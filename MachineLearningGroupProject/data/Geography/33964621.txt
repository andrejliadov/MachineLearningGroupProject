== Origins ==

Nancy Peluso, professor of forest policy, coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest [[map]]ping strategies in [[Kalimantan]]. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the [[international financial institutions]] that supported them, such as the [[World Bank]]. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them.<ref name=Peluso /> The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian [[NGOs]], who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories.<ref name=Peluso /> The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use.<ref name=Rundstrom />  Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired [[GIS]] technologies, satellite technology, and computerised [[resource management]] tools, consequently  making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps.<ref name=Peluso /> As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government.<ref name=Peluso />

It must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term.<ref name="Rundstrom">{{cite book|last=Rundstrom|first=R|title=International Encyclopedia of Human Geography|chapter=Counter-Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=314–318|doi=10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00017-1|isbn=9780080449104}}</ref> Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.<ref name="Wood">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=Rethinking the Power of Maps|year=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|location=London |author2=Fels, J. |author3=Krygier, J}}</ref>

=== Parish Maps Project ===

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parish Map.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|border|alt=Salle parish map.|Salle parish map.]] -->In 1985, the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] launched the [[Parish Maps Project]], a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their [[parish]].<ref>{{cite book|last=King|first=A|title=Holding Your Ground: An Action Guide to Local Conservation|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|author2=Clifford, S}}</ref> Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps.<ref name=Wood /> Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberley|first=D|title=Boundaries of Home: Mapping for Local Empowerment|year=1993|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> Clifford<ref>{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=S|title=From Place to Place: Maps and Parish Maps|year=1996|publisher=Common Ground|location=London|pages=3–7|editor=Clifford, S. |editor2=King, A.|chapter=Places, People, and Parish Maps}}</ref> exemplifies this notion, affirming: "making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement. It is about taking the place in your own hands". The final map product is typically an artistic artefact, usually painted, and often displayed in village halls or schools.<ref name=perkins />  By questioning the biases of cartographic conventions and challenging predominant power effects of mapping,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=L.M|author2=Hazen, H.D|title=Power of Maps: (Counter) Mapping for Conservation|journal=ACME|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–130}}</ref> The Parish Maps Project is an early example of what Peluso<ref name=Peluso /> went on to term 'counter-mapping'

== Development ==

=== Neoliberalism ===
The development of counter-mapping can be situated within the [[neoliberal]] political-economic restructuring of the state.<ref name=Leszcynski /> Prior to the 1960s, equipping a map-making enterprise was chiefly the duty of a single agency, funded by the national government.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodchild|first=M,F|title=Virtual Geographic Environments as Collective Constructions|url=http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/downloads/vge/44.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2008}}</ref> In this sense, maps have conventionally been the products of privileged knowledges.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica|year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53|url=http://dlisv03.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/contents/osakacu/kiyo/13423282-23-123.pdf}}</ref> However, processes of [[neoliberalism]], predominantly since the late 1970s, have reconfigured the state's role in the cartographic project.<ref name=Bryan /> Neoliberalism denotes an emphasis on markets and minimal states, whereby individual choice is perceived to have replaced the mass-production of commodities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Larner|first=W|title=International Encyclopedia of Human Geography|chapter=Neoliberalism|year=2009|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|pages=374–378|doi=10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00792-6|isbn=9780080449104}}</ref> The fact that citizens are now performing cartographic functions that were once exclusively state-controlled can be partially explained through a shift from "roll-back neoliberalism", in which the state dismantled some of its functions, to "roll-out neoliberalism", in which new modes of operating have been constructed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=L|author2=Tickell,A|title=Neoliberalizing Space|journal=Antipode|year=2002|volume=34|issue=3|pages=380–404|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00247}}</ref> In brief, the state can be seen to have "hollowed out" and delegated some of its [[map]]ping power to citizens.<ref name="Jessop">{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=H|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}</ref>

==== Counter-mapping as Neoliberal Governmentality ====
[[Governmentality]] refers to a particular form of state power that is exercised when citizens self-discipline by acquiescing to state knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=M|author2=Knopp, L|title=Places and Polygons? Governmentality, Scale, and the Census in the Gay and Lesbian Atlas|year=2006|journal=Population, Space and Place|volume=12|issue=4|pages=223–242|doi=10.1002/psp.410}}</ref> Historically, [[cartography]] has been a fundamental governmentality strategy,<ref name="Crampton">{{cite book|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=London}}</ref> a technology of power, used for surveillance and control.<ref name="McCarthy">{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|title=Theorizing the State in Environmental Governance|journal=Review of International Political Economy|year=2006|volume=14|issue=1|pages=176–194|doi=10.1080/09692290601081244|s2cid=154372072}}</ref> Competing claimants and boundaries made no appearance on state-led maps.<ref name=McCarthy /> This links to [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s<ref name="Foucault">{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=M|title=Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings:1972-1977|year=1988|publisher=Randon House|location=Canada}}</ref> notion of "subjugated knowledges" - ones that did not rise to the top, or were disqualified.<ref name=Crampton /> However, through neoliberalising processes, the state has retracted from performing some of its cartographic functions.<ref name="Leszcynski">{{cite journal|last=Leszcynski|first=A|title=Situating the Geoweb in Political Economy|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2011|pages=1–18}}</ref> Consequently, rather than being passive recipients of top-down map distribution, people now have the opportunity to claim sovereignty over the mapping process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=M|author2=Perkins, P|title=Reclaiming the Map: British Geography and Ambivalent cartographic Practice|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2008|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1271–1276|doi=10.1068/a4172|s2cid=129859071}}</ref> In this new regime of neoliberal cartographic governmentality the "insurrection of subjugated knowledges" occurs,<ref name=Foucault /> as counter-mapping initiatives incorporate previously marginalised voices.

=== Technological democratisation? ===
In response to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rood|first=J |author2=Ormeling, F. |author3=van Elzakker, C|title=An Agenda for Democratising Cartographic Visualisation|journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=38–41|doi=10.1080/002919501300061427|year=2001 }}</ref> The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on [[Global Positioning System]] receivers, home computers, and the internet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|author2=Weber, P|title=OpenStreetMap: User-Generated Street Maps|journal=Pervasive Computing|year=2008|volume=1536|issue=4|pages=12–18|doi=10.1109/mprv.2008.80|s2cid=16588111|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/13849/1/13849.pdf}}</ref> The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius ''et al''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosius|first=P.J|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London |author2=Tsing, A.L. |author3=Zerner, C.}}</ref> to assert that counter-mapping involves "stealing the master's tools". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=P|title=Geomatics: Who Needs it?|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1–77}}.</ref> Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and felt boards, as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular.<ref name=Rocheleau /> Consequently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al.''<ref name=Wood /> assert that counter-mappers can "make gateau out of technological crumbs".

==== Public Participation Geographical Information Systems ====
In recent years, [[Public Participation Geographical Information Systems]] (PPGIS) have attempted to take the power of the map out of the hands of the cartographic elite, putting it into the hands of the people. For instance, Kyem<ref name="Kyem">{{cite web|last=Kyem|first=K|title=Promoting Local Community Participation in Forest Management Through the Application of a Geographical Information System: A PPGIS Experience from Southern Ghana|url=http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/varenius/ppgis/papers/kyem/kyem.html|accessdate=2011|year=1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991011224042/http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/varenius/ppgis/papers/kyem/kyem.html|archive-date=1999-10-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> designed a PPGIS method termed Exploratory Strategy for Collaboration, Management, Allocation, and Planning (ESCMAP). The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official [[forest management]] practices.<ref name=Kyem /> Kyem<ref name=Kyem /> concluded that, notwithstanding  the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of [[GIS]]. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic.<ref name=Kyem /> Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al''.<ref name=Wood />  disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is "scarcely [[GIS]], intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory".

== Counter-mapping as governance ==
[[Governance]] makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several [[spatial scales]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bridge|first=G|title=A Companion to Environmental Geography|year=2009|author2=Perreault, T|editor=Castree, N.M |editor2=Demeritt, D. |editor3=Liverman, D. |editor4=Rhoads, B|pages=475–497|chapter=Environmental Governance}}</ref> Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of [[cartography]], advocating [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] participatory mapping projects (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to [[Bob Jessop|Jessop]]'s<ref name=Jessop /> notion of "governance without government". Another characteristic of governance is its "purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society" towards a common goal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kooiman|first=J|title=Modern Governance. New Government-Society Interactions|year=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London}}</ref> Likewise, as maps exude power and authority,<ref>{{cite book|last=Colchester|first=M|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London|pages=271–304|editor=Brosius, P.J. |editor2=Tsing, A.L. |editor3=Zerner, C|chapter=Maps, Power, and the Defense of Territory: The Upper Mazarini Land Claim in Guyana}}</ref> they are a trusted medium<ref>{{cite book|last=Markham|first=B|title=West with the Night|url=https://archive.org/details/westwithnight00mark|url-access=registration|year=1983|publisher=North Point Press|location=San Francisco}}</ref> with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, [[cartography]], once the tool of kings and governments,<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=The Power of Maps|url=https://archive.org/details/powerofmaps00wood|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}</ref> is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the [[grassroots]].<ref name="Alcorn">{{cite book|last=Alcorn|first=J.B|title=Borders, Rules and Governance: Mapping to Catalyse Changes in Policy and Management|year=2000|publisher=Gatekeeper Series|location=London}}</ref> The environmental sphere is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.<ref name=Alcorn />

=== Counter-mapping as environmental governance ===
In contrast to expert knowledges, lay knowledges are increasingly valuable to decision-makers, in part due to the scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental issues.<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Taylor Francis|location=London}}</ref> [[Participatory]] counter-mapping projects are an effective means of incorporating lay knowledges<ref>{{cite journal|last=Narayan|first=P|title=Empowerment through Participation: How Effective is this Approach?|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2003|volume=38|issue=25|pages=21–27}}</ref> into issues surrounding [[environmental governance]]. For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.<ref name=Alcorn /> For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.<ref name=Alcorn /> The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn<ref name=Alcorn />  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]]. In short, it can be seen that "maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions".<ref name=Alcorn />

== Types of counter-mapping ==
Numerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and [[PPGIS]]. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.

=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===
Counter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.<ref name="perkins">{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440|year=2007|s2cid=218692622}}</ref> [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=153–187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515|hdl=1811/52137|s2cid=145710578|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766–1775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}</ref> and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.<ref name=Peluso /> The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's<ref>{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34–37}}</ref> assertion:

==== Creation of Nunavut ====
The power of indigenous counter-mapping can be exemplified through the creation of [[Nunavut]]. In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.<ref name=Wood /> As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}</ref> Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.<ref name=Wood /> As Usher<ref>{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365–382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}</ref> noted:

{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were…but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples’ own recollections of their own activities''.
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}

These maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km² in Canada, today known as Nunavut.<ref name=Wood /> Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645–661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309|year=2002|citeseerx=10.1.1.1027.5622|s2cid=9570342}}</ref> 

Indigenous peoples have begun remapping areas of the world that were once occupied by their ancestors as an act of reclamation of land stolen from them by country governments. Indigenous peoples have begun this process all over the world from the Indigenous peoples from the United States, Aboriginal peoples from Australia, and Amazonian people from Brazil. The people of the lands have begun creating their own maps of the land in terms of the borders of the territory and pathways around the territory. When Native peoples first began this process it was done by hand, but presently GPS systems and other technological mapping devices are used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> Indigenous maps are reconceptualizing the "average" map and creatively representing space as well as the culture of those who live in the space. Indigenous people are creating maps that are for their power and social benefit instead of the ones forced on them through different titling, and description. Indigenous peoples are also creating maps to adjust to the contamination and pollution that is present In their land. Specifically in Peru, Indigenous peoples are using mapping to identify problem areas and innovating and creating strategies to combat these risks for the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.utexas.edu/participatory-mapping/files/2012/12/Portal_Participatory-Mapping_2012.pdf|title=Indigenous Rights, Insurgent Cartographies, and the Promise of Participatory Mapping}}</ref> 

===== Perspectives on the Land (United States) =====
White colonists saw land as property and a commodity to be possessed. As a result, as settlers grew in numbers and journeyed west, land was claimed and sold for profit. White colonists would “develop” the land and take ownership of it, believing the land was theirs to own. Indigenous peoples, on the other hand, saw themselves as connected with the land spiritually and that the land, instead owned them. Land to Aboriginal people is a major part of their identity and spirituality. They saw the land as being sacred and needing to be protected. Indigenous peoples believe it is their responsibility to take care of the land. As Marion Kickett states in her research, “Land is very important to Aboriginal people with the common belief of 'we don’t own the land, the land owns us'. Aboriginal people have always had a spiritual connection to their land...<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sharingculture.info/the-importance-of-land.html|title=The Importance of Land|website=Sharing Culture|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>" These differing perspectives on land caused many disputes during the era of Manifest Destiny and as white settler populations began to increase and move into Indigenous peoples’ territory. The Indigenous people believed they were to serve the land while white colonists believed the land should serve them. As a result, when the two sides came in contact, they disputed over how to "claim" land. The height of this conflict began to occur during [[Manifest destiny|Manifest Destiny]]<nowiki/>as the white colonist population began to grow and move westward into more parts of Indigenous lands and communities.

===== The Process of Mapping (United States) =====
Maps represent and reflect how an individual or society names and projects themselves onto nature, literally and symbolically. Mapping, while seemingly objective is political and a method of control on territory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-amazonian-forest-peoples-are-counter-mapping-their-ancestral-lands-84474|title=Why Amazonian forest peoples are 'counter-mapping' their ancestral lands|last=Fraser|first=James A.|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>Mapmaking has thus both socio-cultural (myth-making) and technical (utilitarian and economic) functions and traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aughty.org/pdf/community_mapping.pdf|title=Community Mapping}}</ref> The difference between boundaries and territories made by the White colonists and Indigenous people were vastly different, and expressed their views on the land and nature. Indigenous peoples' territory often ended at rivers, mountains, and hills or were defined by relationships between different tribes, resources, and trade networks. The relationships between tribes would determine the access to the land and its resources. Instead of the borders being hard edges like the United States’, border on Indigenous peoples’ lands were more fluid and would change based on marriages between chiefs and their family members, hunting clans, and heredity. In Indigenous maps the landmarks would be drawn on paper and in some cases described. Detailed knowledge of the thickness of ice, places of shelter and predators were placed in maps to inform the user for what to look for when in the territory. 

Maps made by White colonists in America were first based on populations, created territories based on the edges of civilization. After the creation of the United States government, state land was designated by Congress and intended to be given equally by latitude and longitudinal coordinates. The  ending of railroad tracks and crossings also designated the ending of one state to another, creating a fence-like boundary. In a special case, after the acquisition of the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the United States had to decide between the territory where slavery was legal and where it was not. The [[Missouri Compromise]]<nowiki/>was birthed as a result and a boundary line was created at the longitude and latitude lines of 36’30”. The states were documented by their coordinates and borders were made at the numbered locations. These numbered locations would stretch for miles and encompass all in that territory even if it belonged to Indigenous peoples’. That is often how land would be stolen from Indigenous peoples. The land that would be "claimed" by the United States Government would stretch across Indigenous lands without consideration of their borders. Indigenous peoples' lands were absorbed by the borders of America's newly mapped states and were forced out as a result. Their livelihoods and mythology tied to the land was also destroyed. White colonists claimed the land for their own and Indigenous peoples were no longer allowed to occupy the space. Another way was the differences in the way each group mapped the land. The United States Government would not recognize a Tribes territory without a map and most tribes did not have maps that were in the style of European maps, therefore they were ignored.

=== Community mapping ===
[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: "local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative
local knowledge".<ref name=perkins /> [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise. Paper Presented at the 24th Annual International Cartography Conference|year=2009|location=Santiago, Chile}}</ref>

==== OpenStreetMap ====
[[File:OpenStreetMap homepage 2018 en.png|thumb|"border"text-topalt=OpenStreetMap home page.|OpenStreetMap home page.]]
[[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), a citizen-led spatial data collection website, was founded by [[Steve Coast]] in 2004. Data are collected from diverse public domain sources; of which [[GPS]] tracks are the most important, collected by volunteers with GPS receivers.<ref name=perkins />  {{as of|2011|January|10}} there were 340,522 registered OSM users, who had uploaded 2.121 billion GPS points onto the website.<ref>{{cite book|last=Perkins, C|title=Review OSM: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World by Ramm, F., Topf, J and Chilton, S.|year=2011|publisher=(in press)}}</ref> The process of map creation explicitly relies upon sharing and participation; consequently, every registered OSM user can edit any part of the map. Moreover, 'map parties' - social events which aim to fill gaps in coverage, help foster a community ethos.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|author2=Dodge, M|title=The Potential of User-Generated Cartography: A Case Study of the OpenStreetMap Project and Mapchester Mapping Party|journal=North West Geography|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19–32}}</ref> In short, the [[grassroots]] OSM project can be seen to represent a [[paradigm shift]] in who creates and shares geographic information - from the state, to society.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S |author2=Goodchild, M.F |author3=Sui, D.Z|title=Researching VGI: Spatial Data, Geographic Research and New Social Practice|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=102 |issue=3 |year=2011|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.595657|s2cid=129270695 }}</ref> 
However, rather than countering the state-dominated cartographic project, some commentators have affirmed that OSM merely replicates the 'old' socio-economic order.<ref name="Haklay">{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|title=How Good is Volunteered Geographical Information? A Comparative Study of OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey Datasets|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|year=2008|volume=37|issue=4|pages=682–703|doi=10.1068/b35097|s2cid=301237}}</ref> For instance, Haklay<ref name=Haklay /> affirmed that OSM users in the United Kingdom tend not to map council estates; consequently, middle-class areas are disproportionately mapped. Thus, in opposition to notions that OSM is a radical cartographic counter-culture,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=A.J|title=Cartographic Blandscapes and the New Noise: Finding the Good View in a Topographical Mashup|journal=The Bulletin of the Society of Cartographers|year=2008|volume=42|pages=29–38}}</ref> are contentions that OSM "simply recreates a mirror copy of existing [[topographic mapping]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Dodge|first=M|title=Rethinking Maps: New Frontiers in Cartographic Theory|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London |author2=Perkins, C. |author3=Kitchin, R}}</ref>

=== State counter-mapping ===
What has come to be known as counter-mapping is not limited to the activities of [[Stateless nation|non-state]] actors within a particular nation-state; relatively weak states also engage in counter-mapping in an attempt to challenge other states.<ref name="Nevins">{{cite journal|last=Nevins|first=J|title=Contesting the Boundaries of International Justice: State Countermapping and Offshore Resource Struggles Between East-Timor and Australia|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=470–484}}</ref>

==== Competing cartographic representations: East Timor versus Australia ====
[[East Timor]]'s on-going effort to gain control of gas and oil resources from Australia, which it perceives at its own, is a form of counter-mapping. This dispute involves a cartographic contestation of Australia's mapping of the seabed resources between the two countries.<ref name=Nevins /> As Nevins<ref name=Nevins /> contends: whilst Australia's map is based on the status quo - a legacy of a 1989 agreement between Australia and the Indonesian occupier of East Timor at that time, East Timor's map represents an enlarged notion of what its sea boundaries should be, thereby entailing a redrawing of the map. This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia.<ref name=Rundstrom /> However, Nevins<ref name=Nevins /> notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.<ref name=Nevins />

== Criticisms ==
Counter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested.<ref>{{cite book|last=Turow|first=J|title=Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling, and Medical Power|year=2010|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan}}</ref> A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping:

* Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed. As such, the process of mapping communicates and naturalises who does, and who does not, belong within particular boundaries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kosek|first=J|title=Mapping Politics|journal=Quarterly Publication of the International Association for the Study of Common Property|year=1998|volume=45|pages=4–6}}</ref>
* Due to the power imbalance between [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] claims and those of the state, the language and tools of the dominant society must be used by those under its control. The process of using another's tools can change the ideas represented, resulting in a map of unpredictable quality.<ref name=Rundstrom />
* Counter-mapping is in danger of becoming the 'thing to do'; a "magic bullet applied uncritically".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fox|first=J|title=Mapping Communities: Ethics, Values, Practice|year=2005|publisher=East-West Center|location=Hawaii |author2=Suryanata, K. |author3=Hershock, P.}}</ref>
* There is a geography to the success of counter-mapping. In Tibet, counter-mapping is of limited political utility as [[mapmaking]] is not enfranchised and cannot be scaled up, for instance, to settle legal battles over land tenure and resource rights through the regulatory offices of the state.<ref name=Bauer />
* Counter-mapping projects utilising [[GIS]] require significant knowledge and [[computer literacy]] above that of lay individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Milla|first=K.A |author2=Lorenzo, A. |author3=Brown,C|title=GIS, GPS, and Remote Sensing Technologies in Extension Services: Where to Start, What to Know|journal=Extension Journal|year=2005|volume=43|issue=3}}</ref>
* Investment in specialised computers and software often results in prohibitive mapping costs for a large majority of local people, particularly in poor areas. As some groups prove more capable of adopting the technologies than others, counter-mapping projects can deepen divisions within communities along gender and economic lines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Corbett|first=J.M |author2=Chaplin, L. |author3=Gibson, G.R|title=Indigenous Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=377–382|doi=10.1016/B978-008044910-4.00056-0 |isbn=9780080449104 }}</ref>

To summarise, whilst counter-mapping has the potential to transform map-making from "a science of princes",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Silences and Secrecy: The Hidden Agenda of Cartography in Early Modern Europe|journal=Imago Mundi, Ltd|year=1988|volume=40|pages=57–76|doi=10.1080/03085698808592639}}</ref> the investment required to create a map with the ability to challenge state-produced cartography means that counter-mapping is unlikely to become a "science of the masses".<ref name=Peluso />
