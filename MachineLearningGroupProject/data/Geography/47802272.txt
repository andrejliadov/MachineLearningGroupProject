'''Edgelands''' are the transitional, [[Liminality|liminal]] areas of space to be found on the boundaries of country and townâ€”with the spread of [[urbanisation]], an increasingly important facet of the twenty-first century world.<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Walker|title=Aspects of Lincoln: Discovering Local History|publisher=Wharncliffe Books|date=14 June 2002|isbn=978-1903425046|page=134|quote=THE TERM 'EDGE-LAND' has been coined recently for the concept of a neglected area on the fringe of a city.}}</ref>

==History==
The concept of Edgelands was introduced by [[Marion Shoard]] in 2002, to cover the disorganised but often fertile hinterland between planned town and over-managed country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-beautiful-edgelands-a-dark-light-on-the-edge-of-town-2217071.html|work=[[The Independent]]|title=Our beautiful 'edgelands': A dark light on the edge of town|first1=Paul|last1=Farley|first2=Michael Symmons|last2=Roberts|date=17 February 2011}}</ref> However, a century and a half earlier, [[Victor Hugo]] had already highlighted the existence of what he called "bastard countryside ... ugly but bizarre, made up of two different natures, which surrounds certain great cities";<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Macfarlane|author-link=Robert Macfarlane (writer)|title=Landmarks|date=5 March 2015|page=231|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn=978-0241967874}}</ref> while [[Richard Jeffries]] similarly explored the London edgeland in ''Nature near London'' (1883).
[[Alice Coleman]] (Kings College London, dept geography) in 2nd Land Use Survey of Great Britain, refers to  "rurban fringe". Indicating a similar landscape but with negative overtones.

Nevertheless it was only in the last decades of the twentieth century - as a distinct realm of Nature increasingly disappeared beneath the commodifying impact of globalising [[late capitalism]]<ref>{{cite book|first=Fredric|last=Jameson|author-link=Fredric Jameson|editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Hardt|editor2-first=Kathi|editor2-last=Weeks|title=The Jameson Reader|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|date=5 July 2000|isbn=978-0-631-20270-7|page=251}}</ref> - that the significance of the unstructured borderlands between organised town and organised country, part man-made, part natural,<ref>{{cite book|first=Mike|last=Pratt|title=My Wild Northumbria|publisher=Red Squirrel Press|date=20 January 2015|pages=176 and 208|isbn=978-1910437209}}</ref> both for wildlife and for human exploration, came into fuller focus. [[Psychogeography]] charted the London orbital, while bombsites, canal banks and brownfield sites were documented in poetry and prose, film and photography;<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Macfarlane|title=Landmarks|page=232}}</ref> and the borderlands as an untapped, transgressive resource became almost the object of a new cult.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Eleni|editor1-last=Kalantidou|editor2-first=Tony|editor2-last=Fry|title=Design in the Borderlands|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=16 May 2014|isbn=978-0415725187|page=159}}</ref>
