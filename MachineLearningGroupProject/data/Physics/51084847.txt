A '''dispersive medium''' is a medium in which waves of different frequencies travel at different velocities.<ref name="Samiullah 2015 p. ">{{cite book | last=Samiullah | first=Mohammad | title=A first course in vibrations and waves | publisher=Oxford University Press | publication-place=New York, NY | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-19-872979-2 | page=211}}</ref> With [[electromagnetic radiation]] (e.g. light, radio waves), [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] corresponds to a frequency-dependent variation in the [[index of refraction]] of the medium.
