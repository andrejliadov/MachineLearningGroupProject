The '''Kopp–Etchells effect''' is a sparkling ring or disk that is sometimes produced by [[rotary-wing aircraft]] when operating in desert conditions, particularly near the ground at night. The name was coined by photographer [[Michael Yon]] to honor two soldiers who were killed in combat; Benjamin Kopp, a US Army Ranger, and Joseph Etchells, a British soldier. Both were killed in combat in Sangin, Afghanistan in July of 2009.<ref name=nautil>{{Cite web|url=http://nautil.us/blog/mystery-in-motion-beauty-in-battle|title=Mystery in Motion, Beauty in Battle|last=Hill|first=Kyle|date=2013-07-24|website=Nautilus|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Other names that have been used to describe this phenomenon include scintillation,{{r|4A}} halo effect,{{r|IOM3}} pixie dust,{{r|brownout2}} and corona effect.{{r|Realitypod}}

==Explanation==
[[File:Grinding Sparks - Kolkata 2011-11-26 7427.JPG|thumb|The Kopp–Etchells effect is created by metallic sparks, similar to the sparks generated when grinding metal.]]
[[Helicopter rotor]]s are fitted with abrasion shields along their leading edges to protect the blades. These abrasion strips are often made of [[titanium]], stainless steel, or [[nickel]] alloys, which are very hard, but not as hard as sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand can strike the metal abrasion strip and cause erosion, which produces a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the [[pyrophoric]] oxidation of the ablated metal particles.<ref name="AHS-paper">{{cite web|url=http://www.vtol.org/f65_bestPapers/productSupport.pdf |title=Enhanced Erosion Protection for Rotor Blades: Paper presented at the American Helicopter Society 65th Annual Forum, Grapevine, Texas, May 27 – 29, 2009. |accessdate=2009-09-02 |author=Warren (Andy) Thomas |author2=Shek C.

Abrasion strips made of titanium produce the brightest sparks,<ref name="4A">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=P. |last2=Moore |first2=C. |title=Solutions to helicopter blade erosion - Improving aircraft availability and reducing costs |date=September 2014 |hdl=20.500.11881/3401 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2007-12/titanium-or-plain-ol-steel/|title=Titanium or Plain Ol' Steel?|website=Popular Science|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> and the intensity increases with the size and concentration of sand grains in the air.{{r|boots}}

Sand particles are more likely to hit the rotor when the rotorcraft is near the ground. This occurs because sand is blown into the air by the [[downwash]] and then carried to the top of the rotor disk by a vortex of air. This process is called recirculation and can lead to a complete [[Brownout (aeronautics)|brownout]] in severe situations.<ref name=Realitypod>{{cite web |title=Helicopter Static-Electricity Phenomenon Explained [corona effect] |url=http://realitypod.com/2011/03/29/helicopter-static-electricity-phenomenon-explained-corona-effect/ |website=REALITYPOD |accessdate=14 April 2020 |date=29 March 2011}}</ref> The Kopp–Etchells effect, however, is not necessarily associated with takeoff and landing operations.

==Other theories==
[[File:MV-22 Osprey in Iraq.jpg|thumb|Rotor tip lights produce a visually similar but distinct effect.]]
The effect is often and incorrectly believed to be an electrical phenomenon, either as a result of [[static electricity]] as in [[St. Elmo's Fire]], or due to the interaction of sand with the rotor ([[triboelectric effect]]), or a [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] property of quartz sand.<ref name="SciAm">{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Kyle |title=The Beautiful Science of Helicopter Halos |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/overthinking-it/the-beautiful-science-of-helicopter-halos/ |website=Scientific American Blog Network |accessdate=14 April 2020 |language=en |date=August 1, 2013}}</ref> 

Mechanical action has been considered, whereby impact with the sand particles may cause [[photoluminescence]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mamedov|first1=R. K.|last2=Mamalimov|first2=R. I.|last3=Vettegren'|first3=V. I.|last4=Shcherbakov|first4=I.

Yet another incorrect theory is that the extreme speed of the helicopter blades pushes sand particles out of the way so fast that they burn up like [[Atmospheric entry|meteors in the atmosphere]] due to adiabatic heating.{{r|nautil}}

[[Groundcrew]] have mistaken the phenomenon for fire or other malfunctions.{{r|boots}}

The erosion associated with the Kopp–Etchells effect presents costly maintenance and logistics problems, and is an example of [[Foreign object damage|FOD]].<ref name=boots>{{cite web | url = http://www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200402/itf_amrdec_boots.html | title = These boots are made for flying: Rotor blades get new protective shields| accessdate = 2009-09-04 | author = Jim Bowne, Public Affairs Office, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command | date = February 2004 | work = RDECOM Magazine | publisher = U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (Provisional)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603164546/http://www.rdecom.army.mil/rdemagazine/200402/itf_amrdec_boots.html|archive-date=3 June 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Sand hitting the moving rotor blades represents a security risk because of the highly visible ring it produces, which places military operations at a tactical disadvantage when trying to remain concealed in darkness.{{r|boots}}

The light from the Kopp–Etchells effect can interfere with the pilot's ability to see, especially when using night vision equipment. This may cause difficulty with landing safely, and produce [[spatial disorientation]].<ref name="brownout2">{{cite web |last1=Colby |first1=Steve |title=Military Spin: Help With Brownouts, Part 2 |url=http://www.rotorandwing.com/2005/07/01/military-spin-help-with-brownouts-part-2/ |website=Rotor & Wing International |publisher=Access Intelligence, LLC. |accessdate=14 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508054956/http://www.rotorandwing.com/2005/07/01/military-spin-help-with-brownouts-part-2/ |archivedate=May 8, 2018 |language=en |date=1 July 2005}}</ref> With repeated exposure, the Kopp–Etchells effect could damage night vision gear.{{cn|date=April 2020}}
