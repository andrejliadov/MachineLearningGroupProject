A '''perpendicular paramagnetic bond''' is a type of chemical bond (in contrast to [[Covalent bond|covalent]] or [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] bonds) that does not exist under normal, atmospheric conditions.<ref name=lange /> Such a phenomenon was first hypothesized through simulation to exist in the atmospheres of [[white dwarf]] stars<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|first1=Bob|last1=Yirka|date=July 20, 2012|url=https://phys.org/news/2012-07-chemists-molecular-bond-white-dwarf.html|title=Chemists discover new type of molecular bond near white dwarf stars|website=phys.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref> whose magnetic fields, on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]],<ref name=lange>{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=K.

Normally, at such intense temperatures as those near a white dwarf, more common molecular bonds cannot form and existing ones decompose.<ref name=":0" />
