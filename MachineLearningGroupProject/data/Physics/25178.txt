{{short description|Theories, models and concepts that go back to the quantum hypothesis of Max Planck}}
'''Quantum physics''' is a branch of [[modern physics]] in which energy and matter are described at their most fundamental level, that of [[Quantization (physics)|energy quanta]], [[Elementary particle|elementary particles]], and [[quantum fields]]. Quantum physics encompasses any discipline concerned with systems that exhibit notable [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] effects, where waves have properties of particles, and particles behave like waves.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Subject: Quantum physics|url=https://www.nature.com/subjects/quantum-physics|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Nature Research}}</ref> When particles are bound in quantum-mechanical systems, their energy can only change in discrete steps, energy quanta. Even though our description of systems in quantum physics starts at the scale of [[Atom|atoms]] and [[Subatomic particle|subatomic particles]], the effects can extend to [[Many-body theory|collective behavior]] and [[Emergent phenomena#Nonliving, physical systems|emergent phenomena]] at [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic scales]].

==Applications==
Quantum mechanics has had enormous<ref name= feynmanIII >See, for example, [[the Feynman Lectures on Physics]] for some of the technological applications which use  quantum mechanics, e.g., [[transistor]]s (vol '''III''', pp. 14–11 ff), [[integrated circuit]]s, which are follow-on technology in solid-state physics (vol '''II''', pp. 8–6), and [[laser]]s (vol '''III''', pp. 9–13).</ref> success in explaining many of the features of our universe. Quantum mechanics is often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the [[subatomic particle]]s that make up all forms of matter ([[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, [[photon]]s, and others). Quantum mechanics has strongly influenced [[string theory|string theories]], candidates for a [[Theory of everything]] (see [[reductionism]]).

Quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms are joined by covalent bonds to form [[molecules]]. The application of quantum mechanics to [[chemistry]] is known as quantum chemistry.  Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into [[Ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bonding]] processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others and the magnitudes of the energies involved.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdXU6SD4_UYC |title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics with Applications to Chemistry |date= 1985|accessdate=2012-08-18|isbn=9780486648712|last1=Pauling |first1=Linus |authorlink1= Linus Pauling|last2=Wilson |first2=Edgar Bright |authorlink2= Edgar Bright Wilson}}</ref> Furthermore, most of the calculations performed in modern [[computational chemistry]] rely on quantum mechanics.

In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant.
Important applications of quantum theory include [[quantum chemistry]], [[quantum optics]], [[quantum computing]], [[superconducting magnet]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s, the [[optical amplifier]] and the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] and [[semiconductor]]s such as the [[microprocessor]], [[medical imaging|medical and research imaging]] such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] and [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Matson|first1=John|title=What Is Quantum Mechanics Good for?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everyday-quantum-physics/|magazine=Scientific American|accessdate=18 May 2016}}</ref> Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule [[DNA]].<ref>The Nobel laureates Watson and Crick cited {{cite book |last= Pauling |first= Linus |authorlink= Linus Pauling |year= 1939 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals |publisher= [[Cornell University Press]]}} for chemical bond lengths, angles, and orientations.</ref>

===Electronics===
Many modern electronic devices are designed using quantum mechanics. Examples include the [[laser]], the [[transistor]] (and thus the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]]), the [[electron microscope]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). The study of [[semiconductor]]s led to the invention of the [[diode]] and the [[transistor]], which are indispensable parts of modern [[electronics]] systems, [[computer]] and [[telecommunication]] devices. Another application is for making laser diodes and [[light emitting diodes]], which are a high-efficiency source of light.

(Left: [[band diagram]]; Center: [[transmission coefficient]]; Right: current-voltage characteristics) As shown in the band diagram(left), although there are two barriers, electrons still tunnel through via the confined states between two barriers(center), conducting current.]]

Many electronic devices operate under effect of [[quantum tunneling]]. It even exists in the simple [[light switch]]. The switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces. [[Flash memory]] chips found in [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunneling effect, such as [[resonant tunneling diode|resonant tunneling diodes]]. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by [[Quantum tunneling|resonant tunneling]] through two or more [[potential barrier]]s (see right figure). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to [[Fermi level]], tunnel current increases. As it moves away, current decreases. Quantum  mechanics is necessary to understand and design such electronic devices.

===Cryptography===
{{Main|quantum cryptography}}
Researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop [[quantum cryptography]], which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.

An inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical [[cryptography]] is the detection of passive [[eavesdropping]]. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]], if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an [[eigenstate]]. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit's state would no longer be in a superposition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|author-link=Bruce Schneier|title=Applied Cryptography|date=1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0471117094|page=554|edition=2nd}}</ref>

===Quantum computing===
{{Main|Quantum computer}}
Another goal is the development of [[quantum computer]]s, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical [[computer]]s. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use [[qubits]], which can be in [[quantum superposition|superpositions]] of states. Quantum programmers are able to  manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or [[integer factorization]]. [[IBM]] claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, [[artificial intelligence]] and cloud security.<ref>{{cite web|title=Applications of Quantum Computing|url=https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/learn/quantum-computing-applications/|website=research.ibm.com|accessdate=28 June 2017}}</ref>

Another active research topic is [[quantum teleportation]], which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.

===Macroscale quantum effects===
While quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit [[Mechanics#Classical versus quantum|quantum mechanical effects]] on a large scale. [[Superfluidity]], the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near [[absolute zero]], is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of [[superconductivity]], the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an [[electric current]]) at sufficiently low temperatures. The [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is a [[topological order]]ed state which corresponds to patterns of long-range [[quantum entanglement]].<ref name=chen>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

===Other phenomena===
Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as [[black-body radiation]] and the stability of the [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different [[biological systems]], including [[smell receptors]] and [[protein structure]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Mark |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/13-is-quantum-mechanics-controlling-your-thoughts/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C |title=Is Quantum Mechanics Controlling Your Thoughts? &#124; Subatomic Particles |publisher=Discover Magazine |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref> Recent work on [[photosynthesis]] has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/41632 |title=Quantum mechanics boosts photosynthesis |publisher=physicsworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}</ref> Even so, [[classical physics]] can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large [[quantum number]]s. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.
