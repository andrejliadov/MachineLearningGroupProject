== Fabrication ==

Some considerations for microfluidic devices relating to cell culture include:
* fabrication material (e.g., [[Polydimethylsiloxane|polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)]], [[polystyrene]])
* culture region geometry
* control system for delivering and removing [[Growth medium|media]] when needed using either passive methods (e.g., [[Gravity flow system|gravity-driven flow]], [[Capillary action|capillary pumps]], or [[Laplace pressure]] based ‘passive pumping’) or a [[Volumetric flow rate|flow-rate]] controlled device (i.e., [[perfusion]] system)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho BS, Schuster TG, Zhu X, Chang D, Smith GD, Takayama S | title = Passively driven integrated microfluidic system for separation of motile sperm | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 75 | issue = 7 | pages = 1671–5 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12705601 | doi = 10.1021/ac020579e }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann M, Schmid H, Hunziker P, Delamarche E | title = Capillary pumps for autonomous capillary systems | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–25 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17180214 | doi = 10.1039/b609813d | s2cid = 5583380 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5dbf0aa25530cde291a84f2f1d598b5bf0d2f21b }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker G, Beebe DJ | title = A passive pumping method for microfluidic devices | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 131–4 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 15100822 | doi = 10.1039/b204381e | citeseerx = 10.1.1.118.5648 }}</ref><ref name=":82"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim L, Toh YC, Voldman J, Yu H | title = A practical guide to microfluidic perfusion culture of adherent mammalian cells | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 681–94 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17538709 | doi = 10.1039/b704602b | s2cid = 1453088 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/50fbce1ccd457488e0430f0782818dbd1cd13a19 }}</ref>

Cell's health is defined as the collective equilibrium activities of essential and specialized cellular processes; while a cell stressor is defined as a stimulus that causes excursion from its equilibrium state. Hence, cell health may be perturbed within microsystems based on platform design or operating conditions. Exposure to stressors within microsystems can impact cells through direct and indirect ways. Therefore, it is important to design the microfluidics system for cell culture in a manner that minimizes cell stress situations. For example, by minimizing cell suspension, by avoiding abrupt geometries (which tend to favor bubble formation), designing higher and wider channels (to avoid shear stress), avoid thermosensitive hydrogels...<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Varma S, Voldman J | title = Caring for cells in microsystems: principles and practices of cell-safe device design and operation | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | pages = 3333–3352 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 30324208 | pmc = 6254237 | doi = 10.1039/C8LC00746B }}</ref>

Typically, cell-to-cell signaling can be divided into four categories depending on the distance: [[Endocrine system|endocrine signaling]], [[paracrine signaling]], [[autocrine signaling]], and [[Juxtacrine signalling|juxtacrine signaling]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Geoffrey M.|date=2000|title=Signaling Molecules and Their Receptors|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9924/|journal=The Cell: A Molecular Approach. 2nd Edition|language=en}}</ref> For example, in paracrine signaling, growth factors secreted from one cell diffuse over a short distance to the neighboring target cell,<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Wordinger RJ, Clark AF | chapter =Growth Factors and Neurotrophic Factors as Targets|date=2008|doi =10.1016/b978-012370585-3.50007-8 |title = Ocular Therapeutics|pages=87–116|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-370585-3 }}</ref> whereas in juxtacrine signaling, membrane-bound ligands of one cell directly bind to surface receptors of adjacent cells.<ref>{{cite book |last=Torii|first=Keiko U | name-list-style = vanc | chapter =Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor Kinases in Plants: Structure, Function, and Signal Transduction Pathways|date=2004|doi = 10.1016/s0074-7696(04)34001-5|title =International Review of Cytology|volume=234 |pages=1–46|publisher=Elsevier|pmid=15066372 |isbn=978-0-12-364638-5 }}</ref> There are three conventional approaches to incorporate cell signaling in ''in vitro'' cell culture: conditioned media transfer, mixed (or direct) co-culture, and segregated (or indirect) co-culture.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Regier MC, Alarid ET, Beebe DJ | title = Progress towards understanding heterotypic interactions in multi-culture models of breast cancer | journal = Integrative Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 684–92 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27097801 | pmc = 4993016 | doi = 10.1039/C6IB00001K  }}</ref> The use of conditioned media, where the cultured medium of one cell type (the effector) is introduced to the culture of another cell type (the responder), is a traditional way to include the effects of soluble factors in cell signaling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons RM, Keski-Oja J, Moses HL | title = Proteolytic activation of latent transforming growth factor-beta from fibroblast-conditioned medium | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 106 | issue = 5 | pages = 1659–65 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2967299 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.106.5.1659 | pmc = 2115066 }}</ref> However, this method only allows one-way signaling, does not apply to short-lived factors (which often degrade before transfer to the responder cell culture), and does not allow temporal observations of the secreted factors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bogdanowicz DR, Lu HH | title = Studying cell-cell communication in co-culture | journal = Biotechnology Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–6 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23554248 | pmc = 4230534 | doi = 10.1002/biot.201300054 }}</ref> Recently, co-culture has become the predominant approach to study the effect of cellular communication by culturing two biologically related cell types together.

=== Closed channel multi-culture systems ===
The flexibility of microfluidic devices greatly contributes to the development of multi-culture studies by improved control over spatial patterns. Closed channel systems made by [[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]] are most commonly used because PDMS has traditionally enabled rapid prototyping. For example, mixed co-culture can be achieved in [[droplet-based microfluidics]] easily by a co-encapsulation system to study [[Paracrine signaling|paracrine]] and [[Juxtacrine signalling|juxtacrine signaling]].<ref name=":62">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tumarkin E, Tzadu L, Csaszar E, Seo M, Zhang H, Lee A, Peerani R, Purpura K, Zandstra PW, Kumacheva E | display-authors = 6 | title = High-throughput combinatorial cell co-culture using microfluidics | journal = Integrative Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 653–62 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21526262 | doi = 10.1039/c1ib00002k | url = https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/3/6/653-662/5212760 }}</ref> Two types of cells are co-encapsulated in droplets by combining two streams of cell-laden agarose solutions. After gelation, the agarose microgels will serve as a 3D microenvironment for cell co-culture.<ref name=":62" /> Segregated co-culture is also realized in microfluidic channels to study paracrine signaling. Human [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] and microvascular [[Endothelium|endothelial cells]] can be co-cultured in compartmentalized PDMS channels, separated by a thin, porous, and stretchable PDMS membrane to mimic [[Blood–air barrier|alveolar-capillary barrier]].<ref name=":32" /> Endothelial cells can also be co-cultured with cancer cells in a monolayer while separated by a 3D [[collagen]] scaffold to study endothelial [[cell migration]] and capillary growth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung S, Sudo R, Mack PJ, Wan CR, Vickerman V, Kamm RD | title = Cell migration into scaffolds under co-culture conditions in a microfluidic platform | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 269–75 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19107284 | doi = 10.1039/B807585A | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=B807585A }}</ref> When embedded in gels, salivary gland [[adenoid cystic carcinoma]] (ACC) cells can be co-cultured with carcinoma-associated [[fibroblast]] (CAF) in a 3D [[extracellular matrix]] to study stroma-regulated cancer invasion in the 3D environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu T, Lin B, Qin J | title = Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promoted tumor spheroid invasion on a microfluidic 3D co-culture device | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 10 | issue = 13 | pages = 1671–7 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20414488 | doi = 10.1039/c000022a | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c000022a }}</ref> If juxtacrine signaling is to be investigated solely without paracrine signaling, a single cell coupling co-culture microfluidic array can be designed based on a cellular valving principle.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Frimat JP, Becker M, Chiang YY, Marggraf U, Janasek D, Hengstler JG, Franzke J, West J | display-authors = 6 | title = A microfluidic array with cellular valving for single cell co-culture | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 231–7 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20978708 | doi = 10.1039/C0LC00172D | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C0LC00172D }}</ref>

=== Open channel multi-culture systems ===
Although closed channel microfluidics (discussed in the section [[#Closed channel multi-culture systems|above]]) offers high customizability and biological complexity for multi-culture, the operation often requires handling expertise and specialized equipment, such as [[Pump|pumps]]<nowiki/>and [[Valve|valves]].<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":52" /> In addition, the use of [[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]] is known to cause adverse effects to cell culture, including leaching of oligomers or absorption of small molecules, thus often doubted by biologists.<ref name=":72">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berthier E, Young EW, Beebe D | title = Engineers are from PDMS-land, Biologists are from Polystyrenia | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1224–37 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22318426 | doi = 10.1039/c2lc20982a | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c2lc20982a }}</ref> Therefore, [[Open microfluidics|open microfluidic]] devices made of [[polystyrene]] (PS), a well-established cell culture material, started to emerge.<ref name=":72" /> The advantages of open multi-culture designs are direct pipette accessibility and easy fabrication ([[Milling (machining)|micro-milling]], [[3D printing]], [[Injection moulding|injection molding]], or razor-printing – without the need for a subsequent bonding step or channel clearance techniques).<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":52" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee Y, Choi JW, Yu J, Park D, Ha J, Son K, Lee S, Chung M, Kim HY, Jeon NL | display-authors = 6 | title = Microfluidics within a well: an injection-molded plastic array 3D culture platform | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 18 | issue = 16 | pages = 2433–2440 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29999064 | doi = 10.1039/C8LC00336J | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C8LC00336J }}</ref><ref name=":8">{{cite journal | vauthors = Berry SB, Zhang T, Day JH, Su X, Wilson IZ, Berthier E, Theberge AB | title = Upgrading well plates using open microfluidic patterning | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 17 | issue = 24 | pages = 4253–4264 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29164190 | doi = 10.1039/C7LC00878C | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C7LC00878C }}</ref><ref name=":9">{{cite journal | vauthors = Day JH, Nicholson TM, Su X, van Neel TL, Clinton I, Kothandapani A, Lee J, Greenberg MH, Amory JK, Walsh TJ, Muller CH, Franco OE, Jefcoate CR, Crawford SE, Jorgensen JS, Theberge AB | display-authors = 6 | title = Injection molded open microfluidic well plate inserts for user-friendly coculture and microscopy | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–119 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31712791 | pmc = 6917835 | doi = 10.1039/C9LC00706G }}</ref> They can also be incorporated into traditional cultureware (well plate or [[petri dish]]) while remaining the complexity for multi-culture experiments.<ref name=":15" /><ref name=":52" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /> For example, the ‘monorail device’ which patterns hydrogel walls along a rail via spontaneous capillary flow can be inserted into commercially available 24-well plates.<ref name=":8" /> Flexible patterning geometries are achieved by merely changing 3D printed or milled inserts. The monorail device can also be adapted to study multikingdom soluble factor signaling, which is difficult in traditional shared media co-culture due to the different media and culture requirements for microbial and mammalian cells.<ref name=":8" /> Another open multi-culture device fabricated by razor-printing is capable of integrating numerous culture modalities, including 2D, 3D, Transwell, and spheroid culture.<ref name=":15" /> It also shows improved diffusion to promote soluble factor paracrine signaling.<ref name=":15" />
