'''Аpriorics''' is a formal apriori [[ontology]] not based upon any  experimental or observational data, and does not include any free parameter. Its aim is to investigate into the essence  of the existence of the fundamental entities (FE) from which [[Particle physics|elementary]] and composite particles are combined. It also explores a new meaning of space and time and several philosophical problems associated with them. This theory predicts correctly the number of elementary particles, their grouping into sub groups and the number of interactions (3) among them.

Apriorics was suggested by Yakir Shoshani in the Wittgenstein Symposium held in Austria in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shoshani|first=Yakir|title=A priori Physics|publisher=Holder-Pinchler-Tempsky|year=1989|editor1-last=Weingartner|editor1-first=Paul|location=Austria|pages=79|editor2-last=Gerhard|editor2-first=Schurz}}</ref>

== The Fundamental Entities ==
Apriorics basic concept is the Ontological Structure (OS) – a set of n inter-connected items representing the fundamental entities (FEs) from which the elementary and composite particles are composed. The number n is called the order of the OS. Every FE, A, is characterized by two parameters: a) The significance number (SN) – the number of other FEs to which A is connected, and b) The significance set (SS) - the set of the SNs of all the other FEs in the structure connected to A. These two parameters are later translated to the intrinsic properties of the FEs.

The design of the OS is based upon 5 axioms:<ref name=Foundation/>

#    Every FE is connected to at least one other FE.
#    The connections between 2 FEs is non reflexive, commutative, and not necessarily transitive.
#    If the FE P<sub>1</sub> is connected to the FE P<sub>2</sub> there exists other FE, P<sub>3</sub>, connected both to P<sub>1</sub> and to P<sub>2</sub>. P<sub>3</sub> is called the mediator between P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>.
#    Two FEs can be connected by at most one connection.
#    Every two FEs will be different either in their SNs or, if they have the same SN, they will be different in their SSs.

It turns out that the lowest order, n, of an OS is n=7.

Figures 1 and 2 display two possible OSs of order 7, named O1(7) and O2(7) and tables 1and 2 give the SNs and SSs of the FEs in these OSs (based on <ref name=Foundation/>).

Apriorics predicts then that the two simplest universes include each 7 FEs. The elementary particles are binary compounds (BC) of the FEs. As can be seen from Figure 1,  O<sub>1</sub>(7) includes 12 BCs (there are 12 edges in this structure), and it can be associated with its group of 12 elementary fermions (6 leptons and 6 quarks).  O<sub>2</sub>(7) includes 13 BCs that can be associated with the 13 bosons transferring the interactions between its 12 fermions (8 gluons, z+/-, W, photon, and Higgs). The ascription of properties to the BCs in accordance with the SNs and SSs of their components, and the division of each of these two groups into sub-groups further substantiate these predictions. Other interesting predictions and the explanatory capacity of Apriorics are given in Shoshani's book.<ref name=book/>
