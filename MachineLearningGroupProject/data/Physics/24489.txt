==General concepts of physics ==

===Basic principles of physics===
Physics &ndash; branch of science that studies [[matter]]<ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963-atomic">At the start of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', [[Richard Feynman]] offers the [[Atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]] as the single most prolific scientific concept: "If, in some cataclysm, all [] scientific knowledge were to be destroyed [save] one sentence&nbsp;[...] what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is&nbsp;[...] that ''all things are made up of atoms&nbsp;– little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another''&nbsp;..." {{harv|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|p=I-2}}</ref> and its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] through [[Spacetime|space and time]], along with related concepts such as [[energy]] and [[force]].<!--

           -->  Physics is one of the "[[fundamental science]]s" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology  etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles).
