'''Physical metallurgy''' is one of the two main branches of the scientific approach to [[metallurgy]],  which considers in a systematic way the physical properties of [[metal]]s and [[alloy]]s. It is basically the fundamentals and applications of the theory of phase transformations in metal and alloys, as the title of classic, challenging monograph on the subject with this title  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780080440194 ]. While [[chemical metallurgy]] involves the domain of reduction/oxidation of metals, physical metallurgy deals mainly with mechanical and magnetic/electric/thermal properties of metals â€“ treated by the discipline of [[solid state physics]]. [[Calphad]] methodology, able to produce [[Phase diagram]]s which is the basis for evaluating or estimating physical properties of metals, relies on [[Computational thermodynamics]] i.e. on [[Chemical thermodynamics]] and could be considered a common and useful field for both the two sub-disciplines.
