'''The arts''' refers to the theory, human application and physical expression of [[creativity]] found in human [[culture]]s and [[Society|societies]] through [[Skill|skills]] and [[imagination]] in order to produce [[Physical object|objects]], [[Natural environment|environments]] and [[Experience|experiences]]. Major constituents of the arts include [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[filmmaking]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[Sculpture|sculpting]]), [[literary arts]] (including [[fiction]], [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (including [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[culinary arts]] (including [[Cuisine|cooking]], [[Chocolatier|chocolate making]] and [[winemaking]]).

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. [[cinematography]]), or artwork with the written word (e.g. [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|cave paintings]] to modern-day [[film]]s, art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.

==Definition==
{{Main|Art|Classificatory disputes about art|Liberal arts education}}

There are several possible meanings for the definitions of the terms ''Art'' and ''Arts''.{{efn|The term ''Art'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ars#Latin|ars, artis]]''.}} The first meaning of the word ''art'' is « way of doing ».{{sfn|Valéry|1935|p=683}} The most basic present meaning defines the arts as specific activities that produce sensitivity in humans.<ref name="editions-larousse">{{cite web |url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/art/5509 |title=Définition de l'art |publisher=[[Éditions Larousse]] |trans-title=Definition of art |language=fr |access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref> The arts are also referred to as bringing together all creative and imaginative activities, without including science.{{efn|Historically, science has long been opposed to art, because art was characterised as a discipline that could not be learned (unlike science).}}<ref name="working-definitions">{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/art-definition.htm#definition |title=Art Definition: Meaning, Classification of Visual Arts |website=visual-arts-cork.com |access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="collins">{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-arts |title=The arts definition and meaning |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref> In its most basic abstract definition, [[art]] is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors.

==History==
{{main article|History of art|History of music|History of literature}}
[[File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Venus of Brassempouy]]]]
In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and [[craft]] was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and instead expresses religious ideas through geometry.

In modern [[academia]], the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the [[humanities]]. Some subjects in the humanities are [[history]], [[linguistics]], [[literature]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], and [[logic]].

The arts have also been classified as seven: [[painting]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[performing]] and [[Film|cinema]].
Some view literature, painting, sculpture, and music as the main four arts, of which the others are derivative; [[drama]] is literature with [[acting]], [[dance]] is music expressed through [[Motion (physics)|motion]], and [[song]] is music with literature and [[Human voice|voice]].{{sfn|Rowlands|Landauer|2001}}

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".{{sfn|Harper|2016}} A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]]. Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.{{sfn|LeWitt|1967|pp=79-83}} Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{sfn|Huntsman|2015|p=221}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029235558/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|archive-date=29 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]]. Comics are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship, adding to the traditional "[[Seven Arts]]".{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=23}}

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.{{sfn|Perry|2014|p=85}} Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.{{sfn|Miller|2007|p=23}}

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.{{sfn|Honderich|2006}} Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin) generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.{{sfn|Fraleigh|1987|p=3}} ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|left|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts", music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date=29 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030001050/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>) is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music).

[[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|[[Ernestine Schumann-Heink]] as Waltraute]]
The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in English, emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]]. Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.{{sfn|Desai|DeSimone|Henig|2013}}

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.{{sfn|Chilvers|2004|p=29}} The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.<ref name="dictionary.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Define Applied art at Dictionary.com |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2018-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731085429/http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |archive-date=31 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=42}} Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.{{sfn|Borowiecki|Prieto-Rodriguez|2013|pp=239–258}}

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{sfn|Barber|2012}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.{{sfn|Parker|2012|p=46}} Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.
