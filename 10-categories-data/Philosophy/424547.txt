{{Nihongo|'''''Fullmetal Alchemist'''''|鋼の錬金術師|Hagane no Renkinjutsushi|{{lit}} "The Steel Alchemist"|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Hiromu Arakawa]]. It was serialized in [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Gangan Comics#Monthly Shōnen Gangan|Monthly Shōnen Gangan]]'' [[shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]] magazine between July 2001 and June 2010; the publisher later collected the individual chapters into twenty-seven ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. The [[steampunk]] world of ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' is primarily styled after <!--This is not about the year of the series, this is about the design of the characters and the cities. This is cited in production.--> the European [[Industrial Revolution]]. Set in a fictional universe in which [[alchemy]] is one of the advanced natural techniques revolved around scientific laws of equivalent exchange, the series follows the adventures of two alchemist brothers named [[Edward Elric|Edward]] and [[Alphonse Elric]], who are searching for the [[philosopher's stone]] to restore their bodies after a failed attempt to bring their mother back to life using alchemy.

The manga was published and localized in English by [[Viz Media]] in North America, [[Madman Entertainment]] in Australasia, and [[Chuang Yi]] in Singapore. [[Yen Press]] also has the rights for the digital release of the volumes in North America due to the series being a Square Enix title. It has been adapted into two [[anime]] television series, two animated films—all animated by [[Bones (studio)|Bones]] studio—and [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist light novels|light novels]]. [[Funimation]] dubbed the television series, films and video games. The series has generated [[original video animation]]s, video games, supplementary books, a [[collectible card game]], and a variety of action figures and other merchandise. A [[Fullmetal Alchemist (film)|live action film]] based on the series was also released in 2017.

The manga has sold over 70&nbsp;million volumes worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]]. The English release of the manga's first volume was the top-selling graphic novel during 2005. In two [[TV Asahi]] web polls, the anime was voted the most popular anime of all time in Japan. At the [[American Anime Awards]] in February 2007, it was eligible for eight awards, nominated for six, and won five. Reviewers from several media conglomerations had positive comments on the series, particularly for its character development, action scenes, symbolism and philosophical references.

==Synopsis==
{{See also|List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters}}

===Setting===
''Fullmetal Alchemist'' takes place in the fictional country of {{nihongo4|Amestris|アメストリス|Amesutorisu}}. In this world, [[alchemy]] is one of the most-practiced sciences; Alchemists who work for the government are known as {{nihongo4|State Alchemists|国家錬金術師|Kokka Renkinjutsushi}} and are automatically given the rank of [[Major]] in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called Transmutation Circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the [[Conservation of mass|Law of Equivalent Exchange]]. The only things Alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body and the result is a horrific inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by {{nihongo4|Truth|真理|Shinri}}, a [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person to whom Truth is conversing with; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.

Attemptees of Human Transmutation are also thrown into the {{nihongo4|Gate of Truth|真理の扉|Shinri no Tobira}}, where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the [[Gaea hypothesis]] heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange (to an extent) using a [[Philosopher's Stone]], a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones can be used to create [[Homunculi (Fullmetal Alchemist)|Homunculi]], artificial humans of proud nature. Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.

There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of {{nihongo4|Central City|セントラルシティ|Sentoraru Shiti}}, along with other military cities such as the northern city of {{nihongo4|Briggs|ブリッグズ|Burigguzu}}. Towns featured include {{nihongo4|Resembool|リゼンブール|Rizenbūru}}, the rural hometown of the Elrics; {{nihongo4|Liore|リオール|Riōru}}, a city tricked into following a cult; {{nihongo4|Rush Valley|ラッシュバレー|Rasshu Barē}}, a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and [[Ishbal]], a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is [[Xing (Fullmetal Alchemist)|Xing]]. Heavily reminiscent of [[China]], Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris's government-controlled election of a [[Führer]]. It also has its own system of alchemy, called {{nihongo4|[[Alkahestry]]|錬丹術|Rentanjutsu}}, which is more medical and can be bi-located using [[kunai]]; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.

===Plot===
<!-- As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 to 700 words only; please keep the plot brief and concise. DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->
[[Edward Elric|Edward]] and [[Alphonse Elric]] live in Resembool with their mother [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Trisha Elric|Trisha]] and father [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Van Hohenheim|Van Hohenheim]], the latter having left without a reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Izumi Curtis|Izumi Curtis]], the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. The transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse loses his body. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by [[Roy Mustang]] to become a State Alchemist, to research a way to restore their bodies, and undergoes a painful medical procedure, which grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical [[Philosopher's Stone]] to achieve their goals.

The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan [[serial killer]] known as [[Scar (Fullmetal Alchemist)|Scar]], who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people's genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward's limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, [[Winry Rockbell]], the Elrics meet [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Tim Marcoh|Dr. Marcoh]], who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher's Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang's friend [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Maes Hughes|Maes Hughes]] continues the Elrics' research, but is killed by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]].

The Elrics learn from Izumi that she attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Greed|Greed]], but is rescued by Amestris' leader [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#King Bradley|King Bradley]]. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath, and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi's creator, [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Father|Father]]. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 

After meeting the Xingese prince [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Lin Yao|Lin Yao]], who seeks a Philosopher's Stone to cement his position as heir to his country's throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes's murder. Lieutenant [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Denny Brosh and Maria Ross|Maria Ross]] is framed for Hughes' murder, so Mustang fakes Ross's death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Lust|Lust]]. Lin captures [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Gluttony|Gluttony]], who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony's stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government, but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father's plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as "human sacrifices". Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#May Chang|May Chang]], fired corrupt official [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Yoki|Yoki]], and kidnapped Dr. Marcoh.

The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Olivier Mira Armstrong|Olivier Armstrong]]. They confront the homunculus [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Sloth|Sloth]] and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher's Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the ‘Promised Day’. Forced to work with [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Solf J. Kimblee|Solf Kimblee]], a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee's chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an [[Immortality|immortal]] when Father arranged the fall of Cselkcess four centuries ago, and had been working since then to stop Father.

The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an [[eclipse]] and ‘human sacrifices’ in order to trigger the transmutation. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father's minions, with Kimblee and almost all of the Homunculi dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle, and absorbs the superior being. Hohenheim and Scar activate countermeasures, draining much of Father's absorbed souls, rendering him unstable. The Elrics and their comrades face Father in a final battle, in which Greed is killed by Father.

Alphonse, his armor almost destroyed, sacrifices his soul to restore Edward's right arm. Edward defeats Father, who is dragged into the Gate of Truth, from which he was created. Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to fully restore Alphonse, while Lin receives a Philosopher's Stone. Hohenheim goes to visit Trisha's grave, where he dies peacefully. The Elrics return home, but separate two years later to research alchemy further. Years later, Edward and Winry have married and have two children.

==Production==
After reading about the concept of the Philosopher's Stone, Arakawa became attracted to the idea of her characters using alchemy in the manga. She started reading books about alchemy, which she found complicated because some books contradict others. Arakawa was attracted more by the philosophical aspects than the practical ones.<ref name="new">{{cite journal|title=Equivalent Change|journal=Newtype USA|date=January 2006|publisher=[[A.D. Vision]] }}</ref> For the {{nihongo|Equivalent Exchange|等価交換|Tōka Kōkan}} concept, she was inspired by the work of her parents, who had a farm in [[Hokkaido]] and worked hard to earn the money to eat.<ref name="yahoo">{{cite web|url=http://books.yahoo.co.jp/interview/detail/08249604/01.html|script-title=ja:インタビュー|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20071209123210/http://books.yahoo.co.jp/interview/detail/08249604/01.html|archivedate=December 9, 2007|language=Japanese|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Arakawa wanted to integrate social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs and talking to refugees, war veterans and former [[yakuza]]. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping people to understand the meaning of family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of ''Fullmetal Alchemist'', Arakawa was inspired after reading about the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe; she was amazed by differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga.<ref name="new" />

When the manga began serialization, Arakawa was considering several major plot points, including the ending. She wanted the Elric brothers to recover their bodies{{mdash}}at least partly.<ref name="animeland">{{cite journal|url=http://www.animeland.com/news/voir/4928/Interview-Hiromu-ARAKAWA|title=Interview : Hiromu Arakawa|journal=Animeland|issue=189|date=January 2013|publisher=Asuka Editions|language=French}}</ref> As the plot continued, she thought that some characters were maturing and decided to change some scenes.<ref name="yahoo" /> Arakawa said the manga authors [[Suihō Tagawa]] and Hiroyuki Eto are her main inspirations for her character designs; she describes her artwork as a mix of both of them. She found that the easiest of the series's characters to draw were [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Alex Louis Armstrong|Alex Louis Armstrong]], and the little animals. Arakawa likes dogs so she included several of them in the story.<ref>{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=Fullmetal Alchemist Profiles|year=2006|publisher=Viz Media|pages=100–105|isbn=1-4215-0768-4 }}</ref> Arakawa made comedy central to the manga's story because she thinks it is intended for entertainment, and tried to minimize sad scenes.<ref name="yahoo" />

When around forty manga chapters had been published, Arakawa said that as the series was nearing its end and she would try to increase the pace of the narrative. To avoid making some chapters less entertaining than others, unnecessary details from each of them were removed and a climax was developed. The removal of minor details was also necessary because Arakawa had too few pages in ''[[Monthly Shōnen Gangan]]'' to include all the story content she wanted to add. Some characters' appearances were limited in some chapters.<ref name="guide2">{{cite book|last=Arakawa|first=Hiromu|title=鋼の錬金術師 パーフェクトガイドブック 2|year=2005|publisher=Square Enix|pages=168–172|isbn=978-4-7575-1426-3 }}</ref> At first, Arakawa thought the series would last twenty-one volumes but the length increased to twenty-seven. Serialization finished after nine years, and Arakawa was satisfied with her work because she had told everything she wanted with the manga.<ref name="animeland"/>

During the development of the first anime, Arakawa allowed the anime staff to work independently from her, and requested a different ending from that of the manga. She said that she would not like to repeat the same ending in both media, and wanted to make the manga longer so she could develop the characters. When watching the ending of the anime, she was amazed about how different the [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Homunculi|homunculi]] creatures were from the manga and enjoyed how the staff speculated about the origins of the villains.<ref name="new" /> Because Arakawa helped the [[Bones (studio)|Bones]] staff in the making of the series, she was kept from focusing on the manga's cover illustrations and had little time to make them.<ref name="guide2"/>

====Critical response====
''Fullmetal Alchemist'' has generally been well received by critics. Though the first volumes were thought to be formulaic, critics said that the series grows in complexity as it progresses. [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] called Arakawa one of the best at creating action scenes and praised the series for having great female characters despite being a boys' manga. He also noted how the story gets dark by including real-world issues such as government corruption, war and genocide. Thompson finished by stating that ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' "will be remembered as one of the classic [[shonen manga]] series of the 2000s."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2013-06-06|last=Thompson|first=Jason|website=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Fullmetal Alchemist|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref> Melissa Harper of [[Anime News Network]] praised Arakawa for keeping all of her character designs unique and distinguishable, despite many of them wearing the same basic uniforms.<ref name="comedy">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/fullmetal-alchemist-gn-1-3|last=Harper|first=Melissa|website=[[Anime News Network]]|title=Fullmetal Alchemist G.

===Light novels===
The first ''Fullmetal Alchemist'' novel, ''The Land of the Sand'', was well received by Jarred Pine of Mania Entertainment as a self-contained novelization that remained true to the characterizations of the manga series. He said that while the lack of backstory aims it more towards fans of the franchise than new readers, it was an impressive debut piece for the Viz Fiction line.<ref name="AoD Review 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-novels-vol01_article_82350.html|title=Fullmetal Alchemist (novels) Vol.#01|first=Jarred|publisher=Mania Entertainment|last=Pine|date=September 26, 2005|accessdate=August 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217234945/http://www.mania.com/fullmetal-alchemist-novels-vol01_article_82350.html|archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' also found the novel to be true to its roots, and said that while it added nothing new, it was compelling enough for followers of the series to enjoy a retelling.
