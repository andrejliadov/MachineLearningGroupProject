'''''Food for the Spirit''''' (1971) is a [[performance art]] piece and [[self-portrait]] series by American [[conceptual art]]ist [[Adrian Piper]], which was conducted, performed and documented in the summer of 1971 in her New York loft as she isolated herself<ref name="artbasel">{{cite web|title=Art Basel|url=https://www.artbasel.com/catalog/artwork/55861/Adrian-Piper-Food-for-the-Spirit|website=Art Basel|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref> and entered a [[Dissociation (psychology)|disassociative]] phase influenced by her constant reading of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.<ref name="artbasel"></ref>

==Outline==
Piper had begun ''Food for the Spirit'' out of a temporary isolated lifestyle that she took upon in her New York loft, including doing yoga, reading, writing, and fasting. However, most integral to the piece was [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] work, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', which she became so intensely engaged with that, by her intention, she began to [[Dissociation (psychology)|disassociate]] and question her material existence. Around the end of this period, where she started to lose all sense of being, intentionally strictly influenced by Kant's perspective on ''[[Being]]'' and obsessed with [[Kantianism|Kantian]] thought,<ref name="rizdmuseum">{{cite web|title=RISD Museum|url=https://risdmuseum.org/art-design/collection/food-spirit-2000971|website=RISD Museum|accessdate=February 11, 2019}}</ref> she finalized the piece by ritualistically taking photographs of herself in the mirror, undressed in various ways, as she chanted key phrases from Kant's text that made her feel existentially questioned.<ref name="artbasel"></ref> ''Food for the Spirit'' is an essential piece of artwork in the contribution to the development of conceptual art. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artbasel.com/catalog/artwork/55861/Adrian-Piper-Food-for-the-Spirit|title=Adrian Piper {{!}} Food for the Spirit|last=Basel|first=Art|website=Art Basel|language=en|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref>

<blockquote>"I rigged up a camera and tape recorder next to [a] mirror, so that every time the fear of losing myself overtook me and drove me to the 'reality check' of the mirror, I was able to both record my physical appearance objectively and also record myself on tape repeating the passage in Critique that was currently driving me to self-transcendence."<ref name="rizdmuseum"></ref></blockquote>
