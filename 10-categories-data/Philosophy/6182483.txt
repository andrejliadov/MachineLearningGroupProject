{{short description|Religious studies of scriptures}}
'''Scriptural Reasoning''' ("SR") is one type of interdisciplinary, [[interfaith]] scriptural reading. It is an evolving practice in which [[Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], and sometimes members of other faiths, meet to study their sacred scriptures together, and to explore the ways in which such study can help them understand and respond to particular contemporary issues. Originally developed by theologians and religious philosophers as a means of fostering post-critical and [[narrative theology|postliberal]] corrections to patterns of [[modernity|modern]] reasoning, it has now spread beyond academic circles.

== Method ==

Scriptural Reasoning involves participants from multiple religious traditions<ref>It is most commonly described as involving Jews, Christians and Muslims ({{Harvnb |Ford|2006}}; {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=33}}; {{Harvnb |Campbell|2001}}; {{Harvnb |Gaylord|2006| p=327}}; {{Harvnb |Burrell|2006| p=708}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}; and {{Harvnb |Hauerwas|2008| loc=p.19, n.43}}); for the inclusion of Hindus, see {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}.</ref> meeting, very often in small groups, to read and discuss passages from their sacred texts (e.g., [[Tanakh]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Qur'an]]).<ref>{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| pp=33, 123}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}.</ref> The texts will often relate to a common topic - say, the figure of [[Abraham]], or consideration of legal and moral issues of property-holding.<ref>For the thematic nature of many SR discussions, see {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=123}}; for collections of themed essays emerging from such discussions, see issues of the ''Journal of Scriptural Reasoning''.</ref> Participants discuss the content of the texts, and will often explore the variety of ways in which their religious communities have worked with them and continue to work with them, and the ways in which those texts might shape their understanding of and engagement with a range of contemporary issues.<ref>For SR’s engagement with contemporary issues, see {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=124}}.</ref>

A participant from any one religious tradition might therefore:

* Discuss with the other participants his or her own readings of the texts from his or her own tradition
* Discuss with them ''their'' attempts to make sense of the texts from his or her own tradition, and
* In turn discuss with them the texts from their own traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb |Higton|2008}} provides a transcript and analysis of an SR group's conversation about a particular Qur'anic passage; for more general descriptions of SR, see {{Harvnb |Adams|2006| pp=240–244}}; {{Harvnb |Bailey|2006}} and {{Harvnb |Ford|2006}}.</ref>

Scriptural Reasoning has sometimes been described as a "tent of meeting" - a Biblical ''mishkan'' (Heb. משׁכן Ara. مسكن) - a reference to the story of Genesis 18. Steven Kepnes, a Jewish philosopher, writes:

<blockquote>Participants in SR practice come to it as both representatives of academic institutions and particular "houses" (churches, mosques, synagogues) of worship. SR meets, however, outside of these institutions and houses in special times and in separate spaces that are likened to Biblical "tents of meeting". Practitioners come together in these tents of meeting to read and reason with scriptures. They then return to their academic and religious institutions and to the world with renewed energy and wisdom for these institutions and the world.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=368}}. Note that Kepnes’ handbook is pointed to by various third party sources as an appropriate description of SR. See, for example, {{Harvnb |Anglican Communion Network for Inter Faith Concerns (NIFCON)|2008| p=6}} and {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=252}}.</ref></blockquote>

== Purpose ==

As originally conceived, SR was an academic practice involving theologians, religious philosophers, and text scholars, and was said to be aimed at 'repairing' or 'correcting' patterns of modern philosophical and theological reasoning.<ref>{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008}}; {{Harvnb |Lamberth|2008| pp=460–461}}; {{Harvnb |Campbell|2001}}.</ref> That is, it was seen not only as a form of [[interfaith|interfaith dialogue]], but also as a form of philosophical or theological reasoning.<ref>{{Harvnb |Smith|2008| pp=469–472}}.</ref> It has often been described as a 'postliberal' or 'postcritical' theological or philosophical movement.<ref>For 'postliberal', see {{Harvnb |Pecknold|2006| p=339}}; {{Harvnb |Smith|2008| pp=469–472}} or {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}; for 'postcritical', see {{Harvnb |Soulen|Soulen|2001| p=140}}; {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008}}; {{Harvnb |Lamberth|2008}}.</ref> Its purpose is sometimes described more simply as that of promoting the growth of 'wisdom',<ref>{{Harvnb |Torrance|2009| p=128}}.</ref> or, more simply still, as 'humbling and creative' interfaith encounter<ref>{{Harvnb |Anglican Communion Network for Inter Faith Concerns (NIFCON)|2008| p=6}}.</ref> or 'deeper mutual understanding'.<ref>{{Harvnb | Clooney, 2008: p.28.}}</ref>

== Basic features ==

Most forms of SR exhibit the following basic features:

* SR does not ask participants from different faith traditions to focus upon areas in which they are most nearly in agreement, or to bracket their commitments to the deepest sources of their traditions' distinct identities. SR allows participants to remain faithful to the deepest identity-forming practices and allegiances of their religious communities.<ref>See the section of {{Harvnb |Ford|2006 }} on 'Core Identities in Conversation'.</ref>
* SR provides a context in which the participants can discuss those commitments, and perhaps even become more self-aware about them. SR sessions therefore often highlight and explore differences and disagreements between religious tradition, and give rise to serious argument - in order to promote what has been called 'better quality disagreement'.<ref>"Unlike some other kinds of interfaith dialogue, we aim not to pretend a consensus between our often divergent religious teachings and practices, but rather we seek to understand our disagreements more deeply through scripture study - and build friendships out of that better quality disagreement." {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|n.d.}}. Cf {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=368}} - 'SR is about serious conversation between three religious traditions that preserves difference as it establishes relations.'</ref>
* SR does not assume any consensus between the participants as to how they understand the nature, authority or proper interpretation of the texts in front of them. Participants do not have to assume, for instance, that the Bible fulfills the same role for Christians as does the Qur'an for Muslims or the Tanakh for Jews.<ref>{{Harvnb |Batnitzky|2008| p=484}}: ‘I do not mean to suggest that Ochs' view of scriptural reasoning requires a shared theology as a prerequisite for dialogue.’ David F. Ford gives the following maxim for SR: 'Acknowledge the sacredness of the others' scriptures to them (without having to acknowledge its authority for oneself) - each believes ''in different ways'' (which can be discussed) that their scripture is in some sense from God and that the group is interpreting it before God, in God’s presence.' {{Harvnb |Ford|2006| p=349}}, emphasis added.)</ref>
* SR is said to rely upon the existence of honesty, openness and trust amongst the participants, and more generally upon the growth of friendship among the participants in order to provide an appropriate context for disagreement. It is therefore sometimes said that the key to SR is 'not consensus but friendship'.<ref>The phrase is coined in {{Harvnb |Adams|2006| p=243}}; for other examples of its use see {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|2007}} and {{Harvnb |Abernethy|2007}}. It builds on earlier claims such as that of {{Harvnb |Kepnes|2006| p=367}} that SR 'builds sociality among its practitioners'. Cf the claim in {{Harvnb |Society for Scriptural Reasoning|2006}}: 'After about three sessions of this kind, a successful group should begin to nurture a sense of friendship in study and an emergent sense of direction'. For a third-party description of the importance of friendship in SR, see {{Harvnb |Torrance|2009}}.</ref>
* In order to encourage these relationships, the practice of Scriptural Reasoning is often located geographically with a view to engendering mutual hospitality - for example, by meeting in neutral academic spaces such as universities, or by peripatetically rotating between the houses of worship of different faiths. SR groups try to preserve an ethos of ''mutual'' hospitality with each participant being both host and guest, and to ensure parity of leadership, oversight or ownership.<ref>See {{Harvnb |Scriptural Reasoning Society|2007| p=2}}: 'It may be appropriate for meetings of a Member Scriptural Reasoning Group to take place in rotation between different venues associated with different faiths, or for meetings to be hosted at a neutral venue such as a secular university or community centre.'</ref>

== History ==

The term "Scriptural Reasoning" was coined by [[Peter W. Ochs|Peter Ochs]]<ref>{{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=123}}; {{Harvnb |Hauerwas|2008| p=19 n.43}}. Note that the phrase can also be found in some other contexts – sometimes in apparent dependence upon SR usage, as in {{Harvnb |Campbell|2006| p=60}}; '"scriptural reasoning" for Paul is necessarily a social and communal activity rather than being purely individual and personal.' Note that Campbell had already written on SR before using the term this way: {{Harvnb |Campbell| 2001}}. Other uses, like that of {{Harvnb |Donnelly|2009}}, seem to be unconnected to SR.</ref> to name a group who now form the Society for Scriptural Reasoning (SSR)<ref>{{Harvnb |Ford|2007| p=278}}.</ref> The founders of this international group, formed in 1995, include Ochs himself, [[David F. Ford]] and [[Daniel W. Hardy]]<ref>{{Harvnb |Ochs|2006| p=147 n.3}}; {{Harvnb |Torrance|2009| p=128}}; {{Harvnb |Afzaal|1998| pp=3–5}} describes the importance of Basit Koshul in the extension of this practice to Muslims.</ref> Its origins lie in a related practice, "Textual Reasoning" ("TR"),<ref>See [http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/tr/ The Journal of Textual Reasoning]</ref> which involved Jewish philosophers reading Talmud in conversation with scholars of rabbinics.<ref>{{Harvnb |Ochs|2006| p=147, n.4}}, {{Harvnb |Ford|2006| p=3}}: 'Scriptural reasoning had its immediate origins in "textual reasoning" among a group of academic Jewish text scholars .... on the one hand, and philosophers and theologians, on the other hand....'. Lewis S. Mudge speaks of ‘a traditional Jewish practice being opened, as an act of hospitality, to others.’ {{Harv |Mudge|2008| p=123}}</ref> Peter Ochs was one of the leading participants in Textual Reasoning.<ref>{{Harvnb |Ford|2006| pp=3–4}} describes the involvement of Ochs in Textual Reasoning. The fullest description of Textual Reasoning can be found in {{Harvnb |Ochs|2002}} and {{Harvnb |Levene|2002}} (and in the rest of the book from which those essays come); for some of the ways in which TR relates to SR see {{Harvnb |Hardy|2002}}.</ref>

The core practice of interfaith biblical study resembles already existing practices, such as that of the International Theology Conference at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] in Jerusalem.<ref>{{Harvtxt |Burrell|2006| p=78}} suggests similarities between SR and Hartman Institute activity; see also the Hartman's Institute [http://www.hartman.org.il/Center_Adv/Program_View.asp?Program_Id=9 programme overview]</ref>

The [http://www.scripturalreasoning.org.uk Scriptural Reasoning Society] is an independent network of SR activity in the UK, not affiliated to the international Society for Scriptural Reasoning described above.

In 2007, independent Islamic authorities in London issued a [[fatwa]]<ref>{{Harvnb |Fatahllah|Al-ansari|Al-Salamoni|2007}}</ref> advising Muslims about participation in the practice of Scriptural Reasoning.<ref>'...groups are now welcomed in major UK mosques - a feat achieved through a fatwah (a scholarly opinion on a matter of Islamic law) accomplished by the Society.' (i.e., the Scriptural Reasoning Society.) 'Drawing upon fundamental Islamic teaching, the fatwa lays down guidelines that enable Muslims to feel comfortable in participating in the dialogue' {{Harv |Williams|2009}}</ref>

== Developments ==

Scriptural Reasoning began as an academic practice. Examples of academic SR include the Scriptural Reasoning Group of the [[American Academy of Religion]],<ref>See {{Harvnb |Mudge|2008| p=33}}; {{Harvnb |Clooney|2008| p=28}}.</ref> the Scriptural Reasoning in the University group (which evolved from the Scriptural Reasoning Theory Group <ref>See {{Harvnb |Society for Scriptural Reasoning|2005}}.</ref>), Scriptural Reasoning project at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton,<ref>See {{Harvnb |Gaylord|2006| p=327}}.</ref> the [http://www.scripturesindialogue.org/ Scriptures in Dialogue] project founded by [[Leo Baeck College]], and the SR Oxford group of the Scriptural Reasoning Society ("Oxford School") founded by the [http://www.interfaithalliance.org.uk/ Interfaith Alliance UK].

Scriptural Reasoning has also become a "civic practice" in the community, examples of which include the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/abraham/cvsrg.html Central Virginia Scriptural Reasoning Group] sponsored by [[Eastern Mennonite University]], at [http://www.stethelburgas.org/sr.htm St Ethelburga's Centre for Reconciliation and Peace] at [[St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate]], the SR Camden and SR Westminster groups of the Scriptural Reasoning Society sponsored by Camden Faith Communities Partnership, [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)]] and different places of worship in London.

Civic developments from Scriptural Reasoning carrying different names, include the Faith and Citizenship programme of [[London Metropolitan University]], and [http://www.3ff.org.uk/prog_t4t.htm Tools for Trialogue], a youth project of the [[Three Faiths Forum]], which develops modes of scriptural study for young people in schools and local communities.

== Criticisms ==

Theologian Adrian Thatcher has questioned whether Scriptural Reasoning flattens theological differences in the way the three traditions approach their respective Scriptures, noting especially "the paucity of references to Jesus Christ" in the essays in ''The Promise of Scriptural Reasoning'' (see, e.g., Ford and Pecknold 2006), and asking whether this "may indicate … the further erosion of Christocentric biblical interpretation."<ref>See {{Harvnb |Thatcher|2008| pp=193–4, n.1}}.</ref>

Another theologian, [[James Gustafson|James M. Gustafson]], questions the claim he believes implied by Peter Ochs' descriptions of Scriptural Reasoning that it "has not only the capacity, but also the authority to correct 'modernist reason'" – and asking whether Scriptural Reasoning has been sufficiently open to the critical discourses fostered in modernity. His claims have been responded to directly by S. Mark Heim.<ref>{{Harvnb |Gustafson|2004| pp=37–39}}; {{Harvnb |Heim|2004}}.</ref>

Christina Grenholm and [[Daniel Patte]] ask whether SR "presupposes a view of Christianity as a separate nation with clear borders and set markers" and whether it lacks a "critical perspective that would reveal that there are different kinds of 'scriptural reasonings.'"<ref>{{Harvnb |Grenholm|Patte|2005| pp=16 n.14}}.</ref>
