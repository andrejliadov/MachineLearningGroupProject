The '''world soul''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ψυχὴ κόσμου ''psychè kósmou''; [[Latin]]: ''anima mundi'') is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living things on the planet, which relates to the world in much the same way as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the human body. [[Plato]] adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most [[Neoplatonic]] systems:

<blockquote>Therefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', 30b–c, 33b.</ref></blockquote>

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of [[eastern philosophy]] in the [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Buddha-Nature]] in [[Mahayana Buddhism]],{{fact|date=May 2016}} and in the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin-Yang]], [[Taoism]], and [[Neo-Confucianism#World view|Neo-Confucianism]] as ''[[qi]]''.

Other resemblances can be found in the thoughts of [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] philosophers like [[Paracelsus]], and by [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Schelling]] and in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"/"Mind"). [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] published "The Over-Soul" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a ''universal soul''. There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by [[Gaia Theory|Gaia theorists]] such as [[James Lovelock]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In [[Jewish mysticism]], a parallel concept is that of "[[Chokhmah]] Ila'ah," the all-encompassing "Supernal Wisdom" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps "channeled") by a perfect [[tzaddik]] (holy man).<ref>Likutey Moharan I, 61.</ref> Thus, the tzaddik attains "[[cosmic consciousness]]" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.
