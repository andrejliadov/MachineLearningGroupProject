In [[metaphysics]], '''abstract''' and '''concrete''' are classifications that denote whether the [[object (philosophy)|object]] that a term describes has physical [[referent|referents]]. '''Abstract objects'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> have no physical referents, whereas concrete objects do. They are most commonly used in [[philosophy]] and [[semantics]]. Abstract objects are sometimes called '''''abstracta''''' (sing. '''''abstractum''''') and [[concrete object]]s are sometimes called ''[[wikt:concreta|concreta]]'' (sing. ''concretum''). An  abstract object is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a [[Type (metaphysics)|type]] of thing—i.e., an [[idea]], or [[abstraction]].<ref name="A Glossary of Literary Terms">{{cite book|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SUEtEa9nUWQC&pg=PA60|accessdate=18 September 2012|isbn=978-0495898023|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|year=2011}}</ref> The term ''abstract object'' is said to have been coined by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=D.

The study of abstract objects is called [[abstract object theory]] (AOT). According to AOT, some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) ''exemplify'' properties, while others (abstract objects like numbers, and what others would call "[[non-existent object]]s", like the [[Round square copula|round square]], and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely ''encode'' them (this is also known as the [[dual copula strategy]]).{{sfn|Zalta|1983|p=33}}

The [[type–token distinction]] identifies physical objects that are tokens of a particular type of thing.<ref>Carr, Philip (2012) "The Philosophy of Phonology" in ''Philosophy of Linguistics'' (ed. Kemp, Fernando, Asher), Elsevier, p. 404</ref>  The "type" of which it is a part is in itself an abstract object. The abstract–concrete distinction is often introduced and initially understood in terms of paradigmatic examples of objects of each kind:

Abstract objects have often garnered the interest of philosophers because they raise problems for popular theories. In [[ontology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[physicalism]] and some forms of [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]. Historically, the most important ontological dispute about abstract objects has been the [[problem of universals]]. In [[epistemology]], abstract objects are considered problematic for [[empiricism]]. If abstracta lack causal powers or spatial location, how do we know about them? It is hard to say how they can affect our sensory experiences, and yet we seem to agree on a wide range of claims about them. 

Some, such as [[Ernst Mally]],<ref>[https://mally.stanford.edu/mally.html Ernst Mally – The Metaphysics Research Lab]</ref> [[Edward Zalta]]<ref name=SEP/> and arguably, [[Plato]] in his [[Theory of Forms]],<ref name=SEP/> have held that abstract objects constitute the defining subject matter of [[metaphysics]] or philosophical inquiry more broadly. To the extent that philosophy is independent of empirical research, and to the extent that empirical questions do not inform questions about abstracta, philosophy would seem especially suited to answering these latter questions. 

In [[modern philosophy]], the distinction between abstract and concrete was explored by [[Immanuel Kant]]<ref>''[[Critique of Pure Reason|KrV]]'' A51/B75–6. See also: Edward Willatt, ''Kant, Deleuze and Architectonics'', Continuum, 2010 p. 17: "Kant argues that cognition can only come about as a result of the union of the abstract work of the understanding and the concrete input of sensation."</ref> and [[G. W. F. Hegel]].<ref>Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: ''[[The Science of Logic]]'', Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 609. See also: Richard Dien Winfield, ''Hegel's Science of Logic: A Critical Rethinking in Thirty Lectures'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 265.</ref>

[[Gottlob Frege]] said that abstract objects, such as numbers, were members of a '''third realm'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->,<ref>[[Gottlob Frege]], "Der Gedanke. Eine logische Untersuchung," in: ''Beiträge zur Philosophie des deutschen Idealismus'' 1 (1918/19), pp. 58–77; esp. p. 69.</ref><ref>Cf.

===Abstract objects and causality===
Another popular proposal for drawing the abstract–concrete distinction contends that an object is abstract if it lacks any [[causality|causal]] powers. A causal power has the ability to affect something causally. Thus, the empty set is abstract because it cannot act on other objects. One problem for this view is that it is not clear exactly what it is to have a causal power. For a more detailed exploration of the abstract–concrete distinction, see the relevant ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' article.<ref name=SEP>{{cite SEP |url-id=abstract-objects |title=Abstract Objects |last=Rosen |first=Gideon}}</ref>

===Quasi-abstract entities===
Recently, there has been some philosophical interest in the development of a third category of objects known as the quasi-abstract. Quasi-abstract objects have drawn particular attention in the area of [[social ontology]] and [[documentality]]. Some argue that the over-adherence to the platonist duality of the concrete and the abstract has led to a large category of social objects having been overlooked or rejected as [[Nonexistent object|nonexistent]] because they exhibit characteristics that the traditional duality between concrete and abstract regards as incompatible.<ref>B. Smith (2008), "Searle and De Soto: The New Ontology of the Social World." In ''The Mystery of Capital and the Construction of Social Reality''. Open Court.</ref> Specially, the ability to have temporal location, but not spatial location, and have causal agency (if only by acting through representatives).<ref>E. H. Robinson, [http://www.edwardheath.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Social_Agentivity.pdf "A Theory of Social Agentivity and Its Integration into the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering"], ''[[International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems]]'' '''7'''(4) (2011) pp. 62–86.</ref> These characteristics are exhibited by a number of social objects, including states of the international legal system.<ref>E. H. Robinson (2014), "A Documentary Theory of States and Their Existence as Quasi-Abstract Entities," ''Geopolitics'' '''19''' (3), pp. 1–29.</ref>

==Concrete and abstract thought in psychology==
[[Jean Piaget]] uses the terms "concrete" and "formal" to describe two different types of learning. Concrete thinking involves facts and descriptions about everyday, tangible objects, while abstract ([[Formal Operational#Formal operational stage|formal operational]]) thinking involves a mental process.
