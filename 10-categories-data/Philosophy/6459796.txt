{{short description|History of philosophy in Poland}}
The '''history of philosophy in Poland''' parallels the evolution of [[philosophy]] in [[Europe]] in general.

==Overview==
Polish philosophy drew upon the broader currents of European philosophy, and in turn contributed to their growth.  Among the most momentous Polish contributions were made, in the thirteenth century, by the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosopher and scientist [[Witelo]], and, in the sixteenth century, by the [[Renaissance]] [[polymath]] [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys dziejów filozofii w Polsce'' (A Brief History of Philosophy in Poland), p. 32.</ref>

Subsequently, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] partook in the intellectual ferment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which for the multi-ethnic Commonwealth ended not long after the [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] and political annihilation that would last for the next 123 years, until the collapse of the three partitioning empires in [[World War I]].

The period of [[#Polish Messianism|Messianism]], between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], reflected European [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Idealist]] trends, as well as a Polish yearning for political [[resurrection]]. It was a period of [[maximalist]] [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]].

The collapse of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] prompted an agonizing reappraisal of [[Poland]]'s situation. Poles gave up their earlier practice of "measuring their resources by their aspirations," and buckled down to hard work and study. "[A] Positivist," wrote the novelist [[Bolesław Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]], was "anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'' (History of Philosophy), vol. 3, p. 177.</ref>

The twentieth century brought a new quickening to Polish philosophy. There was growing interest in western philosophical currents. Rigorously trained Polish philosophers made substantial contributions to specialized fields—to [[psychology]], the [[history of philosophy]], the [[theory of knowledge]], and especially [[mathematical logic]].<ref name="Zarys. p. 32">[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 32.</ref> [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and his "[[Polish notation]]."<ref>[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', pp. 23–24, 33.</ref> [[Alfred Tarski]]'s work in [[truth theory]] won him world renown.<ref>[[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], ''A Half Century of Polish Mathematics'', p. 30 and ''passim''.</ref>

After [[World War II]], for over four decades, world-class Polish philosophers and [[history of philosophy|historians of philosophy]] such as [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] continued their work, often in the face of adversities occasioned by the dominance of a politically enforced official philosophy. The [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Roman Ingarden]] did influential work in [[esthetics]] and in a [[Husserl]]-style [[metaphysics]]; his student [[Karol Wojtyła]] acquired a unique influence on the world stage as Pope [[John Paul II]].

The formal history of [[philosophy]] in Poland may be said to have begun in the fifteenth century, following the revival of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Kraków]] by King [[Jagiello|Władysław II Jagiełło]] in 1400.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 5.</ref>

The true beginnings of Polish philosophy, however, reach back to the thirteenth century and [[Vitello]] (c. 1230&nbsp;– c. 1314), a [[Silesia]]n born to a Polish mother and a [[Thuringia]]n settler, a contemporary of [[Thomas Aquinas]] who had spent part of his life in [[Italy]] at centers of the highest intellectual culture. In addition to being a [[philosopher]], he was a [[scientist]] who specialized in [[optics]]. His famous treatise, ''Perspectiva'', while drawing on the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[Book of Optics]]'' by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], was unique in [[Latin]] literature,<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 5.</ref> and in turn helped inspire [[Roger Bacon]]'s best work, Part V of his ''Opus maius'', "On Perspectival Science," as well as his supplementary treatise ''On the Multiplication of Vision''.<ref>[[Will Durant]], ''The Age of Faith'', p. 1011.</ref>  Witelo's ''Perspectiva'' additionally made important contributions to [[psychology]]: it held that [[visual perception|vision]] ''per se'' apprehends only [[color]]s and [[light]] while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of [[association (psychology)|association]] and unconscious [[deductive reasoning|deduction]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 5"/>

Witelo's concept of [[being]] was one rare in the [[Middle Ages]], neither [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] as among conservatives nor [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] as among progressives, but [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]]. It was an [[emanationism|emanationist]] concept that held [[radiation]] to be the prime characteristic of being, and ascribed to radiation the nature of [[light]]. This "metaphysic of light" inclined Witelo to [[optics|optical]] research, or perhaps ''vice versa'' his optical studies led to his [[metaphysic]].<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 5–6.</ref>

According to the Polish historian of philosophy, [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], no Polish philosopher since [[Witelo]] has enjoyed so eminent a European standing as this thinker who belonged, in a sense, to the [[prehistory]] of Polish philosophy.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 6.</ref>

From the beginning of the fifteenth century, Polish philosophy, centered at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], pursued a normal course. It no longer harbored exceptional thinkers such as Witelo, but it did feature representatives of all wings of mature [[Scholasticism]], ''via antiqua'' as well as ''via moderna''.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/>

The first of these to reach Kraków was ''via moderna'', then the more widespread movement in [[Europe]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311">Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, p. 311.</ref>  In [[physics]], [[logic]] and [[ethics]], [[Terminism]] ([[Nominalism]]) prevailed in Kraków, under the influence of the [[France|French]] Scholastic, [[Jean Buridan]] (died c. 1359), who had been [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Paris]] and an exponent of views of [[William of Ockham]].  Buridan had formulated the [[theory]] of "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''"—the [[force]] that causes a body, once set in [[Motion (physics)|motion]], to persist in motion—and stated that impetus is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[speed]] of, and amount of [[matter]] comprising, a body: Buridan thus anticipated [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton]].  His theory of impetus was momentous in that it also explained the motions of [[celestial body|celestial bodies]] without resort to the [[spirit]]s—''"intelligentiae"''—to which the [[Peripatetics]] (followers of [[Aristotle]]) had ascribed those motions.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 1, pp. 303–4.</ref>  At [[Kraków]], physics was now expounded by (St.) [[John Cantius|Jan Kanty]] (1390–1473), who developed this concept of "impetus."<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/>

A general trait of the Kraków Scholastics was a provlivity for [[compromise]]—for reconciling [[Nominalism]] with the older tradition. For example, the Nominalist, Benedict Hesse, while in principle accepting the theory of [[Theory of impetus|impetus]], did not apply it to the heavenly spheres.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/>

In the second half of the fifteenth century, at Kraków, ''via antiqua'' became dominant. [[Nominalism]] retreated, and the old Scholasticism triumphed.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 311"/>

In this period, [[Thomism]] had its chief center at [[Cologne]], whence it influenced Kraków. Cologne, formerly the home ground of [[Albertus Magnus]], had preserved Albert's mode of thinking. Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] traits characteristic of Albert, affirming [[Emanationism|emanation]], a [[hierarchy]] of [[being]], and a [[metaphysic]] of [[light]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 6"/>

The chief Kraków adherents of the Cologne-style Thomism included [[Jan of Głogów]] (c. 1445 – 1507) and [[Jakub of Gostynin]] (c. 1454 – 1506). Another, purer teacher of Thomism was [[Michał Falkener]] of [[Wrocław]] (c. 1450 – 1534).<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 6–7.</ref>

Almost at the same time, [[Scotism]] appeared in Poland, having been brought from [[Paris]] first by [[Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków]] (c. 1450 – 1520). Twaróg had studied at Paris in 1473–77, in the period when, following the [[anathema]]tization of the [[Nominalist]]s (1473), the Scotist school was there enjoying its greatest triumphs. A prominent student of Twaróg's, [[Jan of Stobnica]] (c. 1470 – 1519), was already a moderate Scotist who took account of the theories of the [[William of Ockham|Ockhamists]], [[Thomist]]s and [[Humanism|Humanists]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 7.</ref>

When [[Nominalism]] was revived in [[western Europe]] at the turn of the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (''Faber Stapulensis''), it presently reappeared in [[Kraków]] and began taking the upper hand there once more over [[Thomism]] and [[Scotism]]. It was reintroduced particularly by Lefèvre's pupil, [[Jan Szylling]], a native of Kraków who had studied at Paris in the opening years of the sixteenth century. Another follower of Lefèvre's was [[Grzegorz of Stawiszyn]], a Kraków professor who, beginning in 1510, published the Frenchman's works at Kraków.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 7"/>

Thus Poland had made her appearance as a separate philosophical center only at the turn of the fifteenth century, at a time when the creative period of [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophy had already passed. Throughout the fifteenth century, Poland harbored all the currents of Scholasticism. The advent of [[Humanism]] in Poland would find a Scholasticism more vigorous than in other countries. Indeed, Scholasticism would survive the 16th and 17th centuries and even part of the 18th at [[Jagiellonian University|Kraków]] and [[Wilno University|Wilno Universities]] and at numerous [[Jesuit]], [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] colleges.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.</ref>

To be sure, in the sixteenth century, with the arrival of the [[Renaissance]], [[Scholasticism]] would enter upon a decline; but during the 17th century's [[Counter-reformation]], and even into the early 18th century, Scholasticism would again become Poland's chief philosophy.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 7–8.</ref>

The spirit of [[Humanism]], which had reached Poland by the middle of the fifteenth century, was not very "philosophical." Rather, it lent its stimulus to [[linguistics|linguistic]] studies, [[political]] thought, and [[science|scientific]] research. But these manifested a philosophical attitude different from that of the previous period.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 8.</ref>

[[Empirical]] [[natural science]] had flourished at [[Kraków]] as early as the fifteenth century, side by side with speculative philosophy. The most perfect product of this blossoming was [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1473–1543, {{lang-pl|Mikołaj Kopernik}}). He was not only a scientist but a philosopher. According to [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], he may have been the greatest—in any case, the most renowned—philosopher that Poland ever produced. He drew the inspiration for his cardinal discovery from philosophy; he had become acquainted through [[Marsilio Ficino]] with the philosophies of [[Plato]] and the [[Pythagoreans]]; and through the writings of the philosophers [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]] he had learned about the [[ancient history|ancients]] who had declared themselves in favor of the Earth's movement.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], "Outline of the History of Philosophy in Poland," translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XVIII, no. 3, 1973, p. 77.</ref>

Copernicus may also have been influenced by Kraków philosophy: during his studies there, [[Terminism|Terminist]] [[physics]] had been taught, with special emphasis on "''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]''." His own thinking was guided by philosophical considerations. He arrived at the [[heliocentric]] thesis (as he was to write in a youthful treatise) "''ratione postea equidem sensu''": it was not [[observation]] but the discovery of a [[logic]]al [[contradiction]] in [[Ptolemy]]'s system, that served him as a point of departure that led to the new astronomy.  In his dedication to [[Pope Paul III]], he submitted his work for judgment by "philosophers."<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 9.</ref>

In its turn, Copernicus' theory transformed man's view of the structure of the [[universe]], and of the place held in it by the earth and by man, and thus attained a far-reaching philosophical importance.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/>

Copernicus was involved not only in [[natural science]] and [[natural philosophy]] but also—by his postulation of a [[quantity theory of money]]<ref>Nicolaus Copernicus, memorandum on monetary policy, 1517.</ref> and of "[[Gresham's Law]]" (in the year, 1519, of [[Thomas Gresham]]'s birth<ref>"Copernicus seems to have drawn up some notes [on the displacement of good coin from circulation by debased coin] while he was at [[Olsztyn]] in 1519.  He made them the basis of a report on the matter, written in German, which he presented to the Prussian Diet held in 1522 at [[Grudziądz]]...  He later drew up a revised and enlarged version of his little treatise, this time in Latin, and setting forth a general theory of money, for presentation to the Diet of 1528."  Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', 1951, p. 91.</ref>)—in the philosophy of man.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/>

In the early sixteenth century, [[Plato]], who had become a model for philosophy in [[Italy]], especially in [[Medici|Medicean]] [[Florence]], was represented in Poland in some ways by [[Adam of Łowicz]], author of ''Conversations about Immortality''.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 9"/>

Generally speaking, though, Poland remained [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]. [[Sebastian Petrycy]] of [[Pilzno]] (1554–1626) laid stress, in the [[theory of knowledge]], on [[experiment]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]; and in [[psychology]], on [[feeling]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]; while in [[politics]] he preached [[democracy|democratic]] ideas. Petrycy's central feature was his linking of philosophical theory with the requirements of practical national life. In 1601–18, a period when [[translation]]s into [[modern language]]s were still rarities, he accomplished Polish translations of [[Aristotle]]'s practical works. With Petrycy, [[vernacular]] Polish philosophical [[terminology]] began to develop not much later than did the French and German.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 9–10.</ref>

Yet another [[Renaissance]] current, the new [[Stoicism]], was represented in Poland by [[Jakub Górski]] (c. 1525 – 1585), author of a famous ''Dialectic'' (1563) and of many works in [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]], [[theology]] and [[sociology]].  He tended toward [[eclecticism]], attempting to reconcile the [[Stoics]] with [[Aristotle]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 10.</ref>

A later, purer representative of [[Stoicism]] in Poland was [[Adam Burski]] (c. 1560 – 1611), author of a ''Dialectica Ciceronis'' (1604) boldly proclaiming Stoic [[sensationalism|sensualism]] and [[empiricism]] and—before [[Francis Bacon]]—urging the use of [[inductive reasoning|inductive method]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 10"/>

A star among the [[Pleiades|pleiade]] of progressive [[political]] philosophers during the [[Polish Renaissance]] was [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] (1503–72), who advocated on behalf of [[social equality|equality]] for all before the law, the accountability of [[monarch]] and [[government]] to the nation, and social assistance for the weak and disadvantaged.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 38.</ref>  His chief work was ''De Republica emendanda'' (On Reform of the Republic, 1551–54).

Another notable political thinker was [[Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki]] (1530–1607), best known in Poland and abroad for his book ''De optimo senatore'' (The Accomplished Senator, 1568). It propounded the view—which for long got the book banned in [[England]], as subversive of [[monarchy]]—that a ruler may legitimately govern only with the sufferance of the people.<ref>[[Józef Kasparek|Joseph Kasparek]], ''The Constitutions of Poland and of the United States:  Kinships and Genealogy'', pp. 245–50.</ref>

After the first decades of the 17th century, the [[war]]s, [[invasion]]s and internal [[wikt:dissension|dissension]]s that beset the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], brought a decline in philosophy. If in the ensuing period there was independent philosophical thought, it was among the religious [[dissenter]]s, particularly the Polish [[Polish Brethren|Arians]],<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 11.</ref> also known variously as [[Antitrinitarian]]s, [[Socinian]]s, and [[Polish Brethren]]—forerunners of the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[United States|American]] Socinians, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deist]]s who were to figure prominently in the intellectual and political currents of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>Kasparek, ''The Constitutions...'', pp. 218–24.</ref>

The Polish [[dissenter]]s created an original [[ethical]] theory radically condemning evil and [[violence]]. Centers of intellectual life such as that at [[Leszno]] hosted notable thinkers such as the [[Czech people|Czech]] [[pedagogue]], [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (Comenius), and the Pole, [[Jan Jonston]]. Jonston was tutor and physician to the [[Leszczyński]] family, a devotee of Bacon and experimental knowledge, and author of ''Naturae constantia'', published in [[Amsterdam]] in 1632, whose [[geometrical]] method and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]], almost [[pantheistic]] concept of the world may have influenced [[Benedict Spinoza]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/>

The [[Leszczyński]] family itself would produce an 18th-century [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian]] king, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] (1677–1766; reigned in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] 1704–11 and again 1733–36), "''le philosophe bienfaisant''" ("the beneficent philosopher")—in fact, an independent thinker whose views on [[culture]] were in advance of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s, and who was the first to introduce into Polish intellectual life on a large scale the [[France|French]] influences that were later to become so strong.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 11.</ref>

In 1689, in an exceptional miscarriage of justice, a Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher, [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], author of a manuscript treatise, ''De non existentia Dei'' (On the Non-existence of God), was accused of atheism by a priest who was his debtor, was convicted, and was executed in most brutal fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnlIAAAAMAAJ|title=Historical sketch of the rise, progress, and decline of the Reformation in Poland: and of the influence which the scriptural doctrines have exercised on that country in literary, moral, and political respects|first=Valerian Krasinski|last=(Count)|date=23 May 2018|publisher=Printed for the author and sold by Murray|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>"The execution of the nobleman Lyszczynski, accused of atheism, [a] religious murder ordered by the Diet of 1689, remained an isolated case."

After a decline of a century and a half, in the mid-18th century, Polish philosophy began to revive. The hub of this movement was [[Warsaw]]. While Poland's capital then had no institution of higher learning, neither were those of [[Kraków]], [[Zamość]] or [[Vilnius|Wilno]] any longer agencies of progress. The initial impetus for the revival came from religious thinkers: from members of the [[Piarist]] and other teaching orders. A leading patron of the new ideas was [[Bishop]] [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 11"/>

[[Scholasticism]], which until then had dominated Polish philosophy, was followed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Initially the major influence was [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and, indirectly, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s [[Royal elections in Poland|elected]] king, [[August III the Saxon]], and the relations between Poland and her neighbor, [[Saxony]], heightened the [[Germany|German]] [[Sphere of influence|influence]]. Wolff's doctrine was brought to Warsaw in 1740 by the [[Theatine]], Portalupi; from 1743, its chief Polish champion was [[Wawrzyniec Mitzler de Kolof]] (1711–78), court physician to [[August III]].<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 11–12.</ref>

Under the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s last king, [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (reigned 1764–95), the [[Polish Enlightenment]] was radicalized and came under [[France|French]] influence. The philosophical foundation of the movement ceased to be the [[Rationalist]] doctrine of Wolff and became the [[Sensationalism|Sensualism]] of [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]]. This spirit pervaded Poland's [[Commission of National Education]], which completed the reforms begun by the [[Piarist]] priest, [[Stanisław Konarski]]. The Commission's members were in touch with the French [[Encyclopedists]] and [[Freethought|freethinkers]], with [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Condorcet]], [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. The Commission abolished school instruction in [[theology]], even in philosophy.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 12.</ref>

This [[empiricist]] and [[positivist]] Enlightenment philosophy produced several outstanding Polish thinkers. Although active in the reign of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], they published their chief works only after the loss of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]'s independence in 1795. The most important of these figures were [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]].<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 12–13.</ref>

Another adherent of this empirical Enlightenment philosophy was the minister of education under the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and under the [[Congress Poland]] established by the [[Congress of Vienna]], [[Stanisław Kostka Potocki]] (1755–1821). In some places, as at [[Krzemieniec]] and its [[Lyceum]] in southeastern Poland, this philosophy was to survive well into the nineteenth century. Although a belated philosophy from a western perspective, it was at the same time the philosophy of the future. This was the period between [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] and [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]; and even as this variety of [[positivism]] was temporarily fading in the West, it was carrying on in Poland.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 13.</ref>

At the turn of the nineteenth century, as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fame was spreading over the rest of Europe, in Poland the Enlightenment philosophy was still in full flower. Kantism found here a hostile soil.  Even before Kant had been understood, he was condemned by the most respected writers of the time: by [[Jan Śniadecki]], [[Stanisław Staszic|Staszic]], [[Hugo Kołłątaj|Kołłątaj]], [[Tadeusz Czacki]], later by [[Anioł Dowgird]] (1776–1835). [[Jan Śniadecki]] warned against this "fanatical, dark and apocalyptic mind," and wrote: "To revise [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], to desire ''a priori'' knowledge of things that human nature can grasp only by their consequences, is a lamentable aberration of mind."<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 14.</ref>

Jan Śniadecki's younger brother, however, [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]], was the first respected Polish scholar to declare (1799) for Kant.  And in applying Kantian ideas to the [[natural sciences]], he did something new that would not be undertaken until much later by [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]], [[Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz]] and other famous scientists of the nineteenth century.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, pp. 187–88.</ref>

Another Polish proponent of Kantism was [[Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski]] (1764–1843), who had been a student of Kant's at [[Königsberg]].  But, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of [[Idealism]]. Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the antimetaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 14–15.</ref>

In time, Kant's foremost Polish sympathizer would be [[Feliks Jaroński]] (1777–1827), who lectured at Kraków in 1809–18.  Still, his Kantian sympathies were only partial and this half-heartedness was typical of Polish Kantism generally. In Poland there was no actual Kantian period.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 15.</ref>

For a generation, between the age of the [[French Enlightenment]] and that of the Polish national [[metaphysic]], the Scottish philosophy of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|common sense]] became the dominant outlook in Poland. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] held sway in most European countries—in Britain till mid-century, and nearly as long in France. But in Poland, from the first, the Scottish philosophy fused with Kantism, in this regard anticipating the West.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 15–16.</ref>

The Kantian and Scottish ideas were united in typical fashion by [[Jędrzej Śniadecki]] (1768–1838). The younger brother of [[Jan Śniadecki]], Jędrzej was an illustrious scientist, biologist and physician, and the more creative mind of the two. He had been educated at the universities of [[Kraków]], [[Padua]] and [[Edinburgh]] and was from 1796 a professor at [[Wilno]], where he held a chair of [[chemistry]] and [[pharmacy]]. He was a foe of [[metaphysics]], holding that the fathoming of [[first cause]]s of [[being]] was "impossible to fulfill and unnecessary."  But foe of metaphysics that he was, he was not an [[Empiricist]]—and this was his link with Kant. "Experiment and observation can only gather... the materials from which [[common sense]] alone can build science."<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 189.</ref>

An analogous position, shunning both [[positivism]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical speculation]], affined to the Scots but linked in some features to Kantian [[critique]], was held in the period before the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] by virtually all the university professors in Poland:  in [[Wilno]], by Dowgird; in [[Kraków]], by [[Józef Emanuel Jankowski]] (1790–1847); and in [[Warsaw]], by [[Adam Ignacy Zabellewicz]] (1784–1831) and [[Krystyn Lach Szyrma]] (1791–1866).<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 16–17.</ref>

In the early nineteenth century, following a generation imbued with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas, Poland passed directly to a [[maximalism|maximalist]] philosophical program, to absolute [[metaphysics]], to [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|syntheses]], to [[philosophical system|great system]]s, to [[reform]] of the world through philosophy; and broke with [[Positivism]], the doctrines of the Enlightenment, and the precepts of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 17.</ref>

The Polish metaphysical blossoming occurred between the [[November Uprising|November 1830]] and [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprisings]], and stemmed from the spiritual aspirations of a politically humiliated people.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/>

The Poles' metaphysic, although drawing on [[German idealism]], differed considerably from it; it was Spiritualist rather than Idealist. It was characterized by a [[theistic]] belief in a personal [[God]], in the immortality of [[soul]]s, and in the superiority of spiritual over corporeal forces.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/>

The Polish metaphysic saw the mission of philosophy not only in the search for [[truth]], but in the reformation of life and in the [[salvation]] of mankind. It was permeated with a faith in the metaphysical import of the [[nation]] and convinced that man could fulfill his [[vocation]] only within the communion of spirits that was the nation, that nations determined the evolution of mankind, and more particularly that the Polish nation had been assigned the role of [[Messiah]] to the nations.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 17"/>

These three traits—the founding of a metaphysic on the concept of the soul and on the concept of the [[nation]], and the assignment to the latter of [[reform]]ative-[[soteriological]] tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians. Some, such as [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński|Hoene-Wroński]], saw the Messiah in [[philosophy]] itself; others, such as the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]], saw him in the [[Polish nation]]. Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, "[[Messianism]]". '''Messianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term "[[Idealism]]" does to [[Germany|German]] metaphysics.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 18.</ref>

In the first half of the nineteenth century there appeared in Poland a host of metaphysicians unanimous as to these basic precepts, if strikingly at variance as to details. Their only center was [[Paris]], which hosted [[Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński]] (1778–1853).  Otherwise they lived in isolation: [[Bronisław Trentowski]] (1808–69) in [[Germany]]; [[Józef Gołuchowski]] (1797–1858) in [[Congress Poland]]; [[August Cieszkowski]] (1814–94) and [[Karol Libelt]] (1807–75) in [[Wielkopolska]] (western Poland); [[Józef Kremer]] (1806–75) in [[Kraków]].  Most of them became active only after the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 2, p. 229.</ref>

An important role in the Messianist movement was also played by the Polish [[Romantic poet]]s, [[Adam Mickiewicz]] (1798–1855), [[Juliusz Słowacki]] (1809–49) and [[Zygmunt Krasiński]] (1812–59), as well as by religious activists such as [[Andrzej Towiański]] (1799–1878).<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/>

Between the [[philosopher]]s and the [[poet]]s, the method of reasoning, and often the results, differed. The poets desired to create a specifically ''Polish'' philosophy, the philosophers—an absolute ''universal'' philosophy.  The Messianist philosophers knew contemporary European philosophy and drew from it; the poets created more of a home-grown metaphysic.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys'', p. 18.</ref>

The most important difference among the Messianists was that some were [[rationalist]]s, others [[mysticism|mystics]].  Wroński's philosophy was no less rationalist than [[Hegel]]'s, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 18"/>

The Messianists were not the only Polish philosophers active in the period between the 1830 and 1863 uprisings. Much more widely known in Poland were [[Catholic]] thinkers such as Father [[Piotr Semenenko]] (1814–86), [[Florian Bochwic]] (1779–1856) and [[Eleonora Ziemięcka]] (1819–69), Poland's first woman philosopher. The Catholic philosophy of the period was more widespread and fervent than profound or creative.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 173.</ref> Also active were pure [[Hegelian]]s such as [[Tytus Szczeniowski]] (1808–80) and leftist Hegelians such as [[Edward Dembowski]] (1822–46).<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', p. 24.</ref>

An outstanding representative of the philosophy of Common Sense, [[Michał Wiszniewski]] (1794–1865), had studied at that Enlightenment bastion, [[Krzemieniec]]; in 1820, in France, he had attended the lectures of [[Victor Cousin]]; and in 1821, in Britain, he had met the head of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]] at the time, [[Dugald Stewart]].<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 174.</ref>

Active as well were [[wikt:Precursor|precursors]] of [[Positivism]] such as [[Józef Supiński]] (1804–93) and [[Dominik Szulc]] (1797–1860)—links between the earlier Enlightenment age of the brothers Śniadecki and the coming age of [[Positivism]].<ref>

{{main|Positivism in Poland}}
{{mergeto|Positivism in Poland|date=September 2020}}
The [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy that took form in Poland after the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] was hardly identical with the philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]]. It was in fact a return to the line of [[Jan Śniadecki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]]—a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period—now enriched with the ideas of Comte.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176">Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 176.</ref>  However, it belonged only partly to [[philosophy]]. It combined Comte's ideas with those of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], for it was interested in what was common to them all:  a sober, [[empirical]] attitude to life.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 25.</ref>

The Polish Positivism was a reaction against philosophical speculation, but also against [[romanticism]] in poetry and [[idealism]] in politics. It was less a scholarly movement than [[literature|literary]], [[politics|political]] and [[society|social]]. Few original books were published, but many were translated from the philosophical literature of the West—not Comte himself, but easier writers: [[Hippolyte Taine]], Mill, Spencer, [[Alexander Bain]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the Germans [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Friedrich Albert Lange]], the Danish philosopher [[Höffding]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 176"/>

The disastrous outcome of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had produced a distrust of romanticism, an aversion to ideals and illusions, and turned the search for redemption toward sober thought and work directed at realistic goals. The watchword became "organic work"—a term for the campaign for economic improvement, which was regarded as a prime requisite for progress. Poles prepared for such work by studying the [[natural sciences]] and [[economics]]: they absorbed [[Charles Darwin]]'s biological theories, Mill's [[economic]] theories, [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s [[determinism|deterministic]] theory of [[civilization]]. At length they became aware of the connection between their own convictions and aims and the [[Positivism|Positivist]] philosophy of [[Auguste Comte]], and borrowed its name and watchwords.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177">Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.</ref>
[[File:PiotrChmielowski.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Piotr Chmielowski]]]]
[[File:Massonius Peter Marian2.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Marian Massonius]]]]

This movement, which had begun still earlier in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], became concentrated with time in the [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Congress Poland]] centered about [[Warsaw]] and is therefore commonly known as the "Warsaw Positivism."<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 25–26.</ref> Its chief venue was the Warsaw ''Przegląd Tygodniowy'' (Weekly Review);<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/> [[Warsaw University]] (the "Main School") had been closed by the [[Russia]]ns in 1869.

The pioneers of the Warsaw Positivism were [[natural scientist]]s and [[physician]]s rather than philosophers, and still more so [[journalist]]s and [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]]: [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] (1849–1938), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904), [[Adolf Dygasiński]] (1839–1902),<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 177.</ref> [[Bolesław Prus]] (1847–1912).  Prus developed an original [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian]]-inspired [[ethics|ethical]] system in his book, ''[[s:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'';<ref>Edward Pieścikowski, ''Bolesław Prus'', pp. 138–39.</ref> his 1873 public lecture ''[[:wikisource:Page:Aleksander Głowacki - O odkryciach i wynalazkach.djvu/7|On Discoveries and Inventions]]'', subsequently printed as a pamphlet, is a remarkably prescient contribution to what would, in the following century, become the field of [[logology (science of science)#Discoveries and inventions|logology ("the science of science")]].
[[File:Adam_Mahrburg_frotispice.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Adam Mahrburg]]]]
The movement's leader was [[Bolesław Prus|Prus]]' friend, [[Julian Ochorowicz]] (1850–1917), a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the [[University of Leipzig]]. In 1872 he wrote: "We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible."<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 177"/>

The Warsaw Positivists—who included faithful [[Catholic]]s such as Father [[Franciszek Krupiński]] (1836–98)—formed a common front against Messianism together with the [[Neo-Kantian]]s. The Polish [[Kantian]]s were rather loosely associated with Kant and belonged to the Positivist movement. They included [[Władysław Mieczysław Kozłowski]] (1858–1935), [[Piotr Chmielowski]] (1848–1904) and [[Marian Massonius]] (1862–1945).<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.</ref>

[[File:Stefan Pawlicki.png|thumb|75px|[[Stefan Pawlicki]]]]
The most brilliant philosophical mind in this period was [[Adam Mahrburg]] (1855–1913).  He was a [[Positivist]] in his understanding of philosophy as a discipline and in his uncompromising ferreting out of speculation, and a [[Kantian]] in his interpretation of mind and in his centering of philosophy upon the [[theory of knowledge]].<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 177–78.</ref>

In [[Kraków]], Father [[Stefan Pawlicki]] (1839–1916), professor of philosophy at the [[University of Kraków]], was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacked talent for writing or teaching. Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, alien to what was happening in the West and in Warsaw.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 175.</ref>

==20th century==
[[File:Wincenty Lutosławski (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wincenty Lutosławski]]]]
Even before Poland regained independence at the end of [[World War I]], her intellectual life continued to develop.  This was the case particularly in [[Russia]]n-ruled [[Warsaw]], where in lieu of underground lectures and secret scholarly organizations a ''[[Wolna Wszechnica Polska]]'' (Free Polish University) was created in 1905 and the tireless [[Władysław Weryho]] (1868–1916) had in 1898 founded Poland's first philosophical journal, ''Przegląd Filozoficzny'' (The Philosophical Review), and in 1904 a Philosophical Society.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356">Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 356.</ref>

In 1907 Weryho founded a Psychological Society, and subsequently Psychological and Philosophical Institutes. About 1910 the small number of professionally trained philosophers increased sharply, as individuals returned who had been inspired by Mahrburg's underground lectures to study philosophy in [[Austria]]n-ruled [[Lwów]] and [[Kraków]] or abroad.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 356"/>

[[File:Edward Abramowski (1868-1918).jpg|thumb|110px|[[Edward Abramowski]]]]

[[Kraków]] as well, especially after 1910, saw a quickening of the philosophical movement, particularly at the [[Polish Academy of Learning]], where at the prompting of [[Władysław Heinrich]] there came into being in 1911 a Committee for the History of Polish Philosophy and there was an immense growth in the number of philosophical papers and publications, no longer only of a [[historical]] character.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 27.</ref>

At [[Lwów]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) from 1895 stimulated a lively philosophical movement, in 1904 founded the [[Polish Philosophical Society]],<ref>"Twardowski, Kazimierz," ''Encyklopedia powszechna PWN'', vol. 4, p. 512.</ref> and in 1911 began publication of ''[[Ruch Filozoficzny]]'' (The Philosophical Movement).<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/>

There was growing interest in western philosophical currents, and much discussion of [[Pragmatism]] and [[Henri Bergson|Bergsonism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[Henri Poincaré]]'s [[Conventionalism]], [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the [[Marburg School]], and the [[social science|social-science]] [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Heinrich Rickert]].  At the same time, original ideas developed on Polish soil.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 27"/>

Those who distinguished themselves in Polish philosophy in these pre-[[World War I]] years of the twentieth century, formed two groups.

One group developed apart from [[higher education|institutions of higher learning]] and [[learned societies]], and appealed less to trained philosophers than to broader circles, which it (if but briefly) captured. It constituted a reaction against the preceding period of [[Positivism]], and included [[Stanisław Brzozowski (writer)|Stanisław Brzozowski]] (1878–1911), [[Wincenty Lutosławski]] (1863–1954) and, to a degree, [[Edward Abramowski]] (1868–1918).<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 27–28.</ref>
[[File:Władysław Witwicki.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Władysław Witwicki]]]]

The second group of philosophers who started off Polish philosophy in the twentieth century had an [[academic]] character. They included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957) in [[Kraków]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938) in [[Lwów]], and [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931) abroad—all three, active members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]].  Despite the considerable differences among them, they shared some basic features: all three were [[empiricist]]s concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.<ref>[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz|Tatarkiewicz]], ''Zarys...'', pp. 29–30.</ref>

Following the restoration of Poland's independence in 1918, the two older universities ([[Jagiellonian University|Kraków University]], [[Lwów University]]) were joined by four new ones ([[Warsaw University]], [[Poznań University]], [[Wilno University]], [[Lublin University]]). New philosophical journals appeared; all the university cities formed philosophical associations; conventions of Polish philosophers were held; philosophy became more professional, academic, scholarly.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 363–64.</ref>

[[File:Tadeusz Kotarbiński.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]]]]

A characteristic of the [[interbellum]] was that [[maximalist]], metaphysical currents began to fade away.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 30.</ref> The dominant ambition in philosophical theory now was not breadth but [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]. This was a period of [[Academic specialization|specialization]], consistent with the conviction that general philosophy would not yield precise results such as could be obtained in [[logic]], [[psychology]] or the [[history of philosophy]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366">Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 366.</ref>

[[File:Konstanty Michalski.png|thumb|left|100px|[[Konstanty Michalski]]]]
A few individuals did develop a general philosophical outlook:  notably, [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz]] (1885–1939), and [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970).<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 30–31.</ref>

Otherwise, however, [[Academic specialization|specialization]] was the rule. The Kraków school, true to tradition, showed an eminently historical character and produced a [[medievalist]] of world renown, Father [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947).<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31">Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 31.</ref> The Lwów school concentrated on the analysis of [[concept]]s; and in doing so, it considered both their aspects, the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]—hence, the [[psychological]] and the [[logical]]. Twardowski himself continued working at the border of psychology and logic; his pupils, however, generally split in their interests, specializing in either psychology or logic.<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 366"/>

The [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] program that Twardowski passed on to his pupils, and which they in turn spread throughout Poland, was affined to that of [[Franz Brentano]]'s school (Twardowski's ''[[alma mater]]'') in [[Austria]] and to that of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[analytic philosophy|analytic school]], which likewise had arisen as a reaction against speculative systems.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 368.</ref>

The [[alumni]] of the Lwów school entered three distinct fields. Some devoted themselves to [[psychology]]: [[Stefan Błachowski]] (1889–1962), professor at [[Poznań]], entirely; [[Władysław Witwicki]] (1878–1948), professor at [[Warsaw]], partly. Others pursued the [[theory of knowledge]]: they included [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] (1890–1963), professor at [[Lwów]], and after [[World War II]] at [[Poznań]], whose views resembled [[Neopositivism]] and who developed an original theory of radical [[Conventionalism]]. The third group worked in [[mathematical logic|mathematical, or symbolic, logic]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/>

The most important center for mathematical logic was Warsaw. The Warsaw school of logic was headed by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956) and [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] (1886–1939), professors at [[Warsaw University]]. The first of their pupils to achieve eminence, even before [[World War II]], was [[Alfred Tarski]] (1902–83),<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/> from 1939 in the [[United States]], where he became a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Another pupil of Łukasiewicz, Bolesław Sobociński (28 June 1906 – 31 October 1980), became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. The Warsaw logic gained a worldwide importance similar to that of the Kraków [[medievalism]].<ref name="Tatarkiewicz, Zarys..., p. 31"/>

Warsaw was not, however, the sole Polish venue for logic studies. They were initiated at [[Kraków]] by [[Jan Śleszyński]] (''aka'' Ivan Śleszyński, ''aka'' Ivan Vladislavovich Sleshinsky, 1854–1931), professor of mathematics and logic. At Kraków also, and later at [[Lwów]], logic studies were conducted by [[Leon Chwistek]] (1884–1944), a multi-faceted and somewhat eccentric thinker—mathematician, philosopher, [[esthetics|esthetician]], painter—whose name came to be associated popularly with his concept of "plural realities."<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 367.</ref>
[[File:Leszek Kolakowski 1971.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Leszek Kołakowski]]]]

After [[Leon Petrażycki|Petrażycki]]'s death, the outstanding [[legal]] philosopher was [[Czesław Znamierowski]] (1888–1967), professor of philosophy at Poznań.<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, pp. 367–68.</ref>  Another leading thinker of the period, active on the borderlines of [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]], in both Poland and the [[United States]], was [[Florian Znaniecki]] (1882–1958).<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Historia filozofii'', vol. 3, p. 361.</ref>

In the [[interbellum]], the philosopher members of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] included [[Władysław Heinrich]] (1869–1957; Kraków), [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866–1938; Lwów), [[Leon Petrażycki]] (1867–1931; Warsaw), and, from the following generation: [[Konstanty Michalski]] (1879–1947), [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] (1878–1956), and [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980). Michalski's historical works revolutionized prevailing views on ''via moderna'' in late [[medieval philosophy]]. Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of [[many-valued logic]] and is known for his "[[Polish notation]]." Tatarkiewicz was the first to prepare in [[Polish language|Polish]] a large-scale comprehensive history of [[western philosophy]] and a ''History of Aesthetics'' and worked at systematizing the [[concept]]s of [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]].<ref>Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', pp. 31–32.</ref>

After [[World War II]], [[Roman Ingarden]] (1893–1970), [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]] (1886–1981), and [[Alfred Tarski]] became members of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="Zarys. p. 32"/>
[[File:Jan-wolenski-2009.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Jan Woleński]]]]

For some four decades following World War II, in Poland, a disproportionately prominent official role was given to [[Marxist philosophy]]. This, and contemporaneous sociopolitical currents, stimulated [[Leszek Kołakowski]] (1927–2009), writing in [[exile]], to publish influential critiques of [[Marxist]] theory and [[communist]] practice.  Kołakowski also wrote a remarkable history of ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle''.<ref>[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle'', Penguin Books, 1972, ASIN B000OIXO7E.</ref>

Similarly notable for his critiques of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism]] was [[Józef Maria Bocheński]] (1902–95), [[Order of Preachers|O.P.]], a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] philosopher of the [[Dominican Order]] who lectured in [[Rome]] at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]] (the ''Angelicum'') and at the [[University of Fribourg]] in [[Switzerland]]. Bocheński also gained renown for his work in [[logic]] and [[ethics]].

Other Polish philosophers of the postwar period included [[:pl:Andrzej Zabłudowski|Andrzej Zabłudowski]] (1938–2008), a logician and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] of world influence, especially in the theory of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], working at Warsaw University except for a three-decade hiatus beginning in 1968; [[Marek Siemek]] (1942–2011), a historian of [[Germany|German]] [[Transcendental Philosophy|transcendental philosophy]] and recipient of an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Bonn University]]; and [[Jan Woleński]] (born 1940), a broadly erudite thinker at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]], specializing in the history of the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lwów-Warsaw school]] and in [[analytic philosophy]] and widely recognized in Poland as an [[atheism|atheist]] and exponent of replacing religion classes in Polish schools with philosophy classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDgWy_9GqwU|title=Laureat Nagrody FNP w obszarze nauk humanistycznych i społecznych, prof.
