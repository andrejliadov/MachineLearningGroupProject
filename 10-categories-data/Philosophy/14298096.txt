{{short description|Indian philosophy}}
'''Jain philosophy''' is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>  Jain philosophy deals with [[reality]], [[cosmology]], [[epistemology]] (study of knowledge) and Vitalism. It attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of soul's bondage with body and the means to achieve liberation.

Jain texts expound that in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four [[tirthankara]]s grace this part of the Universe to teach the unchanging doctrine of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct.{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=59}} Jain philosophy means the teachings of a ''Tirthankara'' which are recorded in [[Jain Agamas|Sacred Jain texts]]. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Belief on independent existence of soul and matter.
* Refutation of the idea that a supreme divine creator, owner, preserver or destroyer of the universe exists.
* Potency of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], eternal universe.
* Accent on relativity and [[Anekantavada|multiple facets of truth]] and
* Morality and ethics based on liberation of soul.

Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Ahiṃsā ==
{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}{{further|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
According to the Jain texts, the vitalities or life-principles are ten, namely the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind. The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=62–63,196}}

Jain|2012|p=34–35}} According to [[Tattvarthasutra]], a major Jain text, "the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=99}} According to the [[Purushartha Siddhyupaya]], "non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury {{IAST|(ahiṃsā)}}, and manifestation of such passions is injury (hiṃsā)." This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures.{{sfn|Vijay K.

== Fundamentals ==
{{Main|Tattva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|The seven [[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]] of Digambara Jain philosophy]]
Digambara Jain philosophy postulates that seven ''"tattva"'' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality,{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177–187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96–98}}-
#''Jīva''-The [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] or the sentient substance which is said to have a separate existence from the body that houses it. ''Jīva'' is characterised by cetana (consciousness) and upayoga (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state of soul and appearance of another state, these being merely the modes of the soul substance.
#''[[Ajiva|ajīva]]''- the non-soul or the insentient
#''[[Asrava|āsrava]]'' (influx)- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas'', thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=188–190}}{{sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=219–228}}
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

Svetambara Jain philosophy add two more to the above list, which are as follows:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177–187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96–98}}
# Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
# Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras

== The Path to Liberation ==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of ''moksha''. According to the [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1–1){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}}}
* Right Faith (''Samyak Darśana'') means belief in substances like soul and non-soul without delusion and misapprehension.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=18}}
* Right Knowledge (''Samyak Jnāna'')- When the nature of reality (substances) is ascertained with the help of the doctrine of manifold points of view (''anekāntavāda''), the knowledge thus obtained (free from doubts, misapprehension, and delusion) is said to be the Right Knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=29}}
* Right Conduct (''Samyak chāritra'')-The very nature of the soul; devoid of all passions, untainted, unattached to any alien substance is Right conduct. It is achieved by abjuring all sinful activities of the body, the speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=31}}

Those who pass the last stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

== Substances ==
{{Main|Dravya (Jainism)}}
According to Jainas, the world is composed of two different kinds of substances, the ''Jīva'' (conscious) and the ''ajīva'' (unconscious). These are the uncreated existing constituents of the Universe which impart the necessary dynamics to the Universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''Vatthu sahāvō dhammō'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]."{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=225}}

=== Unconscious substance ===
{{Main|Ajiva}}
The five unconscious (''ajīva'') substances are:{{sfn|Sanghvi|2008|p=26}}

* [[Pudgala]] – It is non living (no soul) [[Matter]], which is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter.  It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the Paramānu and Pudgala is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.

*'''''Dharma''''' – (Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]) and '''''Adharma''''' (Medium of Rest) – Also known as Dharmāstikāya and Adharmāstikāya, they are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmāstikāya motion is not possible and without adharmāstikāya rest is not possible in the universe.

* Ākāśa: Space – [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. According to Jains, Space is a substance, in the nature of a vacuum but not a pure vacuum. It is an extended continuous vacuum. As pure vacuum it will be non-existent, and non-extended; which will devoid it of even one positive quality. Therefore, Jains propound that Space, which is endowed with infinite extension is a substance in itself.

* Kāla (Time)- In Jainism, time is explained in two different aspects. Firstly as the measure of duration, known in the form of hours, days, and the like. Secondly, as the cause of the continuity of function of things. According to [[Champat Rai Jain]], "Nothing in nature can exist destitute or devoid of function. Function is discharged by the displacement of energy in the case of simple units and things. If there were no Time-substance to help in the performance of the movement of the displacement of energy, things would be doomed to remain in the same condition always." In its first aspect, time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of sagaropama (ocean years).<ref>{{harvnb|James|1969|p=45}}</ref>[[File:Jain scale of time.JPG|thumb|Scale of time in [[Jain]] texts shown [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmically]]. Check for the second first.]]

=== Conscious substance ===
According to the Jain philosophy, there are infinite independent souls. These are categorised into two—liberated and non-liberated. Infinite knowledge, perception and bliss are the intrinsic qualities of a soul.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=47}}</ref> These qualities are fully enjoyed unhindered by liberated souls, but obscured by ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' in the case of non-liberated souls resulting in karmic bondage. This bondage further results in a continuous co-habitation of the soul with the body. Thus, an embodied non-liberated soul is found in four realms of existence—heavens, hells, humans and animal world – in a never-ending cycle of births and deaths also known as ''[[samsāra]]''. The soul is in bondage since beginningless time; however, it is possible to achieve liberation through rational perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct. Harry Oldmeadow notes that Jain ontology is both [[Realism (philosophy)|realist]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] metaphysics.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=149}}</ref>

== Karma ==
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|thumb|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness.]]
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Classification of ''karmas'' as mentioned in Jain texts]]
In Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. It not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=100}} Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Jain texts have classified the various types of karma according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds.{{sfn|Kritivijay|1957|p=21}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates reliance on supposed existence of divine grace or retribution.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=122}} The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

==Cosmology==
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jain cosmology]] denies the existence of a supreme being responsible for creation and operation of universe. According to [[Jainism]], this ''loka'' or Universe is an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, immutable in nature, beginningless and endless. [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the Universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. The Universe according to Jainism is narrow at top and broad at middle and once again becomes narrow at the bottom. [[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for his quote:<ref>{{harvnb|Allday|2001|p=268}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}
{{quote|Some foolish men declare that the creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If god created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could god have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.}}

===Kalchakra===
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|300px|thumb|Division of time as envisaged by Jains.]]
According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The Kālacakra, the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly.<ref name="Shah1998">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=35–38}}</ref> The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, Utsarpiṇī or ascending time cycle and Avasarpiṇī, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpiṇī is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness, while Avsarpiṇī is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in Sagaropama and Palyopama years) is further sub-divided into six ''aras'' or epochs of unequal periods. Currently, the time cycle is in ''avasarpiṇī'' or descending phase with the following epochs.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=271–272}}</ref>
The aras defined in Jain texts are:
*''Suṣama-suṣamā''
*''Suṣamā''
*''Suṣama-duḥṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama-suṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama''
*''Duḥṣama-duḥṣama''
In ''utsarpiṇī'' the order of the aras is reversed. Starting from Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā, it ends with Suṣama-suṣamā and thus this never ending cycle continues.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=272}}</ref> Each of these aras progress into the next phase seamlessly without apocalyptic consequences. The increase or decrease in the happiness, life spans and length of people and general moral conduct of the society changes in a phased and graded manner as the time passes. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=40}}</ref>

===Loka===
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]
The early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:<ref name="Shah, Natubhai 1998. p. 25">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=25}}</ref>
* ''Urdhva Loka'' – the realms of the gods or heavens
* ''Madhya Loka'' – the realms of the humans, animals and plants
* ''Adho Loka'' – the realms of the hellish beings or the infernal regions. The lower world consists of [[Naraka (Jainism)|seven hells]] which is inhabited by Bhavanpati demigods and the hellish beings. Hellish beings reside in hells whose names are Ratna prabha-dharma, Sharkara prabha-vansha, Valuka prabha-megha, Pank prabha-anjana, Dhum prabha-arista, Tamah prabha-maghavi, Mahatamah prabha-maadhavi.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=27–28}}</ref>

===Śalākāpuruṣas===
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Śalākāpuruṣa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 24 Tīrthaṅkaras and their contemporaries regularly appear. The Jain universal or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. They are 24 Tīrthaṅkara, 12 Chakravartī, 9 Baladevas, 9 Vāsudevas and 9 Prativāsudevas.
Besides these there are 9 Narada, 11 Rudras, 24 Kamdeva, 24 Fathers of the Tirthankaras, 24 Mothers of the Tirthankaras and 14 patriarchs (''Kulakara'') who are also important figures in Jain universal history.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}

==Epistemology==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic [[Epistemology|epistemological]] issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Knowledge for the Jains takes place in the soul, which, without the limiting factor of karma, is omniscient. Humans have partial knowledge – the object of knowledge is known partially and the means of knowledge do not operate to their full capacity. According to ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'', the knowledge of the basic Jaina truths can be obtained through:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* ''{{IAST|Pramāṇa}}'' – means or instruments of knowledge which can yield a comprehensive knowledge of an object, and
* ''Naya'' – particular standpoints, yielding partial knowledge.
{{IAST|Pramāṇa are of five kinds:<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|2006|pp=60–61}}</ref>
* ''mati'' or "sensory knowledge",
* ''Sruta'' or "scriptural knowledge",
* ''avadhi'' or "clairvoyance",
* ''manahparyaya'' or "telepathy", and
* ''kevala'' or "omniscience"

The first two are described as being indirect means of knowledge ''({{IAST|parokṣa}})'', with the others furnishing direct knowledge ''({{IAST|pratyakṣa}})'', by which it is meant that the object is known directly by the soul. Jains came out with their doctrines of [[Relativism|relativity]] used for logic and reasoning:
* ''Anekāntavāda'' – the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
* ''Syādvāda'' – the theory of conditioned predication and;
* ''Nayavāda'' – The theory of partial standpoints.

These philosophical concepts have made most important contributions to the ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of scepticism and relativity.}}<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|p=335}}</ref>

===Anekāntavāda===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
[[File:Aspects of Violence (Himsa).jpg|thumb|350px|Aspects of Violence (Himsa)]]
One of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is [[Anekantavada|Anēkāntavāda]]. It refers to the principles of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref name="Dundas2002">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=123–136}}</ref><ref name="kollerjurno"/><ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pages=400–407}}</ref>

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''andhagajanyāyah'', which can be illustrated through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.<ref name="hughes">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=590–591}}</ref> This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}</ref> According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].<ref name="Dundas2002" />

''Anekāntavāda'' encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of ''anekāntavāda'' apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy—even Jainism—which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view.<ref name="Ronald">{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| access-date= 2012-12-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archive-date= 19 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' also influenced [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to adopt principles of religious tolerance, {{IAST|''ahiṃsā''}} and ''[[satyagraha]]''.<ref name = "hay">{{harvnb |Hay |1970 |pp =14–23}}</ref>

===Syādvāda===
{{Main|Syādvāda}}
''[[Syādvāda]]'' is the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditioned]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], which provides an expression to ''anekānta'' by recommending that the epithet ''Syād'' be prefixed to every phrase or expression.<ref>{{harvnb|Chatterjea|2001|pp=77–87}}</ref> ''Syādvāda'' is not only an extension of ''anekānta'' [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term ''syād'' is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of ''syādvāda'', it means "in some ways" or "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term ''"syāt"'' should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.<ref name="kollerjurno">*{{cite journal  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syādvadā as the Epistemological Key to the Jaina Middle Way Metaphysics of Anekāntavāda  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume = 50  | issue = 3  | pages =400–07  | location =Honolulu  | issn =0031-8221  |date=July 2000  | doi =10.1353/pew.2000.0009 | jstor=1400182  }}</ref> Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, ''syādvāda'' is known as ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as ''[[saptabhangi|saptibhaṅgī]]'', are:<ref name = "grimes">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|p= 312}}</ref>
#''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#''syād-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.<ref name="grimes" /> To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of [[dogmatism]].<ref name="kollerjurno"/>

===Nayavāda===
''Nayavāda'' is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("partial viewpoint") and ''vāda'' ("[[school of thought]] or debate").<ref name="Grimes202">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|pp=202–203}}</ref> It is used to arrive at a certain [[inference]] from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones.<ref name="Grimes202" /> This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of [[critical philosophy]], ''nayavāda'' holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realise it, "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue".<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|pp=335–337}}</ref> While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, Māhavīra used the language of ''nayas''. ''Naya'', being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.<ref name="natu">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=80}}</ref>

The Jain morality and ethics are rooted in its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective of liberation. Jaina ethics evolved out of the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated in the ''[[mahavrata]]s'' or the five great vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

These ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality of physical actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa has to be observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism does not invoke fear of or reverence for God or conformity to the divine character as a reason for moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will. Neither is its observance necessary simply because it is altruistic or humanistic, conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. Rather it is an [[ethical egoism|egoistic imperative]] aimed at self-liberation. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]'' who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but because the life of the Arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conducive to the Arihant's own welfare, helping them to reach spiritual victory. Just as the Arihants achieved {{IAST|''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''}} or liberation by observing the moral code, so can anyone, who follows this path.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Science and Mathematics ==
===Atomism===
The most elaborate and well-preserved Indian theory of [[atomism]] comes from the philosophy of the [[Jainism|Jaina]] school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]], [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls.  Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms.  Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch".  Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space.  Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative  (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter.  To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul.  They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Contributions to Indian philosophy==
Jainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a major impact on [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. The scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically Indian –  [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], reincarnation and like – either have their origins in the [[shramana]] traditions or were propagated and developed by Jain teachers.  The sramanic ideal of mendicancy and renunciation, that the worldly life was full of suffering and that emancipation required giving up of desires and withdrawal into a lonely and contemplative life, was in stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal of an active and ritually punctuated life based on sacrifices, household duties and chants to deities. Sramanas developed and laid emphasis on Ahimsa, Karma, moksa and renunciation.<ref>{{harvnb|Pande|1994|pp=134–136}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Worthington|1982|pp=27–30}}</ref>

==Schools and traditions==
Jain philosophy arose from the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by [[Mahavira]], who preached essentially the same religion as the previous [[Tirthankara]]. [[Harry Oldmeadow]] notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow |2007|p=148}}</ref> The schisms into [[Svetambara|Śvetāmbara]] and [[Digambar]]a traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]], which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that in the course of history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or [[bhakti]] movement developed outside mainstream Jainism.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|pp=31–35}}</ref> Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that is at the core of Jainism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Earlier traditions===
As per the tradition, Jain Sangh was divided into two major sects:
* Digambaras, the older sect hold that nudity is necessary for liberation and only men can attain the final stage of non-attachment to the body by remaining nude. They also hold that the canonical literature was eventually lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* Śvetāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation and that nudity is optional. Śvetāmbara scriptures support both ''acelakatva'', nudity in monks and ''sacelakatva'', the wearing of white clothes by ascetics. They also hold that the Jain canon was not lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The now defunct [[Yapaniya]] sect followed the Digambara practice of nudity and eating from the hands while standing up along with Śvetāmbara beliefs and texts. They notably also permitted their ascetics to be "half-clothed" (''ardhambara'') in public areas only. The Yapaniya sect was absorbed into the Digambara community during the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Medieval traditions===
The period of 16th to 18th century was a period of reforms in Jainism. The following schools arose during this period :
* [[Sthanakvasi]] – The Sthanakvasis, arising from the Śvetāmbara tradition, rejected idol worship as unsanctioned by scriptures.
* [[Digambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Digambara)]] – The Digambara Terapantha movement arose in protest against the institution of [[Bhattaraka]]s (Jain priestly class), usage of flowers and offerings in Jain temples, and worship of minor gods.
* [[Svetambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Śvetāmbara)]] – The Terapanthi, also a non-iconic sect, arose from Sthanakvasis on account of differences in religious practices and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Recent developments===
Recent events lead to dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis on austerities saw the arising of two new sects within Jainism in the 20th century. These were essentially led by the laity rather than ascetics and soon became a major force to be reckoned with. The non-sectarian cult of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html}}</ref> who was one of the major influences on Mahatma Gandhi, is now one of the most popular movements. Another cult founded by [[Kanjisvami]], laying stress on [[theological determinism]] and "knowledge of self", has gained a large following as well.<ref>{{citation |last=Sangave |first=Vilas Adinath |author-link=Vilas Adinath Sangave |title=Jaina Community: A Social Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWdWrRGV_t8C |publisher=Popular Prakashan |date=1980 |orig-year=1959 |isbn=0-317-12346-7|page=53 }}</ref>

==Jain philosophers==
Jains hold the Jain doctrine to be eternal and based on universal principles. In the current time cycle, they trace the origins of its philosophy to [[Rishabhanatha]], the first ''Tīrthankara''. However, the tradition holds that the ancient [[Jain texts]] and [[Purvas]] which documented the Jain doctrine were lost and hence, historically, the Jain philosophy can be traced from [[Mahavira]]'s teachings. Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a concrete form to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira. Following is the partial list of Jain philosophers and their contributions:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

* [[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya]] (1624–1688) – Jain logician and one of the last intellectual giants to contribute to Jain philosophy. He specialised in ''Navya-Nyāya'' and wrote Vrttis (commentaries) on most of the earlier ''Jain Nyāya'' works by Samantabhadra, Akalanka, Manikyanandi, Vidyānandi, Prabhācandra and others in the then-prevalent ''Navya-Nyāya'' style. Yaśovijaya has to his credit a prolific literary output – more than 100 books in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].

{{short description|Indian philosophy}}
'''Jain philosophy''' is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>  Jain philosophy deals with [[reality]], [[cosmology]], [[epistemology]] (study of knowledge) and Vitalism. It attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of soul's bondage with body and the means to achieve liberation.

Jain texts expound that in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four [[tirthankara]]s grace this part of the Universe to teach the unchanging doctrine of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct.{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=59}} Jain philosophy means the teachings of a ''Tirthankara'' which are recorded in [[Jain Agamas|Sacred Jain texts]]. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Belief on independent existence of soul and matter.
* Refutation of the idea that a supreme divine creator, owner, preserver or destroyer of the universe exists.
* Potency of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], eternal universe.
* Accent on relativity and [[Anekantavada|multiple facets of truth]] and
* Morality and ethics based on liberation of soul.

Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Tattva.jpg|thumb|The seven [[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]] of Digambara Jain philosophy]]
Digambara Jain philosophy postulates that seven ''"tattva"'' (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality,{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=6}} These are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177–187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96–98}}-
#''Jīva''-The [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] or the sentient substance which is said to have a separate existence from the body that houses it. ''Jīva'' is characterised by cetana (consciousness) and upayoga (knowledge and perception). Though the soul experiences both birth and death, it is neither really destroyed nor created. Decay and origin refer respectively to the disappearing of one state of soul and appearance of another state, these being merely the modes of the soul substance.
#''[[Ajiva|ajīva]]''- the non-soul or the insentient
#''[[Asrava|āsrava]]'' (influx)- inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' (bondage)- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas'', thereby causing its change, which cumulatively determines the future rebirths{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=188–190}}{{sfn|Jaini|1980|pp=219–228}}
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

Svetambara Jain philosophy add two more to the above list, which are as follows:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177–187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96–98}}
# Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
# Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras

== The Path to Liberation ==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of ''moksha''. According to the [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1–1){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}}}
* Right Faith (''Samyak Darśana'') means belief in substances like soul and non-soul without delusion and misapprehension.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=18}}
* Right Knowledge (''Samyak Jnāna'')- When the nature of reality (substances) is ascertained with the help of the doctrine of manifold points of view (''anekāntavāda''), the knowledge thus obtained (free from doubts, misapprehension, and delusion) is said to be the Right Knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=29}}
* Right Conduct (''Samyak chāritra'')-The very nature of the soul; devoid of all passions, untainted, unattached to any alien substance is Right conduct. It is achieved by abjuring all sinful activities of the body, the speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=31}}

== Substances ==
{{Main|Dravya (Jainism)}}
According to Jainas, the world is composed of two different kinds of substances, the ''Jīva'' (conscious) and the ''ajīva'' (unconscious). These are the uncreated existing constituents of the Universe which impart the necessary dynamics to the Universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''Vatthu sahāvō dhammō'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]."{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=225}}

=== Unconscious substance ===
{{Main|Ajiva}}
The five unconscious (''ajīva'') substances are:{{sfn|Sanghvi|2008|p=26}}

* [[Pudgala]] – It is non living (no soul) [[Matter]], which is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter.  It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the Paramānu and Pudgala is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.

*'''''Dharma''''' – (Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]) and '''''Adharma''''' (Medium of Rest) – Also known as Dharmāstikāya and Adharmāstikāya, they are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmāstikāya motion is not possible and without adharmāstikāya rest is not possible in the universe.

* Ākāśa: Space – [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. According to Jains, Space is a substance, in the nature of a vacuum but not a pure vacuum. It is an extended continuous vacuum. As pure vacuum it will be non-existent, and non-extended; which will devoid it of even one positive quality. Therefore, Jains propound that Space, which is endowed with infinite extension is a substance in itself.

* Kāla (Time)- In Jainism, time is explained in two different aspects. Firstly as the measure of duration, known in the form of hours, days, and the like. Secondly, as the cause of the continuity of function of things. According to [[Champat Rai Jain]], "Nothing in nature can exist destitute or devoid of function. Function is discharged by the displacement of energy in the case of simple units and things. If there were no Time-substance to help in the performance of the movement of the displacement of energy, things would be doomed to remain in the same condition always." In its first aspect, time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of sagaropama (ocean years).<ref>{{harvnb|James|1969|p=45}}</ref>[[File:Jain scale of time.JPG|thumb|Scale of time in [[Jain]] texts shown [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmically]]. Check for the second first.]]

=== Conscious substance ===
According to the Jain philosophy, there are infinite independent souls. These are categorised into two—liberated and non-liberated. Infinite knowledge, perception and bliss are the intrinsic qualities of a soul.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=47}}</ref> These qualities are fully enjoyed unhindered by liberated souls, but obscured by ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' in the case of non-liberated souls resulting in karmic bondage. This bondage further results in a continuous co-habitation of the soul with the body. Thus, an embodied non-liberated soul is found in four realms of existence—heavens, hells, humans and animal world – in a never-ending cycle of births and deaths also known as ''[[samsāra]]''. The soul is in bondage since beginningless time; however, it is possible to achieve liberation through rational perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct. Harry Oldmeadow notes that Jain ontology is both [[Realism (philosophy)|realist]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] metaphysics.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=149}}</ref>

== Karma ==
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|thumb|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness.]]
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Classification of ''karmas'' as mentioned in Jain texts]]
In Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. It not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=100}} Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Jain texts have classified the various types of karma according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds.{{sfn|Kritivijay|1957|p=21}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates reliance on supposed existence of divine grace or retribution.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=122}} The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

==Cosmology==
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jain cosmology]] denies the existence of a supreme being responsible for creation and operation of universe. According to [[Jainism]], this ''loka'' or Universe is an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, immutable in nature, beginningless and endless. [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the Universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. The Universe according to Jainism is narrow at top and broad at middle and once again becomes narrow at the bottom. [[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for his quote:<ref>{{harvnb|Allday|2001|p=268}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}
{{quote|Some foolish men declare that the creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If god created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could god have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.}}

===Kalchakra===
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|300px|thumb|Division of time as envisaged by Jains.]]
According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The Kālacakra, the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly.<ref name="Shah1998">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=35–38}}</ref> The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, Utsarpiṇī or ascending time cycle and Avasarpiṇī, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpiṇī is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness, while Avsarpiṇī is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in Sagaropama and Palyopama years) is further sub-divided into six ''aras'' or epochs of unequal periods. Currently, the time cycle is in ''avasarpiṇī'' or descending phase with the following epochs.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=271–272}}</ref>
The aras defined in Jain texts are:
*''Suṣama-suṣamā''
*''Suṣamā''
*''Suṣama-duḥṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama-suṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama''
*''Duḥṣama-duḥṣama''
In ''utsarpiṇī'' the order of the aras is reversed. Starting from Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā, it ends with Suṣama-suṣamā and thus this never ending cycle continues.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=272}}</ref> Each of these aras progress into the next phase seamlessly without apocalyptic consequences. The increase or decrease in the happiness, life spans and length of people and general moral conduct of the society changes in a phased and graded manner as the time passes. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=40}}</ref>

===Loka===
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]
The early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:<ref name="Shah, Natubhai 1998. p. 25">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=25}}</ref>
* ''Urdhva Loka'' – the realms of the gods or heavens
* ''Madhya Loka'' – the realms of the humans, animals and plants
* ''Adho Loka'' – the realms of the hellish beings or the infernal regions. The lower world consists of [[Naraka (Jainism)|seven hells]] which is inhabited by Bhavanpati demigods and the hellish beings. Hellish beings reside in hells whose names are Ratna prabha-dharma, Sharkara prabha-vansha, Valuka prabha-megha, Pank prabha-anjana, Dhum prabha-arista, Tamah prabha-maghavi, Mahatamah prabha-maadhavi.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=27–28}}</ref>

===Śalākāpuruṣas===
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Śalākāpuruṣa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 24 Tīrthaṅkaras and their contemporaries regularly appear. The Jain universal or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. They are 24 Tīrthaṅkara, 12 Chakravartī, 9 Baladevas, 9 Vāsudevas and 9 Prativāsudevas.
Besides these there are 9 Narada, 11 Rudras, 24 Kamdeva, 24 Fathers of the Tirthankaras, 24 Mothers of the Tirthankaras and 14 patriarchs (''Kulakara'') who are also important figures in Jain universal history.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}

==Epistemology==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic [[Epistemology|epistemological]] issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Knowledge for the Jains takes place in the soul, which, without the limiting factor of karma, is omniscient. Humans have partial knowledge – the object of knowledge is known partially and the means of knowledge do not operate to their full capacity. According to ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'', the knowledge of the basic Jaina truths can be obtained through:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* ''{{IAST|Pramāṇa}}'' – means or instruments of knowledge which can yield a comprehensive knowledge of an object, and
* ''Naya'' – particular standpoints, yielding partial knowledge.
{{IAST|Pramāṇa are of five kinds:<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|2006|pp=60–61}}</ref>
* ''mati'' or "sensory knowledge",
* ''Sruta'' or "scriptural knowledge",
* ''avadhi'' or "clairvoyance",
* ''manahparyaya'' or "telepathy", and
* ''kevala'' or "omniscience"

The first two are described as being indirect means of knowledge ''({{IAST|parokṣa}})'', with the others furnishing direct knowledge ''({{IAST|pratyakṣa}})'', by which it is meant that the object is known directly by the soul. Jains came out with their doctrines of [[Relativism|relativity]] used for logic and reasoning:
* ''Anekāntavāda'' – the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
* ''Syādvāda'' – the theory of conditioned predication and;
* ''Nayavāda'' – The theory of partial standpoints.

These philosophical concepts have made most important contributions to the ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of scepticism and relativity.}}<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|p=335}}</ref>

===Anekāntavāda===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
[[File:Aspects of Violence (Himsa).jpg|thumb|350px|Aspects of Violence (Himsa)]]
One of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is [[Anekantavada|Anēkāntavāda]]. It refers to the principles of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref name="Dundas2002">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=123–136}}</ref><ref name="kollerjurno"/><ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pages=400–407}}</ref>

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''andhagajanyāyah'', which can be illustrated through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.<ref name="hughes">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=590–591}}</ref> This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}</ref> According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].<ref name="Dundas2002" />

''Anekāntavāda'' encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of ''anekāntavāda'' apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy—even Jainism—which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view.<ref name="Ronald">{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| access-date= 2012-12-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archive-date= 19 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' also influenced [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to adopt principles of religious tolerance, {{IAST|''ahiṃsā''}} and ''[[satyagraha]]''.<ref name = "hay">{{harvnb |Hay |1970 |pp =14–23}}</ref>

===Syādvāda===
{{Main|Syādvāda}}
''[[Syādvāda]]'' is the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditioned]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], which provides an expression to ''anekānta'' by recommending that the epithet ''Syād'' be prefixed to every phrase or expression.<ref>{{harvnb|Chatterjea|2001|pp=77–87}}</ref> ''Syādvāda'' is not only an extension of ''anekānta'' [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term ''syād'' is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of ''syādvāda'', it means "in some ways" or "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term ''"syāt"'' should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.<ref name="kollerjurno">*{{cite journal  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syādvadā as the Epistemological Key to the Jaina Middle Way Metaphysics of Anekāntavāda  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume = 50  | issue = 3  | pages =400–07  | location =Honolulu  | issn =0031-8221  |date=July 2000  | doi =10.1353/pew.2000.0009 | jstor=1400182  }}</ref> Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, ''syādvāda'' is known as ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as ''[[saptabhangi|saptibhaṅgī]]'', are:<ref name = "grimes">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|p= 312}}</ref>
#''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#''syād-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.<ref name="grimes" /> To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of [[dogmatism]].<ref name="kollerjurno"/>

===Nayavāda===
''Nayavāda'' is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("partial viewpoint") and ''vāda'' ("[[school of thought]] or debate").<ref name="Grimes202">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|pp=202–203}}</ref> It is used to arrive at a certain [[inference]] from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones.<ref name="Grimes202" /> This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of [[critical philosophy]], ''nayavāda'' holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realise it, "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue".<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|pp=335–337}}</ref> While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, Māhavīra used the language of ''nayas''. ''Naya'', being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.<ref name="natu">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=80}}</ref>

==Ethics==
{{Main|Ethics of Jainism}}
The Jain morality and ethics are rooted in its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective of liberation. Jaina ethics evolved out of the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated in the ''[[mahavrata]]s'' or the five great vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

These ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality of physical actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa has to be observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism does not invoke fear of or reverence for God or conformity to the divine character as a reason for moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will. Neither is its observance necessary simply because it is altruistic or humanistic, conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. Rather it is an [[ethical egoism|egoistic imperative]] aimed at self-liberation. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]'' who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but because the life of the Arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conducive to the Arihant's own welfare, helping them to reach spiritual victory. Just as the Arihants achieved {{IAST|''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''}} or liberation by observing the moral code, so can anyone, who follows this path.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Atomism===
The most elaborate and well-preserved Indian theory of [[atomism]] comes from the philosophy of the [[Jainism|Jaina]] school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]], [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls.  Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms.  Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch".  Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space.  Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative  (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter.  To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul.  They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Contributions to Indian philosophy==
Jainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a major impact on [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. The scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically Indian –  [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], reincarnation and like – either have their origins in the [[shramana]] traditions or were propagated and developed by Jain teachers.  The sramanic ideal of mendicancy and renunciation, that the worldly life was full of suffering and that emancipation required giving up of desires and withdrawal into a lonely and contemplative life, was in stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal of an active and ritually punctuated life based on sacrifices, household duties and chants to deities. Sramanas developed and laid emphasis on Ahimsa, Karma, moksa and renunciation.<ref>{{harvnb|Pande|1994|pp=134–136}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Worthington|1982|pp=27–30}}</ref>

==Schools and traditions==
Jain philosophy arose from the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by [[Mahavira]], who preached essentially the same religion as the previous [[Tirthankara]]. [[Harry Oldmeadow]] notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow |2007|p=148}}</ref> The schisms into [[Svetambara|Śvetāmbara]] and [[Digambar]]a traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]], which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that in the course of history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or [[bhakti]] movement developed outside mainstream Jainism.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|pp=31–35}}</ref> Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that is at the core of Jainism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Earlier traditions===
As per the tradition, Jain Sangh was divided into two major sects:
* Digambaras, the older sect hold that nudity is necessary for liberation and only men can attain the final stage of non-attachment to the body by remaining nude. They also hold that the canonical literature was eventually lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* Śvetāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation and that nudity is optional. Śvetāmbara scriptures support both ''acelakatva'', nudity in monks and ''sacelakatva'', the wearing of white clothes by ascetics. They also hold that the Jain canon was not lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The now defunct [[Yapaniya]] sect followed the Digambara practice of nudity and eating from the hands while standing up along with Śvetāmbara beliefs and texts. They notably also permitted their ascetics to be "half-clothed" (''ardhambara'') in public areas only. The Yapaniya sect was absorbed into the Digambara community during the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Medieval traditions===
The period of 16th to 18th century was a period of reforms in Jainism. The following schools arose during this period :
* [[Sthanakvasi]] – The Sthanakvasis, arising from the Śvetāmbara tradition, rejected idol worship as unsanctioned by scriptures.
* [[Digambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Digambara)]] – The Digambara Terapantha movement arose in protest against the institution of [[Bhattaraka]]s (Jain priestly class), usage of flowers and offerings in Jain temples, and worship of minor gods.
* [[Svetambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Śvetāmbara)]] – The Terapanthi, also a non-iconic sect, arose from Sthanakvasis on account of differences in religious practices and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Recent developments===
Recent events lead to dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis on austerities saw the arising of two new sects within Jainism in the 20th century. These were essentially led by the laity rather than ascetics and soon became a major force to be reckoned with. The non-sectarian cult of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html}}</ref> who was one of the major influences on Mahatma Gandhi, is now one of the most popular movements. Another cult founded by [[Kanjisvami]], laying stress on [[theological determinism]] and "knowledge of self", has gained a large following as well.<ref>{{citation |last=Sangave |first=Vilas Adinath |author-link=Vilas Adinath Sangave |title=Jaina Community: A Social Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWdWrRGV_t8C |publisher=Popular Prakashan |date=1980 |orig-year=1959 |isbn=0-317-12346-7|page=53 }}</ref>

==Jain philosophers==
Jains hold the Jain doctrine to be eternal and based on universal principles. In the current time cycle, they trace the origins of its philosophy to [[Rishabhanatha]], the first ''Tīrthankara''. However, the tradition holds that the ancient [[Jain texts]] and [[Purvas]] which documented the Jain doctrine were lost and hence, historically, the Jain philosophy can be traced from [[Mahavira]]'s teachings. Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a concrete form to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira. Following is the partial list of Jain philosophers and their contributions:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

* [[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya]] (1624–1688) – Jain logician and one of the last intellectual giants to contribute to Jain philosophy. He specialised in ''Navya-Nyāya'' and wrote Vrttis (commentaries) on most of the earlier ''Jain Nyāya'' works by Samantabhadra, Akalanka, Manikyanandi, Vidyānandi, Prabhācandra and others in the then-prevalent ''Navya-Nyāya'' style. Yaśovijaya has to his credit a prolific literary output – more than 100 books in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].

{{short description|Indian philosophy}}
'''Jain philosophy''' is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>  Jain philosophy deals with [[reality]], [[cosmology]], [[epistemology]] (study of knowledge) and Vitalism. It attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of soul's bondage with body and the means to achieve liberation.

Jain texts expound that in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four [[tirthankara]]s grace this part of the Universe to teach the unchanging doctrine of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct.{{sfn|Jansma|Jain|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=59}} Jain philosophy means the teachings of a ''Tirthankara'' which are recorded in [[Jain Agamas|Sacred Jain texts]]. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Belief on independent existence of soul and matter.
* Refutation of the idea that a supreme divine creator, owner, preserver or destroyer of the universe exists.
* Potency of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], eternal universe.
* Accent on relativity and [[Anekantavada|multiple facets of truth]] and
* Morality and ethics based on liberation of soul.

Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

{{Main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}{{further|Vitalism (Jainism)}}
According to the Jain texts, the vitalities or life-principles are ten, namely the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind. The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=62–63,196}}

In the animal world, the five-sensed beings without mind have nine life-principles with the addition of the sense of hearing. Those endowed with mind have ten with the addition of the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34–35}} According to [[Tattvarthasutra]], a major Jain text, "the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=99}} According to the [[Purushartha Siddhyupaya]], "non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury {{IAST|(ahiṃsā)}}, and manifestation of such passions is injury (hiṃsā)." This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=35}} [[Jain vegetarianism|Vegetarianism]] and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahiṃsā.{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=226}}

#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)- obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]'' (gradual dissociation)- separation or falling off of part of karmic matter from the soul.
#''mokṣha'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

Svetambara Jain philosophy add two more to the above list, which are as follows:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|pp=177–187}}{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=151}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=96–98}}
# Good karma (''punya'', merits), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras
# Bad karma (''papa'', negatives), found in the ''tattva'' theory of Śvētāmbara, but not of Digambaras

== The Path to Liberation ==
{{Main|Ratnatraya}}
According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of ''moksha''. According to the [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]]:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|Tattvārthasūtra (1–1){{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2011|p=2}}}}
* Right Faith (''Samyak Darśana'') means belief in substances like soul and non-soul without delusion and misapprehension.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=18}}
* Right Knowledge (''Samyak Jnāna'')- When the nature of reality (substances) is ascertained with the help of the doctrine of manifold points of view (''anekāntavāda''), the knowledge thus obtained (free from doubts, misapprehension, and delusion) is said to be the Right Knowledge.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=29}}
* Right Conduct (''Samyak chāritra'')-The very nature of the soul; devoid of all passions, untainted, unattached to any alien substance is Right conduct. It is achieved by abjuring all sinful activities of the body, the speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=31}}

== Substances ==
{{Main|Dravya (Jainism)}}
According to Jainas, the world is composed of two different kinds of substances, the ''Jīva'' (conscious) and the ''ajīva'' (unconscious). These are the uncreated existing constituents of the Universe which impart the necessary dynamics to the Universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is ''Vatthu sahāvō dhammō'' translated as "the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]."{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=225}}

=== Unconscious substance ===
{{Main|Ajiva}}
The five unconscious (''ajīva'') substances are:{{sfn|Sanghvi|2008|p=26}}

* [[Pudgala]] – It is non living (no soul) [[Matter]], which is classified as solid, liquid, gaseous, energy, fine Karmic materials and extra-fine matter or ultimate particles. Paramānu or ultimate particles are the basic building block of matter.  It possesses at all times four qualities, namely, a color (''varna''), a taste (''rasa''), a smell (''gandha''), and a certain kind of palpability (''sparsha'', touch).{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}} One of the qualities of the Paramānu and Pudgala is that of permanence and indestructibility. It combines and changes its modes but its basic qualities remain the same. According to Jainism, it cannot be created nor destroyed.

*'''''Dharma''''' – (Medium of [[Motion (physics)|Motion]]) and '''''Adharma''''' (Medium of Rest) – Also known as Dharmāstikāya and Adharmāstikāya, they are unique to Jain thought depicting the principles of motion and rest. They are said to pervade the entire universe. ''Dharma'' and ''Adharma'' are by themselves not motion or rest but mediate motion and rest in other bodies. Without dharmāstikāya motion is not possible and without adharmāstikāya rest is not possible in the universe.

* Ākāśa: Space – [[Space]] is a substance that accommodates souls, matter, the principle of motion, the principle of rest, and time. It is all-pervading, infinite and made of infinite space-points. According to Jains, Space is a substance, in the nature of a vacuum but not a pure vacuum. It is an extended continuous vacuum. As pure vacuum it will be non-existent, and non-extended; which will devoid it of even one positive quality. Therefore, Jains propound that Space, which is endowed with infinite extension is a substance in itself.

* Kāla (Time)- In Jainism, time is explained in two different aspects. Firstly as the measure of duration, known in the form of hours, days, and the like. Secondly, as the cause of the continuity of function of things. According to [[Champat Rai Jain]], "Nothing in nature can exist destitute or devoid of function. Function is discharged by the displacement of energy in the case of simple units and things. If there were no Time-substance to help in the performance of the movement of the displacement of energy, things would be doomed to remain in the same condition always." In its first aspect, time is likened to a wheel with twelve spokes divided into descending and ascending halves with six stages, each of immense duration estimated at billions of sagaropama (ocean years).<ref>{{harvnb|James|1969|p=45}}</ref>[[File:Jain scale of time.JPG|thumb|Scale of time in [[Jain]] texts shown [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmically]]. Check for the second first.]]

=== Conscious substance ===
According to the Jain philosophy, there are infinite independent souls. These are categorised into two—liberated and non-liberated. Infinite knowledge, perception and bliss are the intrinsic qualities of a soul.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=47}}</ref> These qualities are fully enjoyed unhindered by liberated souls, but obscured by ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' in the case of non-liberated souls resulting in karmic bondage. This bondage further results in a continuous co-habitation of the soul with the body. Thus, an embodied non-liberated soul is found in four realms of existence—heavens, hells, humans and animal world – in a never-ending cycle of births and deaths also known as ''[[samsāra]]''. The soul is in bondage since beginningless time; however, it is possible to achieve liberation through rational perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct. Harry Oldmeadow notes that Jain ontology is both [[Realism (philosophy)|realist]] and [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] metaphysics.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=149}}</ref>

== Karma ==
{{Main| Karma in Jainism}}
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|thumb|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and reaction: if we sow [[Goodness and value theory|goodness]], we will reap goodness.]]
[[File:Types of Karma.JPG|thumb|Classification of ''karmas'' as mentioned in Jain texts]]
In Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. It not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=100}} Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Jain texts have classified the various types of karma according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds.{{sfn|Kritivijay|1957|p=21}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}} The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates reliance on supposed existence of divine grace or retribution.{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=122}} The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=551}}

==Cosmology==
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}
{{Further|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jain cosmology]] denies the existence of a supreme being responsible for creation and operation of universe. According to [[Jainism]], this ''loka'' or Universe is an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, immutable in nature, beginningless and endless. [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the Universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. The Universe according to Jainism is narrow at top and broad at middle and once again becomes narrow at the bottom. [[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for his quote:<ref>{{harvnb|Allday|2001|p=268}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}
{{quote|Some foolish men declare that the creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If god created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could god have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.}}

===Kalchakra===
[[File:Jain Cosmic Time Cycle.jpg|300px|thumb|Division of time as envisaged by Jains.]]
According to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The Kālacakra, the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly.<ref name="Shah1998">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=35–38}}</ref> The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, Utsarpiṇī or ascending time cycle and Avasarpiṇī, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpiṇī is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness, while Avsarpiṇī is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in Sagaropama and Palyopama years) is further sub-divided into six ''aras'' or epochs of unequal periods. Currently, the time cycle is in ''avasarpiṇī'' or descending phase with the following epochs.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=271–272}}</ref>
The aras defined in Jain texts are:
*''Suṣama-suṣamā''
*''Suṣamā''
*''Suṣama-duḥṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama-suṣamā''
*''Duḥṣama''
*''Duḥṣama-duḥṣama''
In ''utsarpiṇī'' the order of the aras is reversed. Starting from Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā, it ends with Suṣama-suṣamā and thus this never ending cycle continues.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=272}}</ref> Each of these aras progress into the next phase seamlessly without apocalyptic consequences. The increase or decrease in the happiness, life spans and length of people and general moral conduct of the society changes in a phased and graded manner as the time passes. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own [[Karma in Jainism|karma]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=40}}</ref>

===Loka===
[[File:Jain universe.JPG|thumb|300px|Structure of Universe according to the Jain scriptures.]]
The early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:<ref name="Shah, Natubhai 1998. p. 25">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=25}}</ref>
* ''Urdhva Loka'' – the realms of the gods or heavens
* ''Madhya Loka'' – the realms of the humans, animals and plants
* ''Adho Loka'' – the realms of the hellish beings or the infernal regions. The lower world consists of [[Naraka (Jainism)|seven hells]] which is inhabited by Bhavanpati demigods and the hellish beings. Hellish beings reside in hells whose names are Ratna prabha-dharma, Sharkara prabha-vansha, Valuka prabha-megha, Pank prabha-anjana, Dhum prabha-arista, Tamah prabha-maghavi, Mahatamah prabha-maadhavi.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998|pp=27–28}}</ref>

===Śalākāpuruṣas===
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Śalākāpuruṣa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 24 Tīrthaṅkaras and their contemporaries regularly appear. The Jain universal or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. They are 24 Tīrthaṅkara, 12 Chakravartī, 9 Baladevas, 9 Vāsudevas and 9 Prativāsudevas.
Besides these there are 9 Narada, 11 Rudras, 24 Kamdeva, 24 Fathers of the Tirthankaras, 24 Mothers of the Tirthankaras and 14 patriarchs (''Kulakara'') who are also important figures in Jain universal history.{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}}

==Epistemology==
{{Main|Jain epistemology}}
Jainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic [[Epistemology|epistemological]] issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Knowledge for the Jains takes place in the soul, which, without the limiting factor of karma, is omniscient. Humans have partial knowledge – the object of knowledge is known partially and the means of knowledge do not operate to their full capacity. According to ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]]'', the knowledge of the basic Jaina truths can be obtained through:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* ''{{IAST|Pramāṇa}}'' – means or instruments of knowledge which can yield a comprehensive knowledge of an object, and
* ''Naya'' – particular standpoints, yielding partial knowledge.
{{IAST|Pramāṇa are of five kinds:<ref>{{harvnb|Prasad|2006|pp=60–61}}</ref>
* ''mati'' or "sensory knowledge",
* ''Sruta'' or "scriptural knowledge",
* ''avadhi'' or "clairvoyance",
* ''manahparyaya'' or "telepathy", and
* ''kevala'' or "omniscience"

The first two are described as being indirect means of knowledge ''({{IAST|parokṣa}})'', with the others furnishing direct knowledge ''({{IAST|pratyakṣa}})'', by which it is meant that the object is known directly by the soul. Jains came out with their doctrines of [[Relativism|relativity]] used for logic and reasoning:
* ''Anekāntavāda'' – the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
* ''Syādvāda'' – the theory of conditioned predication and;
* ''Nayavāda'' – The theory of partial standpoints.

These philosophical concepts have made most important contributions to the ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of scepticism and relativity.}}<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|p=335}}</ref>

===Anekāntavāda===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
[[File:Aspects of Violence (Himsa).jpg|thumb|350px|Aspects of Violence (Himsa)]]
One of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is [[Anekantavada|Anēkāntavāda]]. It refers to the principles of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref name="Dundas2002">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=123–136}}</ref><ref name="kollerjurno"/><ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pages=400–407}}</ref>

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''andhagajanyāyah'', which can be illustrated through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.<ref name="hughes">{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|pp=590–591}}</ref> This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}</ref> According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].<ref name="Dundas2002" />

''Anekāntavāda'' encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of ''anekāntavāda'' apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy—even Jainism—which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view.<ref name="Ronald">{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| access-date= 2012-12-11| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archive-date= 19 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' also influenced [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to adopt principles of religious tolerance, {{IAST|''ahiṃsā''}} and ''[[satyagraha]]''.<ref name = "hay">{{harvnb |Hay |1970 |pp =14–23}}</ref>

===Syādvāda===
{{Main|Syādvāda}}
''[[Syādvāda]]'' is the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditioned]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], which provides an expression to ''anekānta'' by recommending that the epithet ''Syād'' be prefixed to every phrase or expression.<ref>{{harvnb|Chatterjea|2001|pp=77–87}}</ref> ''Syādvāda'' is not only an extension of ''anekānta'' [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term ''syād'' is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of ''syādvāda'', it means "in some ways" or "from a perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term ''"syāt"'' should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement.<ref name="kollerjurno">*{{cite journal  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syādvadā as the Epistemological Key to the Jaina Middle Way Metaphysics of Anekāntavāda  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume = 50  | issue = 3  | pages =400–07  | location =Honolulu  | issn =0031-8221  |date=July 2000  | doi =10.1353/pew.2000.0009 | jstor=1400182  }}</ref> Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, ''syādvāda'' is known as ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as ''[[saptabhangi|saptibhaṅgī]]'', are:<ref name = "grimes">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|p= 312}}</ref>
#''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#''syād-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-asti-nāsti-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable,
#''{{IAST|syād-avaktavyaḥ}}''—in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.<ref name="grimes" /> To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of [[dogmatism]].<ref name="kollerjurno"/>

===Nayavāda===
''Nayavāda'' is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("partial viewpoint") and ''vāda'' ("[[school of thought]] or debate").<ref name="Grimes202">{{harvnb|Grimes|1996|pp=202–203}}</ref> It is used to arrive at a certain [[inference]] from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones.<ref name="Grimes202" /> This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of [[critical philosophy]], ''nayavāda'' holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realise it, "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue".<ref>{{harvnb|McEvilley|2002|pp=335–337}}</ref> While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, Māhavīra used the language of ''nayas''. ''Naya'', being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.<ref name="natu">{{harvnb|Shah|1998|p=80}}</ref>

==Ethics==
{{Main|Ethics of Jainism}}
The Jain morality and ethics are rooted in its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective of liberation. Jaina ethics evolved out of the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated in the ''[[mahavrata]]s'' or the five great vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

|12.''atihti samvibhag''

|- style="background:gold;"
|}

These ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality of physical actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa has to be observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism does not invoke fear of or reverence for God or conformity to the divine character as a reason for moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will. Neither is its observance necessary simply because it is altruistic or humanistic, conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. Rather it is an [[ethical egoism|egoistic imperative]] aimed at self-liberation. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]'' who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but because the life of the Arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conducive to the Arihant's own welfare, helping them to reach spiritual victory. Just as the Arihants achieved {{IAST|''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''}} or liberation by observing the moral code, so can anyone, who follows this path.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Science and Mathematics ==
===Atomism===
The most elaborate and well-preserved Indian theory of [[atomism]] comes from the philosophy of the [[Jainism|Jaina]] school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Kalpasutra (Jainism)|Kalpasutra]], [[Tattvarthasutra]] and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls.  Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms.  Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by "kind of touch".  Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space.  Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative  (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter.  To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul.  They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Contributions to Indian philosophy==
Jainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a major impact on [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. The scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically Indian –  [[Karma in Jainism|Karma]], [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksa]], reincarnation and like – either have their origins in the [[shramana]] traditions or were propagated and developed by Jain teachers.  The sramanic ideal of mendicancy and renunciation, that the worldly life was full of suffering and that emancipation required giving up of desires and withdrawal into a lonely and contemplative life, was in stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal of an active and ritually punctuated life based on sacrifices, household duties and chants to deities. Sramanas developed and laid emphasis on Ahimsa, Karma, moksa and renunciation.<ref>{{harvnb|Pande|1994|pp=134–136}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Worthington|1982|pp=27–30}}</ref>

==Schools and traditions==
Jain philosophy arose from the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by [[Mahavira]], who preached essentially the same religion as the previous [[Tirthankara]]. [[Harry Oldmeadow]] notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components.<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow |2007|p=148}}</ref> The schisms into [[Svetambara|Śvetāmbara]] and [[Digambar]]a traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]], which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that in the course of history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or [[bhakti]] movement developed outside mainstream Jainism.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|pp=31–35}}</ref> Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that is at the core of Jainism.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Earlier traditions===
As per the tradition, Jain Sangh was divided into two major sects:
* Digambaras, the older sect hold that nudity is necessary for liberation and only men can attain the final stage of non-attachment to the body by remaining nude. They also hold that the canonical literature was eventually lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* Śvetāmbaras believe that women can attain liberation and that nudity is optional. Śvetāmbara scriptures support both ''acelakatva'', nudity in monks and ''sacelakatva'', the wearing of white clothes by ascetics. They also hold that the Jain canon was not lost.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The now defunct [[Yapaniya]] sect followed the Digambara practice of nudity and eating from the hands while standing up along with Śvetāmbara beliefs and texts. They notably also permitted their ascetics to be "half-clothed" (''ardhambara'') in public areas only. The Yapaniya sect was absorbed into the Digambara community during the medieval period.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Medieval traditions===
The period of 16th to 18th century was a period of reforms in Jainism. The following schools arose during this period :
* [[Sthanakvasi]] – The Sthanakvasis, arising from the Śvetāmbara tradition, rejected idol worship as unsanctioned by scriptures.
* [[Digambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Digambara)]] – The Digambara Terapantha movement arose in protest against the institution of [[Bhattaraka]]s (Jain priestly class), usage of flowers and offerings in Jain temples, and worship of minor gods.
* [[Svetambar Terapanth|Terapanthi (Śvetāmbara)]] – The Terapanthi, also a non-iconic sect, arose from Sthanakvasis on account of differences in religious practices and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Recent developments===
Recent events lead to dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis on austerities saw the arising of two new sects within Jainism in the 20th century. These were essentially led by the laity rather than ascetics and soon became a major force to be reckoned with. The non-sectarian cult of [[Shrimad Rajchandra]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Rājacandra | website=Jainpedia|first=Jérôme|last=Petit| date=2016 | url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/studying-jainism/rajacandra.html}}</ref> who was one of the major influences on Mahatma Gandhi, is now one of the most popular movements. Another cult founded by [[Kanjisvami]], laying stress on [[theological determinism]] and "knowledge of self", has gained a large following as well.<ref>{{citation |last=Sangave |first=Vilas Adinath |author-link=Vilas Adinath Sangave |title=Jaina Community: A Social Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWdWrRGV_t8C |publisher=Popular Prakashan |date=1980 |orig-year=1959 |isbn=0-317-12346-7|page=53 }}</ref>

==Jain philosophers==
Jains hold the Jain doctrine to be eternal and based on universal principles. In the current time cycle, they trace the origins of its philosophy to [[Rishabhanatha]], the first ''Tīrthankara''. However, the tradition holds that the ancient [[Jain texts]] and [[Purvas]] which documented the Jain doctrine were lost and hence, historically, the Jain philosophy can be traced from [[Mahavira]]'s teachings. Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a concrete form to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira. Following is the partial list of Jain philosophers and their contributions:{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
<!-- This is only a list of Jain monks who have made substantial contributions to Jain Philosophy. Please do not include names of any other Jain monks  -->
* [[Kundakunda]] (1st—2nd century CE) – exponent of Jain metaphysics and [[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|Jain nayas]] dealing with the nature of the soul and its contamination by matter, author of ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pañcāstikāyasāra]]'' "Essence of the Five Existents", the ''Pravacanasāra'' "Essence of the Scripture", the ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]'' "Essence of the Doctrine", ''[[Niyamasara|Niyamasāra]]'' "Essence of Discipline", ''Atthapāhuda'' "Eight Gifts", ''Dasabhatti'' "Ten Worships" and ''Bārasa Anuvekkhā'' "Twelve Contemplations".
* [[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] (2nd century CE) – first Jain writer to write on ''nyāya'', ([[Aptamimamsa|Apta-Mimāmsā]]), which has had the largest number of commentaries written on it by later Jain logicians.

* [[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya]] (1624–1688) – Jain logician and one of the last intellectual giants to contribute to Jain philosophy. He specialised in ''Navya-Nyāya'' and wrote Vrttis (commentaries) on most of the earlier ''Jain Nyāya'' works by Samantabhadra, Akalanka, Manikyanandi, Vidyānandi, Prabhācandra and others in the then-prevalent ''Navya-Nyāya'' style. Yaśovijaya has to his credit a prolific literary output – more than 100 books in [[Sanskrit]], [[Prakrit]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].
