The '''Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam''' ('''CDHRI''') is a declaration of the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) adopted in [[Cairo]], Egypt, on 5 August 1990,<ref name = Brems>{{cite book | last = Brems | first = E | isbn = 90-411-1618-4 | title = Human rights: universality and diversity: Volume 66 of International studies in human rights | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2001 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=INlkqsHpIFEC&pg=PA241 241–84] | chapter = Islamic Declarations of Human Rights }}</ref> (Conference of [[Foreign Minister]]s, 9–14 [[Muharram]] 1411H in the [[Islamic calendar]]<ref name="Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam at hrlibrary.umn.edu">[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html University of Minnesota, Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]</ref>) which provides an overview on the [[Islamic]] perspective on [[human rights]], and affirms Islamic [[sharia]] as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be "general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights".

This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted in 1948. It guarantees some, but not all, of the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the OIC to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the sharia. Because of this limit, the CDHRI has been criticized as an attempt to shield OIC member states from international criticism for human rights violations, as well as for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], justifying [[corporal punishment]] and allowing discrimination against non-Muslims and women.

==History==
Various [[Muslim countries]] had criticized the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries.<ref>National Review Online, [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs-david-g-littman Human Rights and Human Wrongs], David G. Littman, January 19, 2003, retrieved 30 May, 2012</ref> In 1981, Said Rajaie-Khorassani—the post-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] Iranian representative to the UN—articulated the position of his country regarding the UDHR, by saying that it was a [[Moral relativism|relativistic]] "[[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing Islamic law.<ref name="Midstream">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205577/human-rights-and-human-wrongs/david-g-littman|title=Universal Human Rights and 'Human Rights in Islam'|work=Midstream}}</ref>

The CDHRI was adopted in 1990 by members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. It has been signed by 45 states so far.<ref>Anver M. Emon, Mark Ellis, Benjamin Glahn: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3hpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA113 Islamic Law and International Human Rights Law] p. 113. Oxford University Press, 2012.</ref> In 1992, the CDHRI was presented to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]], where it was strongly condemned by the [[International Commission of Jurists]].

==Contents==
The Declaration <ref name="Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam at hrlibrary.umn.edu"/> starts by saying "All human beings form one family whose members are united by their subordination to Allah and descent from Adam." and it forbids "discrimination on the basis of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Skin colour|colour]], [[language]], [[belief]], [[sex]], [[religion]], [[political affiliation]], [[social status]] or other considerations". It goes on to proclaim the [[sanctity of life]], and declares the "preservation of human life" to be "a duty prescribed by the Shariah". The CDHRI also guarantees non-belligerents—such as old men, [[women and children]], the wounded and sick, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]—the [[right to food]], shelter, and access to safety and medical treatment in times of war.

The CDHRI affords women "equal human dignity", "own rights to enjoy", "duties to perform", "own civil entity", "financial independence", and the "right to retain her name and lineage". Both men and women are given the "right to marriage" regardless of their race, colour, or nationality. The Declaration makes it incumbent upon both parents to protect the child, both before and after birth, while stressing that the [[Gender roles in Islam|husband is responsible]] for the social and financial protection of his family, including any children and wives.

The Declaration recognises the [[Right to property|rights to property]] and [[right to privacy|privacy]] for the individuals.<ref name="RuleGreenleaf2010">{{cite book|last1=Rule|first1=James B.|last2=Greenleaf|first2=G. W.|title=Global Privacy Protection: The First Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2I2Lrf1BeYC&pg=PA45|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84844-512-3|page=45}}</ref><ref name="Baderin2003"/> The Article 18 (b) says that "Everyone shall have the right to privacy in the conduct of his private affairs, in his home, among his family, with regard to his property and his relationships. It is not permitted to spy on him, to place him under surveillance or to besmirch his good name. The State shall protect him from arbitrary interference".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html |title=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> It forbids the [[demolition]] and [[confiscation]] of any family's residence and the [[eviction]] of the family.<ref name="Baderin2003">{{cite book|last=Baderin|first=Mashood A.|title=International Human Rights and Islamic Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RHRCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PP141|date=11 September 2003|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-102182-4|page=141}}</ref> Furthermore, should the family be separated in times of [[Islam and war|war]], it is the responsibility of the [[Sovereign state|state]] to "arrange visits or reunions of families".

Article 10 of the Declaration states: "Islam is the religion of unspoiled nature. It is [[Haram|prohibited]] to exercise any form of [[Al-Baqara 256|compulsion]] on man or to exploit his [[Islam and poverty|poverty]] or ignorance in order to convert him to another religion or to [[Atheism and Islam|atheism]]." Since in Islamic society all reasons for conversion away from Islam are considered to be essentially either compulsion or ignorance, this effectively forbids conversion away from Islam {{Citation needed|reason=examples?|date=May 2019}}.

The Declaration protects each individual from [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[torture]], maltreatment, or indignity. Furthermore, no individual is to be used for medical or scientific experiments without his consent or at the risk of his health or of his life. It also prohibits the taking of hostages of any individual "for any purpose whatsoever". Moreover, the CDHRI guarantees the [[presumption of innocence]]; guilt is only to be proven through a trial in "which he [the defendant] shall be given all the guarantees of defence". The Declaration also forbids the promulgation of "emergency laws that would provide executive authority for such actions". Article 19 stipulates that there are no other crimes or punishments than [[Hudud#Punishments|those mentioned in the sharia]]. Sharia allows corporal punishment (whipping, amputation) and [[capital punishment]] by [[Stoning#In Islam|stoning]] or [[Beheading in Islam|decapitation]].<ref>There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Schari’a.</ref> The right to hold public office can only be exercised in accordance with the sharia.<ref>Smith (2003), p. 195</ref>

The Declaration also emphasizes the "full right to freedom and self-determination", and its opposition to [[Slavery in Islam|enslavement]], oppression, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and [[Muslim conquests|colonialism]]. The CDHRI declares the [[rule of law]], establishing "equality and justice for all", [[Fiqh|with the limitations provided under Islamic law]]. The CDHRI also guarantees all individuals the "right to participate, directly or indirectly in the administration of his country's public affairs". The CDHRI also forbids any abuse of authority "subject to the Islamic Shariah."

Article 22(a) of the Declaration states that "Everyone shall have the right to [[Freedom of speech|express his opinion freely]] in such manner as would not be contrary to the principles of the Shariah." Article 22(b) states that "Everyone shall have the right to advocate what is right, and propagate what is good, and warn against what is wrong and evil according to the norms of Islamic Shariah." Article 22(c) states: "Information is a vital necessity to society. It may not be exploited or misused in such a way as may violate sanctities and the dignity of Prophets, undermine moral and ethical values or disintegrate, corrupt or harm society, or weaken its faith." This is an explicit restriction on the freedom to make any statement which might be considered blasphemous, the penalty for the making of which might be death and as such the wording of this clause allows the death penalty for blasphemy in clear contravention of the UDHR.     Article 22(d) states that "It is not permitted to arouse nationalistic or doctrinal hatred or to do anything that may be an incitement to any form of racial discrimination."

===Religious features===
{{further|Human rights in the Quran}}
Although the CDHRI uses a [[Universalism|universalist]] language akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "quite a number of [its] features express an Islamic particularity."<ref name = Brems/> The preamble is mostly religious rhetoric, and the particulars of the CDHRI contain numerous references to the [[Quran]], sharia, and aspects of the Islamic faith that appear on no other similar international list.<ref name = Brems/> The CDHRI concludes in Articles 24 and 25 that all rights and freedoms mentioned are subject to the Islamic sharia, which is the declaration's sole source.<ref>[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, Aug. 5, 1990, U.N. GAOR], World Conf. on Hum. Rts., 4th Sess., Agenda Item 5, U.N. Doc.
A/CONF.157/PC/62/Add.18 (1993)</ref> The CDHRI declares true religion to be the "guarantee for enhancing such dignity along the path to human [[integrity]]". It also places the responsibility for defending those rights upon the entire [[Ummah]].

==Criticism==
{{See also|Criticism of Sharia law|Human rights in Islamic countries|Application of sharia law by country|Islam and violence}}

The CDHRI has been criticized for being implemented by a set of states with widely disparate religious policies and practices who had "a shared interest in disarming international criticism of their domestic human rights record."<ref name = Brems/>

Article 24 of the declaration states: "All the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic Sharia." Article 19 also says: "There shall be no crime or punishment except as provided for in the Sharia."<ref name="Farouh2002">{{cite book | last = Kazemi | first = F | chapter = Perspectives on Islam and Civil Society | title = Islamic Political Ethics: Civil Society, Pluralism and Conflict |editor= Hashmi SH | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-691-11310-6 | page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=5LmXFpnp_bMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false 50] }}</ref>

The CDHRI has been criticised for failing to guarantee [[freedom of religion]], in particular the right of each and every individual to [[Apostasy in Islam|change their religion]], as a "fundamental and non-derogable right".<ref name="Farouh2002"/> In a joint written statement submitted by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU), a [[non-governmental organization]] in special [[consultative status]], the Association for World Education (AWE) and the Association of World Citizens (AWC), a number of concerns were raised that the CDHRI limits human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression. The statement concludes that "The Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam is clearly an attempt to limit the rights enshrined in the UDHR and the International Covenants. It can in no sense be seen as complementary to the Universal Declaration."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|title=The Cairo Declaration and the Universality of Human Rights|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031135736/http://www.iheu.org/node/3162|archive-date=2008-10-31}}</ref> In September 2008, in an article to the United Nations, the [[Center for Inquiry]] writes that the CDHRI "undermines equality of persons and freedom of expression and religion by imposing restrictions on nearly every human right based on Islamic Sharia law."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/newsroom/cfi_defends_freedom_of_expression_at_the_un_human_rights_council/|title=CFI Defends Freedom of Expression at the U.N. Human Rights Council}}</ref>

[[Rhona Smith]] writes that, because of the CDHRI's reference to Shariah, it implies an inherent degree of superiority of men.<ref name="Smith2003">Rhona, Smith. ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84174-301-1}}, p. 195</ref>

[[Adama Dieng]]—a member of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]—has also criticised the CDHRI. He argued that the declaration gravely threatens the inter-cultural consensus on which the international human rights instruments are based; that it introduces intolerable discrimination against non-Muslims and women. He further argued that the CDHRI reveals a deliberately restrictive character in regard to certain fundamental rights and freedoms, to the point that certain essential provisions are below the legal standards in effect in a number of Muslim countries; it uses the cover of the "Islamic sharia (Law)" to justify the legitimacy of practices, such as corporal punishment, which attack the integrity and dignity of the human being.<ref name="Midstream"/><ref>{{Citation

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the United Nations that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters—in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."<ref>Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.</ref>
