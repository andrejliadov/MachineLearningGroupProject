<section begin="women-in-philosophy-intro" />Although men have generally dominated philosophical discourse, women have been [[philosopher]]s throughout the history of the discipline. [[Ancient philosophy|Ancient]] examples include [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active {{circa|325 BCE}}) and [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th centuries BCE). Some women philosophers were accepted during the [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]] and [[Modern philosophy|modern]] eras, but none became part of the [[Western canon]] until the [[Contemporary philosophy|20th and 21st century]], when some sources indicate that [[Susanne Langer]], [[G.E.M.

In [[ancient philosophy]] in Asia, women made many vital contributions. In the oldest text of the ''[[Upanishads]]'', c. 700 BCE, the female philosophers [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargi]] and [[Maitreyi]] are part of the philosophical dialogues with the sage [[Yajnavalkya]]. [[Ubhaya Bharati]] (c. 800 AD) and [[Akka Mahadevi]] (1130–1160) are other known female thinkers in the Indian philosophical tradition.<ref name="aeon.co">{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/before-the-canon-the-non-european-women-who-founded-philosophy|title=Before the canon: the non-European women who founded philosophy – Dag Herbjørnsrud {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> In China, [[Confucius]] hailed the female [[Jing Jiang of Lu]] (5th c. BCE) as being wise and an example for his students, while [[Ban Zhao]] (45–116) wrote several vital historical and philosophical texts. In Korea, [[Im Yunjidang]] (1721–93) were among the most notable women philosophers during the enlightened mid-Chosŏn era. Among notable female Muslim philosophers are [[Rabia of Basra]] (714–801), [['A'isha al-Ba'uniyya|A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah]] of Damascus (d. 1517), and [[Nana Asma’u|Nana Asma'u]] (1793–1864) from the Sokoto Caliphate of today's Nigeria. In early colonial Latin-America, the philosopher [[Juana Inés de la Cruz|Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–95) was known as "The Phoenix of America".

In ancient Western philosophy, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Edith Stein]] (1891-1942), [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), [[Mary Midgley]] (1919–2018), [[Philippa Foot]] (1920–2010), [[Mary Warnock]] (1924–2019), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) [[Martha Nussbaum]] (born 1947) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

<section begin=Canon/>In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], producing more female academics.

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].<ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/>  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.<ref>Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/>.

In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." <ref name="theatlantic.com"/> The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." <ref name="theatlantic.com"/> Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].<ref name="theatlantic.com"/> Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."<ref name="theatlantic.com"/> Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."<ref name="theatlantic.com"/> ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]].

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref> In the Aeon essay "First women of philosophy" in December 2018, the global historian of ideas [[Dag Herbjørnsrud]] writes about the many women philosophers of the [[Global South]], and concludes: "Philosophy was once a woman’s world, ranging across Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.<ref name="Wider1986">K.

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] philosopher whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.<ref name="Duran2006">{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}</ref>

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].<ref>Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)</ref>

*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen]] (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,<ref>Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.</ref> she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|website=www.nobelprize.org}}</ref> Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').<ref name="weop">''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.<ref>Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.</ref> Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.<ref>Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.</ref> She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American philosopher and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x| s2cid = 220985631 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4<346::aid-jhbs2300150408>3.0.co;2-z| pmid = 11608236 }}</ref> James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." <ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.<ref name="Voices">{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|url=https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre/page/122 122–134]|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}</ref> Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], philosopher, [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===

[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:

*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher of mind]] and of [[philosopher of art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one's world.<ref name="gardner1">{{Citation|author=Howard Gardner|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|chapter-url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm|author-link=Howard Gardner}}</ref>
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[existentialist]] philosopher, political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]

*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."<ref>Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.<!-- isbn needed --></ref> Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[existentialist]] philosopher, political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].<ref name="plato.stanford">Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/>.</ref> De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".<ref name="Haldane">{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G.

*[[Mary Midgley]] (1919-2018) was an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. Midgley was a senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], and is known today for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argued, wholly inadequate. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"<ref name=brown2001>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}</ref>
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] Philosophy|philosopher, most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American philosopher noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.

*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”<ref name="nas.org" /> In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.<ref name="nas.org" /> In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”<ref name="nas.org" />

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".<ref name="nas.org" /> Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."<ref name="nas.org" />

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.<ref name="berkeley.edu" />

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.<ref name="theguardian.com" /> She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." <ref name="theguardian.com" /> Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.<ref name="theguardian.com" />

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."<ref name="insidehighered.com" /> On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions.

Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.<ref name="salon.com" /> In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.<ref name="insidehighered.com" /> Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." <ref name="ReferenceC" /> Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." <ref name="ReferenceC" /> In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".<ref name="insidehighered.com" />
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."<ref name="insidehighered.com" />

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|website=www.apaonline.org}}</ref>
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
Nana Asma'u (1793-1864), from the Sokoto Caliphate in today's Nigeria, is one of many notable black women philosophers. She was a founder of the educational network ''Yan Taru'' (‘The Associates’), which is still active today. She wrote in the Fulfulde, Hausa and Arabic languages, and her first text had the title: ‘Warning for the Negligent and Reminder for the Intelligent Regarding the Ways of the Pious’. She argued for humility between people, and for "good relations with one’s relatives, servants, and comrades. This is shown by being cheerful with them; doing good things for them; serving them; never acting as if superior to them; consulting them in many matters; helping them financially and physically [...]"<ref name="aeon.co" />

[[Phillis Wheatley]] and [[Ida B. Wells]] are other notable women thinkers of African and African-American background in the 19th century.

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." <ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy?

McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."<ref name="newappsblog.com">L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html</ref>  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."<ref name="newappsblog.com" />

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]]. In 2018, [[Mpho Tshivhase]] became the first black woman in [[South Africa]] to complete a PhD in philosophy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewn.co.za/2018/04/24/dr-mpho-tshivhase-is-sa-s-first-black-woman-to-earn-phd-in-philosophy|title=Dr Mpho Tshivhase is SA's first black woman to earn PhD in philosophy|last=News|first=Eyewitness|website=ewn.co.za|language=en|access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy}}</ref> that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.<ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/> Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."<ref>NCES (2000), previously cited.</ref>
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).<ref>NCES (1997), previously cited.</ref> The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.<ref>NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."</ref> Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.<ref>NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."</ref> Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.<ref>[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

==Organizations and campaigns==

=== Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) ===
Minorities and Philosophy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/|title=Home|website=Minorities and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> (MAP) is an international movement of graduate and undergraduate students and faculty members in philosophy working on issues related to “the underrepresentation of women an minorities in philosophy.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.marcsandersfoundation.org/programs/minorities-and-philosophy/|title=Minorities and Philosophy {{!}} Marc Sanders Foundation|work=Marc Sanders Foundation|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}</ref> MAP consists of chapters at universities around the world, and the format can vary from school to school. However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school's philosophy department. MAP's short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report}}</ref> increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

===Committee on the Status of Women (American Philosophical Association) ===

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.<ref name="apaonlinecsw.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}</ref> It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}</ref> In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".<ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com">{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}</ref> At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.<ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/>

===Society for Women in Philosophy===
The [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] is a group created in 1972 that seeks to support and promote women in philosophy. It has a number of branches around the world, including in New York, the American Pacific, the United Kingdom and Canada.<ref>SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html</ref> Each year, the society names one philosopher the distinguished woman philosopher of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html|title=Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)|website=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog}}</ref>

===Gendered Conference Campaign===
The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias against women in philosophy...."<ref>[http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ Gendered Conference Campaign " Feminist Philosophers].

In [[ancient philosophy]] in Asia, women made many vital contributions. In the oldest text of the ''[[Upanishads]]'', c. 700 BCE, the female philosophers [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargi]] and [[Maitreyi]] are part of the philosophical dialogues with the sage [[Yajnavalkya]]. [[Ubhaya Bharati]] (c. 800 AD) and [[Akka Mahadevi]] (1130–1160) are other known female thinkers in the Indian philosophical tradition.<ref name="aeon.co">{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/before-the-canon-the-non-european-women-who-founded-philosophy|title=Before the canon: the non-European women who founded philosophy – Dag Herbjørnsrud {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> In China, [[Confucius]] hailed the female [[Jing Jiang of Lu]] (5th c. BCE) as being wise and an example for his students, while [[Ban Zhao]] (45–116) wrote several vital historical and philosophical texts. In Korea, [[Im Yunjidang]] (1721–93) were among the most notable women philosophers during the enlightened mid-Chosŏn era. Among notable female Muslim philosophers are [[Rabia of Basra]] (714–801), [['A'isha al-Ba'uniyya|A’ishah al-Ba’uniyyah]] of Damascus (d. 1517), and [[Nana Asma’u|Nana Asma'u]] (1793–1864) from the Sokoto Caliphate of today's Nigeria. In early colonial Latin-America, the philosopher [[Juana Inés de la Cruz|Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–95) was known as "The Phoenix of America".

In ancient Western philosophy, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Edith Stein]] (1891-1942), [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), [[Mary Midgley]] (1919–2018), [[Philippa Foot]] (1920–2010), [[Mary Warnock]] (1924–2019), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) [[Martha Nussbaum]] (born 1947) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].<ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/>  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.<ref>Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N.

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|website=independent.co.uk}}</ref> In the Aeon essay "First women of philosophy" in December 2018, the global historian of ideas [[Dag Herbjørnsrud]] writes about the many women philosophers of the [[Global South]], and concludes: "Philosophy was once a woman’s world, ranging across Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]].

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] philosopher whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.<ref name="Duran2006">{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}</ref>

*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience.

*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her [[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen]] (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,<ref>Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.</ref> she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|website=www.nobelprize.org}}</ref> Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').<ref name="weop">''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.<ref>Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.</ref> Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.<ref>Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.</ref> She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American philosopher and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x| s2cid = 220985631 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4<346::aid-jhbs2300150408>3.0.co;2-z| pmid = 11608236 }}</ref> James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." <ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.<ref name="Voices">{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|url=https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/voicesofrevoluti0000stre/page/122 122–134]|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}</ref> Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], philosopher, [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===

[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:

*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher of mind]] and of [[philosopher of art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one's world.<ref name="gardner1">{{Citation|author=Howard Gardner|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|chapter-url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm|author-link=Howard Gardner}}</ref>
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[existentialist]] philosopher, political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]

*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."<ref>Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.<!-- isbn needed --></ref> Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[existentialist]] philosopher, political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].<ref name="plato.stanford">Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/>.</ref> De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".<ref name="Haldane">{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G.

*[[Mary Midgley]] (1919-2018) was an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. Midgley was a senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], and is known today for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposed [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argued, wholly inadequate. She wrote extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"<ref name=brown2001>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}</ref>
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] Philosophy|philosopher, most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American philosopher noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.

*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”<ref name="nas.org" /> In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.<ref name="nas.org" /> In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”<ref name="nas.org" />

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".<ref name="nas.org" /> Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."<ref name="nas.org" />

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.<ref name="berkeley.edu" />

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.<ref name="theguardian.com" /> She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." <ref name="theguardian.com" /> Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.<ref name="theguardian.com" />

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."<ref name="insidehighered.com" /> On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions.

Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.<ref name="salon.com" /> In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.<ref name="insidehighered.com" /> Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." <ref name="ReferenceC" /> Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." <ref name="ReferenceC" /> In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".<ref name="insidehighered.com" />
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."<ref name="insidehighered.com" />

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|website=www.apaonline.org}}</ref>
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
Nana Asma'u (1793-1864), from the Sokoto Caliphate in today's Nigeria, is one of many notable black women philosophers. She was a founder of the educational network ''Yan Taru'' (‘The Associates’), which is still active today. She wrote in the Fulfulde, Hausa and Arabic languages, and her first text had the title: ‘Warning for the Negligent and Reminder for the Intelligent Regarding the Ways of the Pious’. She argued for humility between people, and for "good relations with one’s relatives, servants, and comrades. This is shown by being cheerful with them; doing good things for them; serving them; never acting as if superior to them; consulting them in many matters; helping them financially and physically [...]"<ref name="aeon.co" />

[[Phillis Wheatley]] and [[Ida B. Wells]] are other notable women thinkers of African and African-American background in the 19th century.

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." <ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy?

McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."<ref name="newappsblog.com">L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html</ref>  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."<ref name="newappsblog.com" />

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]]. In 2018, [[Mpho Tshivhase]] became the first black woman in [[South Africa]] to complete a PhD in philosophy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ewn.co.za/2018/04/24/dr-mpho-tshivhase-is-sa-s-first-black-woman-to-earn-phd-in-philosophy|title=Dr Mpho Tshivhase is SA's first black woman to earn PhD in philosophy|last=News|first=Eyewitness|website=ewn.co.za|language=en|access-date=2019-01-02}}</ref>

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref> with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy}}</ref> that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.<ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/> Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."<ref>NCES (2000), previously cited.</ref>
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).<ref>NCES (1997), previously cited.</ref> The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.<ref>NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."</ref> Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.<ref>NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."</ref> Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.<ref>[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

==Organizations and campaigns==

=== Minorities and Philosophy (MAP) ===
Minorities and Philosophy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/|title=Home|website=Minorities and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> (MAP) is an international movement of graduate and undergraduate students and faculty members in philosophy working on issues related to “the underrepresentation of women an minorities in philosophy.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.marcsandersfoundation.org/programs/minorities-and-philosophy/|title=Minorities and Philosophy {{!}} Marc Sanders Foundation|work=Marc Sanders Foundation|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}</ref> MAP consists of chapters at universities around the world, and the format can vary from school to school. However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school's philosophy department. MAP's short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report}}</ref> increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

===Committee on the Status of Women (American Philosophical Association) ===

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.<ref name="apaonlinecsw.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}</ref> It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}</ref> In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".<ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com">{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}</ref> At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.<ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/>

===Society for Women in Philosophy===
The [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] is a group created in 1972 that seeks to support and promote women in philosophy. It has a number of branches around the world, including in New York, the American Pacific, the United Kingdom and Canada.<ref>SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html</ref> Each year, the society names one philosopher the distinguished woman philosopher of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html|title=Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)|website=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog}}</ref>

The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias against women in philosophy...."<ref>[http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ Gendered Conference Campaign " Feminist Philosophers].
