The '''Italian School''' of [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]] was in Italy or [[Magna Graecia]] in the 6th century BC. The Italian School included such thinkers as [[Pythagoras]], [[Parmenides of Elea]], [[Zeno of Elea]], and [[Empedocles]]. [[Diogenes Laertius]] divides pre Socratic philosophy into the [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian]] and Italian School.<ref>https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-concept-of-presocratic-philosophy-its-origin-development-and-significance/</ref>  Pythagoras traveled from [[Samos]] to Croton, beginning the separation from the earlier Ionian schools.
