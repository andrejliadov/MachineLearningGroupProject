An '''aporime''' is a problem difficult to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it may not be, in itself, impossible.

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἄπορον}}'', which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative ''α'', and ''{{lang|grc|πόρος}}'', "passage". When a question was proposed to any of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially of the sect of [[Academists]], if he could not give a solution, his answer was ''{{lang|grc|ἀποροῶ}}'', q.d. "I do not conceive it; I cannot see through it; I am not able to clear it up."
