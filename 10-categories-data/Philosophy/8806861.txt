{{About| the application of philosophical ontology |the term in computer science|ontology (computer science)}}

'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web|Semantic Web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.<ref>{{cite news

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}</ref> the works of Heidegger, and others.<ref>

==Ontological perspectives==
Social scientists adopt a number of ontological approaches.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raddon|first1=Arwen|title=Epistemology & Ontology in Social Science Research|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/colleges/ssah/documents/research-training-presentations/EpistFeb10.pdf|website=le.ac.uk/|publisher=University of Leicester|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>  Some of these are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Research Methodology: Ontology|url=https://research-methodology.net/research-philosophy/ontology/|website=Research Methodologies|publisher=research-methodology.net|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>
# [[Scientific realism|Realism]] - the idea that facts are "out there" just waiting to be discovered;
# [[Empiricism]] - the idea that we can observe the world and evaluate those observations in relation to facts;
# [[Positivism]] - which focuses on the observations themselves, attentive more to claims about facts than to facts themselves;
# [[Grounded theory]] - which claims to derive theories from facts;
# [[Engaged theory]] - which moves across different levels of interpretation, linking different empirical questions to ontological understandings;<ref>{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In â€”Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}</ref>
# [[Postmodernism]] - which regards facts as fluid and elusive, and recommends focusing only on observational claims.
