{{Nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell'''''|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai|"Mobile Armored Riot Police"|lead=yes}} is a [[Seinen manga|''seinen'' manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Masamune Shirow]], which spawned the [[Ghost in the Shell|media franchise of the same name]]. The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of ''The Ghost in the Shell'', was later published in one ''[[tankōbon]]'' volume by [[Kodansha]]. Set in the mid-21st-century, it tells the story of the fictional counter-[[cyberterrorist]] organization [[Public Security Section 9]], led by protagonist Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]]. ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' was the sequel work which follows the story of Motoko after merging with the Puppeteer. The last volume, ''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'', contains four separate cases.

The books contain Shirow's thoughts on design and philosophy, including sociological issues, the consequences of technological advances and themes on the nature of consciousness and identity. Several artbooks have been released to detail the concept art and the world of ''Ghost in the Shell''. All three volumes have received mainly positive reviews.

==Setting==
Primarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of {{nihongo|Niihama, Niihama Prefecture|新浜県新浜市|Niihama-ken Niihama-shi}},<ref group=Note>The real world [[Niihama, Ehime|Niihama]] is located in [[Ehime Prefecture]], and its name is written differently in Japanese.</ref> otherwise known as {{nihongo|New Port City|ニューポートシティ|Nyū Pōto Shiti}}, the manga and the many [[anime]] adaptations follow the members of [[Public Security Section 9]], a special-operations task-force made up of former military officers and police detectives. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.

In this [[cyberpunk]] iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of [[prostheses]], with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a [[cyborg]]. The heroine of ''Ghost in the Shell'', Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required that she use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]]s, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.

==Story==
{{Main article|List of Ghost in the Shell characters}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell'''''|攻殻機動隊 THE GHOST IN THE SHELL|Kōkaku Kidōtai za Gōsuto in za Sheru|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: The Ghost in the Shell''}} begins in 2029, and features Section 9, led by Chief [[Daisuke Aramaki]] and Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], as they investigate the Puppeteer, a cyber-criminal wanted for committing a large number of crimes by proxy through "ghost hacking" humans with cyberbrains. As the investigation continues, Section 9 discovers that the Puppet Master is actually an advanced [[artificial intelligence]] created by a department of the Japanese government, taking up residence in a robot body. After destroying the latest host of the Puppeteer, Section 9 believes all is well, until the Major discovers the Puppet Master in her own mind. After hearing the Puppeteer's wishes to reach its next step in evolution, Kusanagi allows it to become one with her own ghost. After this event, the Major leaves Section 9 to work as a private contractor, with the remaining members of the unit, [[Batou]], [[Togusa]], Ishikawa, Saito, Paz, Borma and Azuma, continuing their work as covert operatives, occasionally meeting up with the Major in her various guises. These stories were later collected under the name {{nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'''''|攻殻機動隊 HUMAN-ERROR PROCESSOR|Kōkaku Kidōtai Hyūman Erā Purosessā|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: Human-Error Processor''}}. In 2035, the Major, now known as Motoko Aramaki, works as a security expert for Poseidon Industrial, now an entity composed of multiple identities that she controls via the network in other prosthetic bodies that attack industrial spies, assassins, and cyber-hackers, solving various crimes, while still at her day job. However, a psychic investigator finds something dangerous emerging as the teachings of a professor of artificial intelligence fall into the wrong hands and attempt to intermingle with the Major's current evolving sense of self. These stories are collected under the title {{nihongo|'''''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'''''|攻殻機動隊 MAN-MACHINE INTERFACE|Kōkaku Kidōtai Manmashīn Intāfēsu|lit. ''Mobile Armored Riot Police: Man-Machine Interface''}}.

== Creation and development ==
While writing the manga, Masamune Shirow struggled to make it neither too complex nor too simple.<ref name="MS-interview">{{cite web |title= An Interview with Masamune Shirow |url= http://www.jai2.com/MSivu.htm |publisher= Frederick L. Schodt |accessdate= December 8, 2012 |archive-date= September 16, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170916085221/http://www.jai2.com/MSivu.htm |url-status= live }}</ref> Two official names exist for the works, the first is {{nihongo3|officially "''Armored Shell''"; literally "''Mobile Armored Riot Police''"|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}} and the second is "''Ghost in the Shell''". Masamune Shirow originally wanted to use the name "''Ghost in the Shell''" for the publication, as an homage to [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]'', from which he drew inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' Official Log 1|page=9|publisher=[[Weekly Young Magazine]]|year=2003}}</ref> Kōichi Yuri, First Coordinator at ''Young Magazine'', requested a "more flashy" name and Shirow came up with {{nihongo3|Shell Squad|攻殻機動隊|Kōkaku Kidōtai}}. Shirow requested that "Ghost in the Shell" be included on the title even if it was in small print. Yuri believes that ''Kōkaku Kidōtai'' is the mainstream title while "Ghost in the Shell" is the theme. While most Japanese publications use both names, the original publication in ''Young Magazine'' used ''Kōkaku Kidōtai''.<ref name=log>{{cite AV media |year=2003 |title=攻殻機動隊 STAND ALONE COMPLEX Official Log ①|trans-title=Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Official Log 1 |medium=DVD |language=ja }}</ref>

When developing ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'', Shirow initially wanted to use a new title by changing the last [[kanji]] character meaning {{nihongo|"military unit"|隊|tai}}, to the homophonic kanji for {{nihongo|"body"|体|tai}} so that it would literally translate {{nihongo|"Mobile Unit Body Entity"|攻殻機動体|Kōkaku Kidōtai}}, but eventually he decided not to do so.<ref name= "Gits2 notes">{{cite book |last=Shirow |first=Masamune |author-link=Masamune Shirow |title=Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface |year=2001 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Japan |isbn=4-06-336310-4 |volume=11}}</ref> The production of ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' manga was done digitally, which was difficult for Shirow because of troubles including a hard disk failure which resulted in the loss of 16 gigabytes of data, USB hardware troubles and reading manuals related to new application upgrades. Shirow considers the manga a completely different kind of work and not a true sequel of ''Ghost in the Shell''. The original manga revolved around Public Security Section 9 and ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' follows what happens to the Major after she merges with the Puppeteer. Shirow drew the color pages on computer, in which he states was difficult to due to technical issues with his computer. In the "short-cut" version of the manga, Masamune Shirow made the color darker and softer, but used more contrasting colors in the "standard" version.<ref name="MS-interview-2">{{cite web |title= Web Interview Masamune Shirow |url= http://kukaku.free.fr/interview/kodanclub.com.html |publisher= Kukaku.free.fr |accessdate= December 19, 2012 |archive-date= August 17, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120817014841/http://kukaku.free.fr/interview/kodanclub.com.html |url-status= live }}</ref> In the Japanese "Short-cut" version, further changes can be found, most notably an increase in nudity and pornographic scenes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kukaku.free.fr/differences/009.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 29, 2020 |archive-date=January 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124234439/http://kukaku.free.fr/differences/009.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Design and philosophy===

Shirow's thoughts and work on ''Ghost in the Shell'' contain numerous footnotes and detailed explanations about scenes to give readers an understanding of the sociological differences or technological advances and philosophical discussion of the material. Examples include concepts like the future of hacking techniques, in which a cyberbrain can be hacked to copy information without being detected. Shirow explains instances of spirit channeling in cyborgs with kiko energy. Shirow even wrote that this phenomenon may be related to the "hearing voices" in individuals that suffer from mental disabilities like schizophrenia. This belief is represented in Motoko's reasons for head hunting Togusa for Section 9.<ref name="dh1">{{cite book | title=Ghost in the Shell | publisher=Dark Horse | author=Masamune, Shirow | year=1995}}</ref> Shirow also notes that he believes these channelers do not speak with a human-like god, but instead tap into a phase of the universe which synchronizes with the channeler's functions. Other philosophical stances are represented such as Shirow's personal beliefs regarding [[death sentence]]s and crime and punishment.<ref name="dh1"/>

Shirow explains numerous facets of the daily life throughout his notes in ''Ghost in the Shell''. Cyborgs are shown consuming food, but Shirow noted that early in the development would have been pills or paste substance that would have both psychological and physical functions. The Fuchikoma robots also must consume in a sense, requiring replenishment of fluid for their neurochips every two months, but Fuchikoma are not entirely bio-robots. Shirow discussed in his notes how the family of Yano received notification of his death and what would be disclosed, but also notes strategic use and premature notifications exist for various purposes. The advancement of technology in Shirow's vision of the future is rapid, but the advancements are at least partially related to then-current technology. The concepts of a 3-D viewing room was based on "crude" golf simulator technology.<ref name="dh1" />

Other personal beliefs of Shirow are represented in the scenes and author's commentary, such metaphysics, religious references, and other philosophical stances that enter a range of topics including his thoughts on a rotating universe.<ref name="dh1" />

===Censorship===
The removal of a two-page lesbian sex scene in [[Studio Proteus]]'s localization of ''Ghost in the Shell'' was not well received, with readers reacting negatively to the removal of the previously uncensored content that was included in the original Dark Horse release. Toren Smith commented on Studio Proteus's actions claiming that requirement of the "Mature Readers Only" would translate into a 40% loss in sales and likely have caused the immediate cancellation of the series. Shirow, who grew tired of "taking flak" over the pages, opted to remove them and reworked the previous page as necessary.<ref name=Toren>{{cite web | url=http://www.sazan.net/digest/news/toren.shtml | title=Toren Smith on Manga Censorship | accessdate=April 29, 2013 | archive-date=January 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111165454/http://www.sazan.net/digest/news/toren.shtml | url-status=live }}</ref>

The sequel volume ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' also featured pornographic scenes and an increase in nudity in the  "Short-cut" version in Japan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kukaku.free.fr/differences.shtml |title=The differences between the two editions of Man Machine Interface: The Solid Box version, or Short-cut and The Standard version. |access-date=May 29, 2020 |archive-date=January 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124192057/http://kukaku.free.fr/differences.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> No such scenes were included in any of the Western versions.
