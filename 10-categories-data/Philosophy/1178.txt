The '''afterlife''' (also referred to as '''life after death''' or '''the world to come''' or '''[[reincarnation]])''' is an existence in which, some believe, the [[essence|essential part]] of an individual's [[Personal identity|identity]] or their [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] continues to have after the [[death]] of their physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an [[individual]], which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].

In some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].

Some belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life.

==Different metaphysical models==
[[Theists]] generally believe some afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no existence after death.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam, and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

===Reincarnation===
{{main|Reincarnation}}
Reincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C.

Although the majority of denominations within the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Kabbalah]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],<ref>Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

===Heaven and Hell===
{{Main|Heaven|Hell}}
[[Heaven]], the heavens, [[seven heavens]], [[pure land]]s, [[Tian]], [[Jannah]], [[Valhalla]], or [[the Summerland]], is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[jinn]], [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].

In [[Hinduism]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death – Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=9 March 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].

[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],<!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--> while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.<!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--> Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].

Traditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.

==Ancient religions==

===Ancient Egyptian religion===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}
The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.<ref>Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}</ref>

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999}}</ref> If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].<ref>Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82</ref>

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".<ref>Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238</ref><ref>Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11</ref>

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.<ref>Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96</ref>

On 30 March 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=meeja.com.au |date=30 March 2010 |access-date=30 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archive-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> a powerful adviser to the [[18th Dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].

===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===
{{main|Greek underworld}}
The Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.<ref>F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, "Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).</ref> The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.<ref>Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&nbsp;49–51</ref>

[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the [[Fields of Punishment]]. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.<ref>Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&nbsp;68–70</ref>

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.<ref>N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147</ref>

In Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

===Baháʼí Faith===
{{Main|Baháʼí Faith on life after death}}
The teachings of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the [[womb]]. The [[Baháʼí literature|Baháʼí writings]] state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it finally attains [[God in the Baháʼí Faith|God's presence]].<ref>[[Baháʼu'lláh]], [[Gleanings from the Writings of Baháʼu'lláh]], ed. by US Baháʼí Publishing Trust, 1990, pp. 155-156.</ref> In Baháʼí belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their [[Marriage|spouses]].<ref name="PSmith">{{cite encyclopedia|last= Smith|first= Peter|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith|title= burial, "death and afterlife", evil, evil spirits, sin|year= 2000|publisher= Oneworld Publications|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6|pages= [https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/96 96–97, 118–19, 135–36, 322–23]|url= https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/96}}</ref>

The Baháʼí scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baháʼí view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.<ref name="PSmith"/>

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian eschatology|Heaven in Christianity|Christian views on hell|Intermediate state}}
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
[[Mainstream Christianity]] professes belief in the [[Nicene Creed]], and [[English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use]] include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."

When questioned by the [[Sadducees]] about the [[resurrection of the dead]] (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), [[Jesus]] said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the [[angels]] in heaven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2022:23-33;&version=47; |title=Matthew 22:23–33 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the [[Son of God]], and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PXD.HTM |title=The New American Bible |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

The [[Book of Enoch]] describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.<ref>[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1956. p. 276.</ref> The Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 056.jpg|right|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]'s ''Inferno'': a Christian vision of hell]]
The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about God and the angels versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]].

The non-canonical [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of [[prayer for the dead]], so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla] 8:5</ref>

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures the [[underworld]] ([[Hades]]) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.<ref>He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphasis added)—Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527235028/http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp |date=27 May 2007 }}</ref>

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun [[Purgatory|"purgatorium"]] (Latin: place of cleansing<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory "purgatory"]. The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 6 June 2007.</ref>) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref> was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.<ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org">{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg Foundation, 2000)}}</ref> His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as [[marriage]] in heaven (where all [[angels]] are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), [[time]] and [[space]] in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the [[eternity]] of [[Hell]] (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.<ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"/>

====The Catholic Church====
The "Spiritual Combat", a written work by [[Lorenzo Scupoli]], states that four assaults are attempted by the "evil one" at the hour of death.<ref>http://stjudetheapostleparish.org/pdf/books/spiritual_combat.pdf#page35</ref> The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that [[Particular judgment|after the body dies, the soul is judged]], the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

=====Limbo=====
{{main|Limbo}}
Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo – definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

=====Purgatory=====
{{main|Purgatory}}
The notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.<ref>Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=22 July 2011 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=4746355&content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613074435/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=4746355&content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&notoc=1 |date=13 June 2016 }}</ref>

====Orthodox Christianity====
The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one's final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative."<ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011">[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud & Michael Hardin, 230–52 (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2011), 245.]</ref>

Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience."<ref name="Andrew P. Klager 2011"/> For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners ... [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability."<ref>St. Isaac the Syrian, "Homily 28," In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.</ref> In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.

Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19–21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God's mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives... . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."<ref>Fr. Thomas Hopko, "Foreword," in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.</ref>

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 CE) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Clément]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].<ref>[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P. Klager, "Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion," In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud & Michael Hardin, 230–52 (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2011), 251.]</ref> Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a [[wikt:theologoumenon#English|theologoumenon]], it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection.  As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,"<ref>Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.</ref> as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}
[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]
[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19–25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18–20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived – Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial. (1 Cor 15:44–42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) [[Son of perdition (Mormonism)|Sons of Perdition]], or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of [[Satan]], which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]</ref> However, according to Mormon faith, since most persons lack the amount of knowledge to commit the [[Eternal sin]], they are incapable of becoming sons of perdition.<ref>[[Spencer W. Kimball]]: The Miracle of Forgivness, p. 123.</ref>

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where the righteous can live eternally with their families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to "True to the Faith" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng | title=Kingdoms of Glory}}</ref>

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as "afterlife"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=1 April 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}</ref> to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168–75}}</ref> Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise.<ref>{{cite book|title=Insight on the Scriptures|volume=2|pages=574–76}}</ref> After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

====Seventh-day Adventists====
[[File:Life And Death Equation.jpg|thumb|Creation and Death Equation]]
The Seventh-day Adventist Church's beliefs regarding the afterlife differ from other Christian churches. Rather than ascend to Heaven or descend to Hell, Adventists believe the dead "remain unconscious until the return of Christ in judgement". The concept that the dead remain dead until resurrection is one of the fundamental believes of Seventh-day Adventist.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The State of the Dead: From Death to Life|url=https://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental-beliefs/restoration/death-and-resurrection/|website=Seventh-day Adventist World Church Official Website}}</ref> Adventists believe that death is an unconscious state (a “sleep”). This is based on Matt. 9:24; Mark 5:39; John 11:11-14; 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; 2 Peter 3:4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10. At death, all consciousness ends. The dead person does not know anything and does not do anything. <ref>{{Cite web|title=From Life to Death: What Really Happens When You Die?|url=https://www.adventist.org/articles/waking-up-to-eternity/|website=Seventh-day Adventist World Church Official Website}}</ref> They believe that death is creation, only in reverse. Ecclesiastes 12:7. When a person dies, the body turns to dust again, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave it. The spirit of every person who dies—whether saved or unsaved—returns to God at death. The spirit that returns to God at death is the breath of life. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Are the Dead Really Dead?|url=https://www.amazingfacts.org/media-library/study-guide/e/4987/t/are-the-dead-really-dead-|website=Amazing Facts}}</ref>

===Islam===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|An artist's representation of "Muhammed's Paradise". A [[Persian miniature]] from ''The History of Mohammed'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.]]
[[File:Idris the prophet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]] is shown the afterlife places by an [[Angels in Islam|angel]]. In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]
{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah|Punishment of the Grave}}
The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or "[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah" over and over again to acquire good deeds, all for the cause to reach absolute beliefe to elevate the spiritual entity that will find its creator (source). This ultimate goal is recited in one of the most prominent verses in Quraan, the first Sura in the Quraan, named Alfateha in the 5th verse "Ehdina al serata al mostaqeem" meaning "guide us to the straight path", and the following verses follows describing this path as "The way of those on whom you have bestowed your grace, not the way of those who earned your anger, nor of those who went astray".

In the Quran, Allah gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),<ref>{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}</ref> and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with god.<ref>{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}</ref>

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship God alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life, including animals, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it Hell or Paradise in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and eight levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting places during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be judged by God and assigned between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&_pos=1 |title=Afterlife – Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=6 May 2008 |access-date=8 March 2014|last1=Smith |first1=Jane Idleman |last2=Haddad |first2=Yvonne |isbn=978-0-19-515649-2 }}</ref>

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will come to an end and God will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?").

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by God according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will go to Hell.

In Islam, Believers are those who believed in oneness of God and did not associate any partners with him or did not give the attributes of God to any other entity. It is an established belief that if a believer goes to hell for his sins being greater than his good deeds, he will not remain in hell forever. When punishment for his sins will be over, God will forgive him and grant him heaven.

Quran 4:48 says "Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin".

====Ahmadiyya====
[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] religion, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=978-1-85372-562-3| year=1997 }}</ref>

====Sufi====
The Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or "isthmus." It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.<ref name="Ibn Al-Arabi 2006 29n, 50n, 59, 64–68, 73, 75–78, 82, 102">{{cite book|last=Ibn Al-Arabi|first=Muhyiddin|title=The Universal Tree and The Four Birds|year=2006|publisher=Anqa Publishing|pages=29n, 50n, 59, 64–68, 73, 75–78, 82, 102|editor=Angela Jaffray}}</ref>

===Judaism===
{{main|Jewish eschatology}}

====Sheol====
[[Sheol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness (Job x. 21, 22) to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, (Gen. xxxvii. 36; Ezek. xxxii.; Isa. xiv.; Job xxx. 23), a place of stillness, (Ps. lxxxviii. 13, xciv. 17; Eccl. ix. 10), at the longest possible distance from heaven, (Job xi. 8; Amos ix. 2; Ps. cxxxix. 8).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13563-sheol|title=SHEOL - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.<ref>{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}</ref> Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).<ref>{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205–06}}</ref>

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC – 70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.<ref name="Longenecker 2003 189">{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}</ref> When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word "[[Hades]]" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.<ref name="Longenecker 2003 189"/>

====World to Come====
The [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal [[damnation]]", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref> This is also part of [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|Maimonides' 13 principles of faith]].<ref name="perek-helek-c">Maimonides' Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>

[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESOJDwAAQBAJ&q=maimonides+olam+haba&pg=PA178|title=Jewish Views of the Afterlife|last=Paull Raphael|first=Simcha|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2019|isbn=9781538103463|pages=177–180}}</ref>

====Reincarnation in Jewish tradition====
Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings,<ref>Saadia Gaon in Emunoth ve-Deoth Section vi</ref> according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,<ref name="youtube.com">{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}</ref> the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.<ref name="youtube.com"/>

[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5–10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi – Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=17 December 2009 |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die&nbsp;..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29, 30)."<ref>{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation " Ask! " Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=12 July 2003 |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref>

Reincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.<ref>Martin Buber, "Legende des Baalschem" in ''Die Chassidischen Bücher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''</ref>

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include [[Yonassan Gershom]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}</ref> and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."<ref>{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

Buddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=978-0-585-03949-7 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}</ref> The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hindu eschatology}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings & deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

The soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in "[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only & only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus,
<blockquote>
"Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2R9gBmnnqMC&q=%22Do+you+believe+that+you+are+the+doer+of+the+action.+No.+You+are+merely+an+instrument+in+MY+hands.+Do+you+believe+that+the+people+in+front+of+you+are+living&pg=PA164|title=Heaven Hell Or?|last=Sabir|first=N.|year=2010|isbn=9781453550120|pages=164}}</ref></blockquote>

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] also believes in the afterlife. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref>

===Sikhism===
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2014}}

The essential doctrine of [[Sikhism]] is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.<ref>http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf</ref>

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'' and in ''[[Dasam Granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1248308791&ucat=7 | title=Sikhism: What happens after death?}}</ref>

===Traditional African religions===
[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. [[Hunter-gatherer]] societies such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]] have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bond|first1=George C.|editor1-last=Obayashi|editor1-first=Hiroshi|title=Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions|date=1992|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-313-27906-5|pages=3–18|chapter=Living with Spirits: Death and Afterlife in African Religions|quote=The entire process of death and burial is simple, without elaborate rituals and beliefs in an afterlife.

===Shinto===
{{further|Shinto#Afterlife}}
It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a [[Japanese funeral|Buddhist funeral]] at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.

===Unitarian Universalism===
Some [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=13 June 2004 |access-date=8 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archive-date=6 November 2015 }}</ref> Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.<ref>Mark W.

===Spiritualism===
According to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.<ref name="Afterlife">{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=978-1841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84181-449-0}}</ref>

Mainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.<ref name="Afterlife"/>

===Wicca===
The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.<ref>''Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own'' p. 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock (2005)</ref>

===Zoroastrianism===
{{main|Frashokereti}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Zoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).

[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

Misvan Gatu is the "place of the mixed ones" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

==Parapsychology==
{{Main|Parapsychology}}

The [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].<ref>David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife. A comprehensive overview of the evidence.</ref> 

A [[21 grams experiment|study]] conducted in 1901 by physician [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]] sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the [[soul]] "departed the body" upon death.<ref>{{cite book | last = Roach | first = Mary | title = Spook – Science Tackles the Afterlife | publisher = W. W. Norton & Co. | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-393-05962-5}}</ref> MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] – Reference Page (Soul man).</ref> The title of the 2003 movie ''[[21 Grams]]'' is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Park|first=Robert Ezra|title=Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science|page=90|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-14597-6}}</ref>

[[Frank Tipler]] has argued that [[physics]] can explain immortality, although such arguments are not [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] and, in [[Karl Popper]]'s views, they do not qualify as science.<ref>{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality – Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-385-46799-5}}</ref>

===Mediumship===
There are [[mediumship|mediums]] who claim to have contacts to deceased people like [[Tyler Henry]], [[Pascal Voggenhuber]] and many more.

===Near death research===
{{See also|Near-death studies|Near death experience}}
Research also includes the study of the near death experience. Scientists who have worked in this area include [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]], [[Raymond Moody]], [[Sam Parnia]], [[Michael Sabom]], [[Bruce Greyson]], [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]], [[Jeffrey Long]], [[Susan Blackmore]], [[Charles Tart]], [[William James]], [[Ian Stevenson]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Pim van Lommel]], [[Penny Sartori]], [[Walter van Laack]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profezie3m.altervista.org/archivio/TheLancet_NDE.htm |title=Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands |publisher=Profezie3m.altervista.org |access-date=8 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7463606.stm | access-date = 6 August 2008 | work=BBC News | title=Nurse writes book on near-death | date=19 June 2008}}</ref>

==Philosophy==

===Modern philosophy===
There is a view based on the philosophical question of [[personal identity]], termed [[open individualism]] by [[Daniel Kolak]]. It concludes that individual conscious experience is illusory, and because consciousness continues after death in all conscious beings, ''you'' do not die. This position has been supported by notable physicists such as [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Freeman Dyson]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | url = https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-1-4020-3014-7 | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1-4020-2999-8}}</ref>

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. [[Peter van Inwagen]], in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc|title=I Look for the Resurrection of the Dead and the Life of the World to Come |author=Peter van Inwagen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012631/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/Resurrection.doc |archive-date=10 June 2007}}</ref> [[John Hick]] also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, ''Death and Eternal Life'' using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

===Process philosophy===
In the [[panentheistic]] model of [[process philosophy]] and theology the writers [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]] rejected that the universe was made of [[Matter|substance]], instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in [[God]], who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as [[David Ray Griffin]] have written that people may have subjective experience after death.<ref>Charles Hartshorne, Omnipotence and Other Theological Mistakes (Albany: State University of New York, 1984) p.&nbsp;32–36</ref><ref>David Griffin, "The Possibility of Subjective Immortality in Whitehead's Philosophy," in The Modern Schoolman, LIII, November. 1975, pp.&nbsp;39–51.</ref><ref>[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=3040&C=2598 What Is Process Theology? by Robert B.

{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Vera|last2=Faísca|first2=Luís|last3=de Sá-Saraiva|first3=Rodrigo|title=Immortality of the Soul as an Intuitive Idea: Towards a Psychological Explanation of the Origins of Afterlife Beliefs|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=1|page=121|doi=10.1163/156853712X633956|url=http://sapientia.ualg.pt/bitstream/10400.1/4894/1/Immortality%20of%20the%20soul%20as%20an%20intuitive%20idea.%20Towards%20a%20psychological%20explanation%20of%20the%20origins%20of%20afterlife%20beliefs.pdf|hdl=10400.1/4894}}</ref> In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Misailidi|first1=Plousia|last2=Kornilaki|first2=Ekaterina N|title=Development of Afterlife Beliefs in Childhood: Relationship to Parent Beliefs and Testimony|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=April 2015|volume=61|issue=2|pages=290–318|issn=0272-930X|doi=10.13110/merrpalmquar1982.61.2.0290|s2cid=143761107}}</ref>
 
In 2008, a large-scale study conducted by the University of Southampton involving 2060 patients from 15 hospitals in the United Kingdom, United States and Austria was launched. The AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation) study examined the broad range of mental experiences in relation to death. In a large study, researchers also tested the validity of conscious experiences for the first time using objective markers, to determine whether claims of awareness compatible with out-of-body experiences correspond with real or hallucinatory events.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2014/10/07-worlds-largest-near-death-experiences-study.page |title=Results of world's largest Near Death Experiences |date=7 October 2014 |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> The results revealed that 40% of those who survived a cardiac arrest were aware during the time that they were clinically dead and before their hearts were restarted. One patient also had a verified out-of-body experience (over 80% of patients did not survive their cardiac arrest or were too sick to be interviewed), but his cardiac arrest occurred in a room without markers. Dr. Parnia in the interview stated, "The evidence thus far suggests that in the first few minutes after death, consciousness is not annihilated."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://bioethics.georgetown.edu/2015/07/consciousness-after-clinical-death-the-biggest-ever-scientific-study-published/ |title=Consciousness after clinical death. The biggest ever scientific study published |access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref> The study continues in AWARE II, which is set to be completed in September 2020.
 
Studies have also been done on the widely reported phenomenon of [[Near Death Experiences]]. Experiencers commonly report being transported to a different “realm” or “plane of existence” and they have been shown to display a lasting positive aftereffect on most experiencers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyson | first1 = Bruce | year = 2003 | title = Near-Death Experiences in a Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic Population | journal = Psychiatric Services | volume = 54 | issue = 12| pages = 1649–1651 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.54.12.1649 | pmid = 14645808 }}</ref>
