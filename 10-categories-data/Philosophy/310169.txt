'''Indian philosophy''' refers to philosophical traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A traditional classification divides [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] ([[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]) and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] ([[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]]) schools of philosophy, depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the [[Vedas]] as a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; and whether the school believes in afterlife and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].<ref>John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}</ref><ref name="andrew"/>

There are six major schools of orthodox (astika) Indian [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]], and  five major heterodox (nastika) schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ajivika]], [[Ajñana]], and [[Charvaka]]. However, there are other methods of classification; [[Vidyaranya]] for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.<ref name="cowell">Cowell and Gough, p. xii.</ref><ref name="nicholson">Nicholson, pp. 158-162.</ref>

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Yoga]], Śaiva and [[Vedanta]] survived, but others, like [[Ajñana]], [[Charvaka]] and [[Ājīvika]] did not.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Indian philosophies include extensive discussions on [[ontology]] ([[metaphysics]], [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[Sunyata]]-[[Anatta]]), reliable means of knowledge ([[epistemology]], [[Pramana]]s), value system ([[axiology]]) and other topics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy W.

Indian philosophies share many concepts such as [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[samsara]], [[reincarnation]], [[dukkha]], [[renunciation]], [[meditation]], with almost all of them focussing on the ultimate goal of liberation of the individual through diverse range of spiritual practices ([[moksha]], [[nirvana]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper |title=The Culture of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC |year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-61530-149-2 |pages=174–178 }}</ref> They differ in their assumptions about the nature of existence as well as the specifics of the path to the ultimate liberation, resulting in numerous schools that disagreed with each other.

==Orthodox schools==

[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|left|Hindu philosophy has a diversity of traditions and numerous saints and scholars, such as Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta school.]]
Many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] intellectual traditions were classified during the medieval period of Brahmanic-Sanskritic scholasticism into a standard list of six orthodox ([[Astika]]) schools ([[Hindu philosophy|darshana]]s), the "Six Philosophies" (''{{IAST|ṣaḍ-darśana}}''), all of which accept the testimony of the [[Vedas]].<ref>Flood, op. cit., p. 231–232.</ref><ref>Michaels, p. 264.</ref>{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

* [[Vedanta]] (also called Uttara Mimamsa), the [[Upanishad]]ic tradition, with many sub-schools ranging from dualism to nondualism.<ref>JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), [[Oxford University Press]], page 107-108</ref><ref>Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251;<br />R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347</ref>

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyaya-Vaishesika, Samkhya-Yoga, and Mimamsa-Vedanta. The Vedanta school is further divided into six sub-schools: [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] ([[monism]]/[[nondualism]]), also includes the concept of [[Ajativada]], [[Visishtadvaita]] (monism of the qualified whole), [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]), [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism-nondualism), [[Suddhadvaita]], and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] schools.

Besides these schools Mādhava Vidyāraṇya also includes the following of the aforementioned theistic philosophies based on the Agamas and Tantras:<ref name="cowell"/>

* [[Pasupata]], school of Shaivism by Nakulisa
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva]], the theistic Sankhya school
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], the recognitive school
* [[Raseśvara]], the mercurial school
* [[Pāṇini]] Darśana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of [[Sphoṭa]])

The systems mentioned here are not the only orthodox systems, they are the chief ones, and there are other orthodox schools. These systems, accept the authority of [[Vedas]] and are regarded as orthodox ([[astika]]) schools of Hindu philosophy; besides these, schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are heterodox (nastika) systems such as Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivika and Charvaka.<ref>Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730</ref>{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}} This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. According to Andrew Nicholson, there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.<ref name="andrew">Andrew J.

==Heterodox (Śramaṇic schools)==
{{Main|Śramaṇa}}
Several [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic movements]] have existed before the 6th century BCE, and these influenced both the [[āstika and nāstika]] traditions of Indian philosophy.<ref name=reginaldray247>Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249</ref> The [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] gave rise to diverse range of heterodox beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, [[atomism]], antinomian ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, strict [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and vegetarianism to permissibility of violence and meat-eating.<ref>Padmanabh S Jaini (2001), Collected papers on Buddhist Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817760}}, pages 57-77</ref> Notable philosophies that arose from [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic]] movement were [[Jainism]], [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]], Charvaka, [[Ajñana]] and [[Ājīvika]].<ref>AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 94-103</ref>

===Ajñana philosophy===
{{Main|Ajñana}}
Ajñana was one of the nāstika or "heterodox" schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and the ancient school of radical Indian skepticism. It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were sophists who specialised in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.

===Jain philosophy===
{{Main|Jain philosophy|Jainism}}
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rishabhanatha]], believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the founder of Jain philosophy.]]

[[Jain]] philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body ([[matter]]) from the [[soul]] (consciousness) completely.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/dravya|title=dravya – Jainism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> [[Jainism]] was revived and re-established after [[Mahavira]], the last and the 24th ''[[Tirthankara]]'', synthesised and revived the philosophies and promulgations of the ancient Śramaṇic traditions laid down by the first Jain tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha]] millions of years ago.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&pg=PA271 |title = Thoughts from the Cosmic Field in the Life of a Thinking Insect &#91;A Latter-Day Saint&#93;|isbn = 9781606938461|last1 = Patel|first1 = Haresh|date = March 2009}}</ref> According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the Mahavira as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BC, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BC.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}

Jainism is a Śramaṇic religion and rejected the authority of the Vedas. However, like all [[Indian religions]], it shares the core concepts such as karma, ethical living, rebirth, samsara and moksha. Jainism places strong emphasis on [[asceticism]], [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[anekantavada]] (relativity of viewpoints) as a means of spiritual liberation, ideas that influenced other Indian traditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield |author2=William Edelglass |title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532899-8 |pages=168 }}</ref> 
Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation. According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of [[Ratnatraya]], that are Samyak Darshan, Samyak Gnana, and Samyak Chàritra which are the key requisites to attain liberation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Das|first=Ravish Kumar|title=Jainism and Jain Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=2018|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-387-50342-1|page=4}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Early Buddhism}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|The Buddhist philosophy is based on the teachings of the [[Buddha]].]]
Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought which started with the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], [[Buddhahood|the Buddha]], or "awakened one". Buddhism is founded on elements of the [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]], which flowered in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, but its foundations contain novel ideas not found or accepted by other Sramana movements. Buddhism and Hinduism mutually influenced each other and shared many concepts, states Paul Williams, however it is now difficult to identify and describe these influences.<ref name=williams84>{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3FuzkBnOxAC |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25057-8 |pages=84–85 }}</ref> Buddhism rejected the Vedic concepts of [[Brahman]] (ultimate reality) and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) at the foundation of Hindu philosophies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Neville |editor=Jeremiah Hackett|others=Jerald Wallulis|title= Philosophy of Religion for a New Century: Essays in Honor of Eugene Thomas Long|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEER8fGxCfMC |year=2004|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2073-5 |pages=257 }}, Quote: "[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada.

Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon."</ref>

Buddhism shares many philosophical views with other Indian systems, such as belief in ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'' – a cause-and-effect relationship, [[samsara]] – ideas about cyclic afterlife and rebirth, [[dharma]] – ideas about ethics, duties and values, [[impermanence]] of all material things and of body, and possibility of spiritual liberation ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian K.

===Ājīvika philosophy===
{{Main|Ājīvika}}
The philosophy of Ājīvika was founded by [[Makkhali Gosala]], it was a [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].<ref>Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199</ref> Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete monastic communities prone to an ascetic and simple lifestyle.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=145-146}}

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} The Ājīvika school is known for its ''Niyati'' doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}<ref name="james22"/> Ājīvika considered the [[karma]] doctrine as a fallacy.<ref name="philtarajiv"/> Ājīvikas were atheists<ref>Johannes Quack (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199644650}}, page 654</ref> and rejected the authority of the [[Vedas]], but they believed that in every living being is an ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.<ref>Analayo (2004), Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization, {{ISBN|978-1899579549}}, pages 207-208</ref>{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=240-261, 270-273}}

===Charvaka philosophy===
{{Main|Charvaka}}
Charvaka or Lokāyata was a philosophy of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] and [[materialism]], founded in the [[Mauryan]] period. They were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Charvaka deemed Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology.<ref name="page4">Cowell and Gough, p. 4</ref> Likewise they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of [[Nirvana|liberation]], [[reincarnation]] and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through karma.<ref>Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna. [http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/08/materialism-in-india-synoptic-view.html Materialism in India: A Synoptic View]. Retrieved 27 July 2012.</ref> They believed that, the viewpoint of relinquishing pleasure to avoid pain was the "reasoning of fools".<ref name="page4"/>

==Comparison of Indian philosophies==
The Indian traditions subscribed to diverse philosophies, significantly disagreeing with each other as well as orthodox Hinduism and its six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) to asserting that there is no soul,<ref name=5sources/> from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth to asserting that there is no rebirth.<ref name=collins>{{cite book|author1=Randall Collins|title=The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=199–200|isbn=9780674001879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&pg=PA199}}</ref>

==Political philosophy==
The [[Arthashastra]], attributed to the [[Mauryan]] minister [[Chanakya]], is one of the early Indian texts devoted to [[political philosophy]]. It is dated to 4th century BCE and discusses ideas of statecraft and economic policy.

The political philosophy most closely associated with modern India is the one of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[Satyagraha]], popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian struggle for independence]]. In turn it influenced the later independence and [[civil rights movement]]s, especially those led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]'s  [[Progressive Utilization Theory]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sarkar, Prabhatranjan - Banglapedia|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sarkar,_Prabhatranjan|access-date=2020-10-13|website=en.banglapedia.org}}</ref> is also a major socio-economic and political philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Thomas|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe/page/136 136]}}</ref>

==Influence==
In appreciation of complexity of the Indian philosophy, [[T. S.

'''Indian philosophy''' refers to philosophical traditions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A traditional classification divides [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] ([[Āstika and nāstika|āstika]]) and [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] ([[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]]) schools of philosophy, depending on one of three alternate criteria: whether it believes the [[Vedas]] as a valid source of knowledge; whether the school believes in the premises of [[Brahman]] and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; and whether the school believes in afterlife and [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]].<ref>John Bowker, ''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger |title=On Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8vRAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-936008-6|page=46}}</ref><ref name="andrew"/>

There are six major schools of orthodox (astika) Indian [[Hindu philosophy]]—[[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]], and  five major heterodox (nastika) schools—[[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Ajivika]], [[Ajñana]], and [[Charvaka]]. However, there are other methods of classification; [[Vidyaranya]] for instance identifies sixteen schools of Indian philosophy by including those that belong to the [[Shaivism|Śaiva]] and [[Raseśvara]] traditions.<ref name="cowell">Cowell and Gough, p. xii.</ref><ref name="nicholson">Nicholson, pp. 158-162.</ref>

The main schools of Indian philosophy were formalised chiefly between 1000 BCE to the early centuries of the [[Common Era]]. Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BCE and 200 CE. Some schools like [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Yoga]], Śaiva and [[Vedanta]] survived, but others, like [[Ajñana]], [[Charvaka]] and [[Ājīvika]] did not.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Indian philosophies include extensive discussions on [[ontology]] ([[metaphysics]], [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], [[Sunyata]]-[[Anatta]]), reliable means of knowledge ([[epistemology]], [[Pramana]]s), value system ([[axiology]]) and other topics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy W.

Indian philosophies share many concepts such as [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[samsara]], [[reincarnation]], [[dukkha]], [[renunciation]], [[meditation]], with almost all of them focussing on the ultimate goal of liberation of the individual through diverse range of spiritual practices ([[moksha]], [[nirvana]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper |title=The Culture of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC |year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-61530-149-2 |pages=174–178 }}</ref> They differ in their assumptions about the nature of existence as well as the specifics of the path to the ultimate liberation, resulting in numerous schools that disagreed with each other.

==Orthodox schools==

[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|left|Hindu philosophy has a diversity of traditions and numerous saints and scholars, such as Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta school.]]
Many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] intellectual traditions were classified during the medieval period of Brahmanic-Sanskritic scholasticism into a standard list of six orthodox ([[Astika]]) schools ([[Hindu philosophy|darshana]]s), the "Six Philosophies" (''{{IAST|ṣaḍ-darśana}}''), all of which accept the testimony of the [[Vedas]].<ref>Flood, op. cit., p. 231–232.</ref><ref>Michaels, p. 264.</ref>{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}}

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyaya-Vaishesika, Samkhya-Yoga, and Mimamsa-Vedanta. The Vedanta school is further divided into six sub-schools: [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] ([[monism]]/[[nondualism]]), also includes the concept of [[Ajativada]], [[Visishtadvaita]] (monism of the qualified whole), [[Dvaita]] ([[Dualistic cosmology#In Hinduism|dualism]]), [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism-nondualism), [[Suddhadvaita]], and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] schools.

Besides these schools Mādhava Vidyāraṇya also includes the following of the aforementioned theistic philosophies based on the Agamas and Tantras:<ref name="cowell"/>

* [[Pasupata]], school of Shaivism by Nakulisa
* [[Shaiva Siddhanta|Saiva]], the theistic Sankhya school
* [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijña]], the recognitive school

* [[Pāṇini]] Darśana, the grammarian school (which clarifies the theory of [[Sphoṭa]])

The systems mentioned here are not the only orthodox systems, they are the chief ones, and there are other orthodox schools. These systems, accept the authority of [[Vedas]] and are regarded as orthodox ([[astika]]) schools of Hindu philosophy; besides these, schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are heterodox (nastika) systems such as Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivika and Charvaka.<ref>Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88</ref><ref>Sushil Mittal & Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730</ref>{{Sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}} This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. According to Andrew Nicholson, there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.<ref name="andrew">Andrew J.

==Heterodox (Śramaṇic schools)==
{{Main|Śramaṇa}}
Several [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic movements]] have existed before the 6th century BCE, and these influenced both the [[āstika and nāstika]] traditions of Indian philosophy.<ref name=reginaldray247>Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195134834}}, pages 237-240, 247-249</ref> The [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] gave rise to diverse range of heterodox beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, [[atomism]], antinomian ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, strict [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and vegetarianism to permissibility of violence and meat-eating.<ref>Padmanabh S Jaini (2001), Collected papers on Buddhist Studies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120817760}}, pages 57-77</ref> Notable philosophies that arose from [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇic]] movement were [[Jainism]], [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]], Charvaka, [[Ajñana]] and [[Ājīvika]].<ref>AL Basham (1951), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812048}}, pages 94-103</ref>

===Ajñana philosophy===
{{Main|Ajñana}}
Ajñana was one of the nāstika or "heterodox" schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and the ancient school of radical Indian skepticism. It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were sophists who specialised in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.

===Jain philosophy===
{{Main|Jain philosophy|Jainism}}
[[File:Photo of lord adinath bhagwan at kundalpur.JPG|thumb|left|[[Rishabhanatha]], believed to have lived over a million years ago, is considered the founder of Jain philosophy.]]

Jainism is a Śramaṇic religion and rejected the authority of the Vedas. However, like all [[Indian religions]], it shares the core concepts such as karma, ethical living, rebirth, samsara and moksha. Jainism places strong emphasis on [[asceticism]], [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[anekantavada]] (relativity of viewpoints) as a means of spiritual liberation, ideas that influenced other Indian traditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay L. Garfield |author2=William Edelglass |title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0iMBtaSlHYC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-532899-8 |pages=168 }}</ref> 
Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation. According to the Jain philosophy, the world (''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|Saṃsāra]]'') is full of ''hiṃsā'' (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of [[Ratnatraya]], that are Samyak Darshan, Samyak Gnana, and Samyak Chàritra which are the key requisites to attain liberation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Das|first=Ravish Kumar|title=Jainism and Jain Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4K9GDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA4|year=2018|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-387-50342-1|page=4}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

===Buddhist philosophy===
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy|Early Buddhism}}
[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|upright=0.85|The Buddhist philosophy is based on the teachings of the [[Buddha]].]]
Buddhist philosophy is a system of thought which started with the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], [[Buddhahood|the Buddha]], or "awakened one". Buddhism is founded on elements of the [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]], which flowered in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE, but its foundations contain novel ideas not found or accepted by other Sramana movements. Buddhism and Hinduism mutually influenced each other and shared many concepts, states Paul Williams, however it is now difficult to identify and describe these influences.<ref name=williams84>{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3FuzkBnOxAC |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25057-8 |pages=84–85 }}</ref> Buddhism rejected the Vedic concepts of [[Brahman]] (ultimate reality) and [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) at the foundation of Hindu philosophies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Neville |editor=Jeremiah Hackett|others=Jerald Wallulis|title= Philosophy of Religion for a New Century: Essays in Honor of Eugene Thomas Long|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEER8fGxCfMC |year=2004|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-2073-5 |pages=257 }}, Quote: "[Buddhism's ontological hypotheses] that nothing in reality has its own-being and that all phenomena reduce to the relativities of pratitya samutpada.

Buddhism shares many philosophical views with other Indian systems, such as belief in ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'' – a cause-and-effect relationship, [[samsara]] – ideas about cyclic afterlife and rebirth, [[dharma]] – ideas about ethics, duties and values, [[impermanence]] of all material things and of body, and possibility of spiritual liberation ([[nirvana]] or [[moksha]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Brian K.

===Ājīvika philosophy===
{{Main|Ājīvika}}
The philosophy of Ājīvika was founded by [[Makkhali Gosala]], it was a [[Śramaṇa|Śramaṇa movement]] and a major rival of [[early Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].<ref>Jeffrey D Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-1845116255}}, page 199</ref> Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete monastic communities prone to an ascetic and simple lifestyle.{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=145-146}}

Original scriptures of the Ājīvika school of philosophy may once have existed, but these are currently unavailable and probably lost. Their theories are extracted from mentions of Ajivikas in the secondary sources of ancient Indian literature, particularly those of Jainism and Buddhism which polemically criticized the Ajivikas.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}} The Ājīvika school is known for its ''Niyati'' doctrine of absolute determinism (fate), the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles.{{sfn|Basham|1951|loc=Chapter 1}}<ref name="james22"/> Ājīvika considered the [[karma]] doctrine as a fallacy.<ref name="philtarajiv"/> Ājīvikas were atheists<ref>Johannes Quack (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199644650}}, page 654</ref> and rejected the authority of the [[Vedas]], but they believed that in every living being is an ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]]'' – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.<ref>Analayo (2004), Satipaṭṭhāna: The Direct Path to Realization, {{ISBN|978-1899579549}}, pages 207-208</ref>{{sfn|Basham|1951|pp=240-261, 270-273}}

===Charvaka philosophy===
{{Main|Charvaka}}
Charvaka or Lokāyata was a philosophy of [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] and [[materialism]], founded in the [[Mauryan]] period. They were extremely critical of other schools of philosophy of the time. Charvaka deemed Vedas to be tainted by the three faults of untruth, self-contradiction, and tautology.<ref name="page4">Cowell and Gough, p. 4</ref> Likewise they faulted Buddhists and Jains, mocking the concept of [[Nirvana|liberation]], [[reincarnation]] and accumulation of [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] or demerit through karma.<ref>Bhattacharya, Ramkrishna. [http://www.carvaka4india.com/2011/08/materialism-in-india-synoptic-view.html Materialism in India: A Synoptic View].

==Comparison of Indian philosophies==
The Indian traditions subscribed to diverse philosophies, significantly disagreeing with each other as well as orthodox Hinduism and its six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. The differences ranged from a belief that every individual has a soul (self, atman) to asserting that there is no soul,<ref name=5sources/> from axiological merit in a frugal ascetic life to that of a hedonistic life, from a belief in rebirth to asserting that there is no rebirth.<ref name=collins>{{cite book|author1=Randall Collins|title=The sociology of philosophies: a global theory of intellectual change|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=199–200|isbn=9780674001879|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2HS1DOZ35EgC&pg=PA199}}</ref>

==Political philosophy==
The [[Arthashastra]], attributed to the [[Mauryan]] minister [[Chanakya]], is one of the early Indian texts devoted to [[political philosophy]]. It is dated to 4th century BCE and discusses ideas of statecraft and economic policy.

The political philosophy most closely associated with modern India is the one of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) and [[Satyagraha]], popularised by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian struggle for independence]]. In turn it influenced the later independence and [[civil rights movement]]s, especially those led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]'s  [[Progressive Utilization Theory]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sarkar, Prabhatranjan - Banglapedia|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sarkar,_Prabhatranjan|access-date=2020-10-13|website=en.banglapedia.org}}</ref> is also a major socio-economic and political philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Thomas|title=Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor|url=https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45657-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/gandhiasdisciple0000webe/page/136 136]}}</ref>

==Influence==
In appreciation of complexity of the Indian philosophy, [[T. S. Eliot|T S Eliot]] wrote that the great philosophers of India "make most of the great European philosophers look like schoolboys".<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew33375.htm |title= The Hidden Advantage of Tradition: On the Significance of T.
