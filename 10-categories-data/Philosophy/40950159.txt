'''Public philosophy''' is a label used for at least two separate philosophical projects. One project often called "public philosophy" is to address issues of public importance through philosophy, especially in the areas of [[public policy]], [[morality]] and [[social issues]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In this conception, public philosophy is a matter of content, not style.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} It must concern certain philosophical issues, but may be undertaken in any venue.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}   The second project often called public philosophy is to engage in philosophy in public venues. This view  is exemplified by the ''Essays in Philosophy'' special issue on public philosophy (Volume 15, issue 1, 2014), which defined public philosophy as "doing philosophy with general audiences in a non-academic setting".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Jack Russell | year = 2014 | title = Public Philosophy: Introduction | journal = Essays in Philosophy | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.7710/1526-0569.1485 }}</ref> Public philosophy, in this conception, is a matter of style not content. It must be undertaken in a public venue but might deal with any philosophical issue.

Some public philosophers are academic professionals, but others may work outside of the usual academic contexts of teaching and writing for [[peer-reviewed journals]].

==Perspectives==
According to one of the founders of the Public Philosophy Network, Sharon Meagher, “'public philosophy' is not simply a matter of doing philosophy in public. A truly public philosophy is one that demands that the
philosopher both become a student of community knowledge and reflect on his or her public engagement, recognizing that philosophy can benefit at as much from public contact as can the public benefit from contact with philosophy. The publicly engaged philosopher does not assume that he or she knows the questions in advance, but draws on his or her experiences in the community to
develop and frame questions. Further, publicly engaged philosophy demands accountability on the part of the philosopher to his or her publics—understanding that philosophers are themselves members of those publics."<ref>http://api.ning.com/files/C*75Xw4bA4cU7vHOHS-zlLRmkdBskXa9IzuVBCJKtjhmSgMrQy8tWTu1s9vqumPuG2gyJfaPzwWJ1Tu4*NoJIUVYUXtPpC37/KetteringreportfinalcorrectedFeb2013.pdf</ref>

Philosophers who hold the alternative view, that public philosophy is simply philosophy undertaken in public venues, are engaged in two projects. One of these is to educate the public and the other to engage with the public collaboratively to identify and address public problems. The second approach is often inspired by  [[John Dewey]]'s work on democracy and the need to reconstruct philosophy.<ref>See part two of Volume I of The Essential Dewey: Pragmatism, Education, Democracy edited by Larry A Hickman and Thomas M. Alexander, Bloomington: Indiana University Press.</ref> The two approaches are not exclusive. For instance, philosopher [[Michael J. Sandel]] describes public philosophy as having two aspects. The first is to "find in the political and legal controversies of our day an occasion for philosophy". The second is "to bring moral and political philosophy to bear on contemporary public discourse."<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael J. |last=Sandel |author-link=Michael J.

Ideas in Context series. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. pp. 243-309.</ref> Public philosophy, in some conceptions, is a matter of content rather than style. Public philosophy, in this sense, need not be undertaken in a public venue but must deal with a particular subset of philosophical problems.
