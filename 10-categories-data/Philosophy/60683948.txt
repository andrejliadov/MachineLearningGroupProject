'''Medium Essentialism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that each [[art]]form has its own distinctive [[Artistic medium|medium]], and that the [[essence]] of such an artform is dependent on its particular medium.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=113–115}}</ref> In practice, the theory argues that every artwork should manifest its [[Essentialism|essential]] properties, those which no other artform can employ. The theory relies on the [[presumption]] that every artform has a unique medium, and is divided into two main interpretations. The ‘limitation’ interpretation of Medium Essentialism argues that, due to their medium, some artforms should be constrained in their aspirations. The ‘productive’ interpretation reasons that a work's medium determines what content or style will function best, and that practitioners should pursue ventures aligning with the nature of this chosen medium.<ref name=":0" /> [[Clement Greenberg]] is a prolific medium-essentialist in relation to [[Modernist art|modernist]] [[Visual arts|art]], proposing that artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] are successful because they properly exploit elements of their chosen medium, such as a painting's physical flatness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schreyach|first=Michael|date=Spring 2015|title=Re-created Flatness: Hans Hofmann's Concept of the Picture Plane as a Medium of Expression|url=https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=art_faculty|journal=The Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=49|issue=1|pages=57}}</ref> However, Medium Essentialism was most propagated by [[film]] [[Filmmaker|practitioners]] throughout the twentieth century, as it legitimised [[Cinematography|cinema]] as an artform for the first time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=59}}</ref> Previously, film had been regarded as merely a recorded representation of a written play.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Film History: An Introduction|url=https://archive.org/details/filmhistoryintro00thom_325|url-access=limited|last=Bordwell|first=David|last2=Thompson|first2=Kristin|publisher=McGraw-Hill Company Inc |year=2003|location=New York, USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/filmhistoryintro00thom_325/page/n34 13]}}</ref> It is therefore most discussed today by film theorists, stemming from the work of critics such as [[André Bazin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Donald|date=July 1969|title=Reviewed Work: What Is Cinema? by André Bazin, Hugh Gray|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=3|issue=3|pages=159–161|doi=10.2307/3331711|jstor=3331711}}</ref> Regardless of the interpretation favoured, what constitutes a film's medium, and therefore essential meaning, has been heavily debated,<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Film|last=Livingston|first=Paisley|last2=Plantinga|first2=Carl|publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2012|isbn=9781281838032|pages=205|oclc=830038431}}</ref> and has prompted the creation of several sub-theories. The theory has been widely discussed among contemporary film theorists<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images|url=https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn|url-access=limited|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn/page/n33 23]–24|oclc=1043047181}}</ref> and has featured in the Anthology of the Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd |year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom}}</ref>
 
Whilst Medium Essentialism is not merely a subcategory of the [[Essentialism]] theory,<ref name=":1" /> it is relevant to the notion that certain characteristics are integral to every entity's purpose and [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].<ref name=":10">{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|year=1968|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626 |doi=10.2307/2024315|jstor=2024315}}</ref> [[Non-essentialism]] rejects the existence of such an 'essence'. Non-essentialism has been the view preferred by scholars such as [[Noël Carroll]], criticising Medium Essentialism in relation to film.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd |year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=114}}</ref>

== Dream Medium Essentialism ==
[[File:The-Love-Light-Poster.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Theatrical release poster for [[The Love Light]], a 1921 [[Silent film|silent]] [[drama]] film that [[Susanne Langer|Langer]] argues demonstrates the movement of mainstream film from simple entertainment into an artform.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Reflections on art: a source book of writings by artists, critics, and philosophers|last=Langer|first=Susanne K. |date=1979|publisher=Arno Press|isbn=0405106114|pages=62|oclc=470851789}}</ref>]]
The sub-theory of Dream Medium Essentialism states that a film's essence is dependent upon its medium, adding that a film's medium is to be found in its creator's [[intention]] or ‘dream’.<ref name=":3" /> [[Susanne Langer|Susanne K. Langer]], within her book 'Feeling and Form' posited this idea.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Feeling and Form|last=Langer|first=Susanne|publisher=Pearson|year=1977|isbn=0023675004|pages=4–14}}</ref> Langer reasoned that film had become its own medium through its use of 'the dream mode', or a direct visual portrayal of an artist's intentions and/or imagination. She pinpointed the time during which cinema began to classify itself as an artform as the early 1920s. She cited films such as [[The Love Light]] and [[The Blacksmith]] as demonstrating a shift from practitioners creating humorous entertainment or historically accurate texts, to an expression of artistic intentions that result in film being classified as a "new poetic mode."<ref name=":4" /> Langer stated that, "The most noteworthy formal characteristic of dream" is that the dreamer "is always at the center of it",<ref>{{Cite book |title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=59}}</ref> the dreamer in this case representing a filmmaker. Langer proposed that a film's essence is determined by its medium (Medium Essentialism), and that its medium is determined by the 'dream' of its creator, director or practitioner.

[[Noël Carroll|Noel Carroll]], however, rejects both Medium Essentialism and Langer's definition of a film's medium as constituted by its creator's 'dream'.<ref name=":10" /> Carroll rebukes Langer's statement that the dreamer is 'always at the centre of' the film and that that proves the 'dream' as constituting a film's meaning/essence. He proposes that the "film viewer is not in the center of the array. She is typically off to one side."<ref name=":0" /> However, Livingston proposes that Carroll misreads Langer's argument, when it actually refers to the film creator - not the film consumer.<ref name=":1" /> Carroll also quotes fellow anti-essentialist critic [[Stanley Cavell]], who argues that dreams are often "boring narratives...their skimpy surface out of all proportion with their riddle interest and their effect on the dreamer."<ref>Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 61. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.</ref>

== Photography Medium Essentialism ==
[[Roger Scruton]]'s 'Philosophy of Representation' also agrees with the premise of Medium Essentialism in relation to film.<ref>Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 8. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.</ref> However, he proposes that since a photograph is [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], it cannot constitute the [[essence]] of a work as it cannot express thought about its subject.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images |url=https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn |url-access=limited |last=Sinnerbrink |first=Robert |date=2018|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn/page/n51 41]|oclc=1043047181}}</ref> This argument relies on the presumption that every artform must be defined by an intention or thought, and not merely its physical substance. This perspective posits that the medium and essence of a photo or film-based artwork must be determined non-materially.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Jarvie|first=Ian|date=August 1995 |title=Sir Karl Popper (1902–94): Essentialism And Historicism In Film Methodology|journal=Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television|volume=15|pages=301–305|doi=10.1080/01439689500260181}}</ref> Numerically, his argument is as follows:

# A text's 'essence' must express an opinion regarding its subject.
# Photography is a transparent representation, and cannot express opinion of any sort.
# Film is, at its most essential, a photograph of a dramatic representation, and does not contain opinion.
# The essence of a film cannot lie in its material photography.<ref name=":5" />

Whilst not detailing the place that a film's medium (and therefore essence) should be found in, Scruton's theory rules out any physical location that a film's medium and essence could be found in.<ref>Choi, Jinhee; Carroll, Noel (2005). ''Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology''. Oxford, United Kingdom: John Wiley and Sons Ltd. pp. 8–16. {{ISBN|1405120274}}.</ref> It thereby indirectly supports Dream Medium Essentialism.

=== Balázs' Requirement of Intention ===
[[File:Balázs Béla.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarians|Hungarian]] [[Film criticism|film critic]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthete]] [[Béla Balázs]], c. 1910s. Balázs was a key proponent of the idea that a film's physical material alone cannot constitute its essence or medium.<ref name=":11" />]]
In addition to Scruton's proposition, [[Béla Balázs]] argued that as a film's physical constitution is transparent, it cannot carry any meaning about its content.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Gertrud|last2=Hansen|first2=Miriam|date=1987|title=Bela Balazs: The Physiognomy of Things|journal=New German Critique|issue=40|pages=167–177|doi=10.2307/488137|issn=0094-033X|jstor=488137}}</ref> Balázs proposes, therefore, that an artform's essence must carry an intention about its subject - and this intention cannot be found within a film's photographic or audio elements.<ref name=":11">{{Cite book |title=The Soul of Film Theory|last=Cooper|first=Sarah|year=1971|isbn=9780230365131|pages=57–58|oclc=825047285}}</ref> For example, whilst a musical composition or an oil painting provides an opinion about its subject (due to the intention required by creating an artwork from scratch), a photograph cannot in itself contain artistic intention without additional elements being considered, such as a directorial vision or lighting.

== Editing Medium Essentialism ==
Soviet theorists [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] also concur with Medium Essentialism, adding that a film's medium (and therefore essence) lies in its [[Film editing|editing]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Film, Art, New Media: Museum Without Walls?|last=Dalle Vacche|first=Angela|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1137026132|location=New York, USA|pages=154}}</ref>  Pudovkin's essay 'The Plastic Material' (1929) proposes that the manipulation of [[celluloid]] (or in the twenty-first century, [[digital editing]]) is what defines a film's medium.<ref name=":6" /> This process would involve the physical alteration of photographic material, as well as intellectual engagement with what images a film should contain, in relation to the artistic intention of the filmmaker.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Film, Art, New Media: Museum Without Walls?|last=Dalle Vacche |first=Angela |publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1137026132|location=New York, USA|pages=155–156}}</ref> For example, a work's essence would be constituted by its medium, which is made up of the editing involved in filmwork. This editing, in turn, is fulfilled by physical editing of collected material, as well as a consideration of how that material fits with the overarching intention of the filmmaker. This intention may be related to a plot, or a broader artistic vision.<ref name=":6" /> Concerned with a film's materiality, Pudovkin's interpretation of Medium Essentialism is agreed upon by later publications, including D.N. Rodowick's The Virtual Life of Film (2007), [[Mary Ann Doane|Mary Ann Doane's]] The Emergence of Cinematic Time (2002), and [[Phil Rosen|Phil Rosen's]] Change Mummified (2001).<ref name=":6" />

[[Dziga Vertov|Vertov]] added to this sub-theory, arguing that editing techniques constitute the film's [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system,<ref name=":7">MICHELSON, Annette, and Kevin O’Brien (1985). ''Kino-eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.</ref> which contains the visual and auditory editing that manipulate recorded images - to the extent that they can create a sequence that has a particular outcome for the film holistically, as an artform in itself.<ref name=":7" /> Eisenstein was also a proponent of Editing Medium Essentialism, and within his essay 'Montage of Attractions', reiterated the idea that sound and image editing can be so transformative for the film and the narrative it tells that editing may be considered the essence of a film.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=Walley|first=Jonathan|date=2003|title=The Material of Film and the Idea of Cinema: Contrasting Practices in Sixties and Seventies Avant-Garde Film|journal=October|volume=103|pages=15–30|doi=10.1162/016228703762874197|issn=0162-2870}}</ref> He proposed that montage was the defining characteristic of a film's medium and essence,<ref name=":8" /> which is necessarily brought about by editing. He proposes that montage cannot simply be found in film and other photographic mediums such as Japanese [[Pictogram|pictographic]] writing, but also in natural phenomena like [[human perception]] more generally. Eisenstein claims that the medium of film, and the [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] it contains, is a satisfaction of the human desire for an artform that contains this montage.<ref name=":8" />

== Reality Medium Essentialism ==
[[Stanley Cavell]] proposes that a film's essence is defined by its medium, and that that medium lies partly within a film's portrayal of an illusion of reality, "Not by literally presenting us with a world, but by permitting us to view it unseen […] we are displaced from our natural habitation within it, placed at a distance from it."<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film |url=https://archive.org/details/worldviewedrefle00cave_136 |url-access=limited |last=Cavell |first=Stanley |publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=9780674961968|location=Harvard University, USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldviewedrefle00cave_136/page/n63 40]–41}}</ref> Cavell proposed that a film's medium lies in its projection of reality,<ref>{{Cite book |title=The World Viewed: Reflections on the Ontology of Film|url=https://archive.org/details/worldviewedrefle00cave_136|url-access=limited|last=Cavell|first=Stanley|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1971|isbn=9780674961968|location=Harvard University, USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldviewedrefle00cave_136/page/n189 166]}}</ref> a notion that is heavily contested by scholars such as Noël Carroll, as his argument relies on the premise that a film's value is determined by how well it represents reality for audiences. Cavell has an almost non-essential conception of a film's medium,<ref name=":9" /> yet still subscribes to medium essentialism.<ref name=":2" /> He argues a film's medium lies not within its physical material, but by the way in which it represents reality through an artform's ongoing re-invention.<ref>{{Cite book |title=New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images |url=https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn |url-access=limited |last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441122575|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newphilosophiesf00sinn/page/n38 28]|oclc=1043047181}}</ref> Using the example of a 1975 [[Russian film|Russian]] [[art film]], [[Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]], Cavell proposes that a filmmaker's accurate portrayal of reality from the perspective of a certain protagonist is what constitutes a film's medium, and therefore essence.<ref name=":9" />

== Criticism ==
[[File:Noël_Carroll_(2005).jpg|thumb|[[Noël Carroll]], a prominent [[critic]] of Medium Essentialism in relation to [[film]] (pictured in 2005).]]
Medium Essentialism has been criticised as heavily as it has been praised,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Appreciating the Art of Television: a Philosophical Perspective |last=Nannicelli |first=Ted|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2016|isbn=9781315732633|pages=53|oclc=1009105087}}</ref> with many considering the theory 'narrow'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schreyach|first=Michael|date=Spring 2015|title=Re-created Flatness: Hans Hofmann's Concept of the Picture Plane as a Medium of Expression|url=https://digitalcommons.trinity.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=art_faculty|journal=The Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=49|issue=1|pages=58}}</ref> Most critics of the idea reject the premise that every artform has a distinctive medium which necessarily determines its essence.<ref name=":0" />

[[V. F. Perkins|V.F. Perkins]] was one of the first critics of the theory, who in the 1970s proposed that no one aspect of the film medium (photographic production, specifically) is superior to its counterparts (such as artistic intention or soundtrack).<ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=New Philosophies of Film: Thinking Images|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-1441146199|location=Bloomsbury, UK|pages=21}}</ref>

[[Noël Carroll]] is regarded as the most comprehensive critic of the theory.<ref name=":13" /> His argument, within 'Theorising the Moving Image,' holds that Medium Essentialism is an inaccurate way to evaluate a work - as it requires the distillation of a film to one medium, when a film is constituted by not one, but several mediums. These mediums may include editing, lighting, narrative, photography, colour, and artistic intention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Film and Motion Pictures: An Anthology|last=Choi|first=Jinhee|last2=Carroll|first2=Noel|publisher=John Wiley and Sons Ltd|year=2005|isbn=1405120274|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=68–74}}</ref> The notion of a film as not containing one medium but several, can be interpreted in any number of ways, with some defining medium as an artist's intention and photography, others by audio editing, narrative, and artistic intention. Carroll takes issue with the presumptions held by Medium Essentialism, that each artform holds a unique medium, that that medium determines an arform's essence, and that an artform's content is determined by that medium.<ref>Sinnerbrink, Robert (2011). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. pp. 21. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.</ref> Carroll argues that theorists must "forget the medium"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sankowski|first=Edward|date=Spring 2006|title=Film Studies, the Moving Image, and Noël Carroll|journal=Journal of Aesthetic Education|volume=40|issue=1|pages=104–110|via=JSTOR|doi=10.1353/jae.2006.0009}}</ref> to understand the aesthetic possibilities that film contains, and criticises the essentialist arguments of works such as [[Siegfried Kracauer|Siegfried Kracauer's]] 'Theory of Film', which avoided an exploration of the essence of film, yet still was preoccupied with a film-specific aesthetic as a result of the film medium, and nothing else.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlüpmann|first=Heide|last2=Y. Levin|first2=Thomas|date=Winter 1987|title=Phenomenology of Film: On Siegfried Kracauer's Writings of the 1920s|journal=New German Critique|volume=40|pages=98–99|via=JSTOR}}</ref>

Similarly, [[Robert Sinnerbrink]] within 'New Philosophies of Film: Thinking Images' argues that a film contains a multitude of elements, whilst medium essentialism requires a single, prescriptive and rigid one.<ref name=":2" /> Drawing from ''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]],'' which was the first published consolidation of film theory,<ref>Phil Powrie, Keith Reader (2002). ''French Cinema: A Student's Guide'', Oxford University Press(US), p77. {{ISBN|0-340-76004-4}}.</ref> Sinnerbrink proposes that each film's "movement-image"<ref>Chris Gehman, Steve Reinke (2005). ''The Sharpest Point: animation at the end of cinema'', YYZ Books, p12. {{ISBN|0-920397-32-8}}.</ref> or how a figure is created through the continuity of their movement, is that which defines it, in combination with a number of other elements.<ref name=":2" /> This position, therefore, denounces the idea that an artform's essence is determined by one specific medium. Citing the example of [[Derek Jarman|Derek Jarman's]] [[Blue (1993 film)|Blue]] (1993), Sinnerbrink argues that the film's engaging voiceover narration, effective use of colour, exciting background music and plot cannot be distilled into a single 'relevant medium'.<ref>Sinnerbrink, Robert (2018). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. p. 22-23. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.</ref>

[[Jacques Rancière]] is also a critic of Medium Essentialism, proposing that no film has an essence particular to its medium, and that any essence or single medium cannot be determined by any film in [[History of film|cinematic history]].<ref name=":12">Sinnerbrink, Robert (2018). ''New Philosophies of Film : Thinking Images''. Continuum. p. 100-102. {{ISBN|9781441122575}}. {{OCLC|1043047181}}.</ref> Reiterating the unsolvable conflict between 'visual spectacle' and 'narrative content' faced by critics when attempting to distill film into a single essential medium,<ref name=":12" /> Rancière states that 'essentialising' the film medium often comes at the price of being unable to see the film as a whole, as a 'corpus'.<ref name=":12" />
