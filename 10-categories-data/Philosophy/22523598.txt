The '''Alan Turing Year''', 2012, marked the celebration of the life and scientific influence of [[Alan Turing]] during the centenary of his birth on 23 June 1912. Turing had an important influence on [[computing]], [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[developmental biology]], and the mathematical [[theory of computability]] and made important contributions to code-breaking during the [[Second World War]]. The Alan Turing Centenary Advisory committee (TCAC) was originally set up by Professor Barry Cooper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/imitation-game-brings-to-life-the-real-alan-turing-pioneer-of-the-computer-age-32517|title=Imitation Game brings to life the real Alan Turing, pioneer of the computer age|first=S. Barry|last=Cooper|website=theconversation.com}}</ref>

The international impact of Turing's work is reflected in the list of countries in which Alan Turing Year was celebrated, including: [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and the [[United States|U.S.A.]] 41+ countries were involved.

A number of major events took place throughout the year. Some of these were linked to places with special significance in Turing's life, such as [[Cambridge University]], the [[University of Manchester]], [[Bletchley Park]], [[Princeton University]].  The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] was involved from June to September 2012. Twelve museums were involved including in Germany and Brazil. Artists, musicians and poets took part in the celebrations internationally.

Events included the 2012 [[Computability in Europe]] conference, as well as Turing Centenary activities organized or sponsored by the [[British Computer Society]], the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], [[British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science]], the [[British Society for the History of Mathematics]], the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], British Logic Colloquium, [[Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour]], the [[Computer Conservation Society]], the [[Computer Society of India]], the [[Bletchley Park]] Trust, the European Association for Computer Science Logic, the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]], [[International Association for Computing and Philosophy]], the [[De La Salle University College of Liberal Arts#Academic departments of CLA|Department of Philosophy]] at [[De La Salle University|De La Salle University-Manila]], the [[John Templeton Foundation]], the [[Kurt Gödel Society]], the [[IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science]], the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]], and Turing100in2012.<ref>[http://www.kevinwarwick.com/turing100.htm  Turing100in2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114151842/http://www.kevinwarwick.com/turing100.htm |date=14 January 2010 }}.</ref> The [[Alan Turing Centenary Conference]] was held at the [[University of Manchester]] during June 2012.

Alan Turing Year is known on Twitter as Alan Turing Years.  @alanturingyear.

==Organisers==
The Turing Year was coordinated by the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC), representing a range of expertise and organisational involvement in the 2012 celebrations.
