{{about|the psychological term}}
In [[psychology]], [[economics]] and [[philosophy]], a '''preference''' is a technical term usually used in relation to choosing between [[wikt:alternative|alternatives]]. For example, someone prefers A over B if they would rather choose A than B.

Preference can also be used in [[insolvency]] terms.

==Psychology==

In [[psychology]], preferences refer to an individual's attitude towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit [[decision-making]] process (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 2006). The term is also used to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-making processes, such as [[choices]] (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, & Dolan, 2009), even unconsciously (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, & Sander, 2010). Consequently, preference can be affected by a person's surroundings and upbringing in terms of geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and education. These factors are found to affect preference as repeated exposure to a certain idea or concept correlates with a positive preference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=Robert B.|last2=Markus|first2=Hazel|date=1982-09-01|title=Affective and Cognitive Factors in Preferences|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/2/123|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–131|doi=10.1086/208905|issn=0093-5301}}</ref>

==Economics==

{{main|Preference (economics)}}

In [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s, ''preference'' refers to the set of assumptions related to ordering some alternatives, based on the degree of [[happiness]], satisfaction, [[gratification]], morality, enjoyment, or [[utility]] they provide, a process which results in an optimal "[[choice]]" (whether real or imagined). Although economists are usually not interested in choices or preferences in themselves, they are interested in the theory of choice because it serves as a background for empirical demand analysis and as a basis for theories involving strategy.

The so-called [[Expected utility hypothesis|Expected Utility Theory (EUT)]], which was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1944, explains that so long as an agent's preferences over risky options follow a set of [[axiom]]s, then he is maximizing the expected value of a utility function.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Basis of Institutions: A Synthesis of Behavioral and Institutional Economics|last=Teraji|first=Shinji|publisher=Academic Press|year=2018|isbn=9780128120231|location=London|pages=137}}</ref> This theory specifically identified four axioms that determine an individual's preference when selecting an alternative out of a series of choices that maximizes expected utility for him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Finance and Psychology – A never-ending love story?!: Behavioural Finance and its impact on the credit crunch in 2009|last=Kemtzian|first=Patrick|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2012|isbn=9783656270577|location=Berlin|pages=5}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Experiments on Decisions under Risk: The Expected Utility Hypothesis|last=Schoemaker|first=P.

==Insolvency==
In [[Insolvency]], the term can be used to describe when a company pays a specific creditor or group of creditors. From doing this, that creditor(s) is made better off, than other creditors. After paying the 'preferred creditor', the company seeks to go into a formal insolvency like an administration or liquidation.  There must be a desire to make the creditor better off, for them to be a preference. If the preference is proven, legal action can occur. It is a wrongful act of trading. Disqualification is a risk.<ref name=Steven>{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Keith|title=What Is A Preference Under The Insolvency Act 1986|url=https://www.companyrescue.co.uk/guides-knowledge/guides/what-is-a-preference-under-the-insolvency-act-1986-3748/|accessdate=October 1, 2018}}</ref> Preference arises within the context of the principle maintaining that one of the main objectives in the winding up of an insolvent company is to ensure the equal treatment of creditors.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Company Law, Fourth Edition|last=Hannigan|first=Brenda|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780198722861|location=Oxford|pages=368}}</ref> The rules on preferences allow paying up their creditors as insolvency looms, but that it must prove that the transaction is a result of ordinary commercial considerations.<ref name=":0" /> Also, under the English [[Insolvency Act 1986]], if a creditor was proven to have forced the company to pay, the resulting payment would not be considered a preference since it would not constitute unfairness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy, Second Edition|last=Gullifer|first=Louise|last2=Payne|first2=Jennifer|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781782259602|location=Oxford|pages=111}}</ref>
