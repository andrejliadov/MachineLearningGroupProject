'''Diogenes''' ({{IPAc-en|d|aɪ|ˈ|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|iː|z}} {{respell|dy|OJ|in|eez}}; {{lang-grc|Διογένης|Diogénēs}} {{IPA-el|di.oɡénɛ͜ɛs|}}), also known as '''Diogenes the Cynic''' ({{lang|grc|Διογένης ὁ Κυνικός}}, {{transl|grc|Diogénēs ho Kynikós}}), was a [[Greek philosopher]] and one of the founders of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophy. He was born in [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], an [[Ionians|Ionian]] colony on the [[Black Sea]] coast of modern day [[Turkey]],<ref name="VoiceWilder">''Diogenes of Sinope'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.beyond-the-pale.co.uk/diogenes.htm |title=The Zen of Disengagement: Diogene of Sinope |publisher=Voice in the Wilderness |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017130617/http://www.beyond-the-pale.co.uk/diogenes.htm |archive-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> in 412 or 404 BC and died at [[Corinth]] in 323 BC.<ref name="birth">{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:79}}, Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 717c. says that he died on the same day as [[Alexander the Great]], which puts his death at 323 BC. [[Diogenes Laërtius]]'s statement that Diogenes died "nearly 90" would put his year of birth at 412 BC. But [[Censorinus]] (''De die natali'', 15.2) says that he died at age 81, which puts his year of birth at 404 BC. The [[Suda]] puts his birth at the time of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], which also gives 404 BC.</ref>

Diogenes was a controversial figure. His father minted coins for a living, and Diogenes was banished from Sinope when he took to [[debasement of currency]].<ref name="VoiceWilder" /> After being exiled, he moved to [[Athens]] and criticized many cultural conventions of the city. He modelled himself on the example of [[Heracles]], and believed that [[virtue]] was better revealed in action than in theory. He used his simple lifestyle and behaviour to criticize the social values and institutions of what he saw as a corrupt, confused society. He had a reputation for sleeping and eating wherever he chose in a highly non-traditional fashion, and took to toughening himself against nature. He declared himself a [[Global citizenship|cosmopolitan]] and a citizen of the world rather than claiming allegiance to just one place. There are many tales about his dogging [[Antisthenes]]' footsteps and becoming his "faithful hound".<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 6, 18, 21; Dio Chrysostom, ''Orations'', viii. 1–4; Aelian, x. 16; Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', 13.19</ref>

Diogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and often slept in a large ceramic jar, or [[pithos]], in the marketplace.<ref name="pithos">The original Greek word describing Diogenes' "jar" is ''[[pithos]]'', a large jar for storing wine, grain, or olive oil. Modern variations include ''barrel'', ''tub'', ''vat'', ''wine-vat'', and ''kennel''. {{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5z-zTlFcBsC&pg=PA21 |title=Cynics |last=Desmond |first=William |publisher=University of California Press |year=2008 |isbn=9780520258358 |page=21 |author-link=William Desmond (philosopher) |access-date=2016-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429053413/https://books.google.com/books?id=_5z-zTlFcBsC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=2017-04-29 |url-status=live}}</ref> He became notorious for his philosophical stunts, such as carrying a lamp during the day, claiming to be looking for a man (often rendered in English as "looking for an honest man"). He criticized [[Plato]], disputed his interpretation of [[Socrates]], and sabotaged his lectures, sometimes distracting listeners by bringing food and eating during the discussions. Diogenes was also noted for [[Diogenes and Alexander|having mocked]] [[Alexander the Great]], both in public and to his face when he visited [[Corinth]] in 336 BC.<ref name="OnExile15">{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:32}}; Plutarch, ''Alexander'', 14, ''On Exile'', 15.</ref><ref name="Alexander14">[[Plutarch]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/3.html#14 ''Alexander'' 14]</ref><ref name="Morality&Custom">{{Cite book |title=Morality and Custom in Ancient Greece |last=John M.

Diogenes was captured by pirates and sold into [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slavery]], eventually settling in [[Corinth]]. There he passed his philosophy of Cynicism to [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], who taught it to [[Zeno of Citium]], who fashioned it into the school of [[Stoicism]], one of the most enduring schools of Greek philosophy. No writings of Diogenes survive but there are some details of his life from anecdotes (''[[chreia]]''), especially from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' book ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' and some other sources.<ref>''Diogenes of Sinope'' {{Cite web |url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_diogenes.html |title=The Basics of Philosophy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505002725/http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_diogenes.html |archive-date=2012-05-05 |access-date=2012-04-06}} Retrieved November 13, 2011.</ref>

==Life==
{{Individualism sidebar}}Nothing is known about Diogenes' early life except that his father, Hicesias, was a banker.<ref>{{Harv|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:20}}. A ''trapezites'' was a banker/money-changer who could exchange currency, arrange loans, and was sometimes entrusted with the minting of currency.</ref> It seems likely that Diogenes was also enrolled into the banking business aiding his father. 

At some point (the exact date is unknown), Hicesias and Diogenes became involved in a scandal involving the adulteration or debasement of the currency,<ref>Navia, ''Diogenes the Cynic'', p. 226: "The word ''paracharaxis'' can be understood in various ways such as the defacement of currency or the counterfeiting of coins or the adulteration of money."</ref> and Diogenes was exiled from the city and lost his citizenship and all his material possessions.<ref name="ReferenceB">Examined Lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller p. 76</ref><ref name="diog2021">{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:20–21}}</ref> This aspect of the story seems to be corroborated by archaeology: large numbers of defaced coins (smashed with a large chisel stamp) have been discovered at Sinope dating from the middle of the 4th century BC, and other coins of the time bear the name of Hicesias as the official who minted them.<ref>C. T. Seltman, ''Diogenes of Sinope, Son of the Banker Hikesias'', in ''Transactions of the International Numismatic Congress 1936'' (London 1938).</ref> During this time there was much counterfeit money circulating in Sinope.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> The coins were deliberately defaced in order to render them worthless as legal tender.<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Sinope was being disputed between pro-[[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and pro-[[Classical Greece|Greek]] factions in the 4th century, and there may have been political rather than financial motives behind the act.

=== In Athens ===
[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|''Diogenes Sitting in His Tub'' by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1860)]]

According to one story,<ref name="diog2021" /> Diogenes went to the [[Pythia|Oracle at Delphi]] to ask for her advice and was told that he should "deface the currency". Following the debacle in Sinope, Diogenes decided that the oracle meant that he should deface the political currency rather than actual coins. He traveled to [[Athens]] and made it his life's goal to challenge established customs and values. He argued that instead of being troubled about the true nature of evil, people merely rely on customary interpretations. This distinction between nature ("[[physis]]") and custom ("[[nomos (mythology)|nomos]]") is a favourite theme of ancient Greek philosophy, and one that Plato takes up in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]],'' in the legend of the [[Ring of Gyges]].<ref>Plato, ''Republic,'' 2.359–2.360.</ref>

Diogenes arrived in Athens with a slave named Manes who escaped from him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humor, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?"<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:55}}; Seneca, ''De Tranquillitate Animi'', 8.7.; Aelian, ''Varia Historia,'' 13.28.</ref>  Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found the figure of a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teaching of [[Antisthenes]], a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly "eventually beat him off with his staff".<ref name="VoiceWilder" /> Diogenes responds, "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep me away from you, so long as I think you've something to say."<ref name="VoiceWilder" /> Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:21}}; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', 10.16.; Jerome, ''Adversus Jovinianum'', 2.14.</ref>  Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain,<ref name="long45">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=45}}</ref><ref name="dudley2">{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=2}}</ref><ref name="prince77">{{Harvnb|Prince|2005|p=77}}</ref> but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretence, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.

The stories told of Diogenes illustrate the logical consistency of his character. He inured himself to the weather by living in a clay wine jar<ref name=pithos /><ref name="ReferenceC">Examined Lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller p. 78</ref> belonging to the temple of [[Cybele]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:23}} ; Jerome, ''Adversus Jovinianum'', 2.14.</ref> He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands. He then exclaimed: "Fool that I am, to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time!"<ref>Examined lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:37}}; Seneca, ''Epistles'', 90.14.; Jerome, ''Adversus Jovinianum'', 2.14.</ref> It was contrary to Athenian customs to eat within the marketplace, and still he would eat there, for, as he explained when rebuked, it was during the time he was in the marketplace that he felt hungry. He used to stroll about in full daylight with a [[oil lamp|lamp]]; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, "I am looking for a man."<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:41}}</ref> (Modern sources often say that Diogenes was looking for an "honest man", but in ancient sources he is simply "looking for a human" – "ἄνθρωπον ζητῶ".[http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/dl/dl06.html#diogenis] The unreasoning behavior of the people around him means that they do not qualify as human.) Diogenes looked for a human being but reputedly found nothing but rascals and scoundrels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:32}}</ref>

According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], when Plato gave the tongue-in-cheek<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAXmguDJM24C&pg=PA106 |title=Being and the Between: Political Theory in the American Academy |last=Desmond |first=William |date=1995 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9780791422717 |page=106}}</ref> [[Human self-reflection#Classical antiquity|definition of man]] as "featherless bipeds," Diogenes plucked a [[chicken]] and brought it into Plato's [[Platonic Academy|Academy]], saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man," and so the Academy added "with broad flat [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]" to the definition.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:40}}</ref>

=== In Corinth ===
According to a story which seems to have originated with [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:29}}</ref> Diogenes was captured by [[pirate]]s while on voyage to [[Aegina]] and sold as a [[slavery|slave]] in [[Crete]] to a [[Corinth]]ian named [[Xeniades]]. Being asked his trade, he replied that he knew no trade but that of governing men, and that he wished to be sold to a man who needed a master. Xeniades liked his spirit and hired Diogenes to tutor his children. As tutor to Xeniades's two sons,<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:30–31}}</ref> it is said that he lived in Corinth for the rest of his life, which he devoted to preaching the doctrines of virtuous self-control. There are many stories about what actually happened to him after his time with Xeniades's two sons. There are stories stating he was set free after he became "a cherished member of the household", while one says he was set free almost immediately, and still another states that "he grew old and died at Xeniades's house in Corinth."<ref name="EncycloPhilos">{{Cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino |title=Diogenes of Sinope |date=2006-04-26 |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103164337/http://www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino/ |archive-date=2011-11-03 |access-date=2011-11-13}}</ref> He is even said to have lectured to large audiences at the [[Isthmian Games]].<ref>Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/8*.html#10 Or.&nbsp;8.10]</ref>

Although most of the stories about his living in a jar<ref name=pithos /> are located in Athens, there are some accounts of his living in a jar near the [[Craneum]] gymnasium in Corinth:

{{blockquote|A report that [[Philip II of Macedon | Philip]] was marching on the town had thrown all Corinth into a bustle; one was furbishing his arms, another wheeling stones, a third patching the wall, a fourth strengthening a battlement, every one making himself useful somehow or other. Diogenes having nothing to do—of course no one thought of giving ''him'' a job—was moved by the sight to gather up his philosopher's cloak and begin rolling his tub-dwelling energetically up and down the Craneum; an acquaintance asked, and got, the explanation: "I do not want to be thought the only idler in such a busy multitude; I am rolling my tub to be like the rest."<ref>{{Citation | title=[[How to Write History]] | author=Lucian | author-link=Lucian | translator-link1=Henry Watson Fowler | translator-link2=Francis George Fowler | chapter=3 | year=1905 | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/worksoflucianofs02luci/page/110/mode/2up }}</ref>}}

===Diogenes and Alexander===
[[Image:Alexander visits Diogenes at Corinth by W. Matthews (1914).jpg|right|thumb|''Alexander the Great Visits Diogenes at Corinth'' by W. Matthews (1914)]]
{{Main article|Diogenes and Alexander}}
It was in Corinth that a meeting between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is supposed to have taken place.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:38}}; Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', 5.32.; [[Plutarch]], ''Alexander'', 14, ''On Exile'', 15; Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/4*.html#14 Or.&nbsp;4.14]</ref> These stories may be [[apocryphal]]. The accounts of Plutarch and [[Diogenes Laërtius]] recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." Alexander then declared, "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." "If I were not Diogenes, I would still wish to be Diogenes," Diogenes replied.<ref name=OnExile15/><ref name=Alexander14/><ref name=Morality&Custom/> In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, "I am searching for the bones of [[Philip II of Macedon|your father]] but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave."<ref>There is a similar anecdote in one of the dialogues of [[Lucian]] ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl1/wl176.htm ''Menippus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924125132/http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl1/wl176.htm |date=2015-09-24 }}, 15) but that story concerns [[Menippus]] in the [[Hades|underworld]].</ref>

=== Death ===
There are conflicting accounts of Diogenes' death. His contemporaries alleged he had held his breath until he expired; although other accounts of his death say he had become ill from eating raw octopus;<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:76}}; Athenaeus, 8.341.</ref> or to have suffered an infected dog bite.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:77}}</ref> When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, "Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!" When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied: "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?"<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', 1.43.</ref> In the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the "proper" treatment of the dead. The Corinthians erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of [[Parian marble]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:78}}; Greek Anthology, 1.285.; Pausanias, 2.2.4.</ref>

==Philosophy==

===Cynicism===
[[File:Bastein-Lepage Diogenes.jpg|left|thumb|''Diogenes'' (1873) by [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]]]]

Along with Antisthenes and [[Crates of Thebes]], Diogenes is considered one of the founders of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]]. The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survive even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:80}}</ref> Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore what we know about Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.

Diogenes maintained that all the artificial growths of society were incompatible with happiness and that morality implies a return to the simplicity of nature. So great was his austerity and simplicity that the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] would later claim him to be a wise man or "sophos". In his words, "Humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods."<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:44}}</ref> Although [[Socrates]] had previously identified himself as belonging to the world, rather than a city,<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', 5.37.; Plutarch, ''On Exile'', 5.; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i.9.1.</ref> Diogenes is credited with the first known use of the word "[[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]". When he was asked from where he came, he replied, "I am a citizen of the world (''cosmopolites'')".<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:63}}. Compare: {{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:72}}, Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/4*.html#13 Or.&nbsp;4.13], Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.24.66.</ref> This was a radical claim in a world where a man's identity was intimately tied to his citizenship of a particular city-state. An exile and an outcast, a man with no social identity, Diogenes made a mark on his contemporaries.

[[File:Mattia Preti - Diogenes and Plato - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Plato and Diogenes (Mattia Preti)|Plato and Diogenes]] (17th century) by [[Mattia Preti]]]]

Diogenes had nothing but disdain for [[Plato]] and his abstract philosophy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:24}}</ref> Diogenes viewed Antisthenes as the true heir to [[Socrates]], and shared his love of [[virtue]] and indifference to [[wealth]],<ref>Plato, [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1656 ''Apology''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924074100/http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1656 |date=2009-09-24 }}, 41e.</ref> together with a disdain for general opinion.<ref>Xenophon, [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1171 ''Apology''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924073832/http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1171 |date=2009-09-24 }}, 1.</ref> Diogenes shared Socrates's belief that he could function as doctor to men's souls and improve them morally, while at the same time holding contempt for their obtuseness. Plato once described Diogenes as "a Socrates gone mad."<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:54}} ; Aelian, ''Varia Historia'', 14.33.</ref>

===Obscenity===
Diogenes taught by living example. He tried to demonstrate that wisdom and happiness belong to the man who is independent of society and that civilization is regressive. He scorned not only family and socio-political organization, but also property rights and reputation. He even rejected normal ideas about human decency. Diogenes is said to have eaten in the marketplace,<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:58, 69}}. Eating in public places was considered bad manners.</ref> urinated on some people who insulted him,<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:46}}</ref> defecated in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]],<ref>Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/8*.html#36 Or.&nbsp;8.36]; Julian, ''Orations'', 6.202c.</ref> and [[masturbated]] in public. When asked about his eating in public he said, "If taking breakfast is nothing out of place, then it is nothing out of place in the marketplace. But taking breakfast is nothing out of place, therefore it is nothing out of place to take breakfast in the marketplace." <ref name="auto">Examined Lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller p. 80</ref> On the indecency of his [[indecent exposure|masturbating in public]] he would say, "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly."<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:34–35}}; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii.2.11. Pointing with one's middle finger was considered insulting; with the finger pointing '''''up''''' instead of to another person, the [[Finger (gesture)|finger gesture]] is considered obscene in modern times.</ref>

===Diogenes as dogged or dog-like===
Many anecdotes of Diogenes refer to his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It is not known whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet "doggish" and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. When asked why he was called a dog he replied, "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals."<ref name="ReferenceC" /> Diogenes believed human beings live artificially and hypocritically and would do well to study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe.<ref>Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II</ref> Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Diogenes stated that "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them."<ref>Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.</ref>
[[File:Diogenes-statue-Sinop-enhanced.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue of Diogenes at his birthplace in [[Sinop, Turkey]]]]

The term "cynic" itself derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word κυνικός, ''kynikos'', "dog-like" and that from κύων, ''kyôn'', "[[dog]]" ([[genitive]]: ''kynos'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#60864 |title=No document found |website=www.perseus.tufts.edu |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223121331/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=#60864 |archive-date=2008-02-23 |access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref> One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called ''dogs'' was that Antisthenes taught in the [[Cynosarges]] gymnasium at [[Athens]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Laërtius|Hicks|1925|loc=VI:13}}. Cf. ''[[The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature]]'', 2nd edition, p. 165.</ref> The word ''Cynosarges'' means the place of the ''white dog''. Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:
<blockquote>There are four reasons why the ''Cynics'' are so named. First because of the ''indifference'' of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.<ref name="dudley5">Scholium on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=5}}</ref></blockquote>

As noted (see [[#Death|Death]]), Diogenes' association with dogs was memorialized by the Corinthians, who erected to his memory a pillar on which rested a dog of [[Parian marble]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

===Contemporary theory===
Diogenes is discussed in a 1983 book by German philosopher [[Peter Sloterdijk]] (English language publication in 1987). 

In Sloterdijk's ''[[Critique of Cynical Reason]]'', Diogenes is used as an example of Sloterdijk's idea of the "kynical"&nbsp;– in which personal degradation is used for purposes of community comment or censure. Calling the practice of this tactic "kynismos", Sloterdijk theorizes that the kynical actor actually embodies the message he is trying to convey and that the kynical actor's goal is typically a false regression that mocks authority&nbsp;– especially authority that the kynical actor considers corrupt, suspect or unworthy.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/critiqueofcynica00slot/page/1 |title=Critique of Cynical Reason |last=Sloterdijk |first=Peter |date=1983 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0816615865 |location=Minneapolis |pages=[https://archive.org/details/critiqueofcynica00slot/page/1 1–600] |url-access=registration}}</ref>

There is another discussion of Diogenes and the Cynics in [[Michel Foucault]]'s book ''Fearless Speech''.  Here Foucault discusses Diogenes' antics in relation to the speaking of truth (''[[parrhesia]]'') in the ancient world. Foucault expands this reading in his last course at the Collège de France, ''The Courage of Truth.'' In this course Foucault tries to establish an alternative conception of militancy and revolution through a reading of Diogenes and Cynicism.<ref>See the 7 March lecture Michel Foucault, The Courage of the Truth Lectures at the Collège de France (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011)</ref>

==Diogenes syndrome==
{{Main article|Diogenes syndrome}}

Diogenes' name has been applied to a [[behavioural disorder]] characterised by apparently involuntary [[self-neglect]] and [[hoarding]].<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Hanon C, Pinquier C, Gaddour N, Saïd S, Mathis D, Pellerin J |year=2004 |title=[Diogenes syndrome: a transnosographic approach] |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-ENC-9-2004-30-4-0013-7006-101019-ART2 |journal=Encephale |language=French |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=315–22 |doi=10.1016/S0013-7006(04)95443-7 |pmid=15538307 |ref=harv}}</ref> The disorder afflicts the elderly and is quite inappropriately named, as Diogenes deliberately rejected common standards of material comfort, and was anything but a hoarder.<ref>Navia, ''Diogenes the Cynic'', p. 31</ref>

==Depictions==
<!-- This section should only contain depictions of Diogenes of Sinope in art and literature, or characters closely based on him. It should not contain people who are vaguely like him, or people who happen to be called Diogenes. -->

=== Art ===

[[File:Alexander The Great and Diogenes.jpg|thumb|Statue of Diogenes with [[Alexander the Great]] in [[Corinth]]]]

Both in ancient and in modern times, Diogenes' personality has appealed strongly to sculptors and to painters. Ancient busts exist in the museums of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], the [[Louvre]], and the [[Capitoline Museums|Capitol]]. The interview between Diogenes and Alexander is represented in an ancient marble bas-relief found in the [[Villa Albani]].

Among artists who have painted the famous encounter of Diogenes with Alexander, there are works by [[Caspar de Crayer|de Crayer]], [[Cornelis de Vos|de Vos]], [[Gioacchino Assereto|Assereto]], [[Giovan Battista Langetti|Langetti]], [[Pierre Paul Sevin|Sevin]], [[Sebastiano Ricci]], [[Gaetano Gandolfi|Gandolfi]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Christian Thomas Wink|de|3=Christian Wink}}, [[Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard|Abildgaard]], [[Nicolas-André Monsiau|Monsiau]], [[John Martin (painter)|Martin]], and [[Honoré Daumier|Daumier]]. The famous story of Diogenes searching for an "honest man" has been depicted by [[Jacob Jordaens|Jordaens]], [[Caesar van Everdingen|van Everdingen]], [[Adriaen van der Werff|van der Werff]], [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]], [[Jan Steen|Steen]] and [[Lovis Corinth|Corinth]]. Others who have painted him with his famous lantern include [[Jusepe de Ribera|de Ribera]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Giuseppe Antonio Petrini|Petrini]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme|Gérôme]], [[Jules Bastien-Lepage|Bastien-Lepage]], and [[John William Waterhouse|Waterhouse]]. The scene in which Diogenes discards his cup has been painted by [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Salvator Rosa|Rosa]], and [[John Martin (painter)|Martin]]; and the story of Diogenes begging from a statue has been depicted by [[Jean-Bernard Restout|Restout]]. In [[Raphael]]'s fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a lone reclining figure in the foreground represents Diogenes.<ref>''Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling'', by Ross King</ref>

Diogenes has also been the subject of sculptures, with famous [[bas-relief]] images by [[Pierre Paul Puget|Puget]] and [[Augustin Pajou|Pajou]].

===Comics===

In ''[[The Adventures of Nero]]'' album ''Het Zeespook'' (1948) [[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]] meets a character who claims to be Diogenes. Two scenes in the comic depict famous anecdotes of Diogenes' life, namely the moment when he was looking for a human and the moment when he asked Alexander to get out of his sun. He is also portrayed living in a barrel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/Nero/Nero-Kolderfiguren.html |title=60 Jaar Nero |website=www.stripspeciaalzaak.be |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607233807/http://www.stripspeciaalzaak.be/Toppers/Nero/Nero-Kolderfiguren.html |archive-date=2012-06-07 |access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
[[File:Diogenes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|A 17th century depiction of Diogenes]]
Diogenes is referred to in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s story "Ward No. 6"; [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]''; [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''; [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s poem ''Genialisch Treiben''; [[Denis Diderot]]'s philosophical novella ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]''; as well as in the first sentence of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s novelistic treatise ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]''. The story of Diogenes and the lamp is referenced by the character Foma Fomitch in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s "The Friend of the Family" as well as "The Idiot". In [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' short story "The Man of Glass" ("[[El licenciado Vidriera]]"), part of the ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'' collection, the (anti-)hero unaccountably begins to channel Diogenes in a string of tart ''[[chreia]]i'' once he becomes convinced that he is made of glass. Diogenes gives his own life and opinions in [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]'s novel ''Socrates Mainomenos'' (1770; English translation ''Socrates Out of His Senses'', 1771). Diogenes is the primary model for the philosopher Didactylos in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Small Gods]]''. He is mimicked by a beggar-spy in [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''[[Kushiel's Scion]]'' and paid tribute to with a costume in a party by the main character in its sequel, ''[[Kushiel's Justice]]''. The character Lucy Snowe in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s novel ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' is given the nickname Diogenes.  Diogenes also features in Part Four of [[Elizabeth Smart (author)|Elizabeth Smart]]'s ''[[By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept]]''. He is a figure in [[Seamus Heaney]]'s ''[[The Haw Lantern]]''. In [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]]'s ''[[Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal]]'', one of [[Jesus]]' [[apostles]] is a devotee of Diogenes, complete with his own pack of dogs which he refers to as his own disciples. His story opens the first chapter of Dolly Freed's 1978 book ''[[Possum Living]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.f4.ca/text/possumliving.htm |title=''Possum Living'' by Dolly Freed |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121104727/http://www.f4.ca/text/possumliving.htm |archive-date=January 21, 2009}}</ref>
The dog that [[Paul Dombey]] befriends in [[Charles Dickens]]' [[Dombey and Son]] is called Diogenes.
Alexander's meeting with Diogenes is portrayed in [[Valerio Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Ends of the Earth (Alexander Trilogy)|(Alexander Trilogy) "The Ends of the Earth"]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEBM54FEE2oC |title=Alexander: The Ends of the Earth by Valerio Manfredi |last=Manfredi |first=Valerio |year=2001 |isbn=9780743434386 |access-date=2013-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429155547/https://books.google.com/books?id=rEBM54FEE2oC |archive-date=2017-04-29 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[William S.

The many allusions to dogs in Shakespeare's ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' are references to the school of Cynicism that could be interpreted as suggesting a parallel between the misanthropic hermit, Timon, and Diogenes; but Shakespeare would have had access to [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s essay, "Of Democritus and Heraclitus", which emphasised their differences: Timon actively wishes men ill and shuns them as dangerous, whereas Diogenes esteems them so little that contact with them could not disturb him.<ref>Hugh Grady, "A Companion to Shakespeare's Works", Dutton. R & Howard J., Blakewell Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-22632-X}}, pp. 443–44.</ref> "Timonism" is in fact often contrasted with "Cynicism": "Cynics saw what people could be and were angered by what they had become; Timonists felt humans were hopelessly stupid & uncaring by nature and so saw no hope for change."<ref>Paul Ollswang, "Cynicism: A Series of Cartoons on a Philosophical Theme", January 1988, [http://www.ollswang.com/_/rsrc/1261384309718/home/cynicism/cynicism---page-2/c2.jpeg?height=873&width=1200 page B at official site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322074959/http://www.ollswang.com/_/rsrc/1261384309718/home/cynicism/cynicism---page-2/c2.jpeg?height=873&width=1200 |date=2012-03-22 }}; repr. in ''The Best Comics of the Decade 1980-1990 Vol. 1'', Seattle, 1990, {{ISBN|1-56097-035-9}}, p. 23.</ref>

The philosopher's name was adopted by the fictional [[The Diogenes Club|Diogenes Club]], an organization that [[Sherlock Holmes]]' brother [[Mycroft Holmes]] belongs to in the story "[[The Greek Interpreter]]" by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. It is called such as its members are educated, yet untalkative and have a dislike of socialising, much like the philosopher himself{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. The group is the focus of a number of Holmes [[pastiche]]s by [[Kim Newman]]. In the [[Rodgers and Hart]] musical ''[[The Boys From Syracuse]]'' (1938), the song ''Oh Diogenes!''—which extols the philosopher's virtues—contains the lyrics "there was an old zany/ who lived in a tub;/ he had so many flea-bites / he didn't know where to rub."
