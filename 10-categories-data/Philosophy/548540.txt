'''Gaston Bachelard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|æ|ʃ|ə|ˈ|l|ɑr}}; {{IPA-fr|baʃlaʁ|lang}}; 27 June 1884 – 16 October 1962) was a French [[philosopher]].<ref name="BioDict20CPhil">{{cite book | title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers | year=1996 | publisher=Routledge | location=London | pages=41–42 | isbn=0-415-06043-5}}</ref> He made contributions in the fields of [[poetics]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. To the latter he introduced the concepts of ''epistemological obstacle'' and ''[[Epistemological rupture|epistemological break]]'' (''obstacle épistémologique'' and ''rupture épistémologique''). He influenced many subsequent French philosophers, among them [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Dominique Lecourt]] and [[Jacques Derrida]], as well as the sociologists [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Bruno Latour]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia31/parrhesia31_simons-et-al.pdf}}</ref>

For Bachelard the [[Objectivity (science)|scientific object]] should be constructed and therefore, different from the [[Positivism|positivist sciences]], information is in continuous construction. [[Empiricism]] and [[rationalism]] are not regarded as dualism or opposition but complementary, therefore studies of a priori and a posteriori or in other words reason and are dialectic and are part of [[Scientific method|scientific research.]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lima|first=Marcos Antonio Martins|last2=Marinelli|first2=Marcos|date=2011-07-13|title=A epistemologia de Gaston Bachelard: uma ruptura com as filosofias do imobilismo|journal=Revista de Ciências Humanas|volume=45|issue=2|doi=10.5007/2178-4582.2011v45n2p393|issn=2178-4582}}</ref>

==Life and work==
Bachelard was a [[postmaster|postal clerk]] in [[Bar-sur-Aube]], and then studied [[physics]] and chemistry before finally becoming interested in philosophy. To obtain his doctorate (''[[doctorat ès lettres]]'') in 1927, he wrote two theses: the main one, ''Essai sur la connaissance approchée'', under the direction of [[Abel Rey]], and the complementary one, ''Étude sur l'évolution d'un problème de physique : la propagation thermique dans les solides'', supervised by [[Léon Brunschvicg]].

He was a professor at the [[University of Burgundy|University of Dijon]] from 1930 to 1940 and then was appointed chair in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Paris. In 1958 he became a member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].<ref>Index biographique des membres et associés de l'Académie royale de Belgique (1769-2005) p 19.</ref>

=== Bachelard's psychology of science ===
Bachelard's studies of the history and philosophy of science in such works as ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' ("The New Scientific Spirit", 1934) and ''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'' ("The Formation of the Scientific Mind", 1938) were based on his vision of historical [[epistemology]] as a kind of [[psychoanalysis]] of the scientific mind.

In the English-speaking world, the connection Bachelard made between [[psychology]] and the history of science has been little understood. Bachelard demonstrated how the progress of science could be blocked by certain types of mental patterns, creating the concept of ''obstacle épistémologique'' ("epistemological obstacle"). One task of epistemology is to make clear the mental patterns at use in science, in order to help scientists overcome the obstacles to knowledge. Another goal is to “give back to human reason its function of agitation and aggressiveness” as Bachelard put it in ‘L'engagement rationaliste’ (1972).<ref>{{Cite web|title=L’invention technique et théorique : la philosophie des sciences de G. Bachelard|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01336345/document|last=Grange|first=Juliette|date=2015|website=HAL-SHS- Archives ouvertes|access-date=3 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Epistemological breaks: the discontinuity of scientific progress ===
Bachelard was critical of [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]], which considered science as a continual [[Progress (history)|progress]]. To Bachelard, scientific developments such as Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] demonstrated the discontinuous nature of the [[history of sciences]]. Thus models that framed scientific development as continuous, such as that of Comte and [[Émile Meyerson]], seemed simplistic and erroneous to Bachelard.

Through his concept of "epistemological break", Bachelard underlined the discontinuity at work in the history of sciences. However the term "epistemological break" itself is almost never used by Bachelard, but became famous through [[Louis Althusser]].

He showed that new theories integrated old theories in new [[Paradigm shift|paradigms]], changing the sense of concepts (for instance, the concept of [[mass (physics)|mass]], used by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in two different senses). Thus, [[non-Euclidean geometry]] did not contradict [[Euclidean geometry]], but integrated it into a larger framework.

=== The role of epistemology in science ===
Bachelard was a [[rationalist]] in the [[Descartes|Cartesian]] sense, although he recommended his "non-Cartesian epistemology" as a replacement for the more standard Cartesian epistemology.<ref>''The New Scientific Mind'', conclusion.</ref> He compared "scientific knowledge" to ordinary knowledge in the way we deal with it, and saw error as only illusion: "Scientifically, one thinks truth as the historical rectification of a persistent error, and experiments as correctives for an initial, common illusion (''illusion première'')."<ref>''The New Scientific Mind'', VI, 6.</ref>

The role of [[epistemology]] is to show the history of the (scientific) production of concepts; those concepts are not just theoretical propositions: they are simultaneously abstract and [[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], pervading [[technic]]al and [[pedagogic]]al activity. This explains why "The electric bulb is an object of scientific thought… an example of an abstract-concrete object."<ref>in ''Le Rationalisme appliqué'' (1949, 2nd ed. of 1962, p. 104ff).</ref> To understand the way it works, one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead it produces regional [[history of science|histories of science]].

=== Shifts in scientific perspective ===
Bachelard saw how seemingly irrational theories often simply represented a drastic shift in scientific perspective. For instance, he claimed that the [[theory of probabilities]] was just another way of complexifying reality through a deepening of rationality (even though critics like [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] found this theory irrational).<ref>''The New Scientific Mind'', V (p. 120 French ed., 1934).</ref>

One of his main theses in ''The New Scientific Mind'' was that modern sciences had replaced the classical [[ontology]] of the [[Substance theory|substance]] with an "ontology of relations", which could be assimilated to something like a [[process philosophy]]. For instance, the physical concepts of matter and rays correspond, according to him, to the metaphysical concepts of the thing and of movement; but whereas classical philosophy considered both as distinct, and the thing as [[Ontology|ontologically]] real, modern science can not distinguish matter from rays: it is thus impossible to examine an immobile thing, which was precisely the condition for knowledge according to classical [[theory of knowledge]] (Becoming being impossible to be known, in accordance with [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]'s [[theory of knowledge|theories of knowledge]]).

In non-Cartesian epistemology, there is no "simple substance" as in [[Cartesianism]], but only complex objects built by theories and experiments, and continuously improved (VI, 4). [[Intuition (philosophy)|Intuition]] is therefore not primitive, but built (VI, 2). These themes led Bachelard to support a sort of [[constructivist epistemology]].

=== Other academic interests ===
In addition to epistemology, Bachelard's work deals with many other topics, including poetry, dreams, [[psychoanalysis]], and the [[imagination]]. ''The Psychoanalysis of Fire'' (1938) and ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958) are among the most popular of his works: [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] cites the former and Bachelard's ''Water and Dreams'' in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943), and the latter had a wide reception in [[architectural theory]] circles. In philosophy, this nocturnal side of his work is developed by his student [[Gilbert Durand]].
