In the [[philosophy|philosophical]] subdiscipline of [[ontology]], '''animalism''' is a theory of [[personal identity]] according to which human persons are animals.{{sfn|Olson|2007|loc=sec. 2.1}} The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].{{sfnm |1a1=Blatti |1a2=Snowdon |1y=2016 |2a1=Garrett |2y=1998 |3a1=Snowdon |3y=2017}}{{page needed|date=December 2020}} The view stands in contrast to positions such as [[John Locke]]'s psychological criterion for [[personal identity]] or various forms of [[mind–body dualism]], such as [[Richard Swinburne]]'s account. Whilst the animalist is committed to something like the claim that human persons are essentially animals, the animalist is quite content to allow non-human persons, e.g., sufficiently advanced robots, aliens, or other animals.

== Use of term in ethics ==
A less common, but perhaps increasing, use of the term ''animalism'' is to refer to the ethical view that all or most animals are worthy of moral consideration.<ref>{{cite web |author=The Animalist |title=What Is Animalism? |url=https://medium.com/@TheAnimalist/what-is-animalism-dc1bb9f9f822 |website=Medium |access-date=29 March 2019}}</ref> It may be similar, though not necessarily, to [[sentientism]].
