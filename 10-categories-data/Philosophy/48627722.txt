'''Anchurus''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄγχουρος}}) was a son of [[Midas]]—the heavily mythologized but still historical king of [[Phrygia]]—in whose reign the earth opened in the area of the town of [[Celaenae]] in [[Phyrgia]]. Midas consulted the oracle about how the opening might be closed and he was commanded to throw into it the most precious thing he possessed. He accordingly threw into it a great quantity of gold and silver, but when the chasm still did not close, his son Anchurus, thinking that life was the most precious of all things, mounted his horse and leapt into the chasm, which closed immediately.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' 5</ref>
