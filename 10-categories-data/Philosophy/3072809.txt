{{Glossary}}
{{term|[[Absolute (philosophy)|absolutism]]}}
{{defn|}}

{{term|[[absurdism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophy stating that the efforts of man to find meaning in the [[Universe]] will ultimately fail because no such meaning exists (at least in relation to man). Absurdism is related to {{gli|existentialism}}, though should not be confused with it, nor with {{gli|nihilism}}.}}

{{term|[[Tychism|accidentalism]]}}
{{defn|Any system of thought that denies the causal nexus and maintains that events succeed one another haphazardly or by chance (not in the mathematical but in the popular sense). In {{gli|metaphysics}}, accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause. In this connection it is synonymous with {{gli|tychism}} (ruxi, chance), a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for the theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.}}

{{term|[[acosmism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophy that denies the reality of the [[Universe]], seeing it as ultimately illusory, and only the infinite Unmanifest Absolute as real. In contrast to {{gli|pantheism}}, acosmism begins with the recognition that there is only one Reality, which is infinite, non-dual, blissful, etc. Yet the phenomenal reality of which humans are normally aware is none of these things; it is in fact just the opposite—i.e., dualistic, finite, full of suffering and pain, and so on. And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not Absolute cannot be real. Thus, according to this viewpoint, the phenomenal dualistic world is ultimately an illusion ("Maya" to use the technical Indian term), irrespective of the apparent reality it possesses at the mundane or empirical level.}}

{{term|[[aestheticism]]}}
{{defn|A loosely defined movement in [[art]] and [[literature]] popular in later 19th-century [[United Kingdom|Britain]] which held that art does not have any didactic purpose (it need only be beautiful), and that life should imitate art. The main characteristics of the movement were suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects – that is, correspondence between words, colors, and music.}}

{{term|[[agnostic atheism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical view that encompasses both {{gli|atheism}} and {{gli|agnosticism}}. Due to definitional variance, an agnostic atheist does not believe in [[God]] or gods and by extension holds true that "the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable", or that "knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant", or that "abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal". Contrast ''{{gli|agnostic theism}}''.}}

{{term|[[agnostic theism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical view that encompasses both {{gli|theism}} and {{gli|agnosticism}}. An agnostic theist is one who views that the {{gli|truth value}} of claims regarding the existence of [[God]] or gods is unknown or inherently unknowable, but still chooses to believe in God or gods in spite of this. Contrast ''{{gli|agnostic atheism}}''.}}

{{term|[[agnosticism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical view that the {{gli|truth value|truth values}} of certain claims — particularly {{gli|theology|theological}} claims regarding the existence of {{gli|monotheism|God}}, {{gli|polytheism|gods}}, or [[deity|deities]] — are unknown, inherently unknowable, or incoherent, and therefore irrelevant to [[Meaning of life|life]]. Agnosticism itself, in both its strong (explicit) and weak (implicit) forms, is necessarily neither an {{gli|atheism|atheist}} nor a {{gli|theism|theist}} position, though an agnostic person may also be either an atheist, a theist, or one who endorses neither position.}}

{{term|[[altruism]]}}
{{defn|The belief that people have a {{gli|morality|moral}} obligation to serve others or the "greater good". It is generally opposed to the concepts of self-interest and {{gli|egoism}}.}}

{{term|''[[amor fati]]''}}
{{defn|A [[Latin]] phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including [[suffering]] and [[grief|loss]], as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, ''amor fati'' is characterized by a passive acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.<ref name="ds">{{cite web|title=Amor Fati: The Formula for Human Greatness|url=https://dailystoic.com/amor-fati-love-of-fate/|publisher=Daily Stoic}}</ref>}}

{{term|[[anarchism]]}}
{{defn|The political position of any of a number of views and movements which advocate the absence or elimination of rulership or government. Other than being opposed to the [[State (polity)|state]], there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold. Compare and contrast ''{{gli|libertarianism}}''.}}

{{term|[[anarcho-capitalism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy based on the idea of [[individual sovereignty]], and a prohibition against initiatory [[coercion]] and [[fraud]]. It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals. From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] as an unjustified monopolist and aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] [[laissez-faire]] {{gli|capitalism}}. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through taxation, with private, competing businesses.}}

{{term|[[anarcho-primitivism]]}}
{{defn|An {{gli|anarchism|anarchist}} critique of the origins and progress of civilization. Primitivists argue that the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]]s to [[agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. They advocate a return to non-"civilized" ways of life through [[industrialisation|deindustrialisation]], abolition of [[division of labour]] or specialization, and abandonment of technology.}}

{{term|[[anarcho-syndicalism]]}}
{{defn|A form of anarchism that allies itself with [[syndicalism]], that is, with [[labor union]]s, as a force for revolutionary social change. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to replace capitalism and the state with a democratically worker-managed means of production. They seek to abolish the wage system and most forms of private property.}}

{{term|[[animism]]}}
{{defn|"Animism" has been applied to many different philosophical systems. This includes [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[stoics]] and [[scholastics]]. On the other hand, [[monadology]] ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) has also been described as animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the ''world soul'', held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others. Lastly, in discussions of religion, "animism" refers to the belief in indwelling souls or spirits, particularly so-called "primitive" religions that consider everything inhabited by spirits.}}

{{term|[[anthropocentrism]]}}
{{ghat|Also called '''homocentrism'''.}}
{{defn|The practice, conscious or otherwise, of regarding the existence and/or concerns of [[human being]]s as the central fact of the [[Universe]]. This is similar, but not identical, to the practice of relating all that happens in the universe to the human experience. To clarify, the first position concludes that the fact of human existence is the point of universal existence; the latter merely compares all activity to that of humanity, without making any [[teleology|teleological]] conclusions.}}

{{term|[[anthropomorphism]]}}
{{defn|A form of [[personification]] involving the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena. [[Animal]]s, forces of [[nature]], and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to God (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]. Anthropomorphism is similar to '''prosopopoeia''' (adopting the persona of another person).<ref name="Oxford">Blackburn, Simon. ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', Oxford University Press, 1994. This dictionary includes an entry for this word.</ref>}}

{{term|[[antinatalism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophical position that assigns a negative value to birth. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is morally bad.}}

{{term|[[Antinomianism]]}}
{{defn|In {{gli|theology}}, the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the [[religious law|laws]] of {{gli|ethics}} or {{gli|morality}} as presented by religious authorities. Antinomianism is the polar opposite of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]], the notion that obedience to a code of religious law is necessary for [[salvation]]. The term has become a point of contention among opposed religious authorities. Few groups or sects explicitly call themselves "antinomian", but the charge is often levelled by some sects against competing sects.}}

{{term|[[anti-realism]]}}
{{defn|Any position involving either the denial of the objective reality of entities of a certain type or the insistence that humans should be {{gli|agnosticism|agnostic}} about their real existence. Thus, people may speak of anti-realism with respect to other minds, the past, the future, [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[mathematics|mathematical entities]] (such as [[natural numbers]]), [[morality|moral categories]], the material world, or even thought.}}

{{term|[[Aristotelianism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical tradition that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school]]. Sometimes contrasted by critics with the rationalism and idealism of [[Plato]], Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories. Most particularly, Aristotelianism brings Plato's ideals down to Earth as goals and goods internal to natural species that are realized in activity. This is the characteristically Aristotelian idea of {{gli|teleology}}.}}

{{term|[[Arminianism]]}}
{{defn|A school of {{gli|soteriology|soteriological}} thought in [[Protestant]] [[Christian theology]] founded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Arminianism is closely related to [[Calvinism]] (or Reformed theology), and the two systems share both their histories and many doctrines in common.}}

{{term|[[asceticism]]}}
{{defn|A way of life characterised by an [[austerity|austere]] existence that refrains from worldly pleasures. Those who practice ascetic lifestyles often perceive their practices as [[virtue|virtuous]] and pursue them to achieve greater [[spirituality]]. In a more cynical context, asceticism may connote some form of self-mortification, ritual punishment of the body, or harsh renunciation of pleasure, though the word itself does not necessarily imply a negative connotation.}}

{{term|[[ascriptivism]]}}
{{defn|The view that human beings are to be held responsible for their actions even if {{gli|determinism}} is true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ismbook.com/ascriptivism.html |title=ascriptivism |publisher=Ismbook.com |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>}}

{{term|[[associationalism]]}}
{{defn|A political project where "human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically self-governing associations".<ref name="Hirst112">Smith, M. K.; ''[http://www.infed.org/association/b-assoc.htm association, la vie associative and lifelong learning]'' cites Hirst, P. [[#References|References]] page 112.</ref> Associationalism "gives priority to freedom in its scale of values, but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows"<ref name="Hirst112"/>}}

{{term|[[atheism]]}}
{{defn|The absence of belief in the existence of [[God]] or [[deity|gods]], thus contrasting with {{gli|theism}}; a condition of being without theistic beliefs. This definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods and those who maintain no beliefs at all regarding the existence of gods. However, narrower definitions often only qualify the former as atheism, with the latter falling under the more general (but rarely used) term {{gli|nontheism}}.}}

{{term|[[atomism]]}}
{{defn|The theory that all objects in the Universe are composed of very small, [[Eternity|indestructible]] elements called [[atom]]s. (This is the case for the Western [i.e., Greek] theories of atomism. Buddhists also have well-developed theories of atomism, which involve momentary, or non-eternal, atoms, that flash in and out of existence).}}

{{term|[[authoritarianism]]}}
{{defn|An [[organization]] or a [[State (polity)|state]] that enforces strong, and sometimes oppressive measures against those in its sphere of influence, generally without attempts at gaining their consent and often not allowing feedback on its policies. In an authoritarian state, citizens are subject to state authority in many aspects of their lives, including many that other [[political philosophy|political philosophies]] would see as matters of personal choice. There are various degrees of authoritarianism; even very democratic and liberal states will show authoritarianism to some extent, for example in areas of national security.}}

{{term|[[Surrealist automatism|automatism]]}}
{{ghat|Also called '''surrealist automatism'''.}}
{{defn|An artistic technique of spontaneous writing, drawing, or the like that is practiced without conscious aesthetic or moral self-censorship.}}

==B==
{{Glossary}}

{{term|[[behavioralism]]}}
{{defn|An approach in [[political science]] that seeks to provide an objective, quantified approach to explaining and predicting political behavior. It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the natural sciences. It should not be confused with the {{gli|behaviorism}} of [[psychology]].}}

{{term|[[behaviorism]]}}
{{defn|An approach to [[psychology]] based on the proposition that behavior can be researched [[Scientific method|scientifically]] without recourse to inner mental states. It is a form of {{gli|materialism}}, denying any independent significance for the mind. Its significance for psychological treatment has been profound, making it one of the pillars of [[pharmacological]] therapy. It should not be confused with the {{gli|behavioralism}} of [[political science]].}}

{{term|[[biologism]]}}
{{ghat|Also called '''biological determinism'''.}}
{{defn|The interpretation of humans and human life from a strictly [[biological]] point of view. It is closely related to and often used interchangeably with ''genetic determinism''.}}

{{term|[[Buddhism]]}}
{{defn|A [[dharmic religion]] and [[philosophy]] based on the teachings of the Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]]. The basic teachings of Buddhism have to do with the nature of suffering or dissatisfaction (''dukkha'') and its overcoming through ethical principles, meditation and wisdom (the Eightfold Path). Buddhism originated in [[India]], and is today largely followed in Southeast and East Asia, including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Myanmar]] and [[Thailand]]. Buddhism is divided into different sects and movements, of which the largest are the [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]].}}

{{Glossary}}

{{term|[[capitalism]]}}
{{defn|An [[economic system]] in which all or most of the [[means of production]] are [[private property|privately owned]] and [[management|operated]] (usually through [[employment|employing]] [[wage]] [[labour (economics)|labour]], and for [[Profit (economics)|profit]]), and in which the [[investment]] of [[capital (economics)|capital]] and the [[Production (economics)|production]], [[logistics|distribution]] and [[price]]s of [[commodities]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] are determined mainly in a [[free market]]. Capitalism has also been called ''[[laissez-faire]] economy'', ''[[free market]] economy'', ''free enterprise system'', ''[[economic liberalism]]'', and ''economic individualism''.<ref name="Oxford"/>}}

{{term|[[careerism]]}}
{{defn|The desire to advance one's own [[career]] as a sole aim in life, often at the expense of personal and social growth or development.}}

{{term|[[Cartesianism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy based on the ideas and works of the French philosopher [[René Descartes]].}}

{{term|[[Christian existential humanism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy that argues that humans can make choices based on {{gli|free will}} through [[Christianity|Christ's teachings]].}}

{{term|[[Christian existentialism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical movement shares similar views to existentialism with the added idea that the [[Judeo-Christian]] [[God]] plays an important part in coping with the underlying themes of human existence.}}

{{term|[[Christian humanism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy in which human freedom and individualism are compatible with the practice of [[Christianity]] or intrinsic in its doctrine. It is a combination of {{gli|humanism|humanist}} and Christian values.}}

{{term|[[Christian materialism]]}}
{{defn|The [[philosophy|philosophical]] view that the only thing that can truly be said to '[[existence|exist]]' is [[matter]] due to the [[Christianity|teachings of Christ]].}}

{{term|[[Christianity|Christianism]]}}
{{defn|Another name for ''Christianity'', the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion recognizing [[Jesus Christ]] as its founder and central figure. With more than two billion adherents, or about one-third of the total world population, it is the largest world religion. Its origins are intertwined with [[Judaism]], with which it shares much sacred lore, including the [[Old Testament]] (Hebrew Bible). Christianity is sometimes termed an [[Abrahamic religion]], along with [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]].}}

{{term|[[classical theism]]}}
{{defn|Traditional ideas of the {{gli|monotheism|monotheistic}} religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Classical theism holds that God is an absolute, [[eternity|eternal]], all-knowing ([[omniscient]]), all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]), and perfect being. God is related to the world as its cause, but is unaffected by the world (immutable). He is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] over the world, which exists relative to him as a temporal effect.}}

{{term|[[Classicism]]}}
{{defn|In the [[arts]], a high regard for [[classical antiquity]], as setting standards for taste that the classicist seeks to emulate. Classicism is usually contrasted with {{gli|Romanticism}}; the art of classicism typically seeks to be formal, restrained, and [[Apollo]]nian (nothing in excess) rather than [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] (excessive), in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s opposition. It can also refer to the other periods of classicism. In [[theater]], '''Classicism''' was developed by 17th century [[France|French]] [[playwright]]s from what they judged to be the rules of [[History of theater|Greek classical theater]], including the [[Classical unities]] of time, place and action.}}

{{term|[[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]}}
{{defn|no=1|In {{gli|ethics}}, cognitivism is the philosophical view that ethical sentences express propositions, and hence are capable of being true or false. More generally, cognitivism with respect to any area of discourse is the position that sentences used in that discourse are cognitive, that is, are meaningful and capable of being true or false.}}
{{defn|no=2|In [[psychology]], cognitivism is the approach to understanding the mind that argues that mental function can be understood as the 'internal' rule bound manipulation of symbols. See [[Cognitivism (psychology)]].}}

{{term|[[coherentism]]}}
{{defn|There are two distinct types of coherentism. One refers to the [[Truth#Coherence theory|coherence theory of truth]], which restricts true sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true {{gli|if and only if}} it is coherent with all or most of their other beliefs. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of [[Occam's razor]] are usually to be preferred. The second type of coherentism is the belief in the coherence [[theory of justification]], an {{gli|epistemology|epistemological}} theory opposing {{gli|foundationalism}} and offering a solution to the {{gli|regress argument}}. In this epistemological capacity, it is a theory about how {{gli|belief}} can be {{gli|theory of justification|justified}}.}}

{{term|[[Colbertism]]}}
{{defn|A variation of [[mercantilism]] which was applied in France between 1661 and 1683 by the superintendent of Finances [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]].}}

{{term|[[collectivism]]}}
{{defn|A theoretical or practical emphasis on the group, as opposed to (and seen by many of its opponents to be at the expense of) the individual. Some psychologists define collectivism as a syndrome of attitudes and behaviors based on the belief that the basic unit of survival lies within a group, not the individual. Collectivists typically hold that the "greater good" of the group, is more important than the good of any particular individual who is one part of that larger organization. Some collectivists argue that the individual ''incidentally'' serves his own interests by working for the benefit of the group.<ref name="Oxford"/>}}

{{term|[[communalism]]}}
{{defn|Outside of [[South Asia]], communalism involves a broad range of [[social movement]]s and [[social theories]] in some way centered upon the [[community]]. Communalism can take the form of communal living or communal property, among others. It is sometimes said to put the interests of the community above the interests of the individual, but this is usually only done on the principle that the community exists for the benefit of the individuals who participate in it, so the best way to serve the interests of the individual is through the interests of the community.}}

{{term|[[Communism]]}}
{{defn|A theoretical system of social organization and a political movement based on common ownership of the means of production. As a political movement, communism seeks to establish a classless society. A major force in world politics since the early 20th century, modern communism is generally associated with ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], according to which the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is replaced by a communist society in which the means of production are communally owned, such as through a [[gift economy]]. Often this process is said initiated by the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie (see Marxism), passes through a transitional period marked by the preparatory stage of socialism (see Leninism). Pure communism has never been implemented, it remains theoretical: communism is, in Marxist theory, the end-state, or the result of state-socialism. The word is now mainly understood to refer to the political, economic, and social theory of Marxist thinkers, or life under conditions of Communist party rule.<ref name="Oxford"/>}}

{{term|[[Communitarianism]]}}
{{defn|A group of related but distinct philosophies that began in the late 20th century, opposing aspects of liberalism and capitalism while advocating phenomena such as civil society. Not necessarily hostile to liberalism in the contemporary American sense of the word, communitarianism rather has a different emphasis, shifting the focus of interest toward communities and societies and away from the individual. The question of priority (individual or community) often has the largest impact in the most pressing ethical questions: health care, abortion, multiculturalism, hate speech, and so on.}}

{{term|[[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilism]]}}
{{defn|Also known as "soft determinism" and championed by [[David Hume]], is a theory that holds that {{gli|free will}} and {{gli|determinism}} are compatible. According to Hume, free will should not be understood as an absolute ability to have chosen differently under exactly the same inner and outer circumstances. Rather, it is a hypothetical ability to have chosen differently if one had been differently psychologically disposed by some different beliefs or desires. Hume also maintains that free acts are not uncaused (or mysteriously self-caused as [[Immanuel Kant]] would have it) but caused by people's choices as determined by their beliefs, desires, and by their characters. While a decision making process exists in Hume's determinism, this process is governed by a causal chain of events.}}

{{term|[[Comtism]]}}
{{defn|[[Auguste Comte]]'s positivistic philosophy that {{gli|metaphysics}} and {{gli|theology}} should be replaced by a hierarchy of sciences from [[mathematics]] at the base to [[sociology]] at the top.}}

{{term|[[conceptualism]]}}
{{defn|A {{gli|doctrine}} in philosophy intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], that [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]s exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial {{gli|reality}}.}}

{{term|[[Confucianism]]}}
{{defn|An East Asian ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage [[Confucius]]. It is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought that has had tremendous influence on the history of Chinese civilization down to the 21st century. Some have considered it to have been the "state religion" of imperial China.}}

{{term|[[consequentialism]]}}
{{defn|The belief that what ultimately matters in evaluating actions or policies of action are the consequences that result from choosing one action or policy rather than the alternative.}}

{{term|[[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]}}
{{defn|The view that reality, or at least humans' knowledge of it, is a value-laden subjective construction rather than a passive acquisition of objective features.}}

{{term|[[consumerism]]}}
{{defn|Attachment to material values or possessions.}}

{{term|[[contextualism]]}}
{{defn|A collection of views that emphasize the ''context'' in which an action, utterance or expression occurs, and argues that, in some important respect, the action, utterance or expression can only be understood within that context. Contextualist views hold that philosophically controversial concepts, such as "meaning <var>P</var>", "knowing that <var>P</var>", "having a reason to <var>A</var>", and possibly even "being true" or "being right" only have meaning relative to a specified context. Some philosophers hold that context-dependence may lead to {{gli|relativism}}; nevertheless, contextualist views are increasingly popular within philosophy.}}

{{term|[[conventionalism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophical attitude which holds that fundamental principles of a certain kind are grounded on (explicit or implicit) agreements in society, rather than on external reality. Although this attitude is commonly held with respect to the rules of grammar and the principles of etiquette, its application to the propositions of law, ethics, science, mathematics, and logic is more controversial.}}

{{term|[[Pantheism|cosmotheism]]}}
{{defn|Another name for {{gli|pantheism}}.}}

{{term|[[Creationism]]}}
{{ghat|Also called '''creation theology'''.}}
{{defn|The belief that humans, life, the Earth, and the [[Universe]] were created by the supernatural intervention of a [[God|supreme being]] or [[deity]]. This intervention may be seen either as an ''act of creation'' from nothing (''[[ex nihilo]]'') or the emergence of order from pre-existing chaos.<ref name="Oxford"/>}}

{{term|[[critical rationalism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophy that tenets of [[science]] should always be criticized and questioned so as to continually prove their worth.}}

{{term|[[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynicism]]}}
{{defn|Originally the philosophy of a group of ancient [[Greeks]] called the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], founded by [[Antisthenes]]. Nowadays the word generally refers to the opinions of those inclined to disbelieve in human sincerity, in [[virtue]], or in [[altruism]]: individuals who maintain that only self-interest motivates human behavior. A modern cynic typically has a highly contemptuous attitude towards social [[Norm (sociology)|norm]]s, especially those that serve more of a [[ritual]]istic purpose than a practical one, and will tend to dismiss a substantial proportion of popular {{gli|belief|beliefs}}, conventional {{gli|morality}}, and accepted [[wisdom]] as obsolete or irrelevant nonsense.}}

{{term|[[Darwinism]]}}
{{defn|The theory of biological evolution developed by English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. See also ''[[History of evolutionary thought]].''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/darwinism/ |title=''Darwinism'' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 26, 2015 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), Stanford University |access-date= January 20, 2017}}</ref>}}

{{term|[[day-age creationism]]}}
{{defn|A type of [[Old Earth creationism]], it is an effort to reconcile Creation as presented in  [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] with modern scientific theories on the age of the Universe. It holds that the [[Hexameron|six days]] referred to in Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but are much longer periods, thus interpreting Genesis as cosmic [[evolution]].}}

{{term|[[deconstruction]]ism}}
{{defn|A school and a set of methods of textual criticism aimed at understanding the assumptions and ideas that form the basis for thought and belief. Also called "deconstruction", its central concern is a radical critique of the {{gli|metaphysics}} of the Western philosophical tradition, in which it identifies a [[Phallogocentrism|logicentrism]] or "[[metaphysics of presence]]" which holds that speech-thought (the ''logos'') is a privileged, ideal, and self-present entity, through which all discourse and meaning derive. This logocentrism is the primary target of deconstruction.}}

{{term|[[deductivism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy that holds that scientific inquiry proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that could conceivably be falsified by a test on observable data.}}

{{term|[[defeatism]]}}
{{defn|The acceptance of and contentedness with defeat without struggle. In everyday use, defeatism has negative connotation, and is often linked to treason and pessimism. The term is commonly used in the context of war: a soldier can be a defeatist if he or she refuses to fight because he or she thinks that the fight will be lost for sure or that it is not worth fighting for some other reason. The term can also be used in other fields, like politics, sports, psychology and philosophy.}}

{{term|[[deism]]}}
{{defn|The view that [[reason]], rather than [[revelation]] or [[tradition]], should be the basis of belief in God. Deists reject both organized and revealed religion and maintain that reason is the essential element in all knowledge. For a "rational basis for religion" they refer to the [[cosmological argument]] (first cause argument), the [[teleological argument]] (argument from design), and other aspects of what was called ''[[natural theology|natural religion]]''. Deism has become identified with the classical belief that God created but does not intervene in the world, though this is not a necessary component of deism. A form of monotheism in which it is believed that one god exists. However, a deist rejects the idea that this god intervenes in the world. Hence any notion of special [[revelation]] is impossible, and the nature of god can only be known through reason and observation from nature. A deist thus rejects the miraculous, and the claim to knowledge made for religious groups and texts.}}

Combines deism with {{gli|pantheism}} to propose a deistic God that becomes a pantheistic Universe; coined by [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' (1859).}}

{{term|[[panentheism]]}}
{{defn|The theological position that [[God]] is [[Immanence|immanent]] within the [[Universe]], but also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] it. It is distinguished from {{gli|pantheism}}, which holds that God is synonymous with the material universe. In panentheism, God is viewed as creator and/or animating force behind the universe, and the source of [[universal morality]]. The term is closely associated with the [[Logos]] of [[Greek philosophy]] in the works of [[Herakleitos]], which pervades the [[cosmos]] and whereby all things were made.}}

{{term|[[panpsychism]]}}
{{defn|Either the view that all parts of matter involve mind, or the more [[holism|holistic]] view that the whole universe is an organism that possesses a mind. It is thus a stronger and more ambitious view than [[hylozoism]], which holds only that all things are alive.

{{term|[[pantheism]]}}
{{defn|The view that everything is of an all-encompassing immanent God; or that the universe, or nature, and God are equivalent. More detailed definitions tend to emphasize the idea that natural law, existence and/or the universe (the sum total of all that was, is, or shall be) is represented or personified in the theological principle of 'God'. The existence of a transcendent supreme extraneous to nature is denied. Depending on how this is understood, such a view may be presented as tantamount to [[atheism]], {{gli|deism}} or {{gli|theism}}.}}

{{defn|In {{gli|epistemology}}, the approach wherein one asks the question "What do we know?" ''before'' asking "How do we know?" The term appears in [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s "The [[Problem of the Criterion]]" and in the work of his student, [[Ernest Sosa]] ("The Raft and the Pyramid: Coherence versus Foundations in the Theory of Knowledge").

{{term|[[pessimism]]}}
{{defn|The belief that the experienced world is the worst possible. It involves a general belief that things are bad, and tend to become worse; or that looks to the eventual triumph of evil over good; it contrasts with optimism, the contrary belief in the goodness and betterment of things generally. A common conundrum illustrates optimism versus pessimism with the question - does one regard a given glass of water as: "Is the glass half empty or half full?" Conventional wisdom expects optimists to reply with half full and pessimists to respond with half empty, but this is not always the case.}}

{{defn|In {{gli|epistemology}} and the [[philosophy of perception]], the view that physical objects do not exist as things in themselves but only as perceptual [[phenomena]] or sensory stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated in time and in space. In particular, phenomenalism reduces discussion about physical objects in the external world to discussion about "bundles of sense-data".}}

{{term|[[philosophical theism]]}}
{{defn|The belief that [[God]] exists (or must exist), independent of the teaching or revelation of any particular [[religion]]. Some philosophical theists are persuaded of God's existence by philosophical arguments, while others consider themselves to have a religious faith that need not be, or could not be, supported by rational argument.}}

{{term|[[philosophy]]}}
{{defn|A broad field of inquiry concerning {{gli|knowledge}}, in which the definition of knowledge itself is one of the subjects investigated. Philosophy is the pursuit of [[wisdom]], spanning the nature of the [[Universe]] and [[human nature]] (of the mind and the body) as well as the relationships between these and between people. It explores what and how people come to know, including [[existence]] itself, and how that knowledge is reliably and usefully represented and communicated between and among humans, whether in thought, by language, or with mathematics. Philosophy is the predecessor and complement of [[science]]. It develops notions about the issues that underlie science and ponders the nature of thought itself. The [[scientific method]], which involves repeated observations of the results of controlled experiments, is an available and highly successful philosophical [[methodology]]. Within fields of study that are concerned directly with humans (economics, psychology, sociology, and so forth), in which experimental methodologies are generally not available, sub-disciplines of philosophy have been developed to provide a rational basis for study in the respective fields.}}

{{term|[[physicalism]]}}
{{defn|The {{gli|metaphysics|metaphysical}} position asserting that everything that exists has one or more [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no kinds of things other than physical things. In contemporary philosophy, physicalism is most frequently associated with the {{gli|philosophy of mind}}, in particular the {{gli|mind-body problem}}, in which it holds that the mind is a physical thing in some sense. Physicalism is also called "materialism", but the term "physicalism" is preferable because it has evolved with the physical sciences to incorporate far more sophisticated notions of physicality than [[matter]]; for example, wave/particle relationships and unseen, non-material forces.}}

{{defn|A belief in the existence of universals as articulated by [[Plato]]. Platonic realism is often called Plato's theory of Forms.}}

{{term|[[Platonism]]}}

The belief in many gods does not contradict or preclude also believing in an all-powerful all-knowing supreme being.}}

{{term|[[positivism]]}}

{{defn|A philosophical movement characterized by the {{gli|postmodernism|postmodern}} criticism and analysis of Western philosophy. Beginning as a critique of [[Continental philosophy]], it was heavily influenced by {{gli|phenomenology}}, {{gli|structuralism}}, and {{gli|existentialism}}, and by the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. It was also influenced to some degree by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later criticisms of [[analytic philosophy]]. Within postmodern philosophy, there are numerous interrelated fields, including [[deconstruction]] and several fields beginning with the prefix "post-", such as [[post-structuralism]], [[post-Marxism]], and [[post-feminism]]. In particular postmodern philosophy has spawned a huge literature of [[critical theory]].}}

{{term|[[pragmatism]]}}
{{defn|A philosophy that originated in the United States in the late 19th century. Pragmatism is characterized by the insistence on consequences, utility and practicality as vital components of meaning and truth. Pragmatism objects to the view that human concepts and intellect represent reality, and therefore stands in opposition to both {{gli|formalism|formalist}} and {{gli|rationalism|rationalist}} schools of philosophy. Rather, pragmatism holds that it is only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that theories acquire significance, and only with a theory's success in this struggle that it ''becomes'' true.}}

{{term|[[Prescriptivism (philosophy)|prescriptivism]]}}
{{defn|A [[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] theory about the [[Semantics|semantical]] content of moral statements, introduced by the philosopher [[R. M. Hare]] in his book ''The Language of Morals''. It holds that moral statements functions similarly to [[Moral imperative|imperative]]s. For example, according to prescriptivism, the statement "Killing is wrong" means something like "You shouldn't kill". What it expresses is an ''imperative''.}}

{{term|[[probabilism]]}}
{{defn|A practical doctrine that gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the {{gli|skepticism|skeptics}} of the [[New Academy]] (''see [[skepticism]] and [[Carneades]].''). Opposed to "probabilism" is "probabiliorism" (Latin ''probabilior'', "more likely"), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy that side is presumably right. [[academic skepticism|Academic skeptics]] accept probabilism, while [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|Pyrrhonian skeptics]] do not.}}

{{defn|The philosophy that holds that human knowledge can be expanded solely through philosophical study.}}

{{term|[[pyrrhonian skepticism]]}}
{{defn|A Hellenistic school of skepticism that inquired about, but did not reject, dogmatic beliefs because the lack of belief is not the same as disbelief.}}

{{term|[[pyrrhonism]]}}
{{defn|A [[Hellenistic philosophy]] that was the earliest Western school of [[philosophical skepticism]]. Like the other Hellenistic philosophies, its objective was [[eudaimonia]], which in Pyrrhonism is achieved by attaining [[ataraxia]] (i.e., a state of being unperturbed). Ataraxia is achieved through coming to see that all assertions with regard to non-evident propositions (i.e., [[dogma]]s) are ultimately unprovable, thus the attitude one should have of them is to [[suspension of judgment|suspend judgment]] (i.e., [[epoche]]).}}

{{term|[[Pythagoreanism]]}}
{{defn|The set of {{gli|esotericism|esoteric}} and {{gli|metaphysics|metaphysical}} beliefs held by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Pythagoras]] and his followers (known as the Pythagoreans), who were considerably influenced by [[mathematics]].

Scholasticism attempted to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. The primary purpose of scholasticism was to find the answer to a question or resolve a contradiction.

{{ghat|Sometimes abbreviated '''>H''' or '''H+'''.}} 
{{defn|An emergent philosophy analysing or favouring the use of science and technology, especially neurotechnology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, to overcome human limitations and improve the human condition. Dr. [[Robin Hanson]] describes it as "the idea that new technologies are likely to change the world so much in the next century or two that our descendants will in many ways no longer be 'human'."}}

{{term|[[transcendental idealism]]}}
{{defn|The philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] and later Kantian and {{gli|German idealism|German idealist}} philosophers, according to which human experience is not of things as they are in themselves, but of those things as they appear to human beings. It differs from standard (empirical) {{gli|idealism}} in that it does not claim that the objects of human experience would be in any sense ''within'' the mind. The idea is that whenever humans experience something, they experience it as it is ''for themselves'': the object is real as well as mind-independent, but is, in a sense, altered by people's cognition (by the [[Category (Kant)|categories]] and the forms of sensibility, space and time). Transcendental idealism denies that people could have knowledge of the thing in itself; the opposite view is sometimes called {{gli|transcendental realism}}.}}

{{term|[[transcendentalism]]}}
{{defn|A group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that advocates that there is an ideal [[spirituality|spiritual]] state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through a knowledgeable intuitive awareness that is conditional upon the individual. The concept emerged in [[New England]] in the early-to mid-19th century. It is sometimes called "''American'' ''Transcendentalism''" to distinguish it from other uses of the word ''[[transcendentals|transcendental]]''. It began as a protest against the general state of culture and [[society]] at the time, and in particular, the state of [[intellectualism]] at [[Harvard]] and the doctrine of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church that was taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. The term ''transcendentalism'' sometimes serves as shorthand for "[[transcendental idealism]]". Another alternative meaning for ''transcendentalism'' is the classical philosophy that God transcends the manifest world. As [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John Scotus Erigena]] put it to [[Franks|Frankish]] king [[Charles the Bald]] in the year 840 A.D., "We do not know what God is. God himself doesn't know what He is because He is not anything. Literally God is not, because He transcends being."}}
