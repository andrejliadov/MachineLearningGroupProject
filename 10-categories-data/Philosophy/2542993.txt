__NOTOC__
'''Divine law''' comprises any body of [[law]] that is perceived as deriving from a [[Transcendence (religion)| transcendent]] source, such as the [[will of God]] or [[gods]] - in contrast to [[man-made law]] or to [[secular law]]. According with [[Angelos Chaniotis]] and [[Rudolph F. Peters]], Divine laws are typically perceived as superior to man-made laws,{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p= 85}}{{sfn|Peters|1988|p= 244}} sometimes due to an assumption that their source has resources beyond human knowledge and human reason.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p= 86}} Believers in divine laws might accord them greater [[authority]] than other laws,{{sfn|Anghie|1996|p= 323}}{{sfn|Molano|2009|p= 212}}{{sfn|Peters|1988|p= 244}} for example by assuming that divine law cannot be changed by human authorities.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p= 244}}

According with Chaniotis, Divine laws are noted for their apparent inflexibility.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p= 67}} The introduction of interpretation into divine law is a controversial issue, since believers place high significance on adhering to the law precisely.{{sfn|Chaniotis|1996|p=75}} Opponents to the application of divine law typically deny that it is purely divine and point out human influences in the law. These opponents characterize such laws as belonging to a particular cultural [[tradition]]. Adherents of divine law, on the other hand, are sometimes reluctant to adapt inflexible divine laws to [[Indigenization |cultural context]]s.{{sfn|Peters|1988|p=244f}}

[[Medieval Christianity]] assumed the existence of three kinds of laws: divine law, [[natural law]], and man-made law.{{sfn|Anghie|1996|p= 323}} [[Theologians]] have substantially debated the scope of natural law, with the [[Age of Enlightenment| Enlightenment]] encouraging greater use of [[reason]] and expanding the scope of natural law and marginalizing divine law in a process of [[secularization]].{{sfn|Anghie|1996|p= 323f}}{{Additional citation needed|date= May 2018|reason= Anghie doesn't say everything said here.}}
Since the authority of divine law is rooted in its source, the origins and transmission-history of divine law are important.{{sfn | Weiss | 2010 |loc= Part II. The Indicators of God's Law}}{{efn|See, for example, in Judaism [[Biblical Mount Sinai]], [[Shavuot#Giving of the Torah]], [[Yitro (parsha)]], and the [[Letter of Aristeas]]. And note disputes over [[Biblical canon]]icity.}}

Conflicts frequently{{quantify|date=April 2020}} arise between [[secular]] understandings of [[justice]] or [[morality]] and divine law.<ref>

[[Religious law]], such as [[canon law]], includes both divine law and additional interpretations, logical extensions, and traditions.{{sfn|Molano|2009|p= 212}}

==Treatise on Law==
{{main|Treatise on Law}}
In [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''Treatise on Law'', divine law comes only from revelation or [[scripture]], hence [[biblical law]], and is necessary for human [[salvation]]. According to Aquinas, divine law must not be confused with natural law. Divine law is mainly and mostly natural law, but it can also be [[positive law]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}
