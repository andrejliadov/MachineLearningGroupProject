{{Nihongo|'''''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'''''|風の谷のナウシカ|Kaze no Tani no Naushika|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[anime]] director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It tells the story of [[Nausicaä (anime and manga character)|Nausicaä]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.

Prior to creating ''Nausicaä'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausicaä'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay#Minamata disease|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.

Since its initial serialization, ''Nausicaä'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausicaä'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
{{See also|List of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind characters}}

The story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)

===Plot===
[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: "''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''..."]]

[[Nausicaä (anime and manga character)|Nausicaä]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.

When the Valley goes to war, she takes her ailing father's place as military chief. The leaders of the Periphery states are vassals to the Torumekian Emperor and are obliged to send their forces to help when he invades the neighboring Dorok lands. The Torumekians have a strong military, but the Doroks, whose ancestors bioengineered the progenitors of the Sea of Corruption, have developed a genetically modified version of a [[mold]] from the Sea of Corruption. When the Doroks introduce this mold into battle, its rapid growth and mutation result in a daikaisho (roughly translated from Japanese as "great [[Tidal bore|tidal wave]]"), which floods across the land and draws the insects into the battle, killing as many Doroks as Torumekians. In doing so, the Sea of Corruption spreads across most of the Dorok nation, uprooting or killing vast numbers of civilians and rendering most of the land uninhabitable.

The Ohmu and other forest insects respond to this development and sacrifice themselves to pacify the expansion of the mold, which is beyond human control. Nausicaä resigns herself to joining in their fate. However, one of the Ohmu encapsulates her inside itself in a protective serum, allowing her to survive the mold. She is recovered by her companions, people she met after leaving the Valley and who have joined her on her [[quest]] for a peaceful coexistence. The fact that the mold can be manipulated and used as a weapon disturbs Nausicaä. Her treks into the forest have already taught her that the Sea of Corruption is actually purifying the polluted land. The Forest People, humans who have learned to live in harmony with the Sea of Corruption, confirm this is the purpose of the Sea of Corruption and one of them shows Nausicaä a vision of the restored Earth at the center of the forest. Nausicaä travels deeper into Dorok territory, where her coming has long been prophesied, to seek those responsible for manipulating the mold. There, she encounters a dormant [[List of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind characters#God Warriors|God Warrior]] who, upon activation, assumes she is his mother and places his destructive powers at her disposal. Faced with this power and its single minded and childlike visions of the world, she engages the creature, names him and persuades him to travel with her to Shuwa, the Holy City of the Doroks.

Here she enters the Crypt, a giant monolithic construct from before the Seven Days of Fire. She learns that the last scientists of the industrial era had foreseen the end of their civilization. They created the Sea of Corruption to clean the land of [[pollution]], altered human [[gene]]s to cope with the changed ecology, stored their own personalities inside the Crypt and waited for the day when they could re-emerge, leaving the world at the mercy of their artificially created caretaker. However, their continual manipulation of the population and the world's environment is at odds with Nausicaä's belief in the natural order. She argues that mankind's behaviour has not been improved significantly by the activities of those inside the crypt. Strife and cycles of violence have continued to plague the world in the thousand years following their interference. She orders the God-Warrior to destroy its progenitors, forcing humanity to live or die without further influence from the old society's technology.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals. Bioengineered doesn't really need hyphenation (Otherwise also change Wikipedia article name and other entries for bioengineering here. The manipulation and weaponisation of the mold is what disturbs Nausicaa, not the attributes of the mold itself perse at this point. See for example her puzzlement (粘菌はあれもそうなの? "And the mold too?") on Universal Page number 667. There are still errors in this Plot section.-->

==Development==

===Precursors and early development===
Miyazaki began his professional career in the animation industry as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]] at [[Toei Animation|Toei]] in 1963 but soon had additional responsibilities in the creation processes.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=30}} While working primarily on animation projects for TV and Cinema, he also pursued his dream of creating manga.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=39}} In conjunction with his work as a [[Key frame|key animator]] on [[The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots|''Puss 'n Boots'']] his manga adaptation of the same title was published in 1969. That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[Dōbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}

After the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kanō |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausicaä: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | 戦国魔城 | Sengoku ma-jō }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}

An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: "Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, "''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it."{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode. The illustrated notice introduced the new series' main character, title and concept.<ref name="Origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaa_origin.html | title=Origin | last=Ryan | first=Scott | work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | archive-date=September 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180201/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaa_origin.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The first chapter, 18 pages, was published in the February issue. Miyazaki would continue developing the story for another 12 years with frequent interruptions along the way.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=3}}

===Influences===
[[File:1878 Frederick Leighton - Nausicaa.jpg|thumb|298x298px|The titular character of the manga was named after the Greek princess, [[Nausicaa]], whose name means "burner of ships".<ref>Shipley, Joseph T. ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011, p. 160</ref>]]
Miyazaki had given other names to the main character during development, but he settled on Nausicaä based on the name of the [[Nausicaa|Greek princess of the same name]] from the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as portrayed in [[Bernard Evslin]]'s dictionary of Greek mythology, translated into Japanese by Minoru Kobayashi.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki |1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=150|3a1=WebcatPlus|3y=1979|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=2006|4p=150}}{{efn|Mentioned as {{Nihongo | Minoru Kobayashi | 小林稔 | Kobayashi Minoru|}} in the Japanese Webcat Plus database and in ''Hayao Miyazaki's Watercolor Impressions''.

Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea]]'', [[Brian Aldiss]]'s ''[[Hothouse (novel)|Hothouse]]'', [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]'', and [[J.R.R Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=48}} [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965) was also a major source of inspiration for ''Nausicaä''.<ref name="hm">{{cite book |title=Hayao Miyazaki Master of Japanese Animation |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |author=McCarthy, Helen |year=1999 |pages=72–92 |isbn=1880656418}}</ref>

Among the inspirations for the environmental themes Miyazaki has mentioned the [[Minamata Bay]] mercury pollution.{{sfnm|1a1=Cavallaro|1y=2006|1p=48}} The Sea of Corruption is based on the forests on the Japanese island of [[Yakushima]] and the marshes of the [[Sivash]], or Rotten Sea, in Ukraine.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Uratani|2y=2001}}{{efn|The Japanese name for the Sea of Corruption {{Nihongo|腐海| fukai|}}, consists of the kanji for decay and sea.

Miyazaki mentioned its origin in the interview published in Watercolor Impressions.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Adachi|2y=2012|2p=184}} }} The works of botanist {{Interlanguage link multi|Nakao Sasuke|ja|3=中尾佐助|lt=Sasuke Nakao}} were among Miyazaki's inspirations for the environment of the story. Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he was asked about the place ''Nausicaä'' takes in the ''ecology boom'', explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no Maō|ja|3=沙漠の魔王}}'' {{nihongo|沙漠の魔王|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences. [[Kentaro Takekuma]] has also observed this continuity in Miyazaki's work and places it within the tradition of illustrated stories, {{Nihongo3||絵物語|emonogatari}}, and manga Miyazaki read while growing up, pointing out the influence of Fukushima on Miyazaki's ''People of the Desert'' which he in turn identifies as a precursor for both ''The Journey of Shuna'', created in watercolour and printed in colour, and ''Nausicaä''.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=194|2a1=McCarthy|2y=1999|2p=27|3a1=McCarthy|3y=2006|3p=70|4a1=Takekuma|4y=2008|5a1=Kaku|5y=2012}}

===Creation===
Miyazaki drew the ''Nausicaä'' chapters primarily in pencil. The work was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage September 10|1y=1983|1p=182|2a1=Art|2y=1984|2p=182|3a1=Miyazaki|3y=1996|3p=94|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=2007|4p=94| |5a1=Saitani|5y=1995|5p=9}}{{efn|In the interview with Ryo Saitani, published in 1995, Miyazaki very briefly mentions discussing the use of pencil with [[Hideo Ogata]], chief editor of ''Animage'' at the time, in the context of their talks on the development of the manga and his desire to quit creating it. Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausicaä and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausicaä in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausicaä'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[Mœbius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}

Takekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}

Miyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tankōbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the ''tankōbon'' spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.<ref name="Ryan(Comparison)">{{Cite web | title=Nausicaä Manga Comparison | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | last=Ryan | first=Scott | publisher=Nausicaa.net | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | archive-date=May 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514214741/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

Miyazaki has said that the lengthy creation process of the ''Nausicaä'' manga, repeatedly tackling its themes as the story evolved over the years, not only changed the material but also affected his personal views on life and changed his political perspectives. He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausicaä manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausicaä providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15–16}} Marc Hairston notes that, “Tellingly, Miyazaki’s first film after finishing the ''Nausicaä'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.”{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177–178}}

===Localization===
''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}

Studio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language "Editor's Choice" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong. The touch-up art and lettering for the Viz Media deluxe two-volume box set was also done by Walden Wong.<ref>{{cite book

Eriko Ogihara-Schuck, lecturer in American studies at the [[Technical University of Dortmund]], conducted a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language manga and anime with their English translations, and demonstrates that American translations have resulted in the "[[Christianity|Christian]]izing of Miyazaki's [[animism]]". She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this "Christianizing" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, "by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133–146}}

The manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442–445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name="chapter_guide">{{cite web| url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html| title=Chapter guide| last=Ryan| first=Scott| work=Nausicaa.net| publisher=Team Ghiblink| accessdate=December 30, 2008| archive-date=December 8, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208085139/http://nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html| url-status=dead}}</ref>

English translations are published in North America and the United Kingdom by [[Viz Media]]. As of 2013 Viz Media has released the manga in five different formats. Initially the manga was printed flipped and with English translations of the sound effects. Publication of English editions began in 1988 with the release of episodes from the story under the title ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind'' in the "Viz Select Comics" series. This series ran until 1996. It consists of 27 issues. In October 1990 Viz Media also started publishing the manga as ''Viz Graphic Novel, Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind''. The last of the seven Viz Graphic Novels in this series appeared in January 1997. Viz Media reprinted the manga in four volumes titled ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection'', which were released from October 1995 to October 1997. A box set of the four volumes was later released in January 2000. In 2004 Viz Media re-released the seven-volume format in an "Editors Choice" edition titled ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind''. In this version the manga is left unflipped and the sound effects are left untranslated.<ref name="nausicaaworld">{{Cite web | title = Nausicaä Around the World | url = http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaaworld.html | publisher = Nausicaa.net | accessdate = December 30, 2012 | archive-date = September 22, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180212/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaaworld.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Viz Media released its own deluxe two-volume box set on November 6, 2012.<ref name="Viz-box-set">{{Cite web | title=VIZ Media Announces the Release of Nausicaä Manga Box Set | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-01/viz-media-announces-the-release-of-nausicaa-manga-box-set | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=November 25, 2012 | archive-date=September 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180203/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-01/viz-media-announces-the-release-of-nausicaa-manga-box-set | url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)}}

When serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausicaä film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name="Animerica(1993)">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausicaä manga " ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kanō|2y=2007|2p=64}}

In his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausicaä'' film had been playing in theatres at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=少年ケニヤ}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=山川惣治}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor "would have been devoured" by Miyazaki's ''Nausicaä'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name="Takeuchi(1995)">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002 |orig-year=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:戦後マンガ50年史 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga |url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=ja |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th |page=49 |isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115142/http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The story of the ''Nausicaä'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name="chapter_guide" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausicaä's'' "{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|コペルニクス的転回|koperunikusutekitenkai}}", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausicaä'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}

In ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausicaä'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that "Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausicaä'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausicaä's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausicaä's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is "dominated by animism". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausicaä'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausicaä's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133–146}}

No chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausicaä Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name="chapter_guide" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausicaä, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:アニメージュヒストリカ 第19回 1984年の「アニメージュ」 | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=ja | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archive-date=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}

''Nausicaä'' was included by Stephen Betts in the comic book–centered reference book ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die'', who said of the series:

<blockquote>Miyazaki's sepia-inked art is precise, delicate, and detailed. He achieves an incredible dynamism and motion across the page. The rich array of characters, multiple themes, and densely interwoven plot ensure that the message, while worthy, is nuanced. Exploring conflict, politics, and religion, Miyazaki achieves a grand, epic sweep that is rarely seen in comics, and particularly in such a stunning action comic. Yet he also manages to keep the whole story accessible and relevant through the human qualities of his timeless heroine.{{sfnm|1a1=Gravett |1y=2011|1p=447}}</blockquote>

Setre, writing for Japanator, said "Nasuicaa {{sic}} is an amazing manga. And no matter what you may think of Miyazaki this story deserves to be read. It has great characters (some of which could star in their own series), a great sense of adventure and scale, and an awesome story."<ref>{{Cite web| title = Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind Reviews (Vol.1-7)| url = http://www.japanator.com/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-review-vols-1-7--18209.phtml| publisher = Japanator| accessdate = November 15, 2012| archive-date = September 22, 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180232/https://www.siliconera.com/| url-status = live}}</ref>

In his July 14, 2001 review of Viz Media's four volume ''Perfect Collection'' edition, of the manga, Michael Wieczorek of Ex.org compared the series to ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' stating, "Both stories deal with man's struggle with nature and with each other, as well as with the effects war and violence have on society." Wieczoek gave a mixed review on the detail of the artwork in this, {{convert|8.08|x|5.56|inch|cm|abbr=on}} sized, edition, stating, "It is good because the panels are just beautiful to look at. It is bad because the size of the manga causes the panels within to be very small, and some of these panels are just crammed with detailed artwork. That can sometimes cause some confusion about what is happening to which person during an action scene."<ref name="nausicaaworld"/>{{sfnm|1a1= Wieczorek |1y=2001}} The ''Perfect Collection'' edition of the manga is out of print.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=2011}}

In the ''Coda [[On Your Mark]] and Nausicaa'' to their April 1999 lecture series on [[manga]], [[anime]] and the works of Miyazaki at the [[University of Dallas]] Pamela Gossin, Professor of Arts and Humanities, and guest instructor Marc Hairston, research scientist in the William B.

Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the music video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of [[William Shakespeare]]'s symbolic liberation of his characters, through [[Prospero]]'s release of his servant [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] in his play [[The Tempest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gossin|1a2=Hairston|1y=1999}} Miyazaki started creating ''On Your Mark'' the same month the seventh volume of the ''Nausicaä'' manga was released.{{sfnm|1a1=Kanō|1y=2007|1p=180}}

Kyle Anderson of ''[[Nerdist]]'' describes the setting as a [[steampunk]] [[post-apocalypse]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Miyazaki's NAUSICAÄ is the Best Anime We Never Talk About |url=https://nerdist.com/article/nausicaa-miyazaki-35th-anniversary/ |accessdate=20 April 2020 |website=[[Nerdist]] |publisher=[[Nerdist Industries]] |date=March 8, 2019 |archive-date=April 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425053346/https://nerdist.com/article/nausicaa-miyazaki-35th-anniversary/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Philip Boyes of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' describes the technology in ''Nausicaä'' and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' as [[dieselpunk]].<ref name="Eurogamer">{{cite news |last1=Boyes |first1=Philip |title=Hot Air and High Winds: A Love Letter to the Fantasy Airship |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-08-hot-air-and-high-winds-a-love-letter-to-the-fantasy-airship |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=8 February 2020 |archive-date=May 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200509234743/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-08-hot-air-and-high-winds-a-love-letter-to-the-fantasy-airship |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Nihongo|'''''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'''''|風の谷のナウシカ|Kaze no Tani no Naushika|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[anime]] director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It tells the story of [[Nausicaä (anime and manga character)|Nausicaä]], a princess of a small kingdom on a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Earth]] with a toxic [[ecosystem|ecological system]], who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an [[environmental disaster]] threatens humankind.

Prior to creating ''Nausicaä'', Miyazaki had worked as an animator for [[Toei Animation]], [[Nippon Animation]] and [[TMS Entertainment|Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature film debut, ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro|Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro]]'' (1979). After working on an aborted adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s ''Rowlf'' for TMS and the publishing firm [[Tokuma Shoten]], he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma's monthly magazine ''[[Animage]]'', initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. ''Nausicaä'' was influenced by the Japanese folk tale ''[[The Lady who Loved Insects|The Princess who Loved Insects]]'', [[Nausicaa|a similarly-named character]] from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', the [[Minamata Bay#Minamata disease|Minamata Bay mercury pollution]], and various works of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] by Western writers, among other sources. The manga was serialized intermittently in ''Animage'' from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in [[North America]] by [[Viz Media]] from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 [[comic book]] issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.

Since its initial serialization, ''Nausicaä'' has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where at least 11 million copies have been sold. The manga and the 1984 [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|film adaptation]], written and directed by Miyazaki following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters,<!-- 'Following the serialization of' is probably more appropriate that 'based on', since this source (http://www.utdallas.edu/research/spacesciences/hairston/nausicaamanga_film.html - from the University of Dallas) covers the areas of the manga the film adapts and since this source (http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html) shows that chapters 15 and 16 are the opening chapters of vol. 3, none of which was adapted for the film. --> received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of ''Nausicaä'' are also credited for the foundation of [[Studio Ghibli]], the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
{{See also|List of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind characters}}

The story is set in the future at the closing of the [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]] era, 1,000 years after the Seven Days of Fire, a cataclysmic global war, in which [[Industrialisation|industrial civilization]] self-destructed. Although humanity survived, the land surface of the Earth is still heavily polluted and the seas have become poisonous. Most of the world is covered by the Sea of Corruption, a toxic forest of fungal life and plants which is steadily encroaching on the remaining open land. It is protected by large mutant insects, including the massive Ohmu. Humanity clings to survival in the polluted lands beyond the forest, periodically engaging in bouts of internecine fighting for the scarce resources that remain. The ability for space travel has been lost but the earth-bound remnants of humanity can still use [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[powered aircraft]] for exploration, transportation and warfare. (Powered [[Vehicles|land vehicles]] are mostly nonexistent, with humanity regressed to dependence on [[Working animal|riding animals and beasts-of-burden]].)

===Plot===
[[File:Nausicaa2p121.jpg|thumb|The Dorok prophecy: "''And that one shall come to you garbed in raiment of blue and descending upon a field of gold''..."]]

[[Nausicaä (anime and manga character)|Nausicaä]] is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, a state on the periphery of what was once known as Eftal, a kingdom destroyed by the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous forest, 300 years ago. An inquisitive young woman, she explores the territories surrounding the Valley on a jet-powered glider, and studies the Sea of Corruption.

When the Valley goes to war, she takes her ailing father's place as military chief. The leaders of the Periphery states are vassals to the Torumekian Emperor and are obliged to send their forces to help when he invades the neighboring Dorok lands. The Torumekians have a strong military, but the Doroks, whose ancestors bioengineered the progenitors of the Sea of Corruption, have developed a genetically modified version of a [[mold]] from the Sea of Corruption. When the Doroks introduce this mold into battle, its rapid growth and mutation result in a daikaisho (roughly translated from Japanese as "great [[Tidal bore|tidal wave]]"), which floods across the land and draws the insects into the battle, killing as many Doroks as Torumekians. In doing so, the Sea of Corruption spreads across most of the Dorok nation, uprooting or killing vast numbers of civilians and rendering most of the land uninhabitable.

The Ohmu and other forest insects respond to this development and sacrifice themselves to pacify the expansion of the mold, which is beyond human control. Nausicaä resigns herself to joining in their fate. However, one of the Ohmu encapsulates her inside itself in a protective serum, allowing her to survive the mold. She is recovered by her companions, people she met after leaving the Valley and who have joined her on her [[quest]] for a peaceful coexistence. The fact that the mold can be manipulated and used as a weapon disturbs Nausicaä. Her treks into the forest have already taught her that the Sea of Corruption is actually purifying the polluted land. The Forest People, humans who have learned to live in harmony with the Sea of Corruption, confirm this is the purpose of the Sea of Corruption and one of them shows Nausicaä a vision of the restored Earth at the center of the forest. Nausicaä travels deeper into Dorok territory, where her coming has long been prophesied, to seek those responsible for manipulating the mold. There, she encounters a dormant [[List of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind characters#God Warriors|God Warrior]] who, upon activation, assumes she is his mother and places his destructive powers at her disposal. Faced with this power and its single minded and childlike visions of the world, she engages the creature, names him and persuades him to travel with her to Shuwa, the Holy City of the Doroks.

Here she enters the Crypt, a giant monolithic construct from before the Seven Days of Fire. She learns that the last scientists of the industrial era had foreseen the end of their civilization. They created the Sea of Corruption to clean the land of [[pollution]], altered human [[gene]]s to cope with the changed ecology, stored their own personalities inside the Crypt and waited for the day when they could re-emerge, leaving the world at the mercy of their artificially created caretaker. However, their continual manipulation of the population and the world's environment is at odds with Nausicaä's belief in the natural order. She argues that mankind's behaviour has not been improved significantly by the activities of those inside the crypt. Strife and cycles of violence have continued to plague the world in the thousand years following their interference. She orders the God-Warrior to destroy its progenitors, forcing humanity to live or die without further influence from the old society's technology.<!--The country name is Torumekia, so this formulation is fine for identifying to whom they've become vassals. Bioengineered doesn't really need hyphenation (Otherwise also change Wikipedia article name and other entries for bioengineering here. The manipulation and weaponisation of the mold is what disturbs Nausicaa, not the attributes of the mold itself perse at this point. See for example her puzzlement (粘菌はあれもそうなの? "And the mold too?") on Universal Page number 667. There are still errors in this Plot section.-->

==Development==

===Precursors and early development===
Miyazaki began his professional career in the animation industry as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]] at [[Toei Animation|Toei]] in 1963 but soon had additional responsibilities in the creation processes.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=30}} While working primarily on animation projects for TV and Cinema, he also pursued his dream of creating manga.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=39}} In conjunction with his work as a [[Key frame|key animator]] on [[The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots|''Puss 'n Boots'']] his manga adaptation of the same title was published in 1969. That same year [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] serialization started of his manga ''[[Sabaku no Tami|People of the Desert]]''. His manga adaptation of [[Dōbutsu Takarajima|''Animal Treasure Island'']] was serialized in 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy |1y=1999|1p=219|2a1=Comic Box November 1|2y=1982|2p=111|3a1=Animage June 10|3y=1983|3pp=172,173}}

After the December 1979 release of ''[[The Castle of Cagliostro]]'', Miyazaki, now at the [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]] (TMS) subsidiary [[Telecom Animation Film]], began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of [[Richard Corben]]'s comic book ''Rowlf'' and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=249|2a1=Kanō |2y=2007|2pp=37ff, 323}} Around that time Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s ''[[Animage]]''. During subsequent conversations he showed his sketchbooks and talked about basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with [[Toshio Suzuki (producer)|Toshio Suzuki]] and Osamu Kameyama, at the time working as editors for ''Animage''. They saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Initially two projects were proposed to Tokuma Shoten, that are significant for the eventual creation of Nausicaä: {{Nihongo |''Warring States Demon Castle'' | 戦国魔城 | Sengoku ma-jō }}, to be set in the [[Sengoku period]], and an aborted adaptation of Corben's ''Rowlf'', but they were rejected, on July 9, 1981. The proposals were rejected because the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga and because the rights for the adaptation of ''Rowlf'' could not be secured.{{sfnm|1a1=DVD Japan|1y=2003|2a1=DVD UK|2y=2005|3a1=Art|3y=1984|3p=8|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=1996|4p=146|5a1=Miyazaki|5y=2007|5p=146|6a1=Haraguchi|6y=1996|6p=35}}

An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=73|2a1=Saitani|2y=1995|2p=9}}{{efn|See in particular Miyazaki's answer to Saitani's question: "Were you asked, from the beginning, to draw the comic with the intention of it becoming an animated work?"{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} Miyazaki stated in an interview, "''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' only really began to take shape once I agreed to serialize it."{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=149}} In the December 1981 issue of ''Animage'', it was announced that a new manga series would start in the February 1982 issue of the magazine, despite the fact that Miyazaki had not completed the first episode. The illustrated notice introduced the new series' main character, title and concept.<ref name="Origin">{{cite web | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaa_origin.html | title=Origin | last=Ryan | first=Scott | work=Nausicaa.net | publisher=Team Ghiblink | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | archive-date=September 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180201/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaa_origin.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The first chapter, 18 pages, was published in the February issue. Miyazaki would continue developing the story for another 12 years with frequent interruptions along the way.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=3}}

===Influences===
[[File:1878 Frederick Leighton - Nausicaa.jpg|thumb|298x298px|The titular character of the manga was named after the Greek princess, [[Nausicaa]], whose name means "burner of ships".<ref>Shipley, Joseph T. ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2011, p. 160</ref>]]
Miyazaki had given other names to the main character during development, but he settled on Nausicaä based on the name of the [[Nausicaa|Greek princess of the same name]] from the ''[[Odyssey]]'', as portrayed in [[Bernard Evslin]]'s dictionary of Greek mythology, translated into Japanese by Minoru Kobayashi.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki |1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Miyazaki|2y=2007|2p=150|3a1=WebcatPlus|3y=1979|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=2006|4p=150}}{{efn|Mentioned as {{Nihongo | Minoru Kobayashi | 小林稔 | Kobayashi Minoru|}} in the Japanese Webcat Plus database and in ''Hayao Miyazaki's Watercolor Impressions''.

Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea]]'', [[Brian Aldiss]]'s ''[[Hothouse (novel)|Hothouse]]'', [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]'', and [[J.R.R Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=48}} [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965) was also a major source of inspiration for ''Nausicaä''.<ref name="hm">{{cite book |title=Hayao Miyazaki Master of Japanese Animation |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |author=McCarthy, Helen |year=1999 |pages=72–92 |isbn=1880656418}}</ref>

Among the inspirations for the environmental themes Miyazaki has mentioned the [[Minamata Bay]] mercury pollution.{{sfnm|1a1=Cavallaro|1y=2006|1p=48}} The Sea of Corruption is based on the forests on the Japanese island of [[Yakushima]] and the marshes of the [[Sivash]], or Rotten Sea, in Ukraine.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Uratani|2y=2001}}{{efn|The Japanese name for the Sea of Corruption {{Nihongo|腐海| fukai|}}, consists of the kanji for decay and sea. Also translated as Toxic Jungle or Sea of Decay in manga translations and in the film's subtitles. Miyazaki mentioned its origin in the interview published in Watercolor Impressions.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1y=1996|1p=149|2a1=Adachi|2y=2012|2p=184}} }} The works of botanist {{Interlanguage link multi|Nakao Sasuke|ja|3=中尾佐助|lt=Sasuke Nakao}} were among Miyazaki's inspirations for the environment of the story. Miyazaki mentions Nakao in the context of a question he was asked about the place ''Nausicaä'' takes in the ''ecology boom'', explaining his shift from a desert to a forest setting. Nakao's influence on his work has been noted by Shiro Yoshioka.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=5|2a1=Yoshioka|2y=2008|p=262}} Miyazaki has identified Tetsuji Fukushima's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sabaku no Maō|ja|3=沙漠の魔王}}'' {{nihongo|沙漠の魔王|The Evil Lord of the Desert}}, a story he first read while still in primary school, as one of his earliest influences. [[Kentaro Takekuma]] has also observed this continuity in Miyazaki's work and places it within the tradition of illustrated stories, {{Nihongo3||絵物語|emonogatari}}, and manga Miyazaki read while growing up, pointing out the influence of Fukushima on Miyazaki's ''People of the Desert'' which he in turn identifies as a precursor for both ''The Journey of Shuna'', created in watercolour and printed in colour, and ''Nausicaä''.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=194|2a1=McCarthy|2y=1999|2p=27|3a1=McCarthy|3y=2006|3p=70|4a1=Takekuma|4y=2008|5a1=Kaku|5y=2012}}

===Creation===
Miyazaki drew the ''Nausicaä'' chapters primarily in pencil. The work was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage September 10|1y=1983|1p=182|2a1=Art|2y=1984|2p=182|3a1=Miyazaki|3y=1996|3p=94|4a1=Miyazaki|4y=2007|4p=94| |5a1=Saitani|5y=1995|5p=9}}{{efn|In the interview with Ryo Saitani, published in 1995, Miyazaki very briefly mentions discussing the use of pencil with [[Hideo Ogata]], chief editor of ''Animage'' at the time, in the context of their talks on the development of the manga and his desire to quit creating it. Ogata persuaded Miyazaki to continue.{{sfnm|1a1=Saitani|1y=1995|1p=9}} }} [[Frederik L. Schodt]] observed differences between Nausicaä and other Japanese manga. He has noted that it was serialized in the large [[Paper size#A series|A4 size]] of ''Animage'', much larger than the normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausicaä in pencil without inking, and that the page and panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, ''Nausicaä'' reminds Schodt of the works of [[Mœbius]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schodt|1y=1996|1p=278}}

Takekuma has noted stylistic changes in Miyazaki's artwork over the course of the series. He points out that, particularly in the first chapters, the panels are densely filled with background, which makes the main characters difficult to discern without paying close attention. According to Takekuma this may be partially explained by Miyazaki's use of pencil, without inking, for much of the series. Takekuma points out that by employing pencil Miyazaki does not give himself the option of much variation in his line. He notes that in the later chapters Miyazaki uses his line art to, literally, draw attention to individuals and that he more frequently separates them from the background. As a result there are more panels in which the main characters stand out vividly in the latter part of the manga.{{sfnm|1a1=Takekuma|1y=2008}}

Miyazaki has stated in interviews that he frequently worked close to publication deadlines and that he was not always able to finish his monthly instalments for serialization in ''Animage''. On such occasions he sometimes created apologetic cartoons. These were printed in the magazine, instead of story panels, to explain to his readers why there were fewer pages that month or why the story was absent entirely. Miyazaki has indicated that he continued making improvements to the story prior to the publication of the ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes, in which chapters from the magazine were collected in book form.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=17}} Changes made throughout the story, before the release of each ''tankōbon'' volume, range from subtle additions of shading to the insertion of entirely new pages. Miyazaki also redrew panels and sometimes the artwork was changed on whole pages. He made alterations to the text and changed the order in which panels appeared. The story as re-printed in the ''tankōbon'' spans 7 volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.<ref name="Ryan(Comparison)">{{Cite web | title=Nausicaä Manga Comparison | url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | last=Ryan | first=Scott | publisher=Nausicaa.net | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | archive-date=May 14, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514214741/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/naucompare.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

Miyazaki has said that the lengthy creation process of the ''Nausicaä'' manga, repeatedly tackling its themes as the story evolved over the years, not only changed the material but also affected his personal views on life and changed his political perspectives. He also noted that his continued struggle with the subject matter in the ongoing development of the Nausicaä manga allowed him to create different, lighter, films than he would have been able to make without Nausicaä providing an outlet for his more serious thoughts throughout the period of its creation.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=15–16}} Marc Hairston notes that, “Tellingly, Miyazaki’s first film after finishing the ''Nausicaä'' manga was ''[[Princess Mononoke|Mononoke Hime]]'', which examined many of the themes from the manga and is arguably the darkest film of his career.”{{sfnm|1a1=Hairston|1y=2010|1p=177–178}}

===Localization===
''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' was initially translated into English by [[Toren Smith]] and Dana Lewis. Smith, who had written comics in the U.S. since 1982, wrote an article on [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)#Warriors of the Wind|''Warriors of the Wind'']] (the heavily edited version of the film adaptation released in the U.S. in the 1980s) for the Japanese edition of [[Starlog]], in which he criticized what [[New World Pictures]] had done to Miyazaki's film. The article came to the attention of Miyazaki himself, who invited Smith to Studio Ghibli for a meeting. On Miyazaki's insistence, Smith's own company [[Studio Proteus]] was chosen as the producer of the English-language translation. Smith hired Dana Lewis to collaborate on the translation. Lewis was a professional translator in Japan who also wrote for ''[[Newsweek]]'' and had written cover stories for such science fiction magazines as ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]'' and ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Smith hired [[Tom Orzechowski]] for the lettering and retouching.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=44-47}}

Studio Proteus was responsible for the translation, the lettering, and the retouching of the artwork, which was flipped left-to-right to accommodate English readers. The original Japanese dialogue was re-lettered by hand, the original sound effects were replaced by English sound effects, and the artwork was retouched to accommodate the new sound effects. When Miyazaki resumed work on the manga following one of the interruptions, Viz chose another team, including [[Rachel Matt Thorn]] and Wayne Truman, to complete the series.{{sfnm|1a1=Smith|1y=1995|1p=47}} The current seven-volume, English-language "Editor's Choice" edition is published in right-to-left reading order: while it retains the original translations, the lettering was done by Walden Wong. The touch-up art and lettering for the Viz Media deluxe two-volume box set was also done by Walden Wong.<ref>{{cite book

Eriko Ogihara-Schuck, lecturer in American studies at the [[Technical University of Dortmund]], conducted a comparative analysis of the Japanese-language manga and anime with their English translations, and demonstrates that American translations have resulted in the "[[Christianity|Christian]]izing of Miyazaki's [[animism]]". She indicates that this was probably done inadvertently in the case of the manga translation, which retains animistic elements and contains [[pantheistic]] phrases, but may have been more deliberate in the translation of dialogue and narration for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s release of the film. In the case of the manga she attributes this "Christianizing" to the limitations of the languages involved, particularly the absence of precise English equivalents for Japanese words and concepts such as ''[[kami]]'', ''[[oni]]'' and ''[[Wrathful deities|kishin]]'' and honorific titles such as ''[[Japanese honorifics#Sama|sama]]''. As another explanation, she offers that translators of both the manga and the film work from a [[Judeo-Christian]] background, in a language suffused with Judeo-Christian [[idiom]]s not found in Japanese, which they introduce to the text, and she indicates that the translators work for an audience more accustomed to, and with the expectation of, the Judeo-Christian religions' [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]], [[Conflict between good and evil|good versus evil]] [[worldview]] in fictional narratives. Ogihara-Schuck concludes that particularly the film translation erased animistic motifs completely but that the manga translations, "by enveloping the text in a dualistic world view", also implicitly reintroduced this dualistic, good versus evil, worldview, absent in the original Japanese language manga, which she presumes to have been a strategy to make the works more accessible to the American audience.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133–146}}

==Publication history==
The manga was serialized in [[Tokuma Shoten]]'s monthly ''[[Animage]]'' magazine between 1982 and 1994.{{sfnm|1a1=Miyazaki|1a2=Takahata|1y=2009|1p=442–445}} The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe.{{sfnm|1a1=Animage October 10|1y=1982|1p=181}} Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on ''[[Laputa]]''. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]''. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on ''[[Porco Rosso]]''. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of ''Animage''. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=9|2a1=Animage February 10|2y=1994|2p=204|3a1=Yom June 1|3y=1994|3p=3}}<ref name="chapter_guide">{{cite web| url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html| title=Chapter guide| last=Ryan| first=Scott| work=Nausicaa.net| publisher=Team Ghiblink| accessdate=December 30, 2008| archive-date=December 8, 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208085139/http://nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/chapter_guide.html| url-status=dead}}</ref>

English translations are published in North America and the United Kingdom by [[Viz Media]]. As of 2013 Viz Media has released the manga in five different formats. Initially the manga was printed flipped and with English translations of the sound effects. Publication of English editions began in 1988 with the release of episodes from the story under the title ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind'' in the "Viz Select Comics" series. This series ran until 1996. It consists of 27 issues. In October 1990 Viz Media also started publishing the manga as ''Viz Graphic Novel, Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind''. The last of the seven Viz Graphic Novels in this series appeared in January 1997. Viz Media reprinted the manga in four volumes titled ''Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection'', which were released from October 1995 to October 1997. A box set of the four volumes was later released in January 2000. In 2004 Viz Media re-released the seven-volume format in an "Editors Choice" edition titled ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind''. In this version the manga is left unflipped and the sound effects are left untranslated.<ref name="nausicaaworld">{{Cite web | title = Nausicaä Around the World | url = http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaaworld.html | publisher = Nausicaa.net | accessdate = December 30, 2012 | archive-date = September 22, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180212/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/manga/nausicaaworld.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Viz Media released its own deluxe two-volume box set on November 6, 2012.<ref name="Viz-box-set">{{Cite web | title=VIZ Media Announces the Release of Nausicaä Manga Box Set | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-01/viz-media-announces-the-release-of-nausicaa-manga-box-set | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=November 25, 2012 | archive-date=September 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180203/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-11-01/viz-media-announces-the-release-of-nausicaa-manga-box-set | url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)}}

When serialization of the manga was underway and the story had proven to be popular among its readers, ''Animage'' came back on their promise not to turn the manga into an animation project and approached Miyazaki to make a 15 minute Nausicaä film. Miyazaki declined. Instead he proposed a sixty-minute [[Original video animation|OVA]]. In a counter offer Tokuma agreed to sponsor a feature-length film for theatrical release.<ref name="Animerica(1993)">{{cite journal |last=Oshiguchi | first=Takashi | title=The whimsy and wonder of Hayao Miyazaki | journal=[[Animerica]]|volume=1|issue=5|date=July 1993|page=4}}</ref> The film adaptation of ''Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'' was released on March 11, 1984. It was released before [[Studio Ghibli]] was established, but it is generally considered a Studio Ghibli film. Helen McCarthy has noted that it was Miyazaki's creation of the Nausicaä manga " ... that had, in a way, started the actual process of his studio's development".{{sfnm|1a1=McCarthy|1y=1999|1p=45}} The film was released with a recommendation from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)]].{{sfnm|1a1=Animage February 10|1y=1984|1p=181|2a1=Kanō|2y=2007|2p=64}}

In his retrospective on ''50 years of Postwar Manga'', Osamu Takeuchi wrote that, in an ironic twist of fate, the ''Nausicaä'' film had been playing in theatres at the same time as the 1984 anime adaptation of one of the illustrated stories Miyazaki had grown up reading, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kenya Boy|ja|3=少年ケニヤ}}'', originally written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Soji Yamakawa|ja|3=山川惣治}} in 1951. Takeuchi observed that the release of its inspirational predecessor "would have been devoured" by Miyazaki's ''Nausicaä'' in a competition of the two works. He went on to note that, in spite of a brief Yamakawa revival around that time, the media for story telling had progressed and a turning point in time had been passed.<ref name="Takeuchi(1995)">{{cite book |last=Takeuchi |first=Osamu |date=April 5, 2002 |orig-year=first published March 30, 1995 |script-title=ja:戦後マンガ50年史 |trans-title=50 Years of Post-War Manga |url=http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |language=ja |location=Tokyo |publisher=Chikuma Shobo |edition=5th |page=49 |isbn=978-4480052018 |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224115142/http://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480052018/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The story of the ''Nausicaä'' film is much simpler than that of the manga, roughly corresponding to the first two books of the manga, the point the story had reached when film production began.<ref name="chapter_guide" /> In his interview for ''Yom'' (1994) Miyazaki explained that he worked from the precept that a film requires an opening and a closing of the story. He stated that, within the confines he set for closing the story, he took the film's narrative up to ''Nausicaä's'' "{{Nihongo|Copernican turn|コペルニクス的転回|koperunikusutekitenkai}}", which came after the character realises the nature of the ''Sea of Corruption''.{{sfnm|1a1=Yom June 1|1y=1994|1p=6}} There are significant differences in plot, with more locations, factions and characters appearing in the manga, as well as more detailed environmentalist themes. The tone of the manga is also more philosophical than the film. Miyazaki has ''Nausicaä'' explore the concepts of fatalistic [[nihilism]] and has her struggle with the [[militarism]] of major powers. The series has been interpreted from the views of [[utopia]]n concepts, as well as religious studies.{{sfnm|1a1=Inaba|1y=1996|2a1=Yamanaka|2y=2008|2p=246ff|3a1=Masaki|3y=2001}}

In ''The Christianizing of Animism in Manga and Anime'', Eriko Ogihara-Schuck conducted a comparative analysis of the religious themes in the manga and the film. Ogihara-Schuck wrote that Miyazaki had started out with animistic themes, such a belief in the god of the wind, in the early chapters of the manga, had conflated the animistic and Judeo-Christian traditions in the anime adaptation, but had returned to the story by expanding on the animistic themes and by infusing it with a non-dualistic worldview when he created additional chapters of the manga, dissatisfied with the manner in which these themes had been handled for the film. Drawing on the scene in which ''Nausicaä'' sacrifices her own life, in order to placate the stampeding Ohmu, and is subsequently resurrected by the miraculous powers of these giant insects, Ogihara-Schuck notes that "Japanese scholars Takashi Sasaki and Masashi Shimizu consider ''Nausicaä'' a Christ-like savior, and American scholar Susan Napier considers her as an active female messiah figure". Ogihara-Schuck contrasts these views with Miyazaki's own belief in the omnipresence of gods and spirits and Hiroshi Aoi's argument that ''Nausicaä's'' self-sacrifice is grounded on an animistic recognition of such spirits. Ogihara-Schuck quotes Miyazaki's comments in which he indicated that ''Nausicaä's'' self-sacrifice is not as a savior of her people but is a decision driven by her desire to return the baby Ohmu and by her respect for nature, as she is "dominated by animism". Ogihara-Schuck concludes that in many of his later films, much more than in the anime version of ''Nausicaä'', Miyazaki expressed his own belief in the animistic world view and is at his most direct in the manga by putting the dualistic world view and the animistic belief in tension and, through ''Nausicaä's'' ultimate victory, makes the animistic world view superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Ogihara-Schuck|1y=2010|1p=133–146}}

No chapters of the manga were published in the period between the July 1983 issue and the August 1984 issue of ''Animage'' but series of ''Nausicaä Notes'' and ''The Road to Nausicaa'' were printed in the magazine during this interim period.<ref name="chapter_guide" /> Frequently illustrated with black and white images from the story boards as well as colour illustrations from the upcoming release of the film, these publications provide background about the history of the manga and development of the film. 1984 was declared The Year of Nausicaä, on the cover of the February 1984 issue of ''Animage''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | script-title=ja:アニメージュヒストリカ 第19回 1984年の「アニメージュ」 | date=December 25, 2008 | publisher=Tokuma Shoten | language=ja | trans-title=Animage Historica, 19th episode, 1984's Animage | accessdate=December 30, 2012 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515071402/http://animage.jp/old/col/col_07/col_07_19.html | archive-date=May 15, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Haraguchi|1y=1996|1p=61}}

''Nausicaä'' was included by Stephen Betts in the comic book–centered reference book ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die'', who said of the series:

<blockquote>Miyazaki's sepia-inked art is precise, delicate, and detailed. He achieves an incredible dynamism and motion across the page. The rich array of characters, multiple themes, and densely interwoven plot ensure that the message, while worthy, is nuanced. Exploring conflict, politics, and religion, Miyazaki achieves a grand, epic sweep that is rarely seen in comics, and particularly in such a stunning action comic. Yet he also manages to keep the whole story accessible and relevant through the human qualities of his timeless heroine.{{sfnm|1a1=Gravett |1y=2011|1p=447}}</blockquote>

Setre, writing for Japanator, said "Nasuicaa {{sic}} is an amazing manga. And no matter what you may think of Miyazaki this story deserves to be read. It has great characters (some of which could star in their own series), a great sense of adventure and scale, and an awesome story."<ref>{{Cite web| title = Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind Reviews (Vol.1-7)| url = http://www.japanator.com/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-review-vols-1-7--18209.phtml| publisher = Japanator| accessdate = November 15, 2012| archive-date = September 22, 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180232/https://www.siliconera.com/| url-status = live}}</ref>

In his July 14, 2001 review of Viz Media's four volume ''Perfect Collection'' edition, of the manga, Michael Wieczorek of Ex.org compared the series to ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' stating, "Both stories deal with man's struggle with nature and with each other, as well as with the effects war and violence have on society." Wieczoek gave a mixed review on the detail of the artwork in this, {{convert|8.08|x|5.56|inch|cm|abbr=on}} sized, edition, stating, "It is good because the panels are just beautiful to look at. It is bad because the size of the manga causes the panels within to be very small, and some of these panels are just crammed with detailed artwork. That can sometimes cause some confusion about what is happening to which person during an action scene."<ref name="nausicaaworld"/>{{sfnm|1a1= Wieczorek |1y=2001}} The ''Perfect Collection'' edition of the manga is out of print.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=2011}}

In his column House of 1000 Manga for the [[Anime News Network]] (ANN) [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] wrote that "''Nausicaa'' is as grim as ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''{{-"}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=2011}} Mike Crandol of ANN praised the manga stating, "I dare say the manga is Hayao Miyazaki's finest work ever—animated, printed, or otherwise—and that's saying a lot. Manga allows for a depth of plot and character unattainable in the cinematic medium, and Miyazaki uses it to its fullest potential."<ref>{{Cite web | last=Crandol | first=Mike | title=Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind Perfect Collection (manga) | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-wind/manga | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=November 15, 2012 | archive-date=September 22, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922180232/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-wind/manga | url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[Final Fantasy]]'' creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] has cited the manga and film as an influence on his series.<ref>{{Cite web | title=In Defense of Final Fantasy XII| url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/defense-final-fantasy-xii/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207185516/http://www.edge-online.com/features/defense-final-fantasy-xii|archive-date=February 7, 2012 |url-status=dead|publisher=Edge | accessdate=November 15, 2012 }}</ref>

In the ''Coda [[On Your Mark]] and Nausicaa'' to their April 1999 lecture series on [[manga]], [[anime]] and the works of Miyazaki at the [[University of Dallas]] Pamela Gossin, Professor of Arts and Humanities, and guest instructor Marc Hairston, research scientist in the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences, discussed ''On Your Mark'', the music video Miyazaki created for [[On Your Mark (song)|the song of the same title]] by Japanese duo [[Chage and Aska]] and drew parallels to the ''Nausicaä'' story, its titular character and its conclusion. Gossin and Hairston interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the music video as Miyazaki setting free his character in a manner reminiscent of [[William Shakespeare]]'s symbolic liberation of his characters, through [[Prospero]]'s release of his servant [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] in his play [[The Tempest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gossin|1a2=Hairston|1y=1999}} Miyazaki started creating ''On Your Mark'' the same month the seventh volume of the ''Nausicaä'' manga was released.{{sfnm|1a1=Kanō|1y=2007|1p=180}}
