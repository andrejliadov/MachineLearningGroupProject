{{short description|Concept of diversity of scientific activity according to field, questioning the unity of science}}
'''Epistemic cultures''' (most of the times in plural form) are a concept developed in the nineties by [[anthropologist]] [[Karin Knorr Cetina]] in her book ''Epistemic Cultures, how the sciences make knowledge.''<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Epistemic cultures : how the sciences make knowledge|last=(Karin)|first=Knorr-Cetina, K.|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674258932|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=39539508}}</ref> Opposed to a [[Monism|monist]] vision of scientific activity (according to which, would exist  a unique [[scientific method]]), Knorr Cetina defines the concept of epistemic cultures as a diversity of scientific activities according to different scientific fields, not only in methods and tools, but also in types of reasonings, ways to establish evidence, and relationships between theory and [[Empiricism|empiry]]. Knorr Cetina's work is seminal in questioning the so-called [[unity of science]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

== Knorr Cetina's anthropology ==
In practice, Knorr Cetina compares two contemporary important scientific fields:<ref name=":0" /> [[Particle physics|High energy physics]] and [[molecular biology]]. She worked as an anthropologist within two laboratories, along the line of the laboratory anthropology work by [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10035890|title=Laboratory life: the construction of scientific facts|last1=Latour|first1=Bruno|last2=Woolgar|first2=Steve|date=1986|isbn=9781400820412|language=English}}</ref> Her anthropological work is comparative and the two chosen scientific fields are highly mediaticized and easily distinguishable.

Epistemic cultures as a philosophical concept has been perused by numerous philosophical, anthropological or historical studies of science.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wray|first=K.

== Two distinct publication regimes ==
High energy physics and molecular biology are very different as scientific fields belonging to two different epistemic cultures. They also are very different in terms of [[academic authorship]]. Biagioli describes this difference in terms of publications culture regarding number of authors per paper, distribution of contributorship within authors, [[preprint]] policy and he precisely chooses to oppose the very same domains.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scientific authorship : credit and intellectual property in science|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|others=Biagioli, Mario, 1955-, Galison, Peter, 1955-|isbn=0415942934|location=New York, NY|oclc=51342797}}</ref>
