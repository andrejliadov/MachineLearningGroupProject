A '''perlocutionary act''' (or '''perlocutionary effect''') is the effect of an [[utterance]] on a listener.<ref>{{cite book |last=Austin |first=John L. |year=1962 |title=How to Do Things with Words |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=101 |quote="Saying something will often, or even normally, produce certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them."}}</ref> Examples of perlocutionary acts include persuading, convincing, scaring, enlightening, inspiring, or otherwise affecting the hearer. The perlocutionary effect of an utterance is contrasted with the [[locutionary act]], which is the act of producing the utterance, and with the [[illocutionary act|illocutionary force]], which does not depend on the utterance's effect on the listener.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/speech-acts/ |title=Speech Acts |last=Green |first=Mitchell |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Winter 2017 |year=2017 |access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref>

As an example, consider the following utterance: "By the way, I have a CD of [[Debussy]]; would you like to borrow it?" Its illocutionary function is an ''offer'', while its intended perlocutionary effect might be to impress the listener, or to show a friendly attitude, or to encourage an interest in a particular type of music.
