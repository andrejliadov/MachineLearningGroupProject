{{short description|Philosophical concept}}
'''Assemblage''' (from {{lang-fr|agencement}}, "a collection of things which have been gathered together or assembled") is a concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], originally presented in their book ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Assemblage theory frames social complexity in the emphasis of fluidity, exchangeability, and the multiple functions through entities that create their connectivity.<ref name=UT2016>Wikis.la.utexas.edu,.

==Overview==
The term assemblage, in a philosophical sense, originally stems from the French word ''agencement'', whose meaning translates narrowly to English as "arrangement", "fitting, or "fixing".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|title=Agencement/Assemblage|journal=Theory, Culture & Society|volume=23|issue=2–3|pages=108–109|doi=10.1177/026327640602300219|year=2006|s2cid=220894814}}</ref> ''Agencement'' asserts the inherent implication of the connection between specific concepts and that the arrangement of those concepts is what provides sense or meaning. Assemblage, on the other hand, can be more accurately described as the integration and connection of these concepts and that it is both the connections ''and'' the arrangements of those connections that provide context for assigned meanings.

John Phillips argued in 2006 that Deleuze and Guattari rarely used the term assemblage at all in a philosophical sense, and that through narrow, literal English translations, the terms became misleadingly perceived as analogous. The translation of ''agencement'' as assemblage that "give[s] rise to the connotations based on analogical impressions, which liberate elements of a vocabulary from the arguments that once helped form it." <ref name=":0" />

== Deleuze and Guattari<!--linked from 'Gilles Deleuze' and 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--> ==
In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extend the theory to include social, linguistic, and philosophical systems in order to create assemblage theory.<ref name="Stanford2008">Smith, D., & Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla</ref> In assemblage theory, assemblages (or relationships) are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization. Any one philosophical context never operates in isolation. <ref name=":0" />

Deleuze and Guattari use the term "constellation" when they talk about assemblage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.<ref name="SlackandWise">Wise, J., & Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.</ref> This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.<ref name="Stanford2008" /> According to Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory.<ref name="SlackandWise" /> In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies in the process of stratification.<ref name="Stanford2008" /> Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view.<ref name="SlackandWise" /> The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies in and around it, and therefore demonstrates the social complexity of assemblage.

Territorialization is another process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the bodies that create the "assemblage".<ref name="Stanford2008" /> Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.<ref name="SlackandWise" /> Within this ordering of the bodies, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected through components "exiting" the assemblage; once again exemplifying the idea that these forms do not and can not operate alone<ref name="SlackandWise" /> Reterritorialization describes the process by which new components "enter" and new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.<ref name="SlackandWise" /> In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda ==
[[Manuel DeLanda]] detailed the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006) where, like Deleuze and Guattari, he suggests that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist <ref name="Karaman2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}</ref> DeLanda details Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) assemblage theory of how assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.<ref name="Karaman2008" /> DeLanda's additional contribution is to suggest that a third axis exists: of genetic/linguistic resources that also defines the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.<ref name="Karaman2008" /> Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda suggests that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.<ref name="UT2016" /> In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes.
