A '''commentary of a philosophical text''' is an analysis of a [[philosophical]] text that is undertaken from different angles and points of view, and that enables the study of its nature and characteristics.

A large portion of the [[schools of thought]] was originated through the analysis that different commentators carried out on renowned philosophical texts, especially texts from [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] (see [[Commentaries on Plato]] and [[Commentaries on Aristotle]]).<ref>Andrea Falcon (2005). [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-commentators/ "Commentators on Aristotle"]. ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref> A significant portion of [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s philosophical ideas were the result of commentaries to some of Aristotle's ideas.
