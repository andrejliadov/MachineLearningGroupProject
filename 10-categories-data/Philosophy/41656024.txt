==Reception==
Comic Book Bin's Leeroy Douresseaux commends "Miyazaki's imagination as bountiful, prodigious, and maybe even protean." He further commends the commentary that accompanies the pictures for providing "humor and insight".<ref name="CBB">{{cite web|last=Douresseaux |first=Leeroy |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.comicbookbin.com/theartofnausicaa2007.html |title=''The Art of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind: Watercolor Impressions'' |publisher=Comic Book Bin |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317095152/http://www.comicbookbin.com/theartofnausicaa2007.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>  [[About.com]]'s Deb Aoki commends the book as "gorgeous, full-color illustrations by the modern master of animation".<ref>{{cite web|last=Aoki|first=Deb |url=http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/NausicaaArt.htm |title=''The Art of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind: Watercolor Impressions'' |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107160707/http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/NausicaaArt.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> PopCultureShock's Katherine Dacey comments on the book with "while readers may not learn much from Miyazaki’s commentary (he spends a great deal of time disavowing his work), they will develop a greater appreciation for his creative process by studying the rough paintings and quick sketches at the back of the volume, which show many of the characters and creatures of ''Nausicaa'' in embryonic form."<ref>{{cite web |last=Dacey |first=Katherine |url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/weekly-recon-11707/ |date=November 4, 2007 |title=Weekly Recon, 11/7/07 |publisher=PopCultureShock |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qtqh9CSI?url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/weekly-recon-11707/ |archivedate=2010-07-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>
