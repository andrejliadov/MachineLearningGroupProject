The '''rejection of evolution by religious groups''' (also termed the '''creation vs. evolution debate''' or the '''origins debate''') involves an ongoing, recurring cultural, political, and [[theology|theological]] dispute about the origins of the Earth, of humanity, and of other life. In accordance with [[creationism]], species were once widely believed to be fixed products of divine creation, but since the mid-19th century, [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] has been established by the [[scientific community]] as an empirical [[Fact#In science|scientific fact]].

[[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] repudiate the [[evidence of common descent]] of humans and other animals as demonstrated in modern [[paleontology]], [[genetics]], [[histology]] and [[cladistics]] and those other sub-disciplines which are based upon the conclusions of modern [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]], [[cosmology]], and other related fields. They argue for the Abrahamic accounts of creation, and, in order to attempt to gain a place alongside evolutionary biology in the science classroom, have developed a rhetorical framework of "[[creation science]]". In the landmark ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover]]'', the purported basis of scientific creationism was judged to be a wholly religious construct without formal scientific merit.

The [[Catholic Church]] now recognizes the existence of evolution (see [[Catholic Church and evolution]]). [[Pope Francis]] has stated: "God is not a [[demiurge]] or a magician, but the Creator who brought everything to life...Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve."<ref>{{cite news|last=Welsh|first=Teresa|date=October 28, 2014|title=Pope Francis Says Science and Faith Aren't At Odds|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/10/28/pope-francis-comments-on-evolution-and-the-catholic-church|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=2017-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McKenna |first=Josephine |date=October 28, 2014 |title=Pope says evolution, Big Bang are real |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/10/28/pope-francis-evolution-big-bang/18053509/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location=Tysons Corner, VA |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |agency=Religion News Service |access-date=2016-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Gordon |first=Kara |date=October 30, 2014 |title=The Pope's Views on Evolution Haven't Really Evolved |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/10/pope-francis-evolution/382143/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |issn=1072-7825 |access-date=2016-01-28}}</ref> The rules of genetic inheritance were first discovered by a [[Catholic priest]], the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] monk [[Gregor Mendel]], who is known today as the founder of modern [[genetics]].

==History==
{{See also|History of the creation–evolution controversy|History of evolutionary thought|}}
The creation–evolution controversy began in Europe and [[North America]] in the late 18th century, when new interpretations of geological evidence led to various theories of an [[Geologic time scale|ancient Earth]], and findings of extinctions demonstrated in the [[fossil]] [[Sequence (geology)|geological sequence]] prompted [[history of evolutionary thought|early ideas of evolution]], notably [[Lamarckism]]. In England these ideas of continuing change were at first seen as a threat to the existing "fixed" social order, and both church and state sought to repress them.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=34–35|ps=}} Conditions gradually eased, and in 1844 [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]'s controversial ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' popularized the idea of gradual [[transmutation of species]]. The scientific establishment at first dismissed it scornfully and the [[Church of England]] reacted with fury, but many [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Quakers]] and [[Baptists]]—groups opposed to the privileges of the [[State religion|established church]]—favoured its ideas of [[God]] acting through such natural laws.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/darwin.html |title=Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist |last=van Wyhe |first=John |author-link=John van Wyhe |year=2006 |website=[[The Complete Works of Charles Darwin Online|The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online]] |publisher=John van Wyhe |access-date=2014-08-27 }}</ref>{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=321–323, 503–505|ps=}}

The publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 brought scientific credibility to evolution, and made it a respectable field of study.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2006|ps=}}

Despite the intense interest in the religious implications of Darwin's book, theological controversy over [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] set out in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' (1860) largely diverted the Church of England's attention. Some of the [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] authors of that work expressed support for Darwin, as did many [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]]. The Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]], for instance, openly supported the idea of God working through evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hale |first=Piers |date=July 2012 |title=Darwin's Other Bulldog: Charles Kingsley and the Popularisation of Evolution in Victorian England |url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/H/Piers.J.Hale-1/DARWIN%27S%20OTHER%20BULLDOG%202011.pdf |journal=Science & Education |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=977–1013 |doi=10.1007/s11191-011-9414-8 |issn=0926-7220 |access-date=2014-08-27 |bibcode=2012Sc&Ed..21..977H |s2cid=144142263 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022916/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/H/Piers.J.Hale-1/DARWIN'S%20OTHER%20BULLDOG%202011.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}</ref> Other Christians opposed the idea, and even some of Darwin's close friends and supporters—including [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Asa Gray]]—initially expressed reservations about some of his ideas.{{sfn|AAAS|2006|ps=}} Gray later became a staunch supporter of Darwin in America, and collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, ''[[Darwiniana]]'' (1876). These essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, at a time when many on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive.<ref>

Darwin also took this position,{{sfn|AAAS|2006|ps=}} but prominent [[atheism|atheists]] including [[Edward Aveling]] and [[Ludwig Büchner]] also took up evolution and it was criticized, in the words of one reviewer, as "tantamount to atheism."{{sfn|Hodge|1874|p=177|ps=}}{{sfn|Numbers|1992|p=14|ps=}}{{sfn|Burns|Ralph|Lerner|Standish|1982|p=965|ps=}}{{sfn|Huxley|1902|ps=}} Following the lead of figures such as [[St. George Jackson Mivart]] and [[John Augustine Zahm]], [[Roman Catholics]] in the United States became accepting of evolution itself while ambivalent towards [[natural selection]] and stressing humanity's divinely imbued [[soul]].{{sfn|Witham|2002|ps=}} The Catholic Church never condemned evolution, and initially the more conservative-leaning Catholic leadership in Rome held back, but gradually adopted a similar position.{{sfn|Witham|2002|ps=}}{{sfn|Barbour|1997|pp=58, 65|ps=}}

During the late 19th century evolutionary ideas were most strongly disputed by the [[premillennialism|premillennialists]], who held to a prophecy of the imminent [[Second Coming|return of Christ]] based on a form of [[Biblical literalism]], and were convinced that the Bible would be invalidated if any error in the Scriptures was conceded. However, hardly any of the critics of evolution at that time were as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the [[Garden of Eden|Edenic]] creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings.{{sfn|Numbers|1992|pp=13–15|ps=}} In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]].{{sfn|Numbers|1992|p=17|ps=}} Likewise, few attached geological significance to the [[Genesis flood narrative|Biblical flood]], unlike subsequent creationists.{{sfn|Numbers|1992|p=17|ps=}} Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of the [[Book of Genesis]], or allowed that the [[Genesis creation narrative|six days of creation]] were not necessarily 24-hour days.<ref>{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=18}}, noting that this applies to published or public skeptics. Many Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation,{{original research inline|date=July 2014}} but these views rarely found expression in books and journals. Exceptions are also noted{{by whom|date=May 2015}}, such as literal interpretations published by [[Eleazar Lord]] (1788–1871), David Nevins Lord (1792–1880), and E. G. White (1829–1915). The observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873); [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] (1807–1884); [[John William Dawson]] (1820–1899); [[Enoch Fitch Burr]] (1818–1907); George D. Armstrong (1813–1899); [[Charles Hodge]], theologian (1797–1878); [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813–1895); [[Edward Hitchcock]], clergyman and Amherst College geologist, (1793–1864); Reverend Herbert W. Morris (1818–1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?–1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838–1922); [[Alexander Patterson]], Presbyterian evangelist.
</ref>

Science professors at liberal northeastern universities almost immediately embraced the theory of evolution and introduced it to their students. However, some people in parts of the south and west of the United States, which had been influenced by the [[Sermon|preachings]] of Christian fundamentalist [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]], rejected the theory as immoral.{{sfn|Salhany|1986|p=32|ps=}}

In the United Kingdom, Evangelical creationists were in a tiny minority. The [[Victoria Institute]] was formed in 1865 in response to ''Essays and Reviews'' and Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species''. It was not officially opposed to evolution theory, but its main founder [[James Reddie]] objected to Darwin's work as "''inharmonious''" and "utterly ''incredible''", and [[Philip Henry Gosse]], author of ''[[Omphalos (book)|Omphalos]]'', was a vice-president. The institute's membership increased to 1897, then declined sharply. In the 1920s [[George McCready Price]] attended and made several presentations of his creationist views, which found little support among the members. In 1927 [[John Ambrose Fleming]] was made president; while he insisted on creation of the soul, his acceptance of divinely guided development and of [[Pre-Adamite]] humanity meant he was thought of as a [[theistic evolution]]ist.{{sfn | Numbers | 2006 | pp=162–164}}

===Creationism in theology===
{{Main|History of creationism}}
{{See also|Creation and evolution in public education}}
At the beginning of the 19th century debate had started to develop over applying historical methods to [[Biblical criticism]], suggesting a less literal account of the Bible. Simultaneously, the developing science of geology indicated the [[age of the Earth|Earth was ancient]], and religious thinkers sought to accommodate this by [[day-age creationism]] or [[gap creationism]]. [[Neptunism|Neptunianist]] [[catastrophism]], which had in the 17th and 18th centuries proposed that a [[Flood myth|universal flood]] could explain all geological features, gave way to ideas of geological [[gradualism]] (introduced in 1795 by [[James Hutton]]) based upon the erosion and depositional cycle over millions of years, which gave a better explanation of the [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary column]]. [[Biology]] and the discovery of [[extinction]] (first described in the 1750s and put on a firm footing by [[Georges Cuvier]] in 1796) challenged ideas of a fixed immutable [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] "[[great chain of being]]." [[Natural theology]] had earlier expected that scientific findings based on empirical evidence would help religious understanding. Emerging differences led some{{according to whom|date=April 2017}} to increasingly regard science and [[theology]] as concerned with different, non-competitive domains.

When most scientists came to accept evolution (by around 1875), European theologians generally came to accept evolution as an instrument of God. For instance, [[Pope Leo XIII]] (in office 1878–1903) referred to longstanding Christian thought that scriptural interpretations could be reevaluated in the light of new knowledge,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and Roman Catholics came around to acceptance of human evolution subject to direct creation of the soul. In the United States the development of the racist [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinian]] [[eugenics]] movement by certain{{which|date=April 2017}} circles led a number of Catholics to reject evolution.{{sfn|AAAS|2006|ps=}} In this enterprise they received little aid from conservative Christians in Great Britain and Europe. In Britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant, less militant theological tradition.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=161|ps=}} This continues to the present. In his speech at the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] in 2014, [[Pope Francis]] declared that he accepted the [[Big Bang]] theory and the theory of evolution and that God was not "a magician with a magic wand".<ref>{{cite web|last1= Withnall|first1= Adam|title= Pope Francis declares evolution and Big Bang theory are real and God is not 'a magician with a magic wand'|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-declares-evolution-and-big-bang-theory-are-right-and-god-isnt-a-magician-with-a-magic-wand-9822514.html|website= Independent.co.uk|publisher= The Independent|access-date= 10 July 2015|date= 2014-10-28}}</ref>

At first in the U.S., evangelical Christians paid little attention to the developments in geology and biology, being more concerned with the rise of European higher [[Biblical criticism]] which questioned the belief in the Bible as literal truth. Those criticizing these approaches took the name "fundamentalist"—originally coined by its supporters to describe a specific package of theological beliefs that developed into a movement within the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century, and which had its roots in the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name="History_fundamentalism">{{cite web |url= http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24092 |title= A History of Fundamentalism |last= Buescher |first= John |website= [[Teachinghistory.org]] |publisher= [[George Mason University]]; [[United States Department of Education]] |location= Fairfax, VA |access-date= 2011-08-15}}</ref> The term in a religious context generally indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs.<ref>

Up until the early mid-20th century{{when|date=July 2014}}, mainline Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution. Around the start of the 20th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as [[B. B. Warfield]] who saw it as a natural law expressing God's will. By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist [[Bible Belt]] communities, led to a backlash. The numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly, and parents who had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called "[[survival of the fittest]]" had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution.{{sfn|AAAS|2006|ps=}}

====British creationism====
The main British creationist movement in this period{{which|date=April 2017}}, the [[Creation Science Movement|Evolution Protest Movement]] (EPM), formed in the 1930s{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=161|ps=}} out of the [[Victoria Institute]], or Philosophical Society of Great Britain (founded in 1865 in response to the publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859 and of ''Essays and Reviews'' in 1860). The Victoria Institute had the stated objective of defending "the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture ... against the opposition of Science falsely so called".{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Although it did not officially oppose evolution, it attracted a number of scientists skeptical of [[Darwinism]], including [[John William Dawson]] and [[Arnold Guyot]].{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=162|ps=}} It reached a high point of 1,246 members in 1897, but quickly plummeted to less than one third of that figure in the first two decades of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|p=162|ps=}} Although it opposed evolution at first, the institute joined the [[theistic evolution]] camp by the 1920s, which led to the development of the Evolution Protest Movement in reaction. Amateur [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Douglas Dewar]], the main driving-force within the EPM, published a booklet entitled ''Man: A Special Creation'' (1936) and engaged in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution. In the late 1930s he resisted American creationists' call for acceptance of [[flood geology]], which later led to conflict within the organization. Despite trying to win the public endorsement of [[C. S. Lewis]] (1898–1963), the most prominent [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] of his day,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} by the mid-1950s the EPM came under control of schoolmaster/pastor Albert G. Tilney, whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organization "as a one-man band", rejecting flood geology, unwaveringly promoting gap creationism, and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity.{{sfn|Numbers|2006|pp=355–356|ps=}} It was renamed the [[Creation Science Movement]] (CSM) in 1980, under the chairmanship of David Rosevear, who holds a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[organometallic chemistry]] from the [[University of Bristol]]. By the mid-1980s the CSM had formally incorporated flood geology into its "Deed of Trust" (which all officers had to sign) and condemned gap creationism and day-age creationism as unscriptural.

==United States legal challenges and their consequences==
In 1925 [[Tennessee]] passed a statute, the [[Butler Act]], which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state. Later that year [[Mississippi]] passed a similar law, as did [[Arkansas]] in 1927. In 1968 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down these "anti-monkey" laws  as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution]]."{{sfn|Salhany|1986|pp= 32–34|ps=}}

In more recent times religious fundamentalists who accept creationism have struggled to get their rejection of evolution accepted as legitimate science within education institutions in the U.S. A series of important court cases has resulted.

=== Butler Act and the Scopes monkey trial (1925) ===
{{Main|Scopes Trial}}
[[File:Anti-EvolutionLeague.jpg|thumb|right| Anti-Evolution League at the Scopes Trial]]
After 1918, in the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy]] had brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of [[William Jennings Bryan]] several [[U.S. state|states]] introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution. By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and had passed in some states, such as Tennessee.<ref>Similar legislation passed in two other states prior to the Scopes trial—in Oklahoma and in Florida. After the Scopes trial of July 1925 legislators abandoned efforts to enact "Butler Acts" in other jurisdictions. ''See'':

The trial, widely publicized by [[H. L. Mencken]] among others, is commonly referred to as the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes Monkey Trial]]. The court convicted Scopes, but the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution. Following an appeal of the case to the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the minimum $100 fine instead of allowing the jury to assess the fine).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/statcase.htm |title= Decision on Scopes' Appeal to the Supreme Court of Tennessee |date= January 17, 1927 |website= University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law |publisher= [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law|Curators of the University of Missouri]] |location= Kansas City, MO |type= Primary source |access-date= 2014-08-27 |ref= {{harvid|Court Opinion of Scope's Trial |1927}} }} The statute required a minimum fine of $100, and the state Constitution required all fines over $50 to be assessed by a jury.</ref>

Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the Butler Act was not in violation of the Religious Preference provisions of the [[Constitution of Tennessee|Tennessee Constitution]] (Section 3 of Article 1), which stated "that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship".<ref>The [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] was not, at the time of the ''Scopes'' decision in the 1920s, deemed applicable to the states.

{{quote|We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory.... Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.

... Furthermore, [the Butler Act] ''requires'' the teaching of nothing. It only ''forbids'' the teaching of evolution of man from a lower order of animals.... As the law thus stands, while the theory of evolution of man may not be taught in the schools of the State, nothing contrary to that theory [such as Creationism] is required to be taught.

... It is not necessary now to determine the exact scope of the Religious Preference clause of the Constitution ... Section 3 of Article 1 is binding alike on the Legislature and the school authorities. So far we are clear that the Legislature has not crossed these constitutional limitations. |''Scopes v.

=== ''Epperson v. Arkansas'' (1968) ===
{{Main|Epperson v. Arkansas}}
In 1968 the United States Supreme Court invalidated a forty-year-old Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the [[State school#United States|public schools]]. A [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], high-school-biology teacher, Susan Epperson, filed suit, charging that the law violated the federal constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the Establishment Clause. The Little Rock Ministerial Association supported Epperson's challenge, declaring, "to use the Bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the Book of Genesis, but to do God and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom".{{sfn|Nelkin|2000|p= 242|ps=}} The Court held that the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, "that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma".<ref>*{{cite court |litigants= Epperson v.

''Daniel v. Waters'' was a 1975 legal case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] struck down Tennessee's law regarding the teaching of "equal time" of evolution and creationism in public-school science classes because it violated the Establishment Clause. Following this ruling, creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and rebranded "Creation Science", and several states passed legislative acts requiring that this be given equal time with the teaching of evolution.

====Court cases====

=====''McLean v. Arkansas''=====
{{Main|McLean v. Arkansas}}
In 1982, another case in Arkansas ruled that the Arkansas "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act" (Act 590) was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause. Much of the transcript of the case was lost,{{by whom|date=December 2018}} including [[evidence (law)|evidence]] from [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]].

=====''Edwards v. Aguillard''=====
{{Main|Edwards v. Aguillard}}
In the early 1980s, the [[Louisiana]] legislature passed a law titled the "Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act". The act did not require teaching either evolution or creationism as such, but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, creation science had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, arguing that the act was about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state in support of the act. Lower courts ruled that the State's actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of creation science, but the State appealed to the Supreme Court.

In the similar case of ''McLean v. Arkansas'' (see above) the federal trial court had also decided against creationism. ''Mclean v. Arkansas'' was not appealed to the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with ''Edwards v. Aguillard''. In 1987 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Louisiana act was also unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, it stated its opinion that "teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction", leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that later came to be known as [[intelligent design]].<ref name="Kitzmiller_p7">{{cite court |litigants= Kitzmiller v.

In the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms, the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plans. The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas]], May 5 to May 12, 2005.

====Texas Board of Education support for intelligent design====
On March 27, 2009, the Texas Board of Education, by a vote of 13 to 2, voted that at least in Texas, textbooks must teach intelligent design alongside evolution, and question the validity of the fossil record. [[Don McLeroy]], a dentist and chair of the board, said, "I think the new standards are wonderful ... dogmatism about evolution [has sapped] America's scientific soul." According to ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine, "Because Texas is the second-largest textbook market in the United States, publishers have a strong incentive to be certified by the board as 'conforming 100% to the state's standards'."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bhattacharjee |first=Yudhijit |date=April 3, 2009 |title=New Texas Standards Question Evolution, Fossil Record |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5923 |page=25 |bibcode=2009Sci...324...25B |doi=10.1126/science.324.5923.25a |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=19342560|s2cid=206585684 }}</ref> The 2009 Texas Board of Education hearings were chronicled in the 2012 documentary ''[[The Revisionaries]]''.

Most of these groups are [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] Christians who believe the biblical account is [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]], and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to [[evangelism|evangelize]].<ref name="Verderame">{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/gospel/world-missions/creation-evangelism-cutting-through-the-excess/ |title=Creation Evangelism: Cutting Through the Excess |last=Verderame |first=John |date=May 10, 2001 |website=[[Answers in Genesis]] |publisher=Answers in Genesis Ministries International |location=Hebron, KY |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref><ref name="Simon_2006">{{cite news |last=Simon |first=Stephanie |date=February 11, 2006 |title=Their Own Version of a Big Bang |url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2006/feb/11/nation/na-creation11 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref> Some groups see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views that cannot be reconciled.

Studies on the religious beliefs of scientists does support the evidence of a rift between traditional literal fundamentalist religion and experimental science. Three studies of scientific attitudes since 1904 have shown that over 80% of scientists do not believe in a traditional god or the traditional belief in immortality, with disbelief stronger amongst biological scientists than physical scientists. Amongst those not registering such attitudes a high percentage indicated a preference for adhering to a belief concerning mystery than any dogmatic or faith based view.<ref name="Graffin_Provine2007">{{cite magazine |last1=Graffin |first1=Gregory W. |author1-link=Greg Graffin |last2=Provine |first2=William B. |author2-link=Will Provine |date=July–August 2007 |title=Evolution, Religion and Free Will |url=https://www.americanscientist.org/sites/americanscientist.org/files/200852181196485-2007-07Macroscope.pdf |department=Macroscope |journal=[[American Scientist]] |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=294–297 |jstor=27858986 |issn=0003-0996 |access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> But only 10% of scientists stated that they saw a fundamental clash between science and religion.

More recently, the intelligent design movement has attempted an anti-evolution position that avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists have argued that intelligent design is pseudoscience and does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is still essentially creationism.<ref name="Larson_p258" /><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Martz |first1=Larry |last2=McDaniel |first2=Ann |date=June 29, 1987 |title=Keeping God Out of the Classroom |url=https://kgov.com/files/docs/Newsweek-1987-God-Classroom.pdf |url-status=live |journal=[[Newsweek]] |location=New York |publisher=Newsweek LLC |pages=23–24 |issn=0028-9604 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153453/https://kgov.com/files/docs/Newsweek-1987-God-Classroom.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-31 |access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> Its leading proponent, the Discovery Institute, made widely publicized claims that it was a new science, although the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the [[Sternberg peer review controversy]], with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal's scientific standards, was a "significant departure" from the journal's normal subject area and was published at the former editor's sole discretion, "contrary to typical editorial practices."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biolsocwash.org/id_statement.html |title=Statement from the Council of the Biological Society of Washington |date=October 4, 2004 |website=Biological Society of Washington |publisher=[[Biological Society of Washington]] |location=Washington, D.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926214521/http://www.biolsocwash.org/id_statement.html |archive-date=2007-09-26 |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref> On August 1, 2005, U.S. president [[George W.

==Viewpoints==
In the controversy a number of divergent opinions have crystallized regarding both the acceptance of scientific theories and religious doctrine and practice.

===Young-Earth creationism===
{{Main| Young Earth creationism}}
{{See also| Creation science |Flood geology}}
Young-Earth creationism (YEC) involves the religiously-based belief that God created the Earth within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in [[Genesis creation narrative |Genesis]], within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed - for example - in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Young-Earth creationists often believe that the [[universe]] has a similar age to that of the Earth.<ref>

[[Creationist cosmologies]] result from attempts by some creationists to assign the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth timeframes based on the genealogies.{{sfn|Scott|2004|p=xii|ps=: "Creationism is about maintaining particular, narrow forms of religious belief—beliefs that seem to their adherents to be threatened by the very idea of evolution."}}

===Old-Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
{{See also|Gap creationism|Day-age creationism|Progressive creationism}}
Old-Earth creationism holds that God created the [[universe|physical universe]], but that one should not take the creation event of Genesis within 6 days strictly literally. This group generally accepts the [[age of the Universe]] and the [[age of the Earth]] as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but regards details of the [[evolutionary theory]] as questionable. Old-Earth creationists interpret the Genesis creation-narrative in a number of ways, each differing from the six, consecutive, 24-hour day creation of the Young-Earth creationist view.

===Neo-creationism and "intelligent design"===
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
{{See also|Intelligent design}}

Neo-creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. They wish to re-frame the debate over the [[origin of life|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public. Neo-creationists may be either Young Earth or Old Earth creationists, and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints (e.g. on the interpretation of the Bible). {{As of | 2020}}, neo-creationism underlies the [[intelligent design movement |intelligent-design movement]], which has a [[intelligent design movement#The 'big tent' strategy|"big tent" strategy]] making it inclusive of many Young-Earth creationists (such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist) |Paul Nelson]] and [[Percival Davis]]) and some sympathetic Old-Earth creationists.

===Theistic evolution===
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
{{See also|Naturalism (philosophy)|Catholic Church and evolution|Clergy Letter Project}}

Theistic evolution takes the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about God and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of modern [[scientific theory]], including, specifically, evolution. It generally views evolution as a tool used by a [[creator deity |creator god]], who is both the [[first cause]] and [[immanence |immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well-accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the [[day-age creationism |day-age]] interpretation of the Genesis creation myth; most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a "literal" description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|allegory]]. This position generally accepts the viewpoint of [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]], a long-standing convention of the [[scientific method]] in science.

Many [[Protestantism in the United States#Mainline vs. evangelical|mainline/liberal denominations]] have long accepted evolution, and it is increasingly finding acceptance among evangelical Christians, who strive to keep traditional Christian theology intact.{{sfn|Applegate|Stump|2016}}

Theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism (including intelligent design). Notable examples have included biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and theologian [[John F. Haught]], who testified for the plaintiffs in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] in 2005. Another example is the [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has compiled and maintains statements - signed by American Christian and non-Christian clergy of different denominations - rejecting creationism, with specific reference to points raised by intelligent-design proponents. Theistic evolutionists have also been active in [[:Category:Citizen alliances for science|Citizens Alliances for Science]] that oppose the introduction of creationism into public-school science classes (one example being evangelical Christian geologist [[Keith B. Miller]], who is a prominent board member of [[Kansas Citizens for Science]]).

===Agnostic evolution===
Agnostic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the belief that it is not important whether God is, was, or will have been involved.{{sfn|Scott|2004|p=65|ps=}}

===Materialistic evolution===
[[Materialism| Materialistic]] evolution is the acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the position that if the [[supernatural]] exists, it has little to no influence on the material world (a position common to [[Metaphysical naturalism| philosophical naturalists]], [[humanism| humanists]] and [[atheists]]).{{sfn|Scott|2004|pp= 65–66|ps= }} The [[New Atheism |New Atheists]] champion this view; they argue strongly that the creationist viewpoint is not only dangerous, but is completely rejected by science.

==Arguments relating to the definition and limits of science==
Critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as [[uniformitarianism]], [[Occam's razor]] or parsimony, and the [[Copernican principle]] are claimed to be the result of a [[bias]] within science toward [[philosophical naturalism]], which is equated by many creationists with atheism.<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}; {{harvnb|Hodge|1874|p=177}}; {{harvnb|Wiker|2003}};
{{harvnb|Peters|Hewlett|2005|p=5|ps=}}. Peters and Hewlett argue that the atheism of many evolutionary supporters must be removed from the debate.</ref> In countering this claim, [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] use the term [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] to refer to the long-standing convention in science of the scientific method. The [[methodology|methodological]] assumption is that [[observation|observable]] events in [[nature]] are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science.<ref name="Lenski">{{cite web |url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |title=Evolution: Fact and Theory |last=Lenski |first=Richard E. |author-link=Richard Lenski |date=September 2000 |website=actionbioscience |publisher=[[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=2014-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403205805/http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/lenski.html |archive-date=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}</ref>

Popper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between statements belonging to the empirical sciences and 'all other statements—whether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical character, or simply pseudoscientific'.

===Conflation of science and religion===
{{See also|Objections to evolution#Religious nature|l1=Objection to evolution on the basis that it is a religion}}
Creationists commonly argue against evolution on the grounds that "evolution is a religion; it is not a science,"{{sfn|Ham|1987|ps=}} in order to undermine the higher ground biologists claim in debating creationists, and to reframe the debate from being between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to being between two equally religious beliefs—or even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not.{{sfn|Dembski|1998|ps=}}<ref name="notscience">{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |author-link=Henry M.

This is generally [[argument#By analogy|argued by analogy]], by arguing that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on [[faith]], that supporters of evolution revere Darwin as a prophet, and that supporters of evolution [[dogma]]tically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand.{{sfn|Morris|1974|ps=}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wiker |first=Benjamin D. |author-link=Benjamin Wiker |date=July–August 2003 |title=Part II: The Christian Critics&nbsp;– Does Science Point to God? |url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/2003/part-ii-the-christian-critics-does-science-point-to-god |journal=Crisis Magazine |access-date=2014-08-27 }}</ref> These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neocreationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.{{sfn|Scott|2004|ps=}}

In response, supporters of evolution have argued that no scientist's claims, including Darwin's, are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years, to form first [[neo-Darwinism]] and later the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA611.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA611: Evolution sacrosanct? |date=February 15, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |author-link1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |author-link2=Karl J.

===Appeal to consequences===
{{See also|Objections to evolution#Moral implications|l1=Objection to evolution's moral implications}}
A number of creationists have blurred the boundaries between their disputes over the truth of the underlying facts, and explanatory theories, of evolution, with their purported philosophical and moral consequences. This type of argument is known as an [[appeal to consequences]], and is a [[Informal fallacy|logical fallacy]]. Examples of these arguments include those of prominent creationists such as [[Ken Ham]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ham |first=Ken |author-link=Ken Ham |date=November 1983 |title=Creation Evangelism (Part II of Relevance of Creation) |url=http://creation.com/creation-evangelism-part-ii-of-relevance-of-creation |journal=Ex Nihilo |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=17 |issn=0819-1530 |access-date=2014-08-27}} "Why has the Lord raised up Creation Science ministries worldwide? Why is it necessary to have such organizations? One thing we have come to realize in Creation Science is that the Lord has not just called us to knock down evolution, but to help in restoring the foundation of the Gospel in our society. We believe that if the churches took up the tool of Creation Evangelism in society, not only would we see a stemming of the tide of humanistic philosophy, but we would also see the seeds of revival sown in a culture which is becoming increasingly more pagan each day.

A new wave of so-called missionaries from mainline Protestant denominations came '''teaching evolution''' and a non-supernatural view of the Bible. Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, and Northern Baptist schools were especially hard hit. [[Bertrand Russell]] came from England preaching atheism and socialism. Destructive books brought by such teachers further undermined orthodox Christianity.

==Disputes relating to science==
Many creationists strongly oppose certain scientific theories in a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community,<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1993|p=69}}. Johnson cites three pages spent in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''New Guide to Science'' that take creationists to task, while only spending one half page on evidence of evolution.</ref> and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]], creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by [[Fallacy of quoting out of context#Quote mining and the creation–evolution controversy|quote mining]]) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally pseudoscientific.

===Biology===
{{Evolutionary biology}}
Disputes relating to evolutionary biology are central to the controversy between creationists and the scientific community. The aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include [[common descent]] (and particularly human evolution from common ancestors with other members of the [[Hominidae|great apes]]), [[macroevolution]], and the existence of [[transitional fossil]]s.

====Common descent====
{{Main|Common descent}}
{{See also|Evidence of common descent|Tree of life (biology)}}
{{quote|[The] Discovery [Institute] presents common descent as controversial exclusively within the animal kingdom, as it focuses on embryology, anatomy, and the fossil record to raise questions about them. In the real world of science, common descent of animals is completely noncontroversial; any controversy resides in the microbial world. There, researchers argued over a variety of topics, starting with the very beginning, namely the relationship among the three main branches of life.|John Timmer|''Evolution: what's the real controversy?''<ref name="timmer">{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2008/05/evolution-whats-the-real-controversy/ |title=Evolution: what's the real controversy? |last=Timmer |first=John |date=May 7, 2008 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>}}

A group of [[organism]]s is said to have common descent if they have a common [[ancestor]]. A theory of universal common descent based on evolutionary principles was proposed by Charles Darwin and is now generally accepted by biologists. The most recent common ancestor of all living organisms is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolutionary history of life|3.9 billion years ago]]. With a few exceptions (e.g. [[Michael Behe]]) the vast majority of creationists rejected this theory in favor of the belief that a common design suggests a common designer (God). Many of these same creationists through the beginning of the 21st century also held that modern species were perpetually fixed from creation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://answersingenesis.org/evidence-for-creation/the-discontinuity-of-life/ |title=The Discontinuity of Life |last=Wise |first=Kurt |author-link=Kurt Wise |website=Answers in Genesis |publisher=[[Answers in Genesis]] |location=Hebron, KY |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/10651 |title=A Primer on the Tree of Life |last=Luskin |first=Casy |date=May 12, 2009 |website=Evolution News & Views |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle, WA |access-date=2014-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |date=May 2002 |title=Evolution Versus the People |url=http://www.icr.org/article/evolution-versus-people/ |format=PDF |journal=Back to Genesis |issue=161 |pages=a–c |oclc=26390403 |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref> However, now a large amount of creationists allow evolution of species, in the face of undeniable evidence for [[speciation]]. They contend, however, that it was specific "kinds" or [[baramin]] that were created initially, from which all present-day species arose. Thus all bear species may have developed from a common ancestor that was separately created to establish a bear-like baramin, by this type of creationism. This type of creationism often acknowledges the existence of evolutionary processes but denies that they demonstrate common ancestry or that evolutionary processes would have produced the diversity of contemporary life.<ref name=":0" />

Evidence of common descent includes evidence from genetics, fossil records, [[comparative anatomy]], [[biogeography|geographical distribution of species]], [[comparative physiology]] and [[Biochemistry|comparative biochemistry]].

=====Human evolution=====

{{Main|Human evolution|Homo|Human taxonomy}}
{{See also|Paleoanthropology|Adam and Eve}}
Human evolution is the study of the biological evolution of humans as a distinct [[species]] from its common ancestors with other animals. Analysis of fossil evidence and [[genetic distance]] are two of the means by which scientists understand this evolutionary history.

Fossil evidence suggests that humans' earliest [[hominid]] ancestors may have split from other [[primates]] as early as the late [[Oligocene]], circa 26 to 24 [[Megaannum|Ma]], and that by the early [[Miocene]], the [[adaptive radiation]] of many different hominoid forms was well underway.{{sfn|Stringer|Andrews|2005|ps=}} Evidence from the [[molecular clock|molecular dating]] of genetic differences indicates that the [[gibbon]] lineage (family [[Gibbon|Hylobatidae]]) diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the [[orangutan]] lineage (subfamily [[Ponginae]]) diverged about 12 Ma. While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from India and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from [[Turkey]], dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the [[gorilla]]s, and then the [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]] (genus ''Pan'') split from the line leading to the humans.{{sfn|Relethford|2004|ps=}} We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see [[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Toumaï]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/july/toumai/index.html |title=Toumaï the Human Ancestor |date=July 10, 2002 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020805134540/http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/july/toumai/index.html |archive-date=2002-08-05 |access-date=2009-02-21}}</ref> Comparisons of [[DNA]] show that 99.4 percent of the [[coding region]]s are identical in chimpanzees and humans (95–96% overall<ref name="Britten2002">{{cite journal |last=Britten |first=Roy J. |author-link=Roy John Britten |date=October 15, 2002 |title=Divergence between samples of chimpanzee and human DNA sequences is 5%, counting indels |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]] |volume=99 |issue=21 |pages=13633–13635 |bibcode=2002PNAS...9913633B |doi=10.1073/pnas.172510699 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=129726 |pmid=12368483 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Varki |first1=Ajit |author-link1=Ajit Varki |last2=Altheide |first2=Tasha K. |date=December 2005 |title=Comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes: Searching for needles in a haystack |journal=[[Genome Research]] |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1746–1758 |doi=10.1101/gr.3737405 |issn=1549-5469 |pmid=16339373 |doi-access=free }}</ref>), which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry.<ref name="98.4">{{cite journal |last=Hecht |first=Jeff |date=May 19, 2003 |title=Chimps are human, gene study implies |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html |journal=[[New Scientist]] |issn=0262-4079 |access-date=2014-08-27}}

Creationists dispute there is evidence of shared ancestry in the fossil evidence, and argue either that these are misassigned ape fossils (e.g. that [[Java Man]] was a gibbon) or too similar to modern humans to designate them as distinct or transitional forms. Creationists frequently disagree where the dividing lines would be. Creation myths (such as the Book of Genesis) frequently posit a [[List of protoplasts|first man]] ([[Adam]], in the case of Genesis), which has been advocated by creationists as underlying an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account. All these claims and objections are subsequently refuted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/gibbon.html |title=Was Java Man a gibbon? |last=Foley |first=Jim |date=April 30, 2003 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaak|2007|ps=: See disputes over the classification of Neanderthals.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html |title=Comparison of all skulls |last=Foley |first=Jim |date=October 28, 2005 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>

Creationists also dispute the scientific community's interpretation of genetic evidence in the study of human evolution. They argue that it is a "dubious assumption" that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship, and that scientists are coming to this interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist. Creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because, they assert, the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental.{{sfn|Nelkin|2000|p=242|ps=}} However, most mutations are [[neutral mutation|neutral]], and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.{{sfn|Isaak|2007|pp=[https://archive.org/details/countercreationi0000isaa/page/52 52–53]}}

In biology, macroevolution refers to evolution at and above the species level, including most of fossil history and much of systematics. [[microevolution]] refers to the process in evolution within populations, including adaptive and neutral evolution. However, there is no fundamental distinction between these processes; small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kutschera|first1=Ulrich|last2=Niklas|first2=KarlJ.|title=The modern theory of biological evolution: an expanded synthesis|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=17 March 2004|volume=91|issue=6|doi=10.1007/s00114-004-0515-y|bibcode = 2004NW.....91..255K|pmid=15241603|pages=255–276|s2cid=10731711}}</ref> Creationists argue that a finite number of discrete ''kinds'' were created, as described in the Book of Genesis, and these kinds determine the limits of variation.{{sfn|Morris|1976|p=[https://archive.org/details/genesisrecordsc00morr/page/63 63]}} Early Creationists equated kinds with species, but most now accept that speciation can occur: not only is the evidence overwhelming for speciation, but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in Noah's Ark, as depicted in Genesis.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Awbrey|first1=Frank T.|title=Defining "Kinds" &nbsp;– Do Creationists Apply a Double Standard?|journal=Creation Evolution Journal|date=Summer 1981|volume=2|issue=3|pages=1–6|url=http://ncse.com/cej/2/3/defining-kinds-do-creationists-apply-double-standard|access-date=31 March 2016}}</ref> ''Created kinds'' identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the [[Family (biology)|family]] (for example, [[Canidae]]), but the genus ''[[Homo]]'' is a separate kind.

Recent arguments against macroevolution (in the Creationist sense) include the intelligent design (ID) arguments of [[irreducible complexity]] and [[specified complexity]]. Neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as pseudoscience. When taken to court in an attempt to introduce ID into the classroom, the judge wrote "The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory."

====Transitional fossils====
{{Main|Transitional fossil}}
{{See also|List of transitional fossils|Bird evolution|Evolution of the horse}}
It is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils.{{sfn|Morris|1985|pp=78–90|ps=}}{{sfn|Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York|International Bible Students Association|1985|pp=57–59|ps=}} This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display<!-- "or" already means that it might have been used for either the three options, two options or one option; "and/or" is redundant -->. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight.

[[File:Ambulocetus BW.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of ''[[Ambulocetus]] natans'']]
As another example, [[Alan Hayward]] stated in ''Creation and Evolution'' (1985) that "Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems. They believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=May 1994 |title=Hooking Leviathan by Its Past |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_leviathan.html |journal=Natural History |volume=103 |issue=4 |pages=8–15 |issn=0028-0712 |access-date=2014-08-27}} Gould quotes from {{harvnb|Hayward|1985}}.</ref> The [[Evolution of cetaceans|evolution of whales]] has been documented in considerable detail, with ''[[Ambulocetus]]'', described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian [[crocodile]], as one of the transitional fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fordyce |first1=R.

Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.

The theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by Stephen Jay Gould and [[Niles Eldredge]] is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.{{sfn|Hoagland|Dodson|Hauck|2001|p=298|ps=}}

Experts in evolutionary theory have pointed out that even if it were possible for enough fossils to survive to show a close transitional change critics will never be satisfied, as the discovery of one "missing link" itself creates two more so-called "missing links" on either side of the discovery. Richard Dawkins says that the reason for this "losing battle" is that many of these critics are theists who "simply don't want to see the truth."

===Geology===
{{Main|Flood geology}}
{{See also|Geochronology|Age of the Earth}}

Many believers in Young Earth creationism—a position held by the majority of proponents of 'flood geology'—accept biblical ''chronogenealogies'' (such as the Ussher chronology, which in turn is based on the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] version of the [[Genealogies of Genesis]]). They believe that God created the universe approximately 6,000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in [[anthropology]], geology, and [[planetary science]] that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of [[radiometric dating]] and [[isochron dating|isochron]] analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by [[diffusion]] of the parent and daughter isotopes. A full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs and gives essentially identical or near identical readings, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.

The consensus of professional scientific organizations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately 4.5 billion years.<ref name="IAP_2006" /> Young Earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology. They have often quoted apparently inconsistent radiometric dates to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method. Mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the [[physical law]]s governing [[radioactive decay]] have not been violated since the sample was formed (harking back to Lyell's doctrine of uniformitarianism). They also point out that the "problems" that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all, are issues with known contamination, or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data.

===Other sciences===

====Cosmology====
{{See also|Age of the universe}}
While Young Earth creationists believe that the [[Universe]] was created by the [[Judeo-Christian]] God approximately 6000 years ago, the current scientific consensus is that the Universe as we know it emerged from the [[Big Bang]] 13.8 billion years ago. The recent science of [[nucleocosmochronology]] is extending the approaches used for [[carbon-14]] and other [[radiometric dating]] to the dating of astronomical features. For example, based upon this emerging science, the Galactic [[thin disk]] of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy is estimated to have been formed 8.3 ± 1.8 billion years ago.<ref name="Del2005">{{cite journal |last1=del Peloso |first1=E.

====Nuclear physics====
{{See also|radiometric dating}}
Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period, from which they infer that "billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay" have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that [[radioactive decay|radioisotope decay]] rates are constant, a core principle underlying [[nuclear physics]] generally, and [[radiometric dating]] in particular.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Humphreys |first=D.

The scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental [[geochronology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/helium/zircons.html |title=Dr. Humphreys' Young-Earth Helium Diffusion 'Dates': Numerous Fallacies Based on Bad Assumptions and Questionable Data |last=Henke |first=Kevin R. |author-link=Kevin Henke |date=June 20, 2010 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston|access-date=2014-08-27}} Original version: March 17, 2005; Revisions: November 24, 2005; July 25, 2006 and June 20, 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gondwanaresearch.com/rate.htm |title=R.A.T.E: More Faulty Creation Science from The Institute for Creation Research |last=Meert |first=Joseph G. |date=February 6, 2003 |website=Gondwana Research |publisher=Joseph Meert |location=Gainesville, Florida |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>

In refutation of Young Earth claims of inconstant decay-rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specializing in isotope dating states:

{{quote|There are only three quite technical instances where a half-life changes, and these do not affect the dating methods [under discussion]":<ref>Dating methods discussed were [[K–Ar dating|potassium–argon dating]], [[argon–argon dating]], [[rubidium–strontium dating]], [[samarium–neodymium dating]], lutetium–hafnium, [[rhenium–osmium dating]], and [[uranium–lead dating]].</ref>

# Only one technical exception occurs under terrestrial conditions, and this is not for an isotope used for dating.... The artificially-produced isotope, beryllium-7 has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.
# ... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus.... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees....
# The last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by atomic clocks in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's [[theory of relativity]]. No rocks in our solar system are going fast enough to make a noticeable change in their dates.... |Roger C.

===Misrepresentations of the scientific community===
The Discovery Institute has a "formal declaration" titled "[[A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism]]" which has many evangelicals, people from fields irrelevant to biology and geology and few biologists. Many of the biologists who signed have fields not directly related to evolution.<ref name="Chang2006NYT">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |date=February 21, 2006 |title=Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/sciencespecial2/21peti.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> In response, there has been an analogous declaration humorously upholding the consensus, [[Project Steve]], which emphasizes the large amount of scientists supporting the consensus.

====Quote mining====
{{Main|Fallacy of quoting out of context#Quote mining and the creation–evolution controversy|l1=Quote mining}}
As a means to criticize mainstream science, creationists sometimes quote scientists who ostensibly support the mainstream theories, but appear to acknowledge criticisms similar to those of creationists.<ref name="Dobzhansky_1973" /> These have very often been shown to be [[quote mining|quote mines]] that do not accurately reflect the evidence for evolution or the mainstream scientific community's opinion of it, or are highly out-of-date.<ref name="talk_origins_quote_mine">{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/project.html |title=The Quote Mine Project: Or, Lies, Damned Lies and Quote Mines |date=October 31, 2006 |editor-last=Pieret |editor-first=John |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2007-01-23}}</ref> Many of the same quotes used by creationists have appeared so frequently in Internet discussions due to the availability of [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]] functions, that the [[TalkOrigins Archive]] has created "The Quote Mine Project" for quick reference to the original context of these quotations.<ref name="talk_origins_quote_mine" /> Creationists often quote mine Darwin, especially with regard to the seeming improbability of the evolution of the eye, to give support to their views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/darwin_eye_quote_revisited.htm |title=The incomprehensible creationist – the Darwin 'eye' quote revisited |last=Stear |first=John |date=May 16, 2005 |website=No Answers in Genesis! |publisher=[[Australian Skeptics|Australian Skeptics Science and Education Foundation]] |location=Melbourne |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>

==Public policy issues==
{{Globalize section|[[the United States]]|date=August 2020}}
The creation–evolution controversy has grown in importance in recent years, interfacing with other contemporary political issues, primarily those in the United States that involve the [[Christian right]].

===Science education===

===Freedom of speech===
Creationists have claimed that preventing them from teaching creationism violates their right of [[freedom of speech]]. Court cases (such as ''[[Webster v. New Lenox School District]]'' (1990) and ''[[Bishop v. Aronov]]'' (1991)) have upheld school districts' and universities' right to restrict teaching to a specified curriculum.

==Issues relating to religion==
{{See also|Relationship between religion and science|Catholic Church and evolution|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}

===Religion and historical scientists===
Creationists often argue that Christianity and literal belief in the Bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress.<ref>{{harvnb|Woods|2005|loc=Chapter five: "The Church and Science"|pp=67–114}}</ref> To that end, Institute for Creation Research founder Henry M. Morris has enumerated scientists such as astronomer and philosopher [[Galileo Galilei]], mathematician and theoretical physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]], mathematician and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]], geneticist monk [[Gregor Mendel]], and [[Isaac Newton]] as believers in a biblical creation narrative.<ref>* {{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |date=January 1982 |title=Bible-Believing Scientists of the Past |url=http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&action=view&ID=185 |journal=Acts & Facts |volume=11 |issue=1 |issn=1094-8562 |access-date=2007-01-20}}</ref>

This argument usually involves scientists who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study did not include evolution. The argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA114: Creationist scientists |date=November 25, 2005 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>

Many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin's theory of evolution with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s theories of inheritance and genetics.<!-- Hopefully something so well known won't be viewed as original research. --> Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that "[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution|Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]," and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ayala |first=Francisco J. |author-link=Francisco J.

Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html |title=Index to Creationist Claims: Claim CA114.22: Pasteur and creationism |date=February 22, 2004 |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref>

The [[relationship between religion and science]] was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late-19th century, and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sci_rel.htm |title=Conflicts & occasional agreements in 'truth' between science and religion |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |date=February 11, 2014 |orig-year=Originally published November 28, 1999 |website=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref> Many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs.

===Debates===
Many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life, hosted by a variety of institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,119,Why-I-Wont-Debate-Creationists,Richard-Dawkins |title=Why I Won't Debate Creationists |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |date=May 15, 2006 |website=RichardDawkins.net |publisher=[[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]] |location=Washington, D.C. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713004332/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C119%2CWhy-I-Wont-Debate-Creationists%2CRichard-Dawkins |archive-date=2007-07-13 |access-date=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For example, in May 2004 [[Michael Shermer]] debated creationist [[Kent Hovind]] in front of a predominantly creationist audience. In Shermer's online reflection while he was explaining that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was "not an intellectual exercise," but rather it was "an emotional drama," with scientists arguing from "an impregnable fortress of evidence that converges to an unmistakable conclusion," while for creationists it is "a spiritual war."<ref name="Hovind">{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Shermer |date=May 10, 2004 |title=Then a Miracle Occurs: An Obstreperous Evening with the Insouciant Kent Hovind, Young Earth Creationist and Defender of the Faith |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-05-10/#miracle |journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|eSkeptic]] |issn=1556-5696 |access-date=2014-07-31}}</ref> While receiving positive responses from creationist observers, Shermer concluded "Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable (evolution v. creation is not), with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion."<ref name="Hovind" /> (see [[Non-overlapping magisteria]]). Others, like evolutionary biologist [[Massimo Pigliucci]], have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try "to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks" and at Hovind's assertion that biologists believe humans "evolved from bananas."{{sfn|Pigliucci|2002|p=102|ps=}}

[[Eugenie Scott]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists.<ref name="Hovind" /> Scott says that "Evolution is not on trial in the world of science," and "the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution" but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Stephen Jay Gould adopted a similar position, explaining:

{{quote|Debate is an art form. It is about the winning of arguments. It is not about the discovery of truth. There are certain rules and procedures to debate that really have nothing to do with establishing fact—which [creationists] are very good at. Some of those rules are: never say anything positive about your own position because it can be attacked, but chip away at what appear to be the weaknesses in your opponent's position. They are good at that. I don't think I could beat the creationists at debate. I can tie them. But in courtrooms they are terrible, because in courtrooms you cannot give speeches.

{{See also|Politics of creationism|Santorum Amendment}}
On both sides of the controversy a wide range of organizations are involved at a number of levels in lobbying in an attempt to influence political decisions relating to the teaching of evolution. These include the Discovery Institute, the National Center for Science Education, the [[National Science Teachers Association]], state [[:Category:Citizen alliances for science|Citizens Alliances for Science]], and numerous national science associations and state academies of science.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/science |title=Statements from Scientific and Scholarly Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |access-date=2014-08-27|date=2008-09-08 }}</ref>

The controversy has been discussed in numerous newspaper articles, reports, [[Editorial|op-eds]] and letters to the editor, as well as a number of radio and television programmes (including the [[PBS]] series, [[Evolution (TV series)|''Evolution'']] (2001) and [[D. James Kennedy|Coral Ridge Ministries]]' [[D. James Kennedy#Apologetics and views|''Darwin's Deadly Legacy'']] (2006)). This has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public. [[Edward Humes]] states:

{{quote|There are really two theories of evolution. There is the genuine scientific theory and there is the talk-radio pretend version, designed not to enlighten but to deceive and enrage.
The talk-radio version had a packed town hall up in arms at the ''Why Evolution Is Stupid'' lecture.

Europeans have often regarded the creation–evolution controversy as an American matter.<ref name="TBO" /> In recent years the conflict has become an issue in other countries including [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Turkey]] and [[Serbia]].<ref name="TBO" /><ref name="NCSE Edis"/><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=September 9, 2004 |title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3642460.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Highfield |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Highfield |date=October 2, 2007 |title=Creationists rewrite natural history |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3309018/Creationists-rewrite-natural-history.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |access-date=2008-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Blancke |first=Stefaan |date=December 2010 |title=Creationism in the Netherlands |url=https://www.academia.edu/212996 |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=791–816 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01134.x |issn=0591-2385 |access-date=2014-08-27|hdl=1854/LU-959157 }}</ref>

On September 17, 2007, the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) issued a report on the attempt by American-inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools. It concludes "If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe... The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Recognition for Our Noodly Friend |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626292.900-feedback.html |type=Feedback |date=November 10, 2007 |journal=New Scientist |volume=196 |issue=2629 |page=112 |doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62868-1 |issn=0262-4079 |access-date=2014-08-27}}</ref> The [[Council of Europe]] firmly rejected creationism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2011/03/evolution-abroad-006522 |title=Evolution abroad |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 4, 2011 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |access-date=2014-05-02}}</ref>

===Asia===

====South Korea====
In South Korea, most opposition to teaching evolution comes from the local evangelical community. As part of these efforts, the [[Korean Association for Creation Research]] (KACR) was established in 1981 by evangelical pastors [[Kim Yŏnggil]] and [[Ch‘oe Yŏngsang]]. In South Korea, according to a 2009 survey, about 30 percent of the population believe in creation science while opposing the teaching of evolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sang-yong |first=Song |date=August 2018 |title=The Creation Science Movement in Korea: A Perspective from the History and Philosophy of Science |url=https://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-23-2-13.pdf |url-status=live |journal=International Journal of Korean History |location=Seoul |publisher=Institute of Korean Culture; Center for Korean History |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=13–35 |doi=10.22372/ijkh.2018.23.2.13 |oclc=742363820 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200209043240/https://ijkh.khistory.org/upload/pdf/ijkh-23-2-13.pdf |archive-date=2020-02-09 |access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref>
