'''Rachel Albeck-Gidron''' ([[Hebrew]]: רחל אַלבֶּק-גדרוֹן; born 1960) is an Israeli inter-disciplinary researcher of  Hebrew and comparative [[literature]], [[philosophy]] and [[art]].

==Research==
In her book, ''The Century of the Monads'', Albeck-Gidron claims that there is a deep similarity and even a relationship between [[monadology|monadic]] [[metaphysics]] and the basic assumptions of [[modernism|modernistic]] thought. This claim is demonstrated in 20th-century scientific thought patterns, in the central movements in plastic art from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and, particularly, in the world view of the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The Century of the Monads: Leibniz's Metaphysics and 20th-Century Modernity |publisher=Bar-Ilan University Press }}</ref>

She also developed a theoretical model of describing  the process of creation of  textual-versions and created a method of comparing between them, named 'the third text'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=The 3rd text – a theoretical and methodological principle in comparative research, and its application in comparison of the versions of Berdyczewski's story 'Urva Parch' |journal=Sadan |volume=4 |year=2000 |pages=323–352 }}</ref>

Albeck-Gidron examines the [[Ashkenaz]]i [[Pronunciation]] of [[Hebrew]] as a [[Postmodernism|Postmodernistic]] Question, in a part of a [[sociological]] discussion in a problem known as 'invention of tradition'.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Rachel |last=Albeck-Gidron |title=Exiled and Suppressed Voices: On the Ashkenazi Pronunciation of Hebrew as a Postmodernistic Question |journal=Jerusalem Studies in Hebrew Literature |volume=19 |year=2003 |pages=69–90 }}</ref> She has also analyzed the work of [[Yoel Hoffmann]] in the light of western and eastern poetics.

Albeck-Gidron is Associate professor of Hebrew literature at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel.<ref>http://www.biu.ac.il/faculty/tomy/</ref>
In 2007, she has been appointed as visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University]] and taught the course "East West East in Israeli Literature: The Novels of Yoel Hoffmann".<ref>http://www.stanford.edu/dept/jewishstudies/people/scholars_2006_07.html</ref>
