'''Hindu philosophy''' encompasses the philosophies, world views and teachings<ref>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&direction=SE&script=HK&link=yes&beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']</ref> that emerged in [[History of India|ancient India]]. These include six systems (''[[darśana|shad-darśana]]'') – [[Samkhya|Sankhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]].<ref name=andrewoverview>Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5</ref> 

In Indian tradition, the word used for philosophy is '''Darshana'''. This word comes from the Sanskrit root ''drish'' (to see, to experience).<ref>[https://www.esamskriti.com/e/Spirituality/Philosophy/What-does-DARSHANA-mean-1.aspx Meaning of word Darshana]</ref>

These are also called the [[Āstika and nāstika|Astika]] (theistic) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the [[Vedas]] as an authoritative, important source of knowledge.<ref name="KK26" />{{refn|group=note|M Chadha (2015), in The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, states that Vedas were knowledge source but interpreted differently by different schools of Hindu philosophy: "The sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are variously interpreted by the six traditional Hindu philosophical schools. Even within a single school, philosophers disagree on the import of Vedic statements. (...) Hindu intellectual traditions must be understood as standing for the collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection. There is no single, comprehensive philosophical doctrine shared by all intellectual traditions in Hinduism that distinguishes their view from other Indian religions such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]] on issues of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, ethics or cosmology. The Vedas are regarded as Apauruseya, but by the same token, they are not the Word of God either.<ref>M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Elisa Freschi (2012): The Vedas are not [[Deontological ethics|deontic]] authorities in absolute sense and may be disobeyed, but are recognized as an [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority by an orthodox school of Hindu philosophy;<ref>Elisa Freschi (2012), Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004222601}}, page 62</ref> (Note: This differentiation between epistemic and deontic authority is true for all Indian religions)}} Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called ''nāstika'' (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies.<ref name=andrewoverview/><ref name="KK26" /> Nāstika Indian philosophies include [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Ājīvika]], and others.<ref name=bilimoriaastika>P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88</ref>

Western scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies, starting with the writings of [[Indology|Indologists]] and [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies.<ref name=andrewoverview/> The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology.<ref name=frazierintrop2>{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}</ref><ref>Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 101-119</ref> While Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox traditions such as Cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy.<ref>R Thomas (2014), Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design.

Hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies, such as the realism of the Nyāya, the naturalism of the Vaiśeṣika, the dualism of the Sāṅkhya, the [[non-dualism]] and knowledge of Self as essential to liberation of Advaita, the self-discipline of yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.<ref name=klaussaiva>Klaus K.

Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive [[Epistemology|epistemological]] literature called ''[[Pramana|pramāṇaśāstras]]'',{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=172}}{{sfn|Guttorm Fløistad|1993|p=137-154}} as well as theories on [[metaphysics]], [[axiology]], and other topics.<ref name=karlpotterov>Karl H.

==Classifications==
{{further|Āstika and nāstika}}
In the [[history of Hinduism]], the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the [[Common Era]], and some schools emerged possibly even before the [[Buddha]] <ref>Students' Britannica India (2000), Volume 4, Encyclopædia Britannica, {{ISBN|978-0852297605}}, page 316</ref> Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Hindu philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=98-102}}

Since ancient times Indian philosophy has been categorized into ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' schools of thought.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} The orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy have been called '''ṣaḍdarśana''' ("six systems"). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by [[Vedanta|Vedantins]].<ref name=uh14>{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Andrew J. |title=Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history |date=2014 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSg0RGmMaTwC |isbn=9780231149877}}</ref>{{rp|2–3}} It was then adopted by the early Western [[indology|Indologists]], and pervades modern understandings of Hindu philosophy.<ref name=uh14/>{{rp|4–5}}

===Āstika===
There are six āstika (orthodox) schools of thought.{{refn|group=note|For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453–487.}} Each is called a [[darśana]], and each darśana accepts the [[Vedas]] as authority. Each astika darsana also accepts the premise that ''[[atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (soul, eternal self) exists.<ref name="KK26">[[Klaus Klostermaier]] (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26</ref><ref>John Plott, James Dolin and Russell Hatton (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62</ref> The {{IAST|āstika}} schools of philosophy are:
# [[Samkhya]] - An atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of [[Purusha|consciousness]] and [[Prakṛti|matter]].
# [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] - A school which emerged from Sankhya and emphasises on practical use of Sankhya theory. This schools focuses on [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], [[Samadhi|contemplation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]].
# [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] or [[Indian logic|logic]] - The school of epistemology which explores [[pramana|sources of knowledge]]. 
# [[Vaiśeṣika]] - An [[empiricism|empiricist]] school of [[atomism]].
# [[Mīmāṃsā]] - An anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of [[orthopraxy]]. This school deals with the correct interpretation of the verses in [[Vedas]].
# [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] - The last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or ''jñānakāṇḍa'' (section of knowledge). Vedanta is also referred as Uttara-Mimamsa. Vedānta came to be the dominant current of [[Hinduism]] in the post-medieval period.

Besides the major orthodox and non-orthodox schools, there have existed syncretic sub-schools that have combined ideas and introduced new ones of their own.

The above sub-schools introduced their own ideas while adopting concepts from orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy such as realism of the Nyāya, naturalism of Vaiśeṣika, monism and knowledge of Self (Atman) as essential to liberation of Advaita, self-discipline of Yoga, asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.<ref name="klaussaiva"/> Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions.<ref name="Klaus K.

==Overview==
===Epistemology===
{{main|Pramana}}
[[Epistemology]] is called [[pramana|pramāṇa]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. Pramāṇa is a hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} The focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=172}}

Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: 
# ''Pratyakṣa'' - Direct perception 
# ''Anumāṇa'' - Inference or indirect perception
# ''Upamāṇa'' - Comparison and analogy 
# ''Arthāpatti'' - Postulation, derivation from circumstances 
# ''Anupalabdi'' - Non-perception, absence of proof 
# ''Shabda'' - Word, testimony of past or present reliable experts{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} 

Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge.{{sfn|Guttorm Fløistad|1993|p=137-154}} For example, the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge,{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} the [[Samkhya]] school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony),{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}

==Sāmkhya==
{{Main|Samkhya}}

Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in [[Hinduism]],{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=232}} with origins in the 1st millennium BCE.<ref>Sharma, C. (1997).

These were ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''sabda'' (''Āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).<ref>Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248</ref>{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

Samkhya school espouses [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] between consciousness and matter.<ref>{{citation |last = Michaels |first = Axel |title = Hinduism: Past and Present |year = 2004 |publisher = Princeton University Press |page=264 |isbn = 0-691-08953-1 }}</ref> It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: ''[[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'' (consciousness) and ''[[prakriti]]'' (matter). ''[[Jiva]]'' (a living being) is that state in which ''puruṣa'' is bonded to ''prakriti'' in some form.<ref name=sambri/> This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of ''buddhi'' (awareness, intellect) and ''ahankara'' (individualized ego consciousness, “I-maker”). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.<ref name=sambri>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520526/Samkhya Samkhya - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)</ref>

Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of [[Guṇa|gunas]] (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche).<ref>Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 154-206</ref> Guna, it states, are of three types: ''Sattva'' being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; ''Rajas'' guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and ''Tamas'' being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three ''gunas'', but in different proportions.<ref>James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, page 265</ref> The interplay of these ''gunas'' defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.<ref>T Bernard (1999), ''Hindu Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1373-1}}, pages 74–76</ref><ref name="Haney">Haney, William S., Culture and Consciousness: Literature Regained, Bucknell University Press (1 August 2002).

The ''[[Samkhyakarika|Samkhya karika]]'', one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be "three<ref>''adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika'' - that is, suffering caused internally by self, cause by other human beings, caused by acts of nature</ref> kinds of human suffering" and means to prevent them.<ref name=colebrookesktrans>[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press</ref> The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states,

{{Quote|
<poem>
From the triad of suffering, arises this inquiry into the means of preventing it.<br />That is useless - if you say so, I say: No, because suffering is not absolute and final. – Verse 1<br />
The [[Guṇa]]s (qualities) respectively consist in pleasure, pain and dullness, are adapted to manifestation, activity and restraint; mutually domineer, rest on each other, produce each other, consort together, and are reciprocally present. – Verse 12
Goodness is considered to be alleviating and enlightening; foulness, urgent and persisting; darkness, heavy and enveloping. Like a lamp, they cooperate for a purpose by union of contraries. – Verse 13<br />
There is a general cause, which is diffuse. It operates by means of the three qualities, by mixture, by modification; for different objects are diversified by influence of the several qualities respectively. – Verse 16
Since the assemblage of perceivable objects is for use (by man); Since the converse of that which has the three qualities with other properties must exist (in man); Since there must be superintendence (within man); Since there must be some entity that enjoys (within man); Since there is a tendency to abstraction (in man), therefore soul is. – Verse 17

==Yoga==
{{main|Yoga (philosophy)}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools.<ref>For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: {{harvnb|Chatterjee|Datta|1984|p=43}}.</ref>  The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] philosophical system aligns closely with the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] premises of the [[Samkhya]] school.<ref name=edbryant>Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''] IEP</ref>{{sfn|Chatterjee|Datta|1984|p=43}} The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god ([[Ishvara]]), unlike Samkhya.<ref>{{cite book |last=Radhakrishnan |first=S. |author-link=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |author2=Moore, CA |title=A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy |year=1967 |publisher=Princeton |isbn=0-691-01958-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sourcebookinindi00radh/page/453 453] |url=https://archive.org/details/sourcebookinindi00radh/page/453 }}</ref><ref>Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Heinrich |author-link=Heinrich Zimmer |title=Philosophies of India |year=1951 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New York City |isbn=0-691-01758-1 }} Bollingen Series XXVI; Edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], page 280</ref> The [[epistemology]] of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge:{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''śabda'' (''āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: [[purusha|puruṣa]] (consciousness) and [[prakṛti]] (matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as "seer, experiencer" and "seen, experienced" than the Samkhya school.<ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages x-xi, 101-107, 142 and Introduction chapter</ref>

A key text of the Yoga school is the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. [[Patanjali]] may have been, as [[Max Müller]] explains, "the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras."<ref>Max Müeller, [https://archive.org/stream/sixsystemsofindi00mulliala#page/410/mode/2up The six systems of Indian philosophy], Longmans, page 410</ref> Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as [[rāja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga|jñāna yoga]],<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'' by Georg Feuerstein</ref> [[karma yoga]], [[bhakti yoga]], [[tantra]] yoga, [[mantra]] yoga, [[Kundalini yoga|laya yoga]], and [[hatha yoga]].<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and [[Tantra]]'', [[Georg Feuerstein]]</ref>

The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that [[jñāna]] (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha.<ref name=edbryant/> Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of [[monism|monistic]] personalism.<ref name=shphillips>{{cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | url=https://archive.org/details/classicalindianm00phil | url-access=registration | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicalindianm00phil/page/12 12–13]}}</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/ Personalism] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2013)</ref><ref>Northrop Frye (2006), Educated Imagination and Other Writings on Critical Theory, 1933-1962, University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0802092090}}, page 291</ref> Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman.<ref>Mike McNamee and William J.

==Vaiśeṣika==
{{main|Vaisheshika}}
The Vaiśeṣika philosophy is a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] school.<ref name="Dale Riepe 1996 pages 227-246"/> It is a form of [[atomism]] in natural philosophy.<ref name=jganeri>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to ''paramāṇu'' ([[atom]]s), and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.<ref name=olilv/> Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vaiśeṣika school.<ref name=olilv/> The Vaiśeṣika darśana is credited to [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kaṇāda Kaśyapa]] from the second half of the first millennium BCE.<ref name=olilv>Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.''

{{Quote|Dharma is that from which results the accomplishment of Exaltation and of the Supreme Good. The authoritativeness of the Veda arises from its being an exposition of ''dharma''. The Supreme Good results from knowledge, produced from a particular ''dharma'', of the essence of the Predicables, Substance, Attribute, Action, Genus, Species and Combination, by means of their resemblances and differences.

Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 38-54</ref>}}

The Vaiśeṣika school is related to the Nyāya school but features differences in its [[epistemology]], metaphysics and ontology.<ref>DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, pages 172-175</ref> The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school, like [[Buddhism]], accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable – perception and inference.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=225}} The Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}<ref name="bilimoriaved"/>

Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire). Each of these four are of two types:<ref name=jganeri/> atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible.<ref name=jganeri/> The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their [[guṇa]] (quality), ''karma'' (activity), ''sāmānya'' (commonness), ''viśeṣa'' (particularity) and ''amavāya'' (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).<ref name=olilv/><ref>M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, pages 228-237</ref>

==Nyāya==
{{main|Nyāya}}

The Nyāya school is a [[philosophical realism|realist]] āstika philosophy.<ref name=nyabri>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/423058/Nyaya Nyaya: Indian Philosophy] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)</ref>{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=221-227}} The school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of [[logic]], methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.<ref>B Gupta (2012), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge and Freedom, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 171-189</ref><ref>PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 223</ref> The foundational text of the Nyāya school is the ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'' of the first millennium BCE.

An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge" (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. xiv.</ref><ref name="Michael Brannigan 2009 page 7"/>

Nyāya epistemology accepts four out of six ''prāmaṇas'' as reliable means of gaining knowledge – ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}<ref name=dpsb>DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172</ref>{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}}

In its [[metaphysics]], the Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than the others.<ref name=nyabri/> It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance).<ref>Vassilis Vitsaxis (2009), Thought and Faith, Somerset Hall Press, {{ISBN|978-1935244042}}, page 131</ref> Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality.<ref>BK Matilal (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807174}}, pages 353-357</ref> The Nyāya Sūtras begin:
{{Quote|<poem>Perception, Inference, Comparison and Word – these are the means of right knowledge.
Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable and non-erratic.
Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds: a priori, a posteriori, and commonly seen.
Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.
Word is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.
It [knowledge] is of two kinds: that which is seen, and that which is not seen.
Soul, body, senses, objects of senses, intellect, mind, activity, fault, transmigration, fruit, suffering and release – are the objects of right knowledge.

The Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The [[Prabhākara|Prābhākara]] subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).<ref name="dpsb"/>{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} The [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.<ref name=olilpm/><ref>{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66}}</ref> To them, [[dharma]] meant rituals and duties, not [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods), because devas existed only in name.<ref name=olilpm/> The Mīmāṃsākas held that the [[Vedas]] are "eternal authorless infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'' (injunctions) and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''karya'' (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the [[Upanishads]] and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the [[Vedanta]] school disagreed with.<ref name=olilm/><ref name=olilpm/>

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].<ref>Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3</ref> While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools,<ref>Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), {{ISBN|978-3110181593}}, pages 23-24, 551-663</ref> their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also ''describe'', ''develop'' and ''derive''.<ref name=olilpm/> Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasized ''karmakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the [[śruti]] which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized ''jñānakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).<ref name=olilm>Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503</ref>

The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge:<ref name=bilimoriaved>P Bilimoria (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154</ref> ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} All of these have been further categorized by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.<ref name=bilimoriaved/>

The emergence of Vedanta school represented a period when a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge. These focussed on ''jnana'' (knowledge) driven aspects of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and the Upanishads. This included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and [[Brahman]], and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.<ref>Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77;<br />JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), Oxford University Press, page 107-108</ref><ref>Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251;<br />R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347</ref>

===Advaita===

''Advaita'' literally means "not two, sole, unity".

===Viśiṣṭādvaita===
{{Main|Vishishtadvaita}}
[[Ramanuja]] (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism. Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Viśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher Etter|title=A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&pg=PA62|date=30 April 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-39312-1|pages=62–63}}</ref> Ramanuja saw [[Vishnu]] as a personification of Brahman.

===Dvaitādvaita (Bhedabheda)===
[[Dvaitadvaita|Dvaitādvaita]] was proposed by [[Nimbarka]], a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter. Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent. Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is [[Krishna]] and his consort [[Radha]], attended by thousands of ''[[gopi]]s''; of the [[Vrindavan]]; and devotion consists in self-surrender.

===Śuddhādvaita===
[[Shuddhadvaita|Śuddhādvaita]] is the "purely non-dual" philosophy propounded by [[Vallabha Acharya]] (1479–1531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā [[sampradaya|sampradāya]] ("tradition of Vallabh") or [[Pushtimarg|''Puṣṭimārga'']], a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. [[Vallabhacharya]] enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world.<ref>Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, “Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)”, Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.</ref> That is why [[Shuddhadvaita]] is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire.<ref>“Brahmavād Saṅgraha”, Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014.</ref>

===Acintya Bheda Abheda===
{{Main|Achintya Bheda Abheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534), stated that the soul or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, [[Govinda]], and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (''[[bhakti]]''). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya.<ref>[http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html Lord Chaitanya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020607045307/http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html |date=7 June 2002 }} (krishna.com) "This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference."</ref> This philosophy of "inconceivable oneness and difference".

==Shaivism==
{{Saivism}}
Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determine.<ref>{{Citation |last = Tattwananda |first = Swami |year = 1984 |title = Vaisnava Sects, Saiva Sects, Mother Worship |place = Calcutta |publisher = Firma KLM Private Ltd. |edition = First Revised |page=45 }}.</ref> However, the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad|''{{IAST|Śvetāśvatara}} Upanishad'']] (400 – 200 BCE){{sfn|Flood|1996|p=86}} is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism.<ref>{{Citation |last = Chakravarti |first = Mahadev |year = 1994 |title = The Concept of Rudra-Śiva Through The Ages |place = Delhi |publisher = Motilal Banarsidass |edition = Second Revised |page=9 |isbn = 81-208-0053-2 }}.</ref> Shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (''abheda''), dualist (''bheda''), and non-dualist-with-dualist (''{{IAST|bhedābheda}}'') perspectives. [[Vidyaranya]] in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought—[[Pashupata Shaivism]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and Pratyabhijña ([[Kashmir Shaivism]]).<ref name="cowell">Cowell and Gough (1882), p. xii.</ref>

===Pāśupata Shaivism===
Pāśupata Shaivism (''Pāśupata'', "of Paśupati") is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools.<ref>Flood (2003), p. 206.</ref> The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by ''[[Lakulish]]'' in the 2nd century CE. ''Paśu'' in [[Pashupati|Paśupati]] refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 104-105.</ref> Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, soul possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 103</ref>

Pāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, [[Classical element|four elements]] and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 107</ref>

===Shaiva Siddhanta===
Considered normative [[Tantra|Tantric]] Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta<ref>Xavier Irudayaraj,"Saiva Siddanta," in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.10 ff.</ref><ref>Xavier Irudayaraj, "Self Understanding of Saiva Siddanta Scriptures" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.14 ff.</ref> provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism.<ref>Flood (2006), p. 120.</ref> Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace).<ref>Flood (2006), p. 122.</ref> This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the [[Nayanars]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=168}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===
Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth<ref>Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, By Lakshman Jee</ref> or ninth century CE<ref>Dyczkowski, p. 4.</ref> in [[Kashmir]] and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE.<ref>The Trika Śaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pp. 1</ref> It is categorised by various scholars as [[monistic]]<ref>Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, Swami Lakshman Jee, pp. 103</ref> [[idealism]] ([[absolute idealism]], theistic monism, realistic idealism,<ref name="vibration">Dyczkowski, p. 51.</ref> transcendental physicalism or concrete monism<ref name="vibration"/>). It is a school of [[Śaivism]] consisting of [[Trika]] and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.<ref>Flood (2005), pp. 56–68</ref>

Even though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness (''Chit'' or ''Brahman''),<ref>Singh, Jaideva. Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam. Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008. PP. 24–26.</ref> in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness.<ref>Dyczkowski, p. 44.</ref> This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').<ref>Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.119</ref> Whereas, Advaita holds that Brahman is the reality (pure consciousness) and it is inactive (''niṣkriya'') and the phenomenal world is an appearance (''māyā'').<ref>Shankarananda, (Swami). Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism. PP. 56–59</ref> The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realize one's already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace.<ref>Mishra, K.  Kashmir Saivism, The Central Philosophy of Tantrism. PP. 330–334.</ref>

'''Hindu philosophy''' encompasses the philosophies, world views and teachings<ref>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=darzana&direction=SE&script=HK&link=yes&beginning=0 Soken Sanskrit, ''darzana'']</ref> that emerged in [[History of India|ancient India]]. These include six systems (''[[darśana|shad-darśana]]'') – [[Samkhya|Sankhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]].<ref name=andrewoverview>Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231149877}}, pages 2-5</ref> 

In Indian tradition, the word used for philosophy is '''Darshana'''. This word comes from the Sanskrit root ''drish'' (to see, to experience).<ref>[https://www.esamskriti.com/e/Spirituality/Philosophy/What-does-DARSHANA-mean-1.aspx Meaning of word Darshana]</ref>

These are also called the [[Āstika and nāstika|Astika]] (theistic) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the [[Vedas]] as an authoritative, important source of knowledge.<ref name="KK26" />{{refn|group=note|M Chadha (2015), in The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, states that Vedas were knowledge source but interpreted differently by different schools of Hindu philosophy: "The sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are variously interpreted by the six traditional Hindu philosophical schools. Even within a single school, philosophers disagree on the import of Vedic statements. (...) Hindu intellectual traditions must be understood as standing for the collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection. There is no single, comprehensive philosophical doctrine shared by all intellectual traditions in Hinduism that distinguishes their view from other Indian religions such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Jainism]] on issues of epistemology, metaphysics, logic, ethics or cosmology. The Vedas are regarded as Apauruseya, but by the same token, they are not the Word of God either.<ref>M Chadha (2015), The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion (Editor: Graham Oppy), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}, pages 127-128</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Elisa Freschi (2012): The Vedas are not [[Deontological ethics|deontic]] authorities in absolute sense and may be disobeyed, but are recognized as an [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority by an orthodox school of Hindu philosophy;<ref>Elisa Freschi (2012), Duty, Language and Exegesis in Prabhakara Mimamsa, BRILL, {{ISBN|978-9004222601}}, page 62</ref> (Note: This differentiation between epistemic and deontic authority is true for all Indian religions)}} Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called ''nāstika'' (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies.<ref name=andrewoverview/><ref name="KK26" /> Nāstika Indian philosophies include [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], [[Ājīvika]], and others.<ref name=bilimoriaastika>P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1135703226}}, page 88</ref>

Western scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies, starting with the writings of [[Indology|Indologists]] and [[Orientalism|Orientalists]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies.<ref name=andrewoverview/> The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology.<ref name=frazierintrop2>{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies | date=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|pages=1–15}}</ref><ref>Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|978-0813540689}}, pages 101-119</ref> While Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox traditions such as Cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy.<ref>R Thomas (2014), Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design.

Hindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies, such as the realism of the Nyāya, the naturalism of the Vaiśeṣika, the dualism of the Sāṅkhya, the [[non-dualism]] and knowledge of Self as essential to liberation of Advaita, the self-discipline of yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.<ref name=klaussaiva>Klaus K.

Each school of Hindu philosophy has extensive [[Epistemology|epistemological]] literature called ''[[Pramana|pramāṇaśāstras]]'',{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=172}}{{sfn|Guttorm Fløistad|1993|p=137-154}} as well as theories on [[metaphysics]], [[axiology]], and other topics.<ref name=karlpotterov>Karl H.

==Classifications==
{{further|Āstika and nāstika}}
In the [[history of Hinduism]], the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the [[Common Era]], and some schools emerged possibly even before the [[Buddha]] <ref>Students' Britannica India (2000), Volume 4, Encyclopædia Britannica, {{ISBN|978-0852297605}}, page 316</ref> Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Hindu philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=98-102}}

Since ancient times Indian philosophy has been categorized into ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' schools of thought.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010}} The orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy have been called '''ṣaḍdarśana''' ("six systems"). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by [[Vedanta|Vedantins]].<ref name=uh14>{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Andrew J. |title=Unifying Hinduism: philosophy and identity in Indian intellectual history |date=2014 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSg0RGmMaTwC |isbn=9780231149877}}</ref>{{rp|2–3}} It was then adopted by the early Western [[indology|Indologists]], and pervades modern understandings of Hindu philosophy.<ref name=uh14/>{{rp|4–5}}

===Āstika===
There are six āstika (orthodox) schools of thought.{{refn|group=note|For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453–487.}} Each is called a [[darśana]], and each darśana accepts the [[Vedas]] as authority. Each astika darsana also accepts the premise that ''[[atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (soul, eternal self) exists.<ref name="KK26">[[Klaus Klostermaier]] (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, {{ISBN|978-1851685387}}, Chapter 2, page 26</ref><ref>John Plott, James Dolin and Russell Hatton (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62</ref> The {{IAST|āstika}} schools of philosophy are:
# [[Samkhya]] - An atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of [[Purusha|consciousness]] and [[Prakṛti|matter]].
# [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] - A school which emerged from Sankhya and emphasises on practical use of Sankhya theory. This schools focuses on [[Dhyana in Hinduism|meditation]], [[Samadhi|contemplation]] and [[Kaivalya|liberation]].
# [[Nyaya|Nyāya]] or [[Indian logic|logic]] - The school of epistemology which explores [[pramana|sources of knowledge]]. 
# [[Vaiśeṣika]] - An [[empiricism|empiricist]] school of [[atomism]].
# [[Mīmāṃsā]] - An anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of [[orthopraxy]]. This school deals with the correct interpretation of the verses in [[Vedas]].
# [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] - The last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or ''jñānakāṇḍa'' (section of knowledge). Vedanta is also referred as Uttara-Mimamsa. Vedānta came to be the dominant current of [[Hinduism]] in the post-medieval period.

==Overview==
===Epistemology===
{{main|Pramana}}
[[Epistemology]] is called [[pramana|pramāṇa]].{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. Pramāṇa is a hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledge.{{sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|p=520-521}} The focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.{{sfn|Potter|1991|p=172}}

Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: 
# ''Pratyakṣa'' - Direct perception 
# ''Anumāṇa'' - Inference or indirect perception
# ''Upamāṇa'' - Comparison and analogy 
# ''Arthāpatti'' - Postulation, derivation from circumstances 
# ''Anupalabdi'' - Non-perception, absence of proof 
# ''Shabda'' - Word, testimony of past or present reliable experts{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} 

Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge.{{sfn|Guttorm Fløistad|1993|p=137-154}} For example, the [[Charvaka|Cārvāka]] nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge,{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} the [[Samkhya]] school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony),{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}

==Sāmkhya==
{{Main|Samkhya}}

Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in [[Hinduism]],{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=232}} with origins in the 1st millennium BCE.<ref>Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.149</ref> It is a [[rationalism|rationalist]] school of [[Indian philosophy]],<ref name="Mike Burley 2012 pages 43-46"/> and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies.<ref name=royper>Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-0754633013}}, pages 149-158</ref> Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose [[epistemology]] accepted three of six ''[[Pramana|pramāṇas]]'' as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These were ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''sabda'' (''Āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).<ref>Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, pages 245-248</ref>{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

Samkhya school espouses [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualism]] between consciousness and matter.<ref>{{citation |last = Michaels |first = Axel |title = Hinduism: Past and Present |year = 2004 |publisher = Princeton University Press |page=264 |isbn = 0-691-08953-1 }}</ref> It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: ''[[Purusha|Puruṣa]]'' (consciousness) and ''[[prakriti]]'' (matter). ''[[Jiva]]'' (a living being) is that state in which ''puruṣa'' is bonded to ''prakriti'' in some form.<ref name=sambri/> This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of ''buddhi'' (awareness, intellect) and ''ahankara'' (individualized ego consciousness, “I-maker”). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.<ref name=sambri>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520526/Samkhya Samkhya - Hinduism] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)</ref>

Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of [[Guṇa|gunas]] (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche).<ref>Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical Sāṃkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120805033}}, pages 154-206</ref> Guna, it states, are of three types: ''Sattva'' being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; ''Rajas'' guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and ''Tamas'' being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three ''gunas'', but in different proportions.<ref>James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|9780823931798}}, page 265</ref> The interplay of these ''gunas'' defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.<ref>T Bernard (1999), ''Hindu Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1373-1}}, pages 74–76</ref><ref name="Haney">Haney, William S., Culture and Consciousness: Literature Regained, Bucknell University Press (1 August 2002).

The ''[[Samkhyakarika|Samkhya karika]]'', one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be "three<ref>''adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika'' - that is, suffering caused internally by self, cause by other human beings, caused by acts of nature</ref> kinds of human suffering" and means to prevent them.<ref name=colebrookesktrans>[http://www.kouroo.info/kouroo/transclusions/18/37/1837_SankhyaKarikaHTColebrook.pdf Samkhya karika] by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press</ref> The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states,

{{Quote|
<poem>
From the triad of suffering, arises this inquiry into the means of preventing it.<br />That is useless - if you say so, I say: No, because suffering is not absolute and final. – Verse 1<br />
The [[Guṇa]]s (qualities) respectively consist in pleasure, pain and dullness, are adapted to manifestation, activity and restraint; mutually domineer, rest on each other, produce each other, consort together, and are reciprocally present. – Verse 12
Goodness is considered to be alleviating and enlightening; foulness, urgent and persisting; darkness, heavy and enveloping. Like a lamp, they cooperate for a purpose by union of contraries. – Verse 13<br />
There is a general cause, which is diffuse. It operates by means of the three qualities, by mixture, by modification; for different objects are diversified by influence of the several qualities respectively. – Verse 16
Since the assemblage of perceivable objects is for use (by man); Since the converse of that which has the three qualities with other properties must exist (in man); Since there must be superintendence (within man); Since there must be some entity that enjoys (within man); Since there is a tendency to abstraction (in man), therefore soul is. – Verse 17

==Yoga==
{{main|Yoga (philosophy)}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools.<ref>For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: {{harvnb|Chatterjee|Datta|1984|p=43}}.</ref>  The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] philosophical system aligns closely with the [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualist]] premises of the [[Samkhya]] school.<ref name=edbryant>Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/yoga/ ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali''] IEP</ref>{{sfn|Chatterjee|Datta|1984|p=43}} The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god ([[Ishvara]]), unlike Samkhya.<ref>{{cite book |last=Radhakrishnan |first=S. |author-link=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |author2=Moore, CA |title=A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy |year=1967 |publisher=Princeton |isbn=0-691-01958-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/sourcebookinindi00radh/page/453 453] |url=https://archive.org/details/sourcebookinindi00radh/page/453 }}</ref><ref>Müller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Zimmer |first=Heinrich |author-link=Heinrich Zimmer |title=Philosophies of India |year=1951 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New York City |isbn=0-691-01758-1 }} Bollingen Series XXVI; Edited by [[Joseph Campbell]], page 280</ref> The [[epistemology]] of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge:{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}} ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference) and ''śabda'' (''āptavacana'', word/testimony of reliable sources).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: [[purusha|puruṣa]] (consciousness) and [[prakṛti]] (matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as "seer, experiencer" and "seen, experienced" than the Samkhya school.<ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages x-xi, 101-107, 142 and Introduction chapter</ref>

A key text of the Yoga school is the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]''. [[Patanjali]] may have been, as [[Max Müller]] explains, "the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras."<ref>Max Müeller, [https://archive.org/stream/sixsystemsofindi00mulliala#page/410/mode/2up The six systems of Indian philosophy], Longmans, page 410</ref> Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as [[rāja yoga]], [[Jnana yoga|jñāna yoga]],<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'' by Georg Feuerstein</ref> [[karma yoga]], [[bhakti yoga]], [[tantra]] yoga, [[mantra]] yoga, [[Kundalini yoga|laya yoga]], and [[hatha yoga]].<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and [[Tantra]]'', [[Georg Feuerstein]]</ref>

The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that [[jñāna]] (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha.<ref name=edbryant/> Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of [[monism|monistic]] personalism.<ref name=shphillips>{{cite book | first=Stephen H. | last=Phillips | title=Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "New Logic" | url=https://archive.org/details/classicalindianm00phil | url-access=registration | publisher=Open Court Publishing | year=1995 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicalindianm00phil/page/12 12–13]}}</ref><ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personalism/ Personalism] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2013)</ref><ref>Northrop Frye (2006), Educated Imagination and Other Writings on Critical Theory, 1933-1962, University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0802092090}}, page 291</ref> Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman.<ref>Mike McNamee and William J. Morgan (2015), Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415829809}}, pages 135-136, Quote: "As a dualistic philosophy largely congruent with Samkhya's metaphysics, Yoga seeks liberation through the realization that Atman equals Brahman; it involves a cosmogonic dualism: purusha an absolute consciousness, and prakriti original and primeval matter."</ref><ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415648875}}, pages 141-142</ref>

==Vaiśeṣika==
{{main|Vaisheshika}}
The Vaiśeṣika philosophy is a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] school.<ref name="Dale Riepe 1996 pages 227-246"/> It is a form of [[atomism]] in natural philosophy.<ref name=jganeri>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/early-modern-india/#VaiAto Analytical philosophy in early modern India] J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to ''paramāṇu'' ([[atom]]s), and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.<ref name=olilv/> Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vaiśeṣika school.<ref name=olilv/> The Vaiśeṣika darśana is credited to [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kaṇāda Kaśyapa]] from the second half of the first millennium BCE.<ref name=olilv>Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.''

{{Quote|Dharma is that from which results the accomplishment of Exaltation and of the Supreme Good. The authoritativeness of the Veda arises from its being an exposition of ''dharma''. The Supreme Good results from knowledge, produced from a particular ''dharma'', of the essence of the Predicables, Substance, Attribute, Action, Genus, Species and Combination, by means of their resemblances and differences.

Phillips (1998), Classical Indian Metaphysics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814899}}, pages 38-54</ref>}}

The Vaiśeṣika school is related to the Nyāya school but features differences in its [[epistemology]], metaphysics and ontology.<ref>DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, pages 172-175</ref> The epistemology of the Vaiśeṣika school, like [[Buddhism]], accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable – perception and inference.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=225}} The Vaiśeṣika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vaiśeṣikas were the Vedas.{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}<ref name="bilimoriaved"/>

Vaiśeṣika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire). Each of these four are of two types:<ref name=jganeri/> atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible.<ref name=jganeri/> The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their [[guṇa]] (quality), ''karma'' (activity), ''sāmānya'' (commonness), ''viśeṣa'' (particularity) and ''amavāya'' (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).<ref name=olilv/><ref>M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, pages 228-237</ref>

==Nyāya==
{{main|Nyāya}}

The Nyāya school is a [[philosophical realism|realist]] āstika philosophy.<ref name=nyabri>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/423058/Nyaya Nyaya: Indian Philosophy] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)</ref>{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=221-227}} The school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of [[logic]], methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.<ref>B Gupta (2012), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge and Freedom, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415800037}}, pages 171-189</ref><ref>PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, page 223</ref> The foundational text of the Nyāya school is the ''[[Nyāya Sūtras]]'' of the first millennium BCE. The text is credited to Aksapada Gautama and its composition is variously dated between the sixth and second centuries BCE.<ref>[[Bimal Krishna Matilal|B. K. Matilal]] "Perception. An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge" (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. xiv.</ref><ref name="Michael Brannigan 2009 page 7"/>

Nyāya epistemology accepts four out of six ''prāmaṇas'' as reliable means of gaining knowledge – ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}<ref name=dpsb>DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, page 172</ref>{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}}

In its [[metaphysics]], the Nyāya school is closer to the Vaiśeṣika school than the others.<ref name=nyabri/> It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance).<ref>Vassilis Vitsaxis (2009), Thought and Faith, Somerset Hall Press, {{ISBN|978-1935244042}}, page 131</ref> Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality.<ref>BK Matilal (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807174}}, pages 353-357</ref> The Nyāya Sūtras begin:
{{Quote|<poem>Perception, Inference, Comparison and Word – these are the means of right knowledge.
Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable and non-erratic.
Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds: a priori, a posteriori, and commonly seen.
Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.
Word is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.
It [knowledge] is of two kinds: that which is seen, and that which is not seen.

==Mīmāṃsā==
{{main|Mīmāṃsā}}
The [[Mīmāṃsā]] school emphasized [[hermeneutics]] and [[exegesis]].<ref name=olilm/><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383181/Mimamsa Mimamsa] Encyclopædia Britannica (2014)</ref> It is a form of [[philosophical realism]].<ref>M.

Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120810860}}, page 298-335</ref> The classical Mīmāṃsā school is sometimes referred to as ''pūrvamīmāṃsā'' or ''Karmamīmāṃsā'' in reference to the first part of the Vedas.<ref name=olilpm>Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'' (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445</ref>

The Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The [[Prabhākara|Prābhākara]] subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).<ref name="dpsb"/>{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} The [[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa]] sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}

The metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both [[atheism|atheistic]] and [[theism|theistic]] doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of ''dharma''.<ref name=olilpm/><ref>{{cite book|last=Neville|first=Robert|title=Religious truth|year=2001|publisher=SUNY Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Worthington|first=Vivian|title=A history of yoga|year=1982|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5aI9AAAAIAAJ|page=66}}</ref> To them, [[dharma]] meant rituals and duties, not [[deva (Hinduism)|devas]] (gods), because devas existed only in name.<ref name=olilpm/> The Mīmāṃsākas held that the [[Vedas]] are "eternal authorless infallible", that Vedic ''vidhi'' (injunctions) and [[mantra]]s in rituals are prescriptive ''karya'' (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the [[Upanishads]] and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the [[Vedanta]] school disagreed with.<ref name=olilm/><ref name=olilpm/>

Mīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]].<ref>Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996), Chapter 3</ref> While their deep analysis of language and [[linguistics]] influenced other schools,<ref>Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), {{ISBN|978-3110181593}}, pages 23-24, 551-663</ref> their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly ''prescribe'' the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also ''describe'', ''develop'' and ''derive''.<ref name=olilpm/> Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of [[dharma]] and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasized ''karmakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the [[śruti]] which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized ''jñānakāṇḍa'' (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).<ref name=olilm>Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in ''Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503</ref>

==Vedānta==
The [[Vedanta|Vedānta]] school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and [[Brahma Sutras]] from the first millennium BCE<ref name="Michael Brannigan 2009 page 7"/><ref>Oliver Leaman (1999), Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173636}}, page xiv</ref> and is the most developed and best-known of the Hindu schools. The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge:<ref name=bilimoriaved>P Bilimoria (1993), Pramāṇa epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, {{ISBN|978-94-010-5107-1}}, pages 137-154</ref> ''pratyakṣa'' (perception), ''anumāṇa'' (inference), ''upamāṇa'' (comparison and analogy), ''arthāpatti'' (postulation, derivation from circumstances), ''anupalabdi'' (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and ''śabda'' (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).{{sfn|Perrett|2000|pp=245-248}}{{sfn|Grimes|1989|p=238}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=225}} All of these have been further categorized by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.<ref name=bilimoriaved/>

The emergence of Vedanta school represented a period when a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge. These focussed on ''jnana'' (knowledge) driven aspects of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and the Upanishads. This included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and [[Brahman]], and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.<ref>Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, page 77;<br />JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), Oxford University Press, page 107-108</ref><ref>Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173582}}, page 251;<br />R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347</ref>

===Viśiṣṭādvaita===
{{Main|Vishishtadvaita}}
[[Ramanuja]] (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism. Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Viśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman.<ref>{{cite book|author=Christopher Etter|title=A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jW2pcWpXY8wC&pg=PA62|date=30 April 2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-39312-1|pages=62–63}}</ref> Ramanuja saw [[Vishnu]] as a personification of Brahman.

===Dvaitādvaita (Bhedabheda)===
[[Dvaitadvaita|Dvaitādvaita]] was proposed by [[Nimbarka]], a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter. Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent. Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is [[Krishna]] and his consort [[Radha]], attended by thousands of ''[[gopi]]s''; of the [[Vrindavan]]; and devotion consists in self-surrender.

===Śuddhādvaita===
[[Shuddhadvaita|Śuddhādvaita]] is the "purely non-dual" philosophy propounded by [[Vallabha Acharya]] (1479–1531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā [[sampradaya|sampradāya]] ("tradition of Vallabh") or [[Pushtimarg|''Puṣṭimārga'']], a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. [[Vallabhacharya]] enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world.<ref>Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, “Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)”, Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.</ref> That is why [[Shuddhadvaita]] is known as ‘Unmodified transformation’ or ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a ‘part’ (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire.<ref>“Brahmavād Saṅgraha”, Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014.</ref>

===Acintya Bheda Abheda===
{{Main|Achintya Bheda Abheda}}
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (1486–1534), stated that the soul or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, [[Govinda]], and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (''[[bhakti]]''). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya.<ref>[http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html Lord Chaitanya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020607045307/http://www.krishna.com/printarticles/Lord_Chaitanya.html |date=7 June 2002 }} (krishna.com) "This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference."</ref> This philosophy of "inconceivable oneness and difference".

[[Vidyaranya]] in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought—[[Pashupata Shaivism]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] and Pratyabhijña ([[Kashmir Shaivism]]).<ref name="cowell">Cowell and Gough (1882), p. xii.</ref>

===Pāśupata Shaivism===
Pāśupata Shaivism (''Pāśupata'', "of Paśupati") is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools.<ref>Flood (2003), p. 206.</ref> The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by ''[[Lakulish]]'' in the 2nd century CE. ''Paśu'' in [[Pashupati|Paśupati]] refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 104-105.</ref> Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, soul possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 103</ref>

Pāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, [[Classical element|four elements]] and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect.<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 107</ref>

===Shaiva Siddhanta===
Considered normative [[Tantra|Tantric]] Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta<ref>Xavier Irudayaraj,"Saiva Siddanta," in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.10 ff.</ref><ref>Xavier Irudayaraj, "Self Understanding of Saiva Siddanta Scriptures" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.14 ff.</ref> provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism.<ref>Flood (2006), p. 120.</ref> Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace).<ref>Flood (2006), p. 122.</ref> This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the [[Nayanars]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=168}}

===Kashmir Shaivism===
Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth<ref>Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, By Lakshman Jee</ref> or ninth century CE<ref>Dyczkowski, p. 4.</ref> in [[Kashmir]] and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE.<ref>The Trika Śaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pp. 1</ref> It is categorised by various scholars as [[monistic]]<ref>Kashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, Swami Lakshman Jee, pp. 103</ref> [[idealism]] ([[absolute idealism]], theistic monism, realistic idealism,<ref name="vibration">Dyczkowski, p. 51.</ref> transcendental physicalism or concrete monism<ref name="vibration"/>). It is a school of [[Śaivism]] consisting of [[Trika]] and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.<ref>Flood (2005), pp. 56–68</ref>

Even though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness (''Chit'' or ''Brahman''),<ref>Singh, Jaideva. Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam. Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008. PP. 24–26.</ref> in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness.<ref>Dyczkowski, p. 44.</ref> This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').<ref>Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.119</ref> Whereas, Advaita holds that Brahman is the reality (pure consciousness) and it is inactive (''niṣkriya'') and the phenomenal world is an appearance (''māyā'').<ref>Shankarananda, (Swami). Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism. PP. 56–59</ref> The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realize one's already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace.<ref>Mishra, K.  Kashmir Saivism, The Central Philosophy of Tantrism. PP. 330–334.</ref>
