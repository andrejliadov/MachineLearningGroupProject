'''Antireductionism''' is the position in [[science]] and [[metaphysics]] that stands in contrast to [[reductionism]] (anti-holism) by advocating that not all properties of a system can be explained in terms of its constituent parts and their interactions.

== General concepts ==
The opposite of reductionism is [[holism]], a word coined by Jan Smuts in [[Holism and Evolution]], that understanding a system can be done only as a whole. One form of antireductionism (epistemological) holds that we simply are not capable of understanding systems at the level of their most basic constituents, and so the program of reductionism must fail. The other kind of antireductionism (ontological) holds that such a complete explanation in terms of basic constituents is not possible even in principle for some systems.<ref name="Nagel" /> [[Robert B. Laughlin|Robert Laughlin]], e.g. supports this view.<ref name="Laughlin" /> Disciplines such as cybernetics and systems theory embrace a non-reductionist view of science, sometimes going as far as explaining phenomena at a given level of hierarchy in terms of phenomena at a higher level, in a sense, the opposite of a reductionist approach.

Although breaking complex phenomena into parts is a key method in science, there are those complex phenomena (e.g. in physics, psychology, sociology, ecology) where the approach does not work. Antireductionism also arises in academic fields such as history, economics, anthropology, medicine, and biology as dissatisfaction with attempts to explain complex phenomena using simplistic, ill-fitting models,  which do not provide much insight.

== Specific views ==
An example of antireductionism in psychology is [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]'s proposed [[ontology]] of what he calls 'events' and its use "to provide an antireductionist answer to the mind/matter debate ...[and to show that]...the impossibility of intertranslating the two idioms by means of [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] laws blocks any analytically reductive relation between...the mental and the physical".<ref name="Davidson" />

[[Karl Popper]] was a famous proponent of antireductionism. In his essay ''Of clouds and clocks'', Popper classified phenomena into two types: "clock" phenomena with a mechanical basis and "cloud" phenomena which are indivisible and depend upon [[emergence]] for explanation.<ref name=Popper/>

For example, Popper thought that a materialist explanation of consciousness is not possible.<ref name=Rae/> The view of [[Reductionism|reductionists]] about consciousness is explained by [[Max Velmans]]:<ref name=Velmans/>
:"Most reductionists accept that consciousness ''seems'' to be different from brain states (or functions) but claim that science will ''discover'' it to be nothing more than a state or function of the brain. In short, they mostly accept that brains states and conscious states are ''conceivably'' different, but deny that they are ''actually'' different (in the universe we happen to inhabit)."
::—Max Velmans; ''Understanding consciousness'', Note 26, page 262

Velmans himself is not in agreement with this reductionist stance. Opposition to this ''mind = brain'' reductionism is found in many authors.<ref name=Thompson/><ref name=Nagel2/><ref name=Northoff/> An often mentioned issue is that science cannot explain the [[hard problem of consciousness]], the subjective feelings called [[qualia]]. Another objection, whose explicit formulation is due to the physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]],  is that science is not a self-contained entity, because the theories it uses are creations of the human mind, not inevitable results of experiment and observation, and the criteria for adoption of a particular theory are not definitive in selecting between alternatives, but require subjective input.<ref name=Kuhn/><ref name=Bird/><ref name=Bird2/> Even the claim that science is based upon testability of its theories has been met with qualifications.<ref name=Thornton/><ref name=Lakatos/>

According to [[Alexander Rosenberg]] and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], the conflict between [[physicalism]] and antireductionism can be resolved, that "both reductionists and antireductionists accept that given our [[cognitive]] interests and limitations, non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones".<ref name=Rosenberg/> However, others find that the conflict between reductionism and antireductionism is "one of the central problems in the philosophy of psychology...an updated version of the old [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]]: how levels of theories in the behavioral and brain sciences relate to one another. Many contemporary philosophers of mind believe that cognitive-psychological theories are not reducible to neurological theories...most nonreductive [[physicalist]]s prefer the idea of a one-way dependence of the mental on the physical."<ref name=Bickle/>

{{cite encyclopedia |quote=Despite the possibility of divergence, there is nonetheless widespread agreement on the desirable features of a new puzzle-solution or theory. Kuhn (1977, 321–2) identifies five characteristics that provide the shared basis for a choice of theory: 1. accuracy; 2. consistency (both internal and with other relevant currently accepted theories); 3. scope (its consequences should extend beyond the data it is required to explain); 4. simplicity (organizing otherwise confused and isolated phenomena); 5. fruitfulness (for further research). |author=Bird, Alexander |title=Thomas Kuhn |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition) |editor=Edward N.
