Following the developments in [[formal logic]] with [[symbolic logic]] in the late nineteenth century and [[mathematical logic]] in the twentieth, topics traditionally treated by [[logic]] not being part of formal logic have tended to be termed either ''philosophy of logic'' or ''philosophical logic'' if no longer simply ''logic''.

Compared to the history of logic, the demarcation between '''philosophy of logic''' and [[philosophical logic]] is of recent coinage and not always entirely clear. Characterisations include:

* '''Philosophy of logic''' is the area of philosophy devoted to examining the scope and nature of logic.<ref name="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|editor=Audi, Robert|publisher=CUP|year=1999|edition=2nd}}</ref>
* '''Philosophy of logic''' is the investigation, critical analysis and intellectual reflection on issues arising in [[logic]]. The field is considered to be distinct from [[philosophical logic]].
* '''Philosophical logic''' is the branch of study that concerns questions about [[reference]], [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]], [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], [[theories of truth|truth]], [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], [[existence]], [[logical entailment|entailment]], [[modal logic|modality]], and [[logical necessity|necessity]].<ref>Lowe, E. J.. ''Forms of Thought: A Study in Philosophical Logic''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2013.</ref>
* '''Philosophical logic''' is the application of formal logical techniques to philosophical problems.<ref>Russell, Gillian [http://tar.weatherson.org/2007/02/27/jcs-oped/ Thoughts, Arguments, and Rants], ''Jc's Column''.</ref>

This article outlines issues in philosophy of logic or provides links to relevant articles or both.

==Introduction==
This article makes use of the following terms and concepts:
* [[Type–token distinction]]
* [[Use–mention distinction]]

==Truth==
Aristotle said ''To say that that which is, is not or that which is not is, is a falsehood; and to say that which is, is and that which is not is not, is true''<ref>Aristotle, Metaphysics,Books Γ, Δ, Ε 2nd edition 1011b25 (1993) trans Kirwan,: OUP</ref>

This apparent truism has not proved unproblematic.

===Truthbearers===
Logic uses such terms as true, false, inconsistent, valid, and self-contradictory. Questions arise as Strawson (1952) writes<ref>{{cite book|last=Strawson |first=P.F.|title=Introduction to Logical Theory |publisher=Methuen: London|year=1952|pages=3}}</ref>
:<blockquote>(a) when we use these words of logical appraisal, what is it exactly that we are appraising? and (b) how does logical appraisal become possible?</blockquote>

===Tarski's definition of truth===
See:
* [[Semantic theory of truth#Tarski's Theory|Semantic theory of truth § Tarski's Theory]]
* [[T-schema]]
* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Tarski's Truth Definitions]
* [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/#Matt-sema Self-reference:2.1 Consequences of the Semantic Paradoxes in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]

===Analytic truths, logical truth, validity, logical consequence and entailment===
Since the use, meaning, if not the meaningfulness, of the terms is part of the debate, it is possible only to give the following working definitions for the purposes of the discussion:
* A [[necessary truth]] is one that is true no matter what the state of the world or, as it is sometimes put, in all possible worlds.<ref>Wolfram (1989) p. 80</ref>
* [[Logical truth]]s are those necessary truths that are necessarily true owing to the meaning of their logical constants only.<ref>Wolfram (1989), p. 273</ref>
* In formal logic a ''logical truth'' is just a "statement" (string of symbols in which no variable occurs free) which is true under all possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretations]].
* An analytic truth is one whose predicate concept is contained in its subject concept.

The concept of logical truth is intimately linked with those of [[validity (logic)|validity]], [[logical consequence]] and [[entailment]] (as well as self-contradiction, necessarily false etc.).
* If ''q'' is a logical truth, then ''p therefore q'' will be a valid argument.
* If ''p1, p2, p3 ... pn therefore q'' is a valid argument then its [[corresponding conditional (logic)|corresponding conditional]] will be a logical truth.
* If ''p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn entails q'' then ''If (p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn) then q'' is a logical truth.
* If ''q'' is a logical consequence of ''p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn'' if and only if ''p1 & p2 & p3 ... pn entails q'' and if and only if ''If (p1 & p2 & p3..pn) then q'' is a logical truth

Issues that arise include:
* If there are truths that must be true, what makes them so?
* Are there analytic truths that are not logical truths?
* Are there necessary truths that are not analytic truths?
* Are there necessary truths that are not logical truths?
* Is the distinction between analytic truth and synthetic truth spurious?
