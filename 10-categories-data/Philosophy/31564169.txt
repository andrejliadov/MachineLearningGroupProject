The '''philosophy of happiness''' is the [[philosophical]] concern with the [[existence]], [[nature]], and attainment of [[happiness]]. Some philosophers believe happiness can be understood as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance; indeed, in most European languages the term happiness is synonymous with luck.<ref>Cassin et al. ''Dictionary of Untranslatables''. Princeton University Press, 2014. Print.</ref> Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it.<ref>{{cite book |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#MeaHap |title = Happiness |website = stanford.edu |publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year = 2011 }}</ref> Given the pragmatic concern for the attainment of happiness, research in psychology has guided many modern day philosophers in developing their theories.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturt |first1=Henry |title=Happiness |journal=International Journal of Ethics |date=1903 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=207–221 |doi=10.1086/intejethi.13.2.2376452 |jstor=2376452 |s2cid=222446622 }}</ref>

=== Democritus ===
[[Democritus]] (c. 460 – c. 370 BC) is known as the 'laughing philosopher' because of his emphasis on the value of 'cheerfulness'.<ref>{{cite book |url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/democritus/ |title = Democritus |website = stanford.edu |publisher = Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year = 2016 }}</ref>

=== Plato ===
{{rquote|right|''We have proved that justice in itself is the best thing for the soul itself, and that the soul ought to do justice...''|[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''<ref name="Pl-10.612b">Plato, ''The Republic'' 10.612b</ref>}}

[[Plato]] (c. 428{{snd}} c. 347 BCE), using [[Socrates]] (c. 470{{snd}} 399 BCE) as the main character in his [[Plato#The dialogues|philosophical dialogues]], outlined the requirements for happiness in ''The Republic''.

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the [[cardinal virtues]], particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the [[Ring of Gyges]], Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.<ref name="Pl-10.612b" /><ref>[https://www.academia.edu/12487162/Plato_Happiness_and_Justice Joshua Olsen, ''Plato, Happiness and Justice'']</ref>

He also sees a type of happiness stemming from [[social justice]] through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness{{snd}} such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure{{snd}} are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mohr |first1=Richard D. |title=A Platonic Happiness |journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly |date=1987 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=131–145 |jstor=27743804 }}</ref>

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] (384 – 322 BCE) was considered an ancient Greek scholar in the disciplines of ethics, metaphysics, biology and botany, amongst others.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last1=Dimmock |first1=Mark |last2=Fisher |first2=Andrew |chapter=Aristotelian Virtue Ethics |title=Ethics for A-Level |date=2017 |pages=49–63 |jstor=j.ctt1wc7r6j.7 |isbn=978-1-78374-388-9 }}</ref> Aristotle described ''[[eudaimonia]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]]) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean [[happiness]], but some scholars contend that "human flourishing" may be a more accurate translation.<ref>Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}</ref> More specifically, eudaimonia (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]) refers to an inherently positive and divine state of being in which humanity can actively strive for and achieve. Given that this state is the most positive state for a human to be in, it is often simplified to mean happiness. However, Aristotle's use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.<ref>'''Aristotle'''., Bartlett, R. C., & Collins, S. D. (2011). Aristotle's Nicomachean ethics. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

Within the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible.<ref>Book I Chapter 1 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1094a 1094a].</ref> Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation.

Aristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. For Aristotle, achieving virtue involves asking the question "how should I ''be''" rather than "what should I ''do''". A fully virtuous person is described as achieving eudaimonia, and therefore would be undeniably happy. The acquisition of virtue is the main consideration for Aristotelian [[Virtue ethics|Virtue Ethics]].<ref name=":0" /> Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this [[moral skepticism]].<ref>Kraut, Richard, "Aristotle's Ethics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N.

[[File:Greek philosopher busts.jpg|thumb|The carved busts of [[Socrates]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Epicurus]].]]

[[Antisthenes]] (c. 445 – c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], advocated an [[asceticism|ascetic life]] lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. [[Xenophon]] testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang "from out of one's soul,"<ref>Xenophon, Symposium, iv. 41.</ref> and [[Diogenes Laërtius]] relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: "I would rather go mad than feel pleasure."<ref>[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', vi. 3</ref> He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a [[Socrates]].

He, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], and [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].<ref name="cynic1">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] – ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Thus, happiness can be gained through [[asceticism|rigorous training]] (askesis, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἄσκησις|ἄσκησις]]) and by living in a way which was natural for [[humans]], rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions.

[[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 – c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The [[stoicism|Stoics]] themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of [[sophos (philosophy)|sage]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/497576 |title=The Stoic Sage |website=ancientworlds.net }}</ref>

The [[Cyrenaics]] were a school of philosophy established by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]] (c. 435 – c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.<ref>{{cite book |last=Annas |first=Julia |author-link=Julia Annas |year=1995 |title=The Morality of Happiness |url=https://archive.org/details/moralityhappines00anna |url-access=limited |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-509652-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/moralityhappines00anna/page/n240 230]}}</ref> [[Claudius Aelianus]], in his ''Historical Miscellany'',<ref>Aelian, Historical Miscellany 14.6</ref> writes about Aristippus:

Some immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain.

===Pyrrhonism===
{{Main|Pyrrhonism}}

[[Pyrrhonism]] was founded by [[Pyrrho]] (c. 360 – c. 270 BCE), and was the first Western school of [[philosophical skepticism]]. The goal of Pyrrhonist practice is to attain the state of [[ataraxia]] (''ataraxia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἀταραξία|ἀταραξία]]) – freedom from perturbation. Pyrrho identified that what prevented people from attaining ataraxia was their beliefs in non-evident matters, i.e., holding [[dogma]]s. To free people from [[belief]] the ancient Pyrrhonists developed a variety of [[skepticism|skeptical]] arguments.

===Epicureanism===
{{Main|Epicureanism}}

{{rquote|right|''Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship.''|Epicurus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus – Principal Doctrines|author=Vincent Cook|website=epicurus.net|access-date=3 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407084128/http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|archive-date=7 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

[[Epicureanism]] was founded by [[Epicurus]] (c. 341 – c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of [[ataraxia|tranquility]] (''ataraxia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἀταραξία|ἀταραξία]]) and freedom from fear, as well as [[aponia|absence of bodily pain]] (''aponia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary: ἀπονία|ἀπονία]]). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an [[asceticism|ascetic lifestyle]], noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics.

One aid to achieving happiness is the ''[[tetrapharmakos]]'' or the four-fold cure:

===Stoicism===
{{Main|Stoicism}}

{{rquote|right|''If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happy. And there is no man able to prevent this.''|[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''<ref>[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''. iii.12</ref>}}

[[Stoicism]] was a school of philosophy established by [[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was [[syncretism|syncretic]] in thought, his primary influence were the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], with [[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365 – c. 285 BCE) as his mentor. Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics that provides a system of logic and views about the natural world.<ref>Sharpe, Matthew. "Stoic Virtue Ethics." Handbook of Virtue Ethics, 2013, 28–41.</ref> Modern use of the term "stoic" typically refers not to followers of Stoicism, but to individuals who feel indifferent to experiences of the world, or represses feelings in general.<ref>"Modern Stoicism | Build The Fire". Build The Fire. 9 February 2016. Retrieved 22 June 2016.</ref> Given Stoicism's emphasis on feeling [[adiaphora|indifferent]] to negativity, it is seen as a path to achieving happiness.<ref>Harper, Douglas (November 2001). "Online Etymology Dictionary – Stoic". Retrieved 2 September 2006.</ref>

Stoics believe that "[[arete|virtue]] is sufficient for [[happiness]]".<ref name="Stoicism">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. In the words of [[Epictetus]], this sage would be "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy."<ref name="Russell">Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''</ref>

The Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying [[Stoic logic]], [[Stoic physics]], and [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|Stoic ethics]]. Stoics describe themselves as "living in agreement with [[nature]]." Certain schools of Stoicism refer to Aristotle's concept of [[eudaimonia]] as the goal of practicing Stoic philosophy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Inwood |first1=Brad |title=Goal and Target in Stoicism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |date=1986 |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=547–556 |doi=10.2307/2026429 |jstor=2026429 }}</ref>

Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain.<ref name="utm.edu2">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/|title=Bentham, Jeremy – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}</ref> Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong – such as ascetic sacrifice.<ref name="utm.edu2"/> This manner of thinking permits the possibility of [[Felicific calculus|a calculator to measure happiness and moral value]].

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]]. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, whereas only [[compassion]] can be a moral act.

Schopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when time moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.<ref>Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea. Cologne 1997, Volume One, §52th.</ref>

===Władysław Tatarkiewicz===
[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]] (1886–1980) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], historian of [[philosophy]], historian of [[art]], [[Aesthetics|esthetician]], and [[ethics|ethicist]].<ref>"Władysław Tatarkiewicz," ''[[Encyklopedia Polski]]'', p.&nbsp;686.</ref>

For Tatarkiewicz, happiness is a fundamental ethical category.

===Herbert Marcuse===
[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]].

In his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/|title=Herbert Marcuse|website=stanford.edu|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2017}}</ref>

In the ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be [[democracy|democratic]], but is [[authoritarian]] in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Marcuse | first1 = Herbert | title = One-dimensional Man: studies in ideology of advanced industrial society | chapter = Introduction to the Second Edition | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | location = London | page = 3 | isbn = 978-0-415-07429-2 }}</ref> He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging.

===Viktor Frankl===
{{Main|Logotherapy|Man's Search for Meaning}}

{{rquote|right|''It is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to 'be happy.' But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to 'be happy'.''|[[Viktor Frankl]]<ref name=Smith20141022>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-lesson-about-happiness-from-a-holocaust-survivor-2014-10 |title=A Psychiatrist Who Survived The Holocaust Explains Why Meaningfulness Matters More Than Happiness |date=22 October 2014 |work=Business Insider |first1=Emily Esfahani |last1=Smith |agency=The Atlantic }}</ref>}}

[[Viktor Frankl]] (1905–1997) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[neurology|neurologist]], [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], [[Holocaust]] [[List of Holocaust survivors|survivor]] and founder of [[logotherapy]]. His philosophy revolved around the emphasis on meaning, the value of suffering, and responsibility to something greater than the self;<ref name=Smith20141022/> only if one encounters those questions can one be happy.

===Robert Nozick===
{{Main|Experience machine}}
[[Robert Nozick]] (1938–2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]]<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ |title=Nozick, Robert |encyclopedia=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |first=Edward |last=Feser |date=4 May 2005}}</ref> and professor at [[Harvard University]]. He is best known for his political philosophy, but he proposed two thought experiments directly tied to issues on Philosophy of Happiness.

In his 1974 book, ''[[Anarchy, State, Utopia]]'', he proposed a [[thought experiment]] where one is given the option to enter a machine that would give the maximum amount of unending hedonistic pleasure for the entirety of one's life. The machine described in his thought experiment is often described as the "[[Experience machine|Experience Machine]]." The machine works by giving the participant connected to it the sensation of any experience they desired and is said to produce sensations that are indistinguishable from real life experiences.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Crisp |first1=Roger |title=Hedonism Reconsidered |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |date=2006 |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=619–645 |doi=10.2307/40041013 |jstor=40041013 }}</ref>

Nozick outlined the "[[utility monster]]" thought experiment as an attempted criticism to utilitarianism. Utilitarian ethics provides guidance for acting morally, but also to maximizing happiness. The utility monster is a hypothetical being that generates extreme amount of theoretical pleasure units compared to the average person. Consider a situation such as the utility monster receiving fifty units of pleasure from eating a cake versus forty other people receiving only one unit of pleasure per cake eaten. Although each individual receives the same treatment or good, the utility monster somehow generates more than all the other people combined. Given many utilitarian commitments to maximizing utility related to pleasure, the thought experiment is meant to force utilitarians to commit themselves to feeding the utility monster instead of a mass of other people, despite our general intuitions insisting otherwise. The criticism essentially comes in the form of a [[reductio ad absurdum]] criticism by showing that utilitarians adopt a view that is absurd to our moral intuitions, specifically that we should consider the utility monster with much more regard than a number of other people.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sridharan |first1=Vishnu |title=Utility Monsters and the Distribution of Dharmas: A Reply to Charles Goodman |journal=Philosophy East and West |date=2016 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=650–652 |doi=10.1353/pew.2016.0033 |jstor=43830917 |s2cid=170234711 }}</ref>

===Happiness research===
[[Happiness research]] is the quantitative and theoretical study of [[happiness]], positive and negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[life satisfaction]] and related concepts. It is especially influenced by [[psychologists]], but also [[sociologists]] and [[economists]] have contributed. 
The tracking of [[Gross National Happiness]] or the [[Satisfaction with Life Index|satisfaction of life]] grow increasingly popular as the economics of happiness challenges traditional economic aims.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Layard |first1=Richard |authorlink1=Richard Layard |title=Happiness and Public Policy: A Challenge to the Profession |journal=The Economic Journal |date=1 March 2006 |volume=116 |issue=510 |pages=C24–C33 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01073.x |jstor=3590410 |s2cid=9780718 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/47483/ }}</ref>

[[Richard Layard]] has been very influential in this area. He has shown that mental illness is the main cause of unhappiness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Layard |first1=Richard |title=Happiness: Lessons from a New Science |publisher=Penguin |date=7 April 2011 |asin=B004TRQAS6 }}{{pn|date=October 2020}}</ref> Other, more influential researchers are [[Ed Diener]], [[Ruut Veenhoven]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]].

===Sonja Lyubomirsky===
[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]] asserted in her 2007 book, ''The How of Happiness'', that happiness is 50 percent genetically determined (based on twin studies),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lyubomirsky |first1=Sonja |last2=Sheldon |first2=Kennon M. |last3=Schkade |first3=David |title=Pursuing Happiness: The Architecture of Sustainable Change |journal=Review of General Psychology |date=1 June 2005 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=111–131 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.2.111 |s2cid=6705969 |citeseerx=10.1.1.335.9655 }}</ref> 10 percent circumstantial, and 40 percent subject to [[self-control]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Halpern |first1=Sue |title=Are You Happy? |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2008/04/03/are-you-happy/ |work=The New York Review |date=3 April 2008 }}</ref>

===Impact of individualism===
[[Hedonism]] appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen |last2=Jarden |first2=Aaron |title=Individualism as the moderator of the relationship between hedonism and happiness: A study in 19 nations |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=1 May 2016 |volume=94 |pages=149–152 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2016.01.025 }}</ref>

===Happiness movement===
Happiness is becoming a more clearly delineated aim in the West, both of individuals and politics (including [[happiness economics]]). The [[World Happiness Report]] shows the level of interest, and organisations such as [[Action for Happiness]] undertake practical actions.
