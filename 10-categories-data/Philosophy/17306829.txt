'''Conceptual necessity''' is a property of the certainty with which a state of affairs, as presented by a certain description, occurs: it occurs by conceptual necessity if and only if it occurs just by virtue of the meaning of the description. If someone is a [[bachelor]], for instance, then he is bound to be unmarried by conceptual necessity, because the meaning of the word "bachelor" determines that he is.

Alternatively, there is [[metaphysical necessity]], which is a certainty determined, not by the meaning of a description, but instead by facts in the world described.

Historically, [[Baruch Spinoza]] was a subscriber to this belief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-modal/notes.html |title=Notes to Spinoza's Modal Metaphysics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref>
