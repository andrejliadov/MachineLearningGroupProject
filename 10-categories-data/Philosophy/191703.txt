'''Anthropocentrism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|θ|r|oʊ-|p|oʊ-|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|t|r|ɪ|z|əm}};{{refn|{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editor=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartmann |editor3=Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}}} from {{lang-grc|ἄνθρωπος}}, ''ánthrōpos'', "human being"; and {{lang-grc|κέντρον}}, ''kéntron'', "center") is the belief that [[human being]]s are the most important entity in the [[universe]]. Anthropocentrism interprets or regards the world in terms of human values and experiences.<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster |anthropocentrism}}</ref> The term can be used interchangeably with '''humanocentrism''', and some refer to the concept as '''human supremacy''' or '''human exceptionalism'''. Anthropocentrism is considered to be profoundly embedded in many modern human cultures and conscious acts. It is a major concept in the field of [[environmental ethics]] and [[environmental philosophy]], where it is often considered to be the root cause of problems created by human action within the [[ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]].<ref>PhilPapers, Systems Thinking and Universal Dialogue: The Creation of a Noosphere in Today’s Era of Globalization, Author-Martha C. Beck, Dialogue and Universalism 23 (3):123-136 (2013)</ref>
However, many proponents of anthropocentrism state that this is not necessarily the case: they argue that a sound long-term view acknowledges that the global environment must be made continually suitable for humans and that the real issue is shallow anthropocentrism.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/#IntChaEnvEth | title=Environmental Ethics, See: 1.

==Environmental philosophy==
Anthropocentrism, also known as homocentricism or human [[supremacism]],<ref name=Plumwood2002>{{Cite book | last1= Plumwood | first1= Val | year= 2002 | title= Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason | isbn= 9780415178778 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-Aku-jlWZ_4C | format= Google Books online preview version | access-date= 12 June 2013 }}</ref> has been posited by some [[environmentalist]]s, in such books as ''[[Confessions of an Eco-Warrior]]'' by [[Dave Foreman]] and ''Green Rage'' by Christopher Manes, as the underlying (if unstated) reason why humanity dominates and sees the need to "develop" most of the Earth. Anthropocentrism is believed by some to be the central problematic concept in environmental philosophy, where it is used to draw attention claims of a systematic bias in traditional Western attitudes to the non-human world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Naess | first1 = A | year = 1973 | title = The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement | journal = Inquiry | volume = 16 | pages = 95–100 | doi=10.1080/00201747308601682}}</ref> [[Val Plumwood]] has argued<ref>Plumwood, V. 1993. ''Feminism and the Mastery of Nature''. London: Routledge</ref><ref>Plumwood, V. 1996. Androcentrism and Anthrocentrism: Parallels and Politics. ''Ethics and the Environment'' 1</ref> that anthropocentrism plays an analogous role in green theory to [[androcentrism]] in feminist theory and [[ethnocentrism]] in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness "anthrocentrism" to emphasise this parallel.

One of the first extended philosophical essays addressing environmental ethics, [[John Passmore]]'s ''Man's Responsibility for Nature''<ref>Passmore, J. 1974. ''Man's Responsibility for Nature'' London: Duckworth</ref> has been criticised by defenders of [[deep ecology]] because of its anthropocentrism, often claimed to be constitutive of traditional Western moral thought.<ref>Routley, R. and V. 1980. 'Human Chauvinism and Environmental Ethics' in ''Environmental Philosophy'' (eds) D.S. Mannison, M. McRobbie and R. Routley. Canberra: ANU Research School of Social Sciences: 96-189</ref> Indeed, defenders of anthropocentrism concerned with the ecological crisis contend that the maintenance of a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for human well-being as opposed to for its own sake. The problem with a "shallow" viewpoint is not that it is human-centred but that according to William Grey: "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. According to this view, we need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grey | first1 = W | year = 1993 | title = Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology | url = http://www.uq.edu.au/%7Epdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html | journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–475 | doi = 10.1080/00048409312345442 | access-date = 2006-11-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080726183226/http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html | archive-date = 2008-07-26 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In turn, Plumwood in ''Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason'' argued that Grey's anthropocentrism is inadequate.<ref>{{Cite book | last1= Plumwood | first1= Val | year= 2002 | chapter= Chapter 6 Philosophy, Prudence and Anthropocentrism | pages= (123–) 130–142 | title= Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason | isbn= 9780415178778 | chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-Aku-jlWZ_4C&pg=130 | chapter-format= Google Books online preview version | access-date= 12 June 2013 }}</ref>

It is important to take note that many devoted environmentalists encompass a somewhat anthropocentric-based philosophical view supporting the fact that they will argue in favor of saving the environment for the sake of human populations. Grey writes: "We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse, and vibrant biosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html|title=The University of Queensland|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref> Such a concern for human flourishing amidst the flourishing of life as a whole, however, is said to be indistinguishable from that of [[deep ecology]] and [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], which has been proposed as both an [[antithesis]] of anthropocentrism.<ref>{{Cite conference

==Jewish and Christian traditions==
In the 1985 [[CBC Television|CBC]] series "A Planet For the Taking", [[Dr. David Suzuki]] explored the [[Old Testament]] roots of anthropocentrism and how it shaped our view of non-human animals. Some Christian proponents of anthropocentrism base their belief on the Bible, such as the verse 1:26 in the [[Book of Genesis]]:
{{quote|And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.}}

The use of the word "dominion" in the ''Genesis'' has been used to justify an anthropocentric worldview, but recently some have found it controversial viewing it as possibly a mistranslation from the Hebrew, .<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hiebert |first1=Theodore |title=Retranslating Genesis 1–2: Reconnecting Biblical Thought and Contemporary Experience |journal=The Bible Translator. |date=12 December 2019 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=261–272 |doi=10.1177/2051677019877229 |s2cid=213322770 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2051677019877229 |access-date=15 September 2020}}</ref> However an argument can be made that the Bible actually places all the importance on God as creator, and humans as merely another part of creation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simkins |first1=Ronald |title=The Bible and anthropocentrism: putting humans in their place |journal=Dialectical Anthropology |date=December 2014 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=397–413 |doi=10.1007/s10624-014-9348-z |jstor=43895115 |s2cid=145211787 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43895115 |access-date=15 September 2020}}</ref>

==Confucian traditions==
The human-animal distinction by [[Mencius]] states that only human develops moral values.<ref>[https://ctext.org/mengzi/li-lou-ii/zh?en=on That whereby man differs from the lower animals is but small. The mass of people cast it away, while superior men preserve it. Shun clearly understood the multitude of things, and closely observed the relations of humanity. He walked along the path of benevolence and righteousness; he did not need to pursue benevolence and righteousness.]''Li Lou II, Mencius'' Translated by James Legge.</ref> In [[Book of Documents]], one of the [[Four_Books_and_Five_Classics#Five_Classics|Five Classics]], it states that human is ''most highly endowed''. <ref>[https://ctext.org/shang-shu/great-declaration-i/zh?en=on Heaven and earth is the parent of all creatures; and of all creatures man is the most highly endowed.]''Great Declaration I, Book of Documents'' Translated by James Legge.</ref> These teachings mainly focus on the development of moral values, but it implicitly leads to the statement that humans are superior to other animals. To the extreme, some may even say that humans is not a member of animals.

==Human rights==
Anthropocentrism is the grounding for some [[natural and legal rights|naturalistic concepts]] of [[human rights]]. Defenders of anthropocentrism argue that it is the necessary fundamental premise to defend [[universal human rights]], since what matters morally is simply being human. For example, noted philosopher [[Mortimer J. Adler]] wrote, "Those who oppose injurious discrimination on the moral ground that all human beings, being equal in their humanity, should be treated equally in all those respects that concern their common humanity, would have no solid basis in fact to support their normative principle." Adler is stating here, that denying what is now called human exceptionalism could lead to tyranny, writing that if we ever came to believe that humans do not possess a unique moral status, the intellectual foundation of our liberties collapses: "Why, then, should not groups of superior men be able to justify their enslavement, exploitation, or even genocide of inferior human groups on factual and moral grounds akin to those we now rely on to justify our treatment of the animals we harness as beasts of burden, that we butcher for food and clothing, or that we destroy as disease-bearing pests or as dangerous predators?"<ref>Mortimer J. Adler, ''The Difference of Man and the Difference It Makes'', (New York, Fordham University Press, 1993), p.264.</ref>

Author and anthropocentrism defender [[Wesley J. Smith]] from the [[Discovery Institute]] has written that human exceptionalism is what gives rise to human duties to each other, the natural world, and to treat animals humanely. Writing in ''A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy'', a critique of [[animal rights]] ideology, "Because we ''are'' unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, proper and improper conduct toward animals. Or to put it more succinctly if being human isn't what requires us to treat animals humanely, what in the world does?"<ref>''A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy: The Human Cost of the Animal Rights Movement'' ''[https://www.amazon.com/Rat-Pig-Dog-Boy-Movement/dp/1594033463/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1275969161&sr=1-1]'', (New York, Encounter Books, 2010),  pp. 243-244.</ref>

== Animal rights ==

Anthropocentrism has been criticised by [[animal rights]] and [[Animal welfare|welfare]] advocates, who contend that the belief that humans are more important than other animals is false and that like humans, non-human animals have [[Intrinsic value (animal ethics)|intrinsic value]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gruen|first=Lori|title=The Moral Status of Animals|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/moral-animal/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> One of the earliest of these critics was the zoologist and philosopher [[J. Howard Moore]], who in ''[[The Universal Kinship]]'' (1906) argued that [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) "sealed the doom of anthropocentricism{{Sic}}"<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J. Howard|url=http://archive.org/details/universalkinship00moor|title=The Universal Kinship|publisher=Charles H. Kerr & Co.|year=1906|location=Chicago}}</ref>{{Rp|319}} and that:<blockquote>The supposed psychical gulf between human and non-human beings has no more existence, outside the flamboyant imagination of man, than has the once-supposed physical gulf. It is pure fiction. The supposition is a relic of the rapidly dwindling vanity of anthropocentricism{{Sic}}, and is perpetuated from age to age by human selfishness and conceit. It has no foundation either in science or in common-sense. Man strives to lessen his guilt by the laudation of himself and the disparagement and degradation of his victims.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|108}}</blockquote>Philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and [[David Pearce (philosopher)|David Pearce]] have argued against anthropocentric ethics, instead advocating for [[Speciesism#Arguments against|antispeciesist]] or [[Sentientism|sentientist]] ethics, which rather than giving more value to humans based on their species membership, assert that "other things being equal, equally strong interests should count equally."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hedweb.com/transhumanism/antispeciesist.html|title=The Antispeciesist Revolution|last=Pearce|first=David|date=2013|website=www.hedweb.com|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> This [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] principle is based on the dictum "everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one" attributed to [[Jeremy Bentham]] by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' (1876).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|url=https://archive.org/details/a592840000milluoft|title=Utilitarianism|publisher=Parker, Son, and Bourn|year=1863|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/a592840000milluoft/page/91 91]}}</ref>

==Cognitive psychology==
In [[cognitive psychology]], anthropocentric thinking can be defined as "the tendency to reason about unfamiliar biological species or processes by analogy to humans."<ref name="Coley2012">{{cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=John D|last2=Tanner|first2=Kimberly D|title=Common Origins of Diverse Misconceptions: Cognitive Principles and the Development of Biology Thinking|journal=CBE: Life Sciences Education|date=2012|volume=11|issue=3|pages=209–215|doi=10.1187/cbe.12-06-0074|pmid=22949417|url=http://www.lifescied.org/content/11/3/209.full|language=en|issn=1931-7913|pmc=3433289}}</ref> Reasoning by [[analogy]] is an attractive thinking strategy, and it can be tempting to apply our own experience of being human to other [[biological]] systems. For example, because death is commonly felt to be undesirable, it may be tempting to form the [[Scientific misconceptions|misconception]] that death at a cellular level or elsewhere in nature is similarly undesirable (whereas in reality [[programmed cell death]] is an essential physiological phenomenon, and [[ecosystem]]s also rely on death).<ref name="Coley2012"/> Conversely, anthropocentric thinking can also lead people to underattribute human characteristics to other organisms. For instance, it may be tempting to wrongly assume that an animal that is very different from humans, such as an insect, will not share particular biological characteristics, such as reproduction or blood circulation.<ref name="Coley2012"/>

Anthropocentric thinking has predominantly been studied in young children (mostly up to the age of 10) by [[developmental psychologist]]s interested in its relevance to biology [[education]]. Children as young as 6 have been found to attribute human characteristics to species unfamiliar to them (in Japan), such as rabbits, grasshoppers or tulips.<ref name="Coley2012"/> Although relatively little is known about its persistence at a later age, evidence exists that this pattern of human exceptionalist thinking can continue through young adulthood at least, even among students who have been increasingly educated in biology.<ref name="Coley2017">{{cite journal|last1=Coley|first1=John D|last2=Arenson|first2=Melanie|last3=Xu|first3=Yian|last4=Tanner|first4=Kimberly D|title=Intuitive biological thought: Developmental changes and effects of biology education in late adolescence|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=February 2017|volume=92|pages=1–21| doi=10.1016/j.cogpsych.2016.11.001|pmid=27865155| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310589329|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The notion that anthropocentric thinking is an [[innate]] human characteristic has been challenged by study of American children raised in urban environments, among whom it appears to emerge between the ages of 3 and 5 years as an acquired perspective.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herrmann|first1=Patricia|last2=Waxman|first2=Sandra R|last3=Medin|first3=Douglas L|title=Anthropocentrism is not the first step in children's reasoning about the natural world|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1 June 2010|volume=107|issue=22|pages=9979–9984|doi=10.1073/pnas.1004440107|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2890461|pmid=20479241|bibcode=2010PNAS..107.9979H}}</ref> Children's recourse to anthropocentric thinking seems to vary with their experience of nature, and cultural assumptions about the place of humans in the natural world.<ref name="Coley2012"/> For example, whereas young children who kept goldfish were found to think of frogs as being more goldfish-like, other children tended to think of frogs in terms of humans.<ref name="Coley2012"/> More generally, children raised in rural environments appear to use anthropocentric thinking less than their urban counterparts because of their greater familiarity with different species of animals and plants.<ref name="Coley2012"/> Studies involving children from some of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] have found little use of anthropocentric thinking.<ref name="Coley2012"/><ref name="Marshall2016">{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Peter J|last2=Brenneman|first2=Kimberly|title=Young Children's Developing Understanding of the Biological World|journal=Early Education and Development|date=2016|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1103–1108| doi=10.1080/10409289.2016.1220772|issn=1040-9289|doi-access=free}}</ref> Study of children among the [[Wichí people]] in South America showed a tendency to think of living organisms in terms of their [[Folk taxonomy|perceived taxonomic similarities]], [[ecological]] considerations, and [[animistic]] traditions, resulting in a much less anthropocentric view of the natural world than is experienced by many children in Western societies.<ref name="Marshall2016"/>

==In popular culture==
{{Expert needed|Science Fiction|talk=|reason=Analysis of global fiction and science fiction without neither source nor examples. Needs an expert of [[Science fiction studies]]|date=November 2016}}
In fiction from all eras and societies, there is fiction treating as normal the actions of humans to ride, eat, milk, and otherwise treat animals as separate species. There are occasional exceptions, such as [[talking animal]]s, but they are generally treated as exceptions, as aberrations to the rule distinguishing people from animals.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

In [[science fiction]], ''humanocentrism'' is the idea that humans, as both beings and as a species, are the superior [[Sentience#Science fiction|sentient]]s. Essentially the equivalent of [[Supremacism|racial supremacy]] on a galactic scale, it entails [[ethnic hatred|intolerant]] discrimination against sentient [[extraterrestrial life|non-human]]s, much like race supremacists discriminate against those not of their race. A prime example of this concept is utilized as a story element for the ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'' series. After humanity's first contact results in a brief war, many humans in the series develop suspicious or even hostile attitudes towards the game's various alien races. By the time of the first game, which takes place several decades after the war, many humans still retain such sentiments in addition to forming 'pro-human' organizations.

This idea is countered by [[Antihumanism#In fiction|anti-humanism]]. At times, this ideal also includes [[Technophobia#Technophobia in arts|fear of and superiority over]] [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AIs]] and [[cyborg]]s, downplaying the ideas of [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#AI equality|integration]], [[cybernetic revolt]]s, [[machine rule]] and [[Tilden's Laws of Robotics]].{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}

[[Mark Twain]] mocked the belief in human supremacy in ''[[Letters from the Earth]]'' (written c. 1909, published 1962).<ref>{{cite news|publisher=skeptically.org|title=Damned Human Race: Mark Twain|author= Mark Twain|url=http://www.skeptically.org/logicalthreads/id14.html|access-date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Planet of the Apes]] franchise focuses on the analogy of apes becoming the dominant species in society and the fall of humans (see also [[human extinction]]). In [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|the 1968 film]], Taylor, a human states "take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!". In [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|the 2001 film]], this is contrasted with Attar (a gorilla)'s quote "take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!". This links in with allusions that in becoming the dominant species apes are becoming more like humans ([[anthropomorphism]]). In the film [[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]], Virgil, an [[orangutan]] states "ape has never killed ape, let alone an ape child. Aldo has killed an ape child. The branch did not break. It was cut with a sword." in reference to planned murder; a stereotypical human concept. Additionally, in [[Dawn of the Planet of the Apes]], Caesar states "I always think...ape better than human. I see now...how much like them we are".

In [[George Orwell]]'s novel [[Animal Farm]], this theme of anthropocentrism is also present. Whereas originally the animals planned for liberation from humans and animal equality, as evident from the "seven commandments" such as "whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.", "Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend", "All animals are equal."; the pigs would later abridge the commandments with statements such as "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others." and "Four legs good, two legs better."{{Citation needed|reason=Specific citations may be useful|date=June 2019}}

The 2012 documentary ''The Superior Human?'' systematically analyzes anthropocentrism and concludes that value is fundamentally an opinion, and since life forms naturally value their own traits, most humans are misled to believe that they are actually more valuable than other species. This natural bias, according to the film, combined with a received sense of comfort and an excuse for exploitation of non-humans cause anthropocentrism to remain in society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesuperiorhuman.ultraventus.info/|title="The Superior Human?"
