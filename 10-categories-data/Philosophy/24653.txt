{{Nihongo|'''''Princess Mononoke'''''|もののけ姫|''Mononoke-[[hime]]''|extra=|lead=yes}} is a 1997 [[Anime|Japanese-animated]] [[Epic film|epic]] [[fantasy film]] written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]], animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]], [[Nippon Television Network]] and [[Dentsu]], and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film stars the voices of [[Yōji Matsuda]], [[Yuriko Ishida]], [[Yūko Tanaka]], [[Kaoru Kobayashi (actor)|Kaoru Kobayashi]], [[Masahiko Nishimura]], [[Tsunehiko Kamijo]], [[Akihiro Miwa]], [[Mitsuko Mori]] and [[Hisaya Morishige]].

''Princess Mononoke'' is set in the late [[Muromachi period]] of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 CE), but it includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young [[Emishi]] prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The term {{Nihongo|''[[Mononoke]]''|{{linktext|物の怪}}}}, or {{lang|ja|もののけ}}, is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.

The film was released in Japan on July 12, 1997, and in the United States on October 29, 1999. It was a critical and commercial [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan of 1997, and also held Japan's box office record for domestic films until 2001's ''[[Spirited Away]]'', another Miyazaki film. It was [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into English with a script by [[Neil Gaiman]], and initially distributed in North America by [[Miramax]], where it sold well on DVD and video, despite a poor box office performance, thereby greatly increasing Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan.

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. Please go to the talk page before making any major changes. -->
In [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] Japan, an [[Emishi]] village is attacked by a demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his right arm. The curse gives him superhuman strength, but will eventually spread through his body and kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from, but he cannot return to his homeland. Before Ashitaka leaves, his sister, Kaya,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tokuma Shoten and Studio Ghibli |title=Interview: Miyazaki on Mononoke-hime |url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/m_on_mh.html |website=The Hayao Miyazaki Web |access-date=14 July 2020}}</ref> gives him her crystal dagger so that he will not forget her.

Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo ("Jiko-bō" in the original Japanese version), an opportunist posing as a monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant "[[Daidarabotchi|nightwalker]]" by night. Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown ("Tataraba" in Japanese), led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men and carries them through the forest, where he encounters many [[Kodama (spirit)|kodama]] and glimpses the Forest Spirit. In Irontown, Ashitaka learns that Eboshi built the town by [[clearcutting]] forests to claim [[ironsand]] and produce iron, leading to conflicts with the forest gods and Asano, a local [[daimyō]]. Irontown is a refuge for social outcasts, including [[Leprosy in Japan|lepers]] employed to manufacture firearms; it was one of these guns that had wounded Nago. Eboshi also explains that San was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.

San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, revealing the curse to the town's people and knocks Eboshi and San out cold. As Ashitaka leaves, he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him the strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life. A boar clan, led by the blind boar god Okkoto, plans to attack Irontown to save the forest. Eboshi prepares for battle and sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo, who is working for the government; she intends to give the god's head to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] in return for protection from Lord Asano. According to legend, the Forest Spirit's head grants immortality.

Ashitaka recovers from his wound but remains cursed; he returns to Irontown to find it besieged by Asano's [[samurai]], and heads out to warn Eboshi. The boar clan is annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is corrupted by his wounds. Jigo's men disguise themselves in boar skins and trick the rampaging Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto, but is swept up in his demonic corruption. Moro intervenes and Ashitaka dives into the corruption, saving San. The Forest Spirit euthanizes Okkoto and Moro. As it transforms into the nightwalker, Eboshi decapitates it. It bleeds ooze which spreads over the land, killing anything it touches as the nightwalker searches for its head, which Jigo steals. The forest and kodama begin to die; Moro's head comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives.

After the samurai flee and Irontown is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies as the sun rises, but its form washes over the land and heals it, and Ashitaka's curse is lifted. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Irontown, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi reunites with the townspeople and vows to build a better town. The forest begins to regrow, and a kodama emerges from the undergrowth.

==Cast and characters==

Novelist Ali Shaw has described Yakul as being more similar to a red [[Lechwe]] than an elk.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/2016/01/07/ali-shaw-is-yakul-from-princess-mononoke/|title=Ali Shaw is Yakul from Princess Mononoke|last=Jahn|first=Pam|date=January 7, 2016|website=Electric Sheep|language=en-US|access-date=December 11, 2019}}</ref> Miyazaki called Ashitaka a "melancholic boy who has a fate" and also stated that Ashitaka's curse "is similar to the lives of people [at the time]".<ref name="m_on_mh">{{cite web|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/m_on_mh.html |title=Miyazaki on Mononoke-hime |publisher=Nausicaa.net |access-date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> Ashitaka's English voice actor [[Billy Crudup]] stated that he liked Ashitaka as "an unexpected hero. He’s not your usual wild, brave guy. He’s really just a young, earnest man who’s trying to lead a valuable life and protect his village."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/03.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616105618/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/03.html |title=Princess Mononoke – The Characters|publisher=Miramax Films|page=3|archive-date=June 16, 2008|access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Yuriko Ishida]] voices {{nihongo|San|サン}}, a young woman who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans, but eventually comes to care for Ashitaka. In the English version, San is voiced by [[Claire Danes]].

Miyazaki stated that Eboshi was supposed to have a traumatic past, although it is not specifically mentioned in the film. Miyazaki said that Eboshi has a strong and secure personality, evident in the fact that she let Ashitaka move freely through the settlement unescorted, despite his unclear motives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} He also said that Eboshi does not acknowledge the Emperor's authority in Irontown, a revolutionary view for the time, and displays an atypical attitude for a woman of that era in that she wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice herself or those around her for her dreams.<ref name="m_on_mh" />{{Failed verification|date=January 2020|reason=There's no mention of the Emperor in this fashion}} Miyazaki also said that Eboshi resembles a [[shirabyōshi]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v5_2/leavey/ | title=Possessed by and of: Up against Seeing: Princess Mononoke | publisher=University of Florida | access-date=September 11, 2012 | last=Leavey | first=John | journal=ImageTexT | year=2010 | volume=5 | issue=2}}</ref> Eboshi's English voice actress [[Minnie Driver]] stated that she was interested in "the challenge of playing [a] woman who supports industry and represents the interests of man, in terms of achievement and greed."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/05.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616090359/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/05.html |title=Princess Mononoke – The Characters|publisher=Miramax Films|page=5|archive-date=June 16, 2008|access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref> Driver viewed Eboshi as "a warrior, an innovator and a protector."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/07.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616020449/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/characters/07.html |title=Princess Mononoke – The Characters|publisher=Miramax Films|page=7|archive-date=June 16, 2008|access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref>
* [[Kaoru Kobayashi (actor)|Kaoru Kobayashi]] provides the voice of {{nihongo|Jiko-bō|ジコ坊||called "Jigo" in the English version}}, a monk and mercenary who befriends Ashitaka on his journey to the west. Miyazaki was unsure whether to make Jiko-bō a government spy, a [[ninja]], a member of a religious group or "a very good guy."

* [[Masahiko Nishimura]] voices {{nihongo|Kohroku|甲六|Kōroku}}, an ox driver; [[John DeMita]] voices Kohroku in the English version.

==Production==
[[File:Shiratani Unsui Gorge 17.jpg|thumb|left|Shiratani Unsui forest, [[Yakushima]]|231x231px]]

In the late 1970s, Miyazaki drew sketches of a film about a princess living in the woods with a beast.{{sfn|McCarthy|2005|p=182}} Miyazaki began writing the film's plotline and drew the initial storyboards for the film in August 1994.<ref name="ProductionDiary1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghibli.jp/diary_m/948-955.html|title=制作日誌　1994年8月～95年5月|publisher=Studio Ghibli|access-date=September 14, 2012}}</ref>{{Sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=185}} He had difficulties adapting his early ideas and visualisations, because elements had already been used in ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and because of societal changes since the creation of the original sketches and image boards. This writer's block prompted him to accept a request for the creation of the ''[[On Your Mark]]'' promotional music video for the [[Chage and Aska]] [[On Your Mark (song)|song of the same title]]. According to Toshio Suzuki, the diversion allowed Miyazaki to return for a fresh start on the creation of ''Princess Mononoke''. In April 1995, supervising animator [[Masashi Ando]] devised the character designs from Miyazaki's [[storyboard]]. In May 1995, Miyazaki drew the initial storyboards. That same month, Miyazaki and Ando went to the ancient forests of [[Yakushima]], of [[Kyushu]], an inspiration for the landscape of ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and the mountains of [[Shirakami-Sanchi]] in northern [[Honshu]] for [[location scouting]] along with a group of art directors, background artists and digital animators for three days.<ref name="ProductionDiary1"/> Animation production commenced in July 1995.{{Sfn|McCarthy|1999|p=185}} Miyazaki personally oversaw each of the 144,000 [[cel]]s in the film,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/chats/dp_991104_transcript.html  |title=Hayao Miyazake Chat Transcript – Movie: Princess Mononoke |publisher=Miramax Films|date=November 4, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629225024/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/chats/dp_991104_transcript.html |archive-date=June 29, 2007|access-date=September 14, 2012}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2020|reason=This specific number (144,000) was never mentioned in the source.}} and is estimated to have redrawn parts of 80,000 of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/studioghibli/princessnews.html |title=Mononoke DVD Website |publisher=Disney|access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2020|reason=There's nothing in this source about the animation cels.}}<ref name="mov">{{cite journal | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition | journal = Moving Pictures, Berlinale Extra | page = 32 | location = Berlin | date = February 11–22, 1998 }}</ref> The final storyboards of the film's ending were finished only months before the Japanese premiere date.<ref name="mononoke_masterpiece">{{cite video  | people = Toshio Uratani  | title = Princess Mononoke: Making of a Masterpiece  | medium = Documentary  | publisher = [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] | location = Japan |date = 2004}}</ref>

Inspired by [[John Ford]], an Irish-American director best known for his [[Western film|Westerns]], Miyazaki created Irontown as a "tight-knit frontier town" and populated it with "characters from outcast groups and oppressed minorities who rarely, if ever, appear in Japanese films." He made the characters "yearning, ambitious and tough."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/myth/02.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525054911/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/myth/02.html |archive-date=May 25, 2008|title=The Myth of Princess Mononoke and Miyazaki's vision|page=2|publisher=Miramax Films|access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref> Miyazaki did not want to create an accurate history of [[Medieval Japan]], and wanted to "portray the very beginnings of the seemingly insoluble conflict between the natural world and modern industrial civilization."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/myth/05.html|title=The Myth of Princess Mononoke and Miyazaki's vision|page=5|publisher=Miramax Films|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025065522/http://www.princess-mononoke.com/html/epic/myth/05.html |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref> The landscapes appearing in the film were inspired by Yakushima.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loca.ash.jp/info/1997/s1997_mononoke.htm|script-title=ja:もののけ姫 ロケ地情報|language=ja|access-date=September 1, 2012}}</ref> Despite being set during the Muromachi period, the actual time period of ''Princess Mononoke'' depicts a "symbolic neverwhen clash of three proto-Japanese races (the [[Jomon]], [[Yamato people|Yamato]] and [[Emishi]])."{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2005| p=505}}

Two titles were originally considered for the film. One, ultimately chosen, has been translated into English as ''Princess Mononoke''. The other title can be translated into English as {{nihongo|''The Legend of Ashitaka''|アシタカ𦻙記|Ashitaka Sekki}}, and it contains an [[Hyōgai kanji|uncommon kanji]] 𦻙 that represents "a legend passed down from ear to ear without being recorded in official history", according to Miyazaki. In a [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program, televised on November 26, 2013, Toshio Suzuki mentioned that Miyazaki had preferred ''The Legend of Ashitaka'' as the title while Suzuki himself favoured ''Princess Mononoke'', though the former title was eventually reused for the first song on the soundtrack.<ref name="Miyazaki(2009)">{{cite book |last=Miyazaki |first=Hayao |date=July 31, 1996 |chapter=「もののけ姫」 企画書 |trans-chapter=Princess Mononoke Planning Memo |title=出発点 |trans-title=Starting Point |url=http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Viz Media |pages=272–274 |isbn=978-1-4215-0594-7 |access-date=December 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828232509/http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |archive-date=August 28, 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode| title= 鈴木 敏夫 100秒博士アカデミー |trans-title=Toshio Suzuki, 100 Byo Hakase Academy | series= 100秒博士アカデミー | last1=Matsumoto | first1= Hitoshi | last2= Hamada | first2= Masatoshi | url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/100byouhakaseacademy/backnumber/bn201311.html#bn20131126 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129080027/http://www.tbs.co.jp/100byouhakaseacademy/backnumber/bn201311.html |archive-date= January 29, 2014 | url-status=live | network= TBS | station=RCC | language= ja | airdate= November 26, 2013 | access-date= January 28, 2014}}</ref> The English dub contains minor additional voice overs to explain nuances of Japanese culture to western audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/4198|title=A more complete look at the dubbed version of MONONOKE HIME (aka Princess Mononoke)|last=staff|website=Aint It Cool News|language=en|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>

Speaking at the International Symposium on Leprosy / Hansen's Disease History in Tokyo, Miyazaki explained that he was inspired to portray people living with leprosy, "said to be an incurable disease caused by bad karma", after visiting the [[Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium]] near his home in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201601290032 |title=Hayao Miyazaki: Leprosy scene in 'Mononoke Hime' inspired by real-life experience |last=Kitano |first=Ryuichi |newspaper=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=January 29, 2016 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130093058/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201601290032 |archive-date=January 30, 2016 }}</ref> Lady Eboshi is driven by her compassion for the disabled, and believes that blood from the Great Forest Spirit could allow her to "cure [her] poor lepers".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wendi|first=Sierra|last2=Alysah|first2=Berwald|last3=Melissa|first3=Guck|last4=Erica|first4=Maeder|date=January 1, 2015|title=Nature, Technology, and Ruined Women: Ecofeminism and Princess Mononoke|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/sfd/vol1/iss1/5/|journal=The Seneca Falls Dialogues Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref> Michelle Jarman, Assistant Professor of Disability Studies at the [[University of Wyoming]], and Eunjung Kim, Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], said the disabled and gendered sexual bodies were partially used as a transition from the feudal era to a hegemony that "embraces modern [[social system]]s, such as [[industrialization]], gendered division of labor, [[institutionalization]] of people with diseases, and [[militarization]] of men and women." They likened Lady Eboshi to a [[monarch]].{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|p=54}} Kim and Jarman suggested that Eboshi's disregard of ancient laws and curses towards sex workers and lepers was enlightenment reasoning and her exploitation of disabled people furthered her modernist viewpoints.{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|pp=56–57}} Kim and Jarman conclude that Lady Eboshi's supposed benevolence in incorporating lepers and sex workers into her society leverages the social stigma attached to marginalized groups, pointing out that the hierarchical structures within Irontown still support the stigmatization of lepers and sex workers.{{Sfn|Kim|Jarman|2008|p=58}}

An additional theme is the morally ambiguous conflict between humankind's growth and development and Nature's need for preservation. According to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'''s [[Roger Ebert]], "It is not a simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/princess-mononoke-1999|title=Princess Mononoke |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=Rogerebert.com |date=October 29, 1999 |access-date=January 29, 2016}}</ref> Billy Crudup, who provided the English voice for Ashitaka, said "The movie was such an entirely different experience; it had a whole new sensibility I had never seen in animation. It also had something profound to say: that there has to be a give and take between man and nature. One of the things that really impressed me is that Miyazaki shows life in all its multi-faceted complexity, without the traditional perfect heroes and wicked villains. Even Lady Eboshi, who Ashitaka respects, is not so much evil as short-sighted." Minnie Driver, the English voice actress for Lady Eboshi, commented similarly: "It's one of the most remarkable things about the film: Miyazaki gives a complete argument for both sides of the battle between technological achievement and our spiritual roots in the forest. He shows that good and evil, violence and peace exist in us all. It's all about how you harmonize it all."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/4.7/06-event_mononoke.html |title=The Remaking of a Myth: Princess Mononoke in America |last=McCarter |first=Charles |publisher=Ex.org – EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga |date=October 20, 1999 |access-date=January 29, 2016 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806214532/http://www.ex.org/4.7/06-event_mononoke.html |archive-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref> Anime historian [[Susan Napier]] said there is no clear good vs. evil conflict in Princess Mononoke, unlike other films popular with children. Based on the multiple point of views the film adopts, San and Lady Eboshi can simultaneously be viewed as heroic or villainous. San defends the forest and viewers empathize with her. But she also attacks innocent people, complicating how we evaluate her. Opposed to San, Eboshi tries to destroy the forest and could be considered a villain. But everything she does is out of a desire to protect her village and see it prosper. San and Lady Eboshi survive until film's end, defying the usual convention of good triumphing over evil with the antagonist defeated. Napier concluded that the resolution of the conflict is left ambiguous, implying that Lady Eboshi and San will be able to come to some sort of compromise. The ambiguity suggests that there are no true villains or heroes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Napier|first1=Susan J.|title=Anime from Akira to Princess Mononoke|url=https://archive.org/details/animefromakirato00napi|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=9780312238636|pages=[https://archive.org/details/animefromakirato00napi/page/175 175–192]}}</ref>

Dan Jolin of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' said that a potential theme could be that of lost innocence. Miyazaki attributes this to his experience of making his previous film, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'', and the [[Yugoslav Wars|wars in the former Yugoslavia]], which he cites as an example of mankind never learning, making it difficult for him to go back to making a film such as ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', where he has been quoted as saying "It felt like children were being born to this world without being blessed. How could we pretend to them that we're happy?"<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Dan Jolin|date=September 2009|title=Miyazaki on Miyazaki: The animation genius on his movies|url=https://www.empireonline.com/features/hayao-miyazaki/|magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Duality is central to Eboshi's characterization. Benjamin Thevenin, Assistant Professor of Theater and Media Arts at [[Brigham Young University]], said  Eboshi does not fully understand the harm she does to the spirits. Her focus is on creating a safe home for her people. She holds no malicious intent toward nature and its spirits until they begin attacking her people. Once nature attacks, she gathers her soldiers to protect the inhabitants of her town, a place where all are welcome. Irontown is a heaven for sex workers and lepers. She brings them to Irontown and gives them jobs, hospitality, and a kindness that they have never experienced before. The same treatment goes for all Irontown's inhabitants, not just the sickly and the scorned. Lady Eboshi treats everyone equally, no matter the race, sex, or history of the individual, creating a caring community. While Eboshi hates San and the forest spirits, she keeps a garden in her town. Her care for the garden implies that her intention is not to ravage nature to no end, but rather to help her own people. Thevenin concluded that although Eboshi can be seen as the film's villain, she is also a hero to the citizens of Irontown and to humankind in general.<ref>Thevenin, Benjamin.

EBSCOhost, {{doi|10.1386/iscc.4.2.147_1}}.</ref>

Another theme in this film is between [[individualism]] and societal [[conformity]]. According to [[University of Bristol]] professors Christos Ellinas, Neil Allan and Anders Johansson, this struggle can be seen between San, a strong individualistic force, and Eboshi, the leader of a great society. San has fully committed to living with the wolves in the forest and to renouncing her association with the human race. Eboshi has vowed to sustain her society of Irontown by any means including destroying the environment. The people of Irontown have a cohesive ideology and agree with  Eboshi to protect Irontown at the cost of the environment's destruction. This conformity can be found within their society, because “even though there is an envisioned culture at which an organization abides to, achieving coherence at lower aggregation levels (e.g. individuals) is increasingly challenging due to its emergent nature”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellinas|first=Christos|last2=Allan|first2=Neil|last3=Johansson|first3=Anders|date=June 30, 2017|title=Dynamics of organizational culture: Individual beliefs vs. social conformity|journal=PLOS One|volume=12|issue=6|pages=e0180193|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180193|pmid=28665960|pmc=5493361|issn=1932-6203|arxiv=1708.06736|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280193E}}</ref> The different viewpoints of San and Lady Eboshi eventually leads to a physical altercation where they both aim to kill one another. This dynamic between them represents the struggle to find a balance between the needs of individualism and those of conformity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

''Princess Mononoke'' was released theatrically in Japan on July 12, 1997.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=414}} The film was extremely successful in Japan and with both [[anime]] fans and [[arthouse]] moviegoers in English-speaking countries. Since [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] had made a distribution deal with Tokuma Shoten for Studio Ghibli's films in 1996, it was the first film from Studio Ghibli along with ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' to have been dubbed into English by Disney; in this case, subsidiary [[Miramax Films]] was assigned to release the movie in America on October 29, 1999.

The film score of ''Princess Mononoke'' was composed and performed by [[Joe Hisaishi]], the soundtrack composer for nearly all of Miyazaki's productions, and Miyazaki wrote the lyrics of the two vocal tracks, "The Tatara Women Work Song" and its title song. The music was performed by Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Hiroshi Kumagai. The soundtrack was released in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications on July 2, 1997, and the North American version was released by [[Milan Records]] on October 12, 1999.

The titular theme song was performed by [[counter-tenor]] [[Yoshikazu Mera]]. For the English adaptation, [[Sasha Lazard]] sang the song.
During the movie Hisaishi makes use of a few known classical pieces and quotes them, such as Dmitri Shostakovich's 5th symphony.
As with other [[Studio Ghibli]] films, additional albums featuring soundtrack themes in alternative versions have been released. The [[image album]] features early versions of the themes, recorded at the beginning of the film production process, and used as source of inspiration for the various artists involved. The [[Symphony|symphonic suite]] features longer compositions, each encompassing several of the movie themes, performed by the [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by Mario Klemens.
