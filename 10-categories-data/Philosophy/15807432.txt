'''Abstract particulars''' are [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entities which are both [[abstract object]]s and [[particular]]s. 

==Examples==
Individual [[number]]s are often classified as abstract particulars because they are neither concrete objects nor [[universals]] — they are particular things which do not themselves occur in [[spacetime|space or time]]. [[Trope theory|Tropes]] are another example of entities cited as abstract particulars.
