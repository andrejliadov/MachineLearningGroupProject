'''Armchair theorizing''', '''armchair philosophizing''', or '''armchair scholarship''' is an approach to providing new developments in a field that does not involve the collection of new information but, rather, a careful analysis or synthesis of existent scholarship, especially frivolously or superficially so.<ref>See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nadel|1956|p=173}}, who defines ''armchair anthropology''.</ref> 

== Commentary and analysis ==
Different disciplines place different weight on purely theoretical research. Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]] argue that purely theoretical anthropological research is outdated and that [[ethnography|ethnographic fieldwork]] should be a necessary part of anthropological research.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ingold|2007|p=82}}</ref> On the other hand, some commentators argue that [[economic theory|economic theories]] are designed to explain and predict economic phenomena, which requires analysis and synthesis, and not necessarily collection, of data.  [[Leland B. Yeager]] even argues that economists can legitimately extrapolate from their own personal observations to design new theories.  In this sense, Yeager sees armchair theorizing as something better than the "mere sterile juggling of arbitrary assumptions" saying that "it can have a sound empirical basis."<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_60/ai_82469376/pg_9 Henry George and Austrian economics - History of Thought], ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', Dec, 2001  by [[Leland B. Yeager]]</ref>
 
While armchair scholarship contrasts with the [[scientific method]], which inherently involves the active investigation of the nature through data collection, armchair philosophers and theorizers can assist in formulating theories that explain observations; these theories can then be tested with further scientific investigation. While the methods of the armchair philosopher are different from those of the scientist, they can complement each other to produce new insights and discover necessary truths, whether they are empirical or theoretical.
