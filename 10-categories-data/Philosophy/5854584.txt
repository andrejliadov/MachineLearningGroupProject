'''Richard Ithamar Aaron''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FBA}} (6 November 1901 – 29 March 1987) was a Welsh philosopher who became an authority on the work of [[John Locke]]. He also wrote a history of philosophy in the Welsh language.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Seven Sisters, Wales|Blaendulais]], [[Glamorgan]], Aaron was the son of a Welsh Baptist draper, William Aaron, and his wife, Margaret Griffith. He was educated at [[Ystalyfera]] [[Grammar School]], followed by a spell at the [[University of Wales]] starting in 1918, where he studied history and philosophy. In 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the university, allowing him to attend [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he was awarded a DPhil in 1928 for a [[dissertation]] entitled "The History and Value of the Distinction between Intellect and Intuition".<ref name="BioDict20CPhil">{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |last1=Brown |first1=Stuart C. |last2=Collinson |first2=Diané |last3=Wilkinson |first3=Robert |year= 1996 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-06043-1 |page=1 }}</ref>

==Career==
In 1926 Aaron was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at [[Swansea University]].<ref name="BioDict20CPhil" /> After the retirement of W. Jenkin Jones in 1932, Aaron was appointed to the chair of philosophy at [[Aberystwyth University]] where he settled, initially on the nearby hill of Bryn Hir and later at [[Garth Celyn]].

Although his early publications focused on [[epistemology]] and the history of ideas, Aaron became fascinated with the work and life of [[John Locke]]. The interest was sparked by his discovery of unexamined information in the Lovelace Collection: a collection of notes and drafts left by John Locke to his cousin [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Peter King]]. There he found letters, notebooks, catalogues, and most pertinent of all, an early draft of Locke's "[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]", hitherto presumed missing. Aaron's research led to the 1937 publication of a book covering the life and work of Locke, which subsequently became the accepted standard work on the subject.<ref>{{cite ODNB |id=65645 |title=Aaron, Richard Ithamar (1901–1987) |last=Jones |first=O. R.}}</ref> The proofs were read by Rhiannon Morgan, whom Aaron married in 1937. They had five children. 
 
Aaron produced several more books and articles, including a book in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] on the [[history of philosophy]], ''Hanes athroniaeth—o [[Descartes]] i [[Hegel]]'' in 1932. He attempted to boost interest in philosophy in Wales, and established a philosophy section at the University of Wales Guild of Graduates in 1932, a society which still conducts all its proceedings in Welsh.

Other notable publications of Aaron's include an essay, "Two Senses of the Word Universal" (published in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' in 1939) and "Our Knowledge of Universals", a study read to the [[British Academy]] in 1945 and published in volume 23 of its ''[[Proceedings of the British Academy|Proceedings]]''. Aaron's work shows fascination with the idea of a [[Universal (metaphysics)|Universal]], which culminated in a 1952 book ''The Theory of Universals''. Here he attacks the notion of universals as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], but is equally critical of [[Aristotle's theory of universals|Aristotelian]] realism about [[essences]], as he is of [[nominalism]] and [[conceptualism]] as theories of universals.

In 1952–1953, Aaron was invited to be Visiting Professor at [[Yale University]]. In 1956 he was able to study the third draft of Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' at the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]], which resulted in a substantial addition to the second edition of ''John Locke'', published in 1955. He was made a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) and President of the [[Mind Association]] in the same year. In 1956 an annual lecture hosted by the [[Aristotelian Society]] and the Mind Association (who published the journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'') was instituted in [[Aberystwyth]], and Aaron was invited to give the inaugural lecture. In 1957 he was elected President of the Aristotelian Society.

In 1967 Aaron published a second edition of ''The Theory of Universals'', with a new preface and several additions and rewritten chapters. In 1971, he published a third edition of his Locke biography and the book ''Knowing and the Function of Reason'', which includes a broad discussion of the laws of [[Law of noncontradiction|non-contradiction]], [[Law of excluded middle|excluded middle]] and [[Law of identity|identity]], of the use of language in speech and thought, and of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[causality]].

After retiring in 1969, he taught for a semester at [[Carlton College]] in [[Minnesota]] before returning to Wales, where he. helped write articles for the 1974 edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. He began to feel the effects of [[Alzheimer's disease]], and died at his home on 29 March 1987.

Richard Aaron was the father of the academic and Welsh literature specialist [[Jane Aaron (educator)|Jane Aaron]], born in 1951.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2003-16419/ Retrieved 11 March 2019.]</ref>
