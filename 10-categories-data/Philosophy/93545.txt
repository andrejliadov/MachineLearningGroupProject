A '''structure''' is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or [[system]], or the object or system so organized.<ref name=OED>{{cite encyclopedia |title=structure, n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=Online |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/191895?rskey=pTgPk1&amp;result=1|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref> Material structures include man-made objects such as [[building]]s and [[machine]]s and natural objects such as [[organism|biological organisms]], [[mineral]]s and [[chemical substance|chemicals]]. Abstract structures include [[data structure]]s in [[computer science]] and [[musical form]]. Types of structure include a [[hierarchy]] (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a [[Complex network|network]] featuring many-to-many [[Link (geometry)|link]]s, or a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.

[[Building]]s, [[aircraft]], [[skeleton]]s, [[Ant colony|anthills]], [[beaver dam]]s, [[bridge]]s and [[salt dome]]s are all examples of [[Structural load|load]]-bearing structures. The results of [[construction]] are divided into [[building]]s and [[nonbuilding structure|non-building structure]]s, and make up the [[infrastructure]] of a human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into [[Structural engineering#Specializations|categories]] including building structures, [[architectural structure]]s, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.

The effects of loads on physical structures are determined through [[structural analysis]], which is one of the tasks of [[structural engineering]]. The [[Structural engineering#Structural elements|structural elements]] can be classified as one-dimensional ([[rope]]s, [[strut]]s, [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[arch]]es), two-dimensional ([[membrane]]s, plates, [[Concrete slab|slab]], [[Shell (structure)|shells]], [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]]), or three-dimensional (solid masses).<ref name=Carpinter>{{cite book|last1=Carpinteri|first1=Alberto|title=Structural Mechanics: A unified approach|date=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203474952}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The latter was the main option available to early structures such as [[Chichen Itza]]. A one-dimensional element has one dimension much larger than the other two, so the other dimensions can be neglected in calculations; however, the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition can determine the [[Flexural rigidity|flexural]] and [[Compressive strength|compressive]] stiffness of the element. Two-dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can resist biaxial traction.<ref name=Carpinter/>{{rp|2–3}}

The structure elements are combined in ''structural systems''. The majority of everyday load-bearing structures are ''section-active'' structures like frames, which are primarily composed of one-dimensional (bending) structures. Other types are ''Vector-active'' structures such as [[truss]]es, ''surface-active'' structures such as shells and folded plates, ''form-active'' structures such as cable or membrane structures, and hybrid structures.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Knippers|first1=Jan|last2=Cremers|first2=Jan|last3=Gabler|first3=Markus|last4=Lienhard|first4=Julian|title=Construction manual for polymers + membranes : materials, semi-finished products, form-finding design|date=2011|publisher=Institut für internationale Architektur-Dokumentation|location=München|isbn=9783034614702|edition=Engl. transl. of the 1.

Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing biominerals and [[protein]]s, at the bottom of which are [[collagen|collagen fibrils]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Z.|last2=Zhang|first2=Y.-W.|last3=Gao|first3=H.|title=On optimal hierarchy of load-bearing biological materials|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=1 September 2010|volume=278|issue=1705|pages=519–525|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1093|pmid=20810437|pmc=3025673}}</ref>

{{Main|Biological organisation}}

In [[biology]], structures exist at all levels of organization, ranging hierarchically from the [[atom]]ic and [[molecular]] to the [[cell (biology)|cellular]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[organism]]ic, [[population]] and [[ecosystem]] level. Usually, a higher-level structure is composed of multiple copies of a lower-level structure.

[[Structural biology]] is concerned with the [[biomolecular structure]] of [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Banaszak|first1=Leonard J.|title=Foundations of Structural Biology.|date=2000|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080521848}}</ref> The function of these molecules is determined by their shape as well as their composition, and their structure has multiple levels. [[Protein structure]] has a four-level hierarchy. The ''[[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]'' is the sequence of [[amino acid]]s that make it up. It has a [[peptide]] backbone made up of a repeated sequence of a nitrogen and two carbon atoms. The ''[[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]]'' consists of repeated patterns determined by [[hydrogen bonding]]. The two basic types are the [[alpha helix|α-helix]] and the [[beta sheet|β-pleated sheet]]. The ''[[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]]'' is a back and forth bending of the polypeptide chain, and the ''[[Protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]'' is the way that tertiary units come together and interact.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=William K.|last2=Sadava|first2=David E.|last3=Orians|first3=Gordon H.|last4=H.

[[File:Dopamin - Dopamine.svg|thumb|right|A skeletal formula for [[dopamine]]]]
Chemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure. The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called [[structural formula]]s. [[Lewis structure]]s use a dot notation to represent the [[valence electron]]s for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the atom in chemical reactions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=DeKock|first1=Roger L.|last2=Gray|first2=Harry B.|title=Chemical structure and bonding|date=1989|publisher=University Science Books|location=Mill Valley, Calif.|isbn=9780935702613|edition=2nd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780935702613}}</ref>{{rp|71–72}} Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared.

Atoms in a crystal have a [[crystal structure|structure]] that involves repetition of a basic unit called a ''unit cell''. The atoms can be modeled as points on a [[Bravais lattice|lattice]], and one can explore the effect of [[symmetry]] operations that include rotations about a point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and ''[[translation (geometry)|translations]]'' (movements of all the points by the same amount). Each crystal has a finite group, called the [[space group]], of such operations that map it onto itself; there are 230 possible space groups.<ref name=Ashcroft>{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=Neil W.|last2=Mermin|first2=N.

== Social ==
{{Main|Social structure}}

A social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social [[organization]]s of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group.<ref name="Lopez">{{cite book |last1=Lopez |first1=J. |last2=Scott |first2=J. |title=Social Structure |date=2000 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham and Philadelphia |isbn=9780335204960 |oclc=43708597}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. [[Structure and agency]] are two confronted theories about human behaviour.  The debate surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of the central issues in sociology. In this context, ''agency'' refers to the individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. ''Structure'' here refers to factors such as [[social class]], [[religion]], [[gender]], [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.

== Data ==

In software architecture, the structure of software is the way in which it is partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one component without requiring changes in others.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gorton|first1=Ian|title=Essential software architecture|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783642191763|edition=2nd}}</ref>{{rp|3}} The structure can be represented in diagrams such as the [[Control Structure Diagram]] and the [[Nassi–Shneiderman diagram]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diehl|first1=Stephan|title=Software visualization : visualizing the structure, behaviour, and evolution of software ; with 5 tables|url=https://archive.org/details/softwarevisualiz00dieh_179|url-access=limited|date=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540465041|pages=[https://archive.org/details/softwarevisualiz00dieh_179/page/n45 38]–47}}</ref> Structural elements reflect the requirements of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance, then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has backups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bernardi|first1=Simona|last2=Merseguer|first2=José|last3=Petriu|first3=Dorina Corina|title=Model-Driven Dependability Assessment of Software Systems|date=2013|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642395123|pages=46–47}}</ref> A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several systems in the [[Space Shuttle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System|url=https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch4-4.html|website=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>

== Logical ==
As a branch of philosophy, [[logic]] is concerned with distinguishing good arguments from poor ones. A chief concern is with the structure of arguments.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Structure of Arguments|url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/structure.html|website=Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic|publisher=philosophy.lander.edu|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> An argument consists of one or more [[premise]]s from which a conclusion is [[inference|inferred]].<ref name=Kemerling>{{cite web|last1=Kemerling|first1=Garth|title=Arguments and Inference|url=http://www.philosophypages.com/lg/e01.htm|website=The Philosophy Pages|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> The steps in this inference can be expressed in a formal way and their structure analyzed. Two basic types of inference are [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. In a [[Validity (logic)|valid]] deduction, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, regardless of whether they are true or not. An invalid deduction contains some error in the analysis. An inductive argument claims that if the premises are true, the conclusion is likely.<ref name=Kemerling/>
