'''Aristotelianism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|l|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|ARR|i|stə|TEE|lee|ə|niz|əm}}) is a [[Tradition#Philosophy|tradition]] of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle was a prolific writer whose works cover many subjects including [[physics]], [[biology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[government]]. Any school of thought that takes one of Aristotle's distinctive positions as its starting point can be considered "Aristotelian" in the widest sense. This means that different Aristotelian theories (e.g. in ethics or in [[ontology]]) may not have much in common as far as their actual content is concerned besides their shared reference to Aristotle.

In Aristotle's time, philosophy included [[natural philosophy]], which preceded the advent of [[modern science]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the [[Peripatetic school]] and later on by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], who produced many [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotle's writings]]. In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] translated the works of Aristotle into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and under them, along with philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Al-Farabi]], Aristotelianism became a major part of [[early Islamic philosophy]].

[[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' on it and that became the basis of Jewish [[scholastic philosophy]]. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to [[western Europe]], it was not until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] and the rise of [[scholasticism]] that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with [[Catholic theology]].

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality. However, this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. 

Recent Aristotelian ethical and "practical" philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. Especially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]'', MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices.

==History==

===Ancient Greek===
{{Main|Peripatetic school}}
The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the [[Peripatetic school]]. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]], who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the [[Roman era]], the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.<ref>Furley, David (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy'', 2, Routledge</ref> The most important figure in this regard was [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of [[Neoplatonism]] in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end. Still, the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system and produced many [[commentaries on Aristotle]].

===Byzantine Empire<!--'Byzantine Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
'''Byzantine Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> emerged in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by [[Themistius]] in the mid-4th century, revived by [[Michael Psellos]] in the mid-11th century, and further developed by [[Sophonias (commentator)|Sophonias]] in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.<ref name=sep-byz>{{cite SEP |url-id=byzantine-philosophy |title=Byzantine Philosophy |last=Ierodiakonou |first=Katerina |last2=Bydén |first2=Börje}}</ref>

[[Leo the Mathematician]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[Magnaura School]] in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess [[Anna Comnena]] who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.<ref name=sep-byz/>

===Islamic world<!--'Islamic Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|A medieval Arabic representation of [[Aristotle]] teaching a student.]]
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed.<ref name="Wiet-Baghdad">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html|first=Gaston |last=Wiet|author-link=Gaston Wiet|title=''Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate|access-date= 2010-04-16}}</ref> Under the [[caliphs]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[Al-Ma'mun]], the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] flourished. Christian scholar [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic.<ref name="Opth">Opth: Azmi, Khurshid.

The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago]], 2007. Print.</ref>

With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', ''[[Magna Moralia]]'' and ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'') became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for '''Islamic Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>Manfred Landfester, Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (eds.), ''Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical tradition'', Volume 1, Brill, 2006, p. 273.</ref>

[[Al-Kindi]] (801–873) was the first of the Muslim [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosophers and is known for his efforts to introduce [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] to the [[Arab world]].<ref>Klein-Frank, F. ''Al-Kindi''. In Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge. p 165</ref> He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.<ref>Felix Klein-Frank (2001) ''Al-Kindi'', pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman & Hossein Nasr. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge.</ref>

The philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of "the Second Teacher"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and [[Sufism]], paved the way for the work of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/| title =Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (c.980–1037)| access-date =2007-07-13 | publisher =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle.<ref name="Avicenna Abu Ali Sina">{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |title=Avicenna (Abu Ali Sina) |publisher=Sjsu.edu |access-date=2010-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184611/http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |archive-date=11 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The school of thought he founded became known as [[Avicennism]], which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |access-date=2010-04-14|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-iv}}</ref>

At the western end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], during the reign of [[Al-Hakam II]] (961 to 976) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and [[Seville]], was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.<ref name="grant30">Edward Grant, (1996), ''The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages'', page 30. Cambridge University Press</ref> Although his writings had an only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the [[Latin West]],<ref name="grant30"/> and would lead to the school of thought known as [[Averroism]].

===Western Europe===
{{also|Scholasticism|Thomism}}
[[File:Aristotle by Raphael.jpg|thumb|Aristotle, holding his Ethics detail from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] fresco [[The School of Athens]]]]
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century, nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of [[Boethius]]'s commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Martianus Capella]].<ref name="schmolders">Auguste Schmolders, ''History of Arabian Philosophy'' in ''The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art'', Volume 46. February 1859</ref> From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.<ref name="schmolders"/>

The [[renaissance of the 12th century]] saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. [[James of Venice]], who probably spent some years in [[Constantinople]], translated Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' from Greek into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the mid-twelfth century,<ref>L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars,'' Oxford, 1974, p. 106.</ref> thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the ''Organon'', available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central [[Spain]], which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. The most productive of these translators was [[Gerard of Cremona]],<ref>C. H. Haskins, ''Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,'' p. 287. "more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way."</ref> (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,<ref>For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century," ''Science in Context'', 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281.</ref> which included many of the works of [[Aristotle]] such as his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''. [[Michael Scot]] (c. 1175–1232) translated  [[Averroes]]' commentaries on the scientific works of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{BBKL|m/michael_sco|band=5|autor=Christoph Kann|artikel=Michael Scotus|spalten=1459–1461}}</ref>

Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly. At a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for [[heterodoxy]] in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].<ref name="schmolders"/> In the first of these, in [[Paris]] in 1210, it was stated that "neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of [[ex-communication]]."<ref name="Grant42">Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press</ref> However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270, the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E. ''Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages'', page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</ref>

[[William of Moerbeke]] (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the ''Alexandrian'' Aristotelianism of Averroes followed "the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional [[Neoplatonism]] was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism".<ref name="Schmolders1842">{{cite book |last=Schmölders |first=Auguste |editor1-last=Telford |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Barber |editor2-first=Benjamin Aquila |editor3-last=Watkinson |editor3-first=William Lonsdale |editor4-last=Davison |editor-first4=William Theophilus |title=The London Quarterly Review |volume=11 |year=1859 |publisher=J.A.

In no material point did they differ from their master, and, therefore, an exposition of their doctrines would be useless to those who know anything of the history of philosophy; but, before the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, a large amount of traditional Neo-Platonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism, so as to take them sometimes far astray from their master's track.}}</ref>

[[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him.<ref name="sep-albert">{{cite SEP |url-id=albert-great |title=Albert the Great |last=Führer |first=Markus}}</ref> He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.<ref name="sep-albert"/> Magnus did not repudiate [[Plato]]. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the "concordist tradition",<ref>Henricus Bate, Helmut Boese, Carlos Steel, ''On Platonic Philosophy'', Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1990, p. xvi.</ref> which sought to harmonize [[Aristotle]] with [[Plato]] through interpretation (see for example [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School''). Magnus famously wrote:

{{quote |''"Scias quod non perficitur homo in philosophia nisi ex scientia duarum philosophiarum: Aristotelis et Platonis."'' (''Metaphysics'', I, tr. 5, c. 5)
(Know that a man is not perfected in philosophy if it weren't for the knowledge of the two philosophers, Aristotle and Plato)}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle.<ref name="sep-thomas">{{cite SEP |url-id=aquinas |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |last=McInerny |first=Ralph}}</ref> Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his [[Aristotelian ethics|moral philosophy]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/> The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as [[Thomism]], and was especially influential among the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and later, the [[Jesuits]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/>

Using Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as [[Marsilius of Padua|Marsilius of Padua's]] ''[[Defensor pacis]]'', 14th-century scholar [[Nicole Oresme]] translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensively [[Livre de Politiques|comments]] on them.

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as un-Aristotelian,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]].<ref>For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'', Although many disagree Rowman & Littlefield, 1992.</ref> [[Postmodernists]], in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.<ref>For example, Ted Sadler, ''Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being'', Athlone, 1996.</ref> In this, they follow [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

==Contemporary==
===Ethics===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.<ref>For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy]]'' (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'', Cornell University Press, 2005.</ref> Recent [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethical]] and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Mortimer J. Adler]] described Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] as a "unique book in the Western tradition of moral philosophy, the only ethics that is sound, practical, and undogmatic."<ref>[[Mortimer J. Adler|Adler, Mortimer]] ''Ten Philosophical Mistakes: [[Basic Errors in Modern Thought]]: How They Came About, Their Consequences, and How to Avoid Them.''(1985) {{ISBN|0-02-500330-5}}, p.196</ref>

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is specially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]''. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Nietzsche]]—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize [[capitalism]]. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one."<ref>Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'', Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264.</ref> Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical, and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Polity Press, 2007.</ref> Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include [[Fred D. Miller, Jr.]]<ref>Fred D. Miller, Jr., ''Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref> in politics and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in ethics.<ref>Rosalind Hursthouse, ''On Virtue Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref>

===Ontology===
Neo-Aristotelianism in [[meta-ontology]] holds that the goal of [[ontology]] is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them.<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite book |author=[[Jonathan Schaffer]] |chapter=On What Grounds What Metametaphysics |title=Metametaphysics |chapter-url=http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/grounds.pdf |editor=Chalmers |editor2=Manley |editor3=Wasserman |isbn=978-0199546046 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |pages=347–83 }}</ref> The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of [[Grounding (metaphysics)|metaphysical grounding]]. Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities.<ref name=Schaffer/> For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects.

These ideas go back to Aristotle's thesis that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, [[Substance_theory#Aristotle|substances]] have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=S. Marc |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref>

Jonathan Schaffer's priority monism is a recent form of neo-Aristotelian ontology. He holds that there exists only one thing on the most fundamental level: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaffer |first1=Jonathan |title=Monism: The Priority of the Whole |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 2010 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=31–76 |doi=10.1215/00318108-2009-025 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/119/1/31/2871/Monism-The-Priority-of-the-Whole |language=en |issn=0031-8108}}</ref>

===Problem of universals===
The [[problem of universals]] is the problem of whether and in which way [[universals]] exist. Aristotelians and [[Platonic realism|Platonists]] are in agreement that universals have actual, mind-independent existence. They, therefore, oppose the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] standpoint. Aristotelians disagree with Platonists about the mode of existence of universals. Platonists hold that universals exist in some form of "Platonic heaven" and therefore exist independently of their instances in the concrete spatiotemporal world. Aristotelians, on the other hand, deny the existence of universals outside the spatiotemporal world. This view is known as immanent realism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balaguer |first1=Mark |title=Platonism in Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2016}}</ref> For example, the universal "red" only exist insofar as there are red objects in the concrete world. There would be no red-universal if there were no red objects.

David Armstrong is a contemporary defender of Aristotelianism concerning the problem of universals. States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology. States of affairs have particulars and universals as their constituents. Armstrong is an immanent realist in the sense that he holds that a universal exists only insofar as it is a constituent of at least one actual state of affairs. Universals without instances are not part of the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=D. M. |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-161542-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGb-Jwp1x8UC |language=en |chapter=4.

'''Aristotelianism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|l|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|ARR|i|stə|TEE|lee|ə|niz|əm}}) is a [[Tradition#Philosophy|tradition]] of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle was a prolific writer whose works cover many subjects including [[physics]], [[biology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[government]]. Any school of thought that takes one of Aristotle's distinctive positions as its starting point can be considered "Aristotelian" in the widest sense. This means that different Aristotelian theories (e.g. in ethics or in [[ontology]]) may not have much in common as far as their actual content is concerned besides their shared reference to Aristotle.

In Aristotle's time, philosophy included [[natural philosophy]], which preceded the advent of [[modern science]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the [[Peripatetic school]] and later on by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], who produced many [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotle's writings]]. In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] translated the works of Aristotle into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and under them, along with philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Al-Farabi]], Aristotelianism became a major part of [[early Islamic philosophy]].

[[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' on it and that became the basis of Jewish [[scholastic philosophy]]. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to [[western Europe]], it was not until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] and the rise of [[scholasticism]] that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with [[Catholic theology]].

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality. However, this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. 

Recent Aristotelian ethical and "practical" philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. Especially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]'', MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices.

==History==

===Ancient Greek===
{{Main|Peripatetic school}}
The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the [[Peripatetic school]]. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]], who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the [[Roman era]], the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.<ref>Furley, David (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy'', 2, Routledge</ref> The most important figure in this regard was [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of [[Neoplatonism]] in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end. Still, the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system and produced many [[commentaries on Aristotle]].

===Byzantine Empire<!--'Byzantine Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
'''Byzantine Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> emerged in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by [[Themistius]] in the mid-4th century, revived by [[Michael Psellos]] in the mid-11th century, and further developed by [[Sophonias (commentator)|Sophonias]] in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.<ref name=sep-byz>{{cite SEP |url-id=byzantine-philosophy |title=Byzantine Philosophy |last=Ierodiakonou |first=Katerina |last2=Bydén |first2=Börje}}</ref>

[[Leo the Mathematician]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[Magnaura School]] in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess [[Anna Comnena]] who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.<ref name=sep-byz/>

===Islamic world<!--'Islamic Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|A medieval Arabic representation of [[Aristotle]] teaching a student.]]
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed.<ref name="Wiet-Baghdad">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html|first=Gaston |last=Wiet|author-link=Gaston Wiet|title=''Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate|access-date= 2010-04-16}}</ref> Under the [[caliphs]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[Al-Ma'mun]], the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] flourished. Christian scholar [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic.<ref name="Opth">Opth: Azmi, Khurshid.

The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago]], 2007. Print.</ref>

With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', ''[[Magna Moralia]]'' and ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'') became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for '''Islamic Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>Manfred Landfester, Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (eds.), ''Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical tradition'', Volume 1, Brill, 2006, p. 273.</ref>

[[Al-Kindi]] (801–873) was the first of the Muslim [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosophers and is known for his efforts to introduce [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] to the [[Arab world]].<ref>Klein-Frank, F. ''Al-Kindi''. In Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge. p 165</ref> He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.<ref>Felix Klein-Frank (2001) ''Al-Kindi'', pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman & Hossein Nasr. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge.</ref>

The philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of "the Second Teacher"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and [[Sufism]], paved the way for the work of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/| title =Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (c.980–1037)| access-date =2007-07-13 | publisher =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle.<ref name="Avicenna Abu Ali Sina">{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |title=Avicenna (Abu Ali Sina) |publisher=Sjsu.edu |access-date=2010-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184611/http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |archive-date=11 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The school of thought he founded became known as [[Avicennism]], which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |access-date=2010-04-14|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-iv}}</ref>

At the western end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], during the reign of [[Al-Hakam II]] (961 to 976) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and [[Seville]], was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.<ref name="grant30">Edward Grant, (1996), ''The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages'', page 30. Cambridge University Press</ref> Although his writings had an only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the [[Latin West]],<ref name="grant30"/> and would lead to the school of thought known as [[Averroism]].

===Western Europe===
{{also|Scholasticism|Thomism}}
[[File:Aristotle by Raphael.jpg|thumb|Aristotle, holding his Ethics detail from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] fresco [[The School of Athens]]]]
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century, nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of [[Boethius]]'s commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Martianus Capella]].<ref name="schmolders">Auguste Schmolders, ''History of Arabian Philosophy'' in ''The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art'', Volume 46. February 1859</ref> From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.<ref name="schmolders"/>

The [[renaissance of the 12th century]] saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. [[James of Venice]], who probably spent some years in [[Constantinople]], translated Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' from Greek into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the mid-twelfth century,<ref>L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars,'' Oxford, 1974, p. 106.</ref> thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the ''Organon'', available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central [[Spain]], which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. The most productive of these translators was [[Gerard of Cremona]],<ref>C. H. Haskins, ''Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,'' p. 287. "more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way."</ref> (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,<ref>For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century," ''Science in Context'', 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281.</ref> which included many of the works of [[Aristotle]] such as his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''. [[Michael Scot]] (c. 1175–1232) translated  [[Averroes]]' commentaries on the scientific works of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{BBKL|m/michael_sco|band=5|autor=Christoph Kann|artikel=Michael Scotus|spalten=1459–1461}}</ref>

Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly. At a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for [[heterodoxy]] in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].<ref name="schmolders"/> In the first of these, in [[Paris]] in 1210, it was stated that "neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of [[ex-communication]]."<ref name="Grant42">Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press</ref> However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270, the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E. ''Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages'', page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</ref>

[[William of Moerbeke]] (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the ''Alexandrian'' Aristotelianism of Averroes followed "the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional [[Neoplatonism]] was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism".<ref name="Schmolders1842">{{cite book |last=Schmölders |first=Auguste |editor1-last=Telford |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Barber |editor2-first=Benjamin Aquila |editor3-last=Watkinson |editor3-first=William Lonsdale |editor4-last=Davison |editor-first4=William Theophilus |title=The London Quarterly Review |volume=11 |year=1859 |publisher=J.A.

In no material point did they differ from their master, and, therefore, an exposition of their doctrines would be useless to those who know anything of the history of philosophy; but, before the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, a large amount of traditional Neo-Platonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism, so as to take them sometimes far astray from their master's track.}}</ref>

[[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him.<ref name="sep-albert">{{cite SEP |url-id=albert-great |title=Albert the Great |last=Führer |first=Markus}}</ref> He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.<ref name="sep-albert"/> Magnus did not repudiate [[Plato]]. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the "concordist tradition",<ref>Henricus Bate, Helmut Boese, Carlos Steel, ''On Platonic Philosophy'', Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1990, p. xvi.</ref> which sought to harmonize [[Aristotle]] with [[Plato]] through interpretation (see for example [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School''). Magnus famously wrote:

{{quote |''"Scias quod non perficitur homo in philosophia nisi ex scientia duarum philosophiarum: Aristotelis et Platonis."'' (''Metaphysics'', I, tr. 5, c. 5)
(Know that a man is not perfected in philosophy if it weren't for the knowledge of the two philosophers, Aristotle and Plato)}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle.<ref name="sep-thomas">{{cite SEP |url-id=aquinas |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |last=McInerny |first=Ralph}}</ref> Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his [[Aristotelian ethics|moral philosophy]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/> The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as [[Thomism]], and was especially influential among the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and later, the [[Jesuits]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/>

Using Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as [[Marsilius of Padua|Marsilius of Padua's]] ''[[Defensor pacis]]'', 14th-century scholar [[Nicole Oresme]] translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensively [[Livre de Politiques|comments]] on them.

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as un-Aristotelian,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]].<ref>For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'', Although many disagree Rowman & Littlefield, 1992.</ref> [[Postmodernists]], in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.<ref>For example, Ted Sadler, ''Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being'', Athlone, 1996.</ref> In this, they follow [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

==Contemporary==
===Ethics===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.<ref>For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy]]'' (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'', Cornell University Press, 2005.</ref> Recent [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethical]] and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Mortimer J. Adler]] described Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] as a "unique book in the Western tradition of moral philosophy, the only ethics that is sound, practical, and undogmatic."<ref>[[Mortimer J. Adler|Adler, Mortimer]] ''Ten Philosophical Mistakes: [[Basic Errors in Modern Thought]]: How They Came About, Their Consequences, and How to Avoid Them.''(1985) {{ISBN|0-02-500330-5}}, p.196</ref>

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is specially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]''. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Nietzsche]]—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize [[capitalism]]. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one."<ref>Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'', Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264.</ref> Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical, and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Polity Press, 2007.</ref> Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include [[Fred D. Miller, Jr.]]<ref>Fred D. Miller, Jr., ''Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref> in politics and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in ethics.<ref>Rosalind Hursthouse, ''On Virtue Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref>

===Ontology===
Neo-Aristotelianism in [[meta-ontology]] holds that the goal of [[ontology]] is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them.<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite book |author=[[Jonathan Schaffer]] |chapter=On What Grounds What Metametaphysics |title=Metametaphysics |chapter-url=http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/grounds.pdf |editor=Chalmers |editor2=Manley |editor3=Wasserman |isbn=978-0199546046 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |pages=347–83 }}</ref> The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of [[Grounding (metaphysics)|metaphysical grounding]]. Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities.<ref name=Schaffer/> For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects.

These ideas go back to Aristotle's thesis that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, [[Substance_theory#Aristotle|substances]] have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=S. Marc |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref>

Jonathan Schaffer's priority monism is a recent form of neo-Aristotelian ontology. He holds that there exists only one thing on the most fundamental level: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaffer |first1=Jonathan |title=Monism: The Priority of the Whole |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 2010 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=31–76 |doi=10.1215/00318108-2009-025 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/119/1/31/2871/Monism-The-Priority-of-the-Whole |language=en |issn=0031-8108}}</ref>

===Problem of universals===
The [[problem of universals]] is the problem of whether and in which way [[universals]] exist. Aristotelians and [[Platonic realism|Platonists]] are in agreement that universals have actual, mind-independent existence. They, therefore, oppose the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] standpoint. Aristotelians disagree with Platonists about the mode of existence of universals. Platonists hold that universals exist in some form of "Platonic heaven" and therefore exist independently of their instances in the concrete spatiotemporal world. Aristotelians, on the other hand, deny the existence of universals outside the spatiotemporal world. This view is known as immanent realism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balaguer |first1=Mark |title=Platonism in Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2016}}</ref> For example, the universal "red" only exist insofar as there are red objects in the concrete world. There would be no red-universal if there were no red objects.

David Armstrong is a contemporary defender of Aristotelianism concerning the problem of universals. States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology. States of affairs have particulars and universals as their constituents. Armstrong is an immanent realist in the sense that he holds that a universal exists only insofar as it is a constituent of at least one actual state of affairs. Universals without instances are not part of the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=D. M. |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-161542-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGb-Jwp1x8UC |language=en |chapter=4.

'''Aristotelianism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|t|iː|l|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} {{respell|ARR|i|stə|TEE|lee|ə|niz|əm}}) is a [[Tradition#Philosophy|tradition]] of [[philosophy]] that takes its defining inspiration from the work of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle was a prolific writer whose works cover many subjects including [[physics]], [[biology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and [[government]]. Any school of thought that takes one of Aristotle's distinctive positions as its starting point can be considered "Aristotelian" in the widest sense. This means that different Aristotelian theories (e.g. in ethics or in [[ontology]]) may not have much in common as far as their actual content is concerned besides their shared reference to Aristotle.

In Aristotle's time, philosophy included [[natural philosophy]], which preceded the advent of [[modern science]] during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the [[Peripatetic school]] and later on by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], who produced many [[Commentaries on Aristotle|commentaries on Aristotle's writings]]. In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] translated the works of Aristotle into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and under them, along with philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Al-Farabi]], Aristotelianism became a major part of [[early Islamic philosophy]].

[[Maimonides|Moses Maimonides]] adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' on it and that became the basis of Jewish [[scholastic philosophy]]. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to [[western Europe]], it was not until the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] and the rise of [[scholasticism]] that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with [[Catholic theology]].

After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality. However, this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. 

Recent Aristotelian ethical and "practical" philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.

The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. Especially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]'', MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices.

==History==

===Ancient Greek===
{{Main|Peripatetic school}}
The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the [[Peripatetic school]]. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]], who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the [[Roman era]], the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.<ref>Furley, David (2003), ''From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy'', 2, Routledge</ref> The most important figure in this regard was [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of [[Neoplatonism]] in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end. Still, the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system and produced many [[commentaries on Aristotle]].

===Byzantine Empire<!--'Byzantine Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
'''Byzantine Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> emerged in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by [[Themistius]] in the mid-4th century, revived by [[Michael Psellos]] in the mid-11th century, and further developed by [[Sophonias (commentator)|Sophonias]] in the late 13th to early 14th centuries.<ref name=sep-byz>{{cite SEP |url-id=byzantine-philosophy |title=Byzantine Philosophy |last=Ierodiakonou |first=Katerina |last2=Bydén |first2=Börje}}</ref>

[[Leo the Mathematician]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[Magnaura School]] in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic.<ref name=sep-byz/> However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess [[Anna Comnena]] who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle.<ref name=sep-byz/>

===Islamic world<!--'Islamic Aristotelianism' redirects here-->===
[[Image:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|A medieval Arabic representation of [[Aristotle]] teaching a student.]]
In the [[Abbasid Empire]], many foreign works were translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed.<ref name="Wiet-Baghdad">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/wiet.html|first=Gaston |last=Wiet|author-link=Gaston Wiet|title=''Baghdad: Metropolis of the Abbasid Caliphate|access-date= 2010-04-16}}</ref> Under the [[caliphs]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] and his son [[Al-Ma'mun]], the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] flourished. Christian scholar [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic.<ref name="Opth">Opth: Azmi, Khurshid.

The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago]], 2007. Print.</ref>

With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', ''[[Magna Moralia]]'' and ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'') became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for '''Islamic Aristotelianism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>Manfred Landfester, Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (eds.), ''Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical tradition'', Volume 1, Brill, 2006, p. 273.</ref>

[[Al-Kindi]] (801–873) was the first of the Muslim [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosophers and is known for his efforts to introduce [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] to the [[Arab world]].<ref>Klein-Frank, F. ''Al-Kindi''. In Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge. p 165</ref> He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.<ref>Felix Klein-Frank (2001) ''Al-Kindi'', pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman & Hossein Nasr. ''History of Islamic Philosophy''. London: Routledge.</ref>

The philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of "the Second Teacher"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and [[Sufism]], paved the way for the work of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037).<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/| title =Avicenna (Ibn Sina) (c.980–1037)| access-date =2007-07-13 | publisher =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle.<ref name="Avicenna Abu Ali Sina">{{cite web |url=http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |title=Avicenna (Abu Ali Sina) |publisher=Sjsu.edu |access-date=2010-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111184611/http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/avicen.html |archive-date=11 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The school of thought he founded became known as [[Avicennism]], which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Avicenna | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |access-date=2010-04-14|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avicenna-iv}}</ref>

At the western end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], during the reign of [[Al-Hakam II]] (961 to 976) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. [[Averroes]] (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and [[Seville]], was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.<ref name="grant30">Edward Grant, (1996), ''The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages'', page 30. Cambridge University Press</ref> Although his writings had an only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the [[Latin West]],<ref name="grant30"/> and would lead to the school of thought known as [[Averroism]].

===Western Europe===
{{also|Scholasticism|Thomism}}
[[File:Aristotle by Raphael.jpg|thumb|Aristotle, holding his Ethics detail from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] fresco [[The School of Athens]]]]
Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century, nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of [[Boethius]]'s commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]'', and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Martianus Capella]].<ref name="schmolders">Auguste Schmolders, ''History of Arabian Philosophy'' in ''The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art'', Volume 46. February 1859</ref> From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge.<ref name="schmolders"/>

The [[renaissance of the 12th century]] saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. [[James of Venice]], who probably spent some years in [[Constantinople]], translated Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' from Greek into [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] in the mid-twelfth century,<ref>L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars,'' Oxford, 1974, p. 106.</ref> thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the ''Organon'', available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central [[Spain]], which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]]. The most productive of these translators was [[Gerard of Cremona]],<ref>C. H. Haskins, ''Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,'' p. 287. "more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way."</ref> (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,<ref>For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century," ''Science in Context'', 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281.</ref> which included many of the works of [[Aristotle]] such as his ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''. [[Michael Scot]] (c. 1175–1232) translated  [[Averroes]]' commentaries on the scientific works of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{BBKL|m/michael_sco|band=5|autor=Christoph Kann|artikel=Michael Scotus|spalten=1459–1461}}</ref>

Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly. At a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for [[heterodoxy]] in the [[Condemnations of 1210–1277]].<ref name="schmolders"/> In the first of these, in [[Paris]] in 1210, it was stated that "neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of [[ex-communication]]."<ref name="Grant42">Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press</ref> However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270, the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.<ref>Rubenstein, Richard E. ''Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages'', page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</ref>

[[William of Moerbeke]] (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the ''Alexandrian'' Aristotelianism of Averroes followed "the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional [[Neoplatonism]] was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism".<ref name="Schmolders1842">{{cite book |last=Schmölders |first=Auguste |editor1-last=Telford |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Barber |editor2-first=Benjamin Aquila |editor3-last=Watkinson |editor3-first=William Lonsdale |editor4-last=Davison |editor-first4=William Theophilus |title=The London Quarterly Review |volume=11 |year=1859 |publisher=J.A.

In no material point did they differ from their master, and, therefore, an exposition of their doctrines would be useless to those who know anything of the history of philosophy; but, before the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, a large amount of traditional Neo-Platonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism, so as to take them sometimes far astray from their master's track.}}</ref>

[[Albertus Magnus]] (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him.<ref name="sep-albert">{{cite SEP |url-id=albert-great |title=Albert the Great |last=Führer |first=Markus}}</ref> He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.<ref name="sep-albert"/> Magnus did not repudiate [[Plato]]. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the "concordist tradition",<ref>Henricus Bate, Helmut Boese, Carlos Steel, ''On Platonic Philosophy'', Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1990, p. xvi.</ref> which sought to harmonize [[Aristotle]] with [[Plato]] through interpretation (see for example [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School''). Magnus famously wrote:

{{quote |''"Scias quod non perficitur homo in philosophia nisi ex scientia duarum philosophiarum: Aristotelis et Platonis."'' (''Metaphysics'', I, tr. 5, c. 5)
(Know that a man is not perfected in philosophy if it weren't for the knowledge of the two philosophers, Aristotle and Plato)}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle.<ref name="sep-thomas">{{cite SEP |url-id=aquinas |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |last=McInerny |first=Ralph}}</ref> Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his [[Aristotelian ethics|moral philosophy]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/> The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as [[Thomism]], and was especially influential among the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and later, the [[Jesuits]].<ref name="sep-thomas"/>

Using Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as [[Marsilius of Padua|Marsilius of Padua's]] ''[[Defensor pacis]]'', 14th-century scholar [[Nicole Oresme]] translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensively [[Livre de Politiques|comments]] on them.

===Modern era===
After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of [[teleology]] was transmitted through [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who applied it to history as a totality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Although this project was criticized by [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Trendelenburg]] and [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] as un-Aristotelian,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon [[Karl Marx|Marx]].<ref>For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'', Although many disagree Rowman & Littlefield, 1992.</ref> [[Postmodernists]], in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.<ref>For example, Ted Sadler, ''Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being'', Athlone, 1996.</ref> In this, they follow [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy.

==Contemporary==
===Ethics===
Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.<ref>For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy]]'' (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, ''Aristotle and Other Platonists'', Cornell University Press, 2005.</ref> Recent [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian ethical]] and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]] and [[John McDowell|McDowell]], is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political [[republicanism]], which views the ''res publica'', public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Mortimer J. Adler]] described Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] as a "unique book in the Western tradition of moral philosophy, the only ethics that is sound, practical, and undogmatic."<ref>[[Mortimer J. Adler|Adler, Mortimer]] ''Ten Philosophical Mistakes: [[Basic Errors in Modern Thought]]: How They Came About, Their Consequences, and How to Avoid Them.''(1985) {{ISBN|0-02-500330-5}}, p.196</ref>

The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] is specially famous for helping to revive [[virtue ethics]] in his book ''[[After Virtue]]''. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Nietzsche]]—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize [[capitalism]]. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is "the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one."<ref>Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), ''The MacIntyre Reader'', Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264.</ref> Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical, and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'', Polity Press, 2007.</ref> Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include [[Fred D. Miller, Jr.]]<ref>Fred D. Miller, Jr., ''Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1997.</ref> in politics and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] in ethics.<ref>Rosalind Hursthouse, ''On Virtue Ethics'', Oxford University Press, 1999.</ref>

===Ontology===
Neo-Aristotelianism in [[meta-ontology]] holds that the goal of [[ontology]] is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them.<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite book |author=[[Jonathan Schaffer]] |chapter=On What Grounds What Metametaphysics |title=Metametaphysics |chapter-url=http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/grounds.pdf |editor=Chalmers |editor2=Manley |editor3=Wasserman |isbn=978-0199546046 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |pages=347–83 }}</ref> The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of [[Grounding (metaphysics)|metaphysical grounding]]. Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities.<ref name=Schaffer/> For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects.

These ideas go back to Aristotle's thesis that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, [[Substance_theory#Aristotle|substances]] have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohen |first1=S. Marc |title=Aristotle's Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref>

Jonathan Schaffer's priority monism is a recent form of neo-Aristotelian ontology. He holds that there exists only one thing on the most fundamental level: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaffer |first1=Jonathan |title=Monism: The Priority of the Whole |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 2010 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=31–76 |doi=10.1215/00318108-2009-025 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/119/1/31/2871/Monism-The-Priority-of-the-Whole |language=en |issn=0031-8108}}</ref>

===Problem of universals===
The [[problem of universals]] is the problem of whether and in which way [[universals]] exist. Aristotelians and [[Platonic realism|Platonists]] are in agreement that universals have actual, mind-independent existence. They, therefore, oppose the [[Nominalism|nominalist]] standpoint. Aristotelians disagree with Platonists about the mode of existence of universals. Platonists hold that universals exist in some form of "Platonic heaven" and therefore exist independently of their instances in the concrete spatiotemporal world. Aristotelians, on the other hand, deny the existence of universals outside the spatiotemporal world. This view is known as immanent realism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balaguer |first1=Mark |title=Platonism in Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2016}}</ref> For example, the universal "red" only exist insofar as there are red objects in the concrete world. There would be no red-universal if there were no red objects.

David Armstrong is a contemporary defender of Aristotelianism concerning the problem of universals. States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology. States of affairs have particulars and universals as their constituents. Armstrong is an immanent realist in the sense that he holds that a universal exists only insofar as it is a constituent of at least one actual state of affairs. Universals without instances are not part of the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=D. M. |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-161542-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGb-Jwp1x8UC |language=en |chapter=4.
