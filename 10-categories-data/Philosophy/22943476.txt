'''American philosophy''' is the activity, corpus, and tradition of philosophers affiliated with the [[United States]]. The ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that while it lacks a "core of defining features, American Philosophy can nevertheless be seen as both reflecting and shaping collective American identity over the history of the nation."<ref name="AmerIEP">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/american.htm "American philosophy" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved on May 24, 2009</ref>

{{See also|17th century philosophy}}

The American philosophical tradition began at the time of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the [[New World]].<ref name="AmerIEP"/> The [[Puritans]] arrival in [[New England]] set the earliest American philosophy into the religious tradition (Puritan [[Providentialism]]), and there was also an emphasis on the relationship between the individual and the community. This is evident by the early colonial documents such as the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]] (1639) and the [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] (1641).<ref name="AmerIEP"/>

Thinkers such as [[John Winthrop]] emphasized the public life over the private. Holding that the former takes precedence over the latter, while other writers, such as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (co-founder of [[Rhode Island]]) held that [[religious tolerance]] was more integral than trying to achieve religious homogeneity in a community.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/historyofus/web03/segment2.html "Religious Tolerance" – Freedom: A History of US: PBS.com] Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref>

==18th century==
{{See also|18th century philosophy}}

18th-century American philosophy may be broken into two halves, the first half being marked by the theology of Reformed [[Puritan]] [[Calvinism]] influenced by the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] as well as Enlightenment natural philosophy, and the second by the native [[moral philosophy]] of the [[American Enlightenment]] taught in American colleges.<ref>Hoeveler, J. David, ''Creating the American Mind:Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges'', Rowman & Littlefield, {{ISBN|978-0742548398}}, 2007, p. xi</ref> They were used "in the tumultuous years of the 1750s and 1770s" to "forge a new intellectual culture for the United states",<ref>Hoeveler, p. xii</ref> which led to the American incarnation of the [[European Enlightenment]] that is associated with the [[political thought]] of the Founding Fathers.<ref name="AmerIEP"/>

The 18th century saw the introduction of [[Francis Bacon]] and the Enlightenment philosophers [[Descartes]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[William Wollaston|Wollaston]], and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] to Colonial British America. Two native-born Americans, [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], were first influenced by these philosophers; they then adapted and extended their Enlightenment ideas to develop their own American theology and philosophy. Both were originally ordained Puritan Congregationalist ministers who embraced much of the new learning of the Enlightenment. Both were Yale educated and Berkeley influenced [[idealists]] who became influential college presidents. Both were influential in the development of American [[political philosophy]] and the works of the [[Founding Fathers]]. But Edwards based his reformed Puritan [[theology]] on [[Calvinist]] doctrine, while Johnson converted to the Anglican episcopal religion (the [[Church of England]]), then based his new American [[moral philosophy]] on William Wollaston's [[Natural religion|Natural Religion]]. Late in the century, [[Scottish common sense realism|Scottish innate or common sense realism]] replaced the native schools of these two rivals in the college philosophy curricula of American colleges; it would remain the dominant philosophy in American academia up to the Civil War.<ref>Hoeveler, p. 127</ref>

===Introduction of the Enlightenment into America===
[[File:American Dr. Samuel Johnson President of King's College by Smibert c. 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]]]]
The first 100 years or so of college education in  the American Colonies were dominated in New England by the Puritan theology of [[William Ames]] and "the sixteenth-century logical methods of [[Petrus Ramus]]."<ref>Ahlstrom, Sydney Eckman, ''A Religious History of the American People'', Yale University Press, 1972, p. 295</ref> Then in 1714, a donation of 800 books from England, collected by [[Colonial agent|Colonial Agent]] [[Jeremiah Dummer]], arrived at [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref>Ellis, Joseph J., ''The New England Mind in Transition: Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, 1696–1772,'' Yale University Press, 1973, p. 34</ref>  They contained what became known as "The New Learning", including "the works of Locke, Descartes, Newton, [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], and [[Shakespeare]]",<ref>Ellis, p. 34</ref> and other [[Enlightenment Era|Enlightenment era]] authors not known to the tutors and graduates of Puritan [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] colleges. They were first opened and studied by an eighteen-year-old graduate student from [[Guilford, Connecticut]], the young American [[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]], who had also just found and read [[Francis Bacon|Lord Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[Advancement of Learning]].'' Johnson wrote in his ''Autobiography'', "All this was like a flood of day to his low state of mind" and that "he found himself like one at once emerging out of the glimmer of twilight into the full sunshine of open day."<ref>Schneider, Herbert and Carol,'' Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume I, p. 7</ref> He now considered what he had learned at Yale "nothing but the scholastic cobwebs of a few little English and Dutch systems that would hardly now be taken up in the street."<ref>Schneider, Volume I, p. 6.</ref>

Johnson was appointed tutor at Yale in 1716. He began to teach the Enlightenment curriculum there, and thus began the [[American Enlightenment]]. One of his students for a brief time was a fifteen-year-old Jonathan Edwards. "These two brilliant Yale students of those years, each of whom was to become a noted thinker and college president, exposed the fundamental nature of the problem" of the "incongruities between the old learning and the new."<ref>Ahlstrom, p. 296</ref>  But each had a quite different view on the issues of [[predestination]] versus [[freewill]], [[original sin]] versus the pursuit of happiness though practicing [[virtue]], and the education of children.

===Reformed Calvinism===
[[File:Rev. Dr. Jonathan Edwards (1837 engraving).jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]]]
[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] is considered to be "America's most important and original philosophical theologian."<ref name = SEPJEdwards>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/edwards/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,'' "Jonathan Edwards," First published Tue Jan 15, 2002; substantive revision Tue Nov 7, 2006]</ref> Noted for his energetic sermons, such as "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]" (which is said to have begun the [[First Great Awakening]]), Edwards emphasized "the absolute sovereignty of God and the beauty of God's holiness."<ref name="SEPJEdwards"/> Working to unite Christian [[Platonism]] with an [[empiricist]] [[epistemology]], with the aid of [[Newtonian physics]], Edwards was deeply influenced by [[George Berkeley]], himself an empiricist, and Edwards derived his importance of the immaterial for the creation of human experience from Bishop Berkeley.

The non-material mind consists of understanding and will, and it is understanding, interpreted in a Newtonian framework, that leads to Edwards' fundamental metaphysical category of Resistance. Whatever features an object may have, it has these properties because the object resists. Resistance itself is the exertion of God's power, and it can be seen in [[Newton's laws of motion]], where an object is "unwilling" to change its current state of motion; an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion.

Though Edwards reformed Puritan theology using Enlightenment ideas from natural philosophy, and Locke, Newton, and Berkeley, he remained a Calvinist and [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism#Hard Determinism|hard determinist]]. Jonathan Edwards also rejected the [[Free will|freedom of the will]], saying that "we can do as we please, but we cannot please as we please." According to Edwards, neither good works nor self-originating faith lead to salvation, but rather it is the unconditional grace of God which stands as the sole arbiter of human fortune.

===Enlightenment===
While the 17th- and early 18th-century American philosophical tradition was decidedly marked by religious themes and the Reformation reason of Ramus, the 18th century saw more reliance on [[science]] and the new learning of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], along with an idealist belief in the perfectibility of human beings through teaching [[ethics]] and [[moral philosophy]], [[laissez-faire]] [[economics]], and a new focus on political matters.<ref>"American philosophy" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Retrieved on May 24, 2009</ref>

[[Samuel Johnson (American educator)|Samuel Johnson]] has been called "The Founder of American Philosophy"<ref>Walsh, James, ''Education of the Founding Fathers of the Republic: Scholasticism in the Colonial Colleges'', Fordham University Press, New York, 1925, p. 185</ref> and the "first important philosopher in colonial America and author of the first philosophy textbook published there".<ref>''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Ed. Edward Craig, Taylor & Francis, 1998, p. 124</ref> He was interested not only in philosophy and theology, but in theories of education, and in knowledge classification schemes, which he used to write [[encyclopedias]], develop [[Curricula|college curricula]], and create [[library classification]] systems.<ref>Fiering, Norman S., "President Samuel Johnson and the Circle of Knowledge", ''The William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Apr., 1971), pp. 199–236</ref>

Johnson was a proponent of the view that "the essence of true religion is [[morality]]", and believed that "the problem of [[denominationalism]]"<ref>Fiering, p. 236</ref> could be solved by teaching a non-denominational common moral philosophy acceptable to all religions. So he crafted one. Johnson's moral philosophy was influenced by Descartes and Locke, but more directly by [[William Wollaston]]'s ''Religion of Nature Delineated'' and the idealist philosopher of George Berkeley, with whom Johnson studied while Berkeley was in Rhode Island between 1729 and 1731. Johnson strongly rejected Calvin's doctrine of Predestination and believed that people were autonomous moral agents endowed with freewill and Lockean [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. His fusion philosophy of Natural Religion and Idealism, which has been called "American Practical Idealism",<ref>Olsen, Neil C., ''Pursuing Happiness: The Organizational Culture of the Continental Congress'', Nonagram Publications, {{ISBN|978-1480065505}} {{ISBN|1480065501}}, 2013, p. 158 n24.</ref> was developed as a series of college textbooks in seven editions between 1731 and 1754. These works, and his dialogue ''Raphael, or The Genius of the English America, ''written at the time of the [[Stamp Act crisis]], go beyond his Wollaston and Berkeley influences;<ref>Jones, Adam Leroy, ''Early American philosophers'', Volume 2, Issue 4 of Columbia University contributions to philosophy, psychology and education, The Macmillan Co., 1898, Volume 2, p. 370</ref> ''Raphael ''includes sections on [[economics]], [[psychology]], the teaching of children, and [[political philosophy]].

His moral philosophy is defined in his college textbook ''Elementa Philosophica'' as "the Art of pursuing our highest Happiness by the practice of virtue".<ref>Schneider, Herbert and Carol, ''Samuel Johnson, President of King's College: His Career and Writings'', Columbia University Press, 4 vols., 1929, Volume II, p. 392.</ref> It was promoted by President [[Thomas Clap]] of Yale, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|Provost William Smith]] at [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia]], and taught at [[Columbia College, Columbia University|King's College]] (now [[Columbia University]]), which Johnson founded in 1754. It was influential in its day: it has been estimated that about half of American college students between 1743 and 1776,<ref>Olsen p. 176 n65</ref> and over half of the men who contributed to the ''Declaration of Independence'' or debated it<ref>Olsen, Appendix I: Morality, pp. 299–300</ref> were connected to Johnson's American Practical Idealism moral philosophy. Three members of the [[Committee of Five]] who edited the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'' were closely connected to Johnson: his educational partner, promoter, friend, and publisher [[Benjamin Franklin]] of [[Pennsylvania]], his King's College student [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and his son [[William Samuel Johnson]]'s legal protegee and Yale treasurer [[Roger Sherman]] of [[Connecticut]]. Johnson's son William Samuel Johnson was the Chairman of the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Committee of Style]] that wrote the U.S. Constitution: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130918173702/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx edits to a draft version]<ref>"[http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx Report of the Committee of Style] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918173702/http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/creatingtheus/Constitution/Ratification/ExhibitObjects/ReportoftheCommitteeofStyle.aspx |date=September 18, 2013 }}", Retrieved on September 2, 2013</ref> are in his hand in the [[Library of Congress]].

===Founders' political philosophy===
[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Thomas Jefferson]] by [[Rembrandt Peale]], 1800]]
About the time of the [[Stamp Act]], interest rose in civil and [[political philosophy]]. Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] wrote extensively on political issues, including [[John Adams]], [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[James Madison]]. In continuing with the chief concerns of the Puritans in the 17th century, the Founding Fathers debated the interrelationship between God, the state, and the individual. Resulting from this were the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'', passed in 1776, and the ''[[United States Constitution]]'', ratified in 1788.

The Constitution sets forth a [[federal state|federal]] and [[republic]]an form of [[government]] that is marked by a [[balance of powers]] accompanied by a [[checks and balances]] system between the three branches of government: a [[judicial branch]], an [[executive branch]] led by the [[President of the United States|President]], and a [[legislative branch]] composed of a [[bicameral legislature]] where the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] is the [[lower house]] and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is the [[upper house]].<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/constitution/article-1/02-bicameralism.html "Bicameralism and Enumerated, Implied, Resulting, and Inherent Powers"] Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref>

Although the ''Declaration of Independence'' does contain references to the Creator, the God of Nature, Divine Providence, and the Supreme Judge of the World, the Founding Fathers were not exclusively [[theism|theistic]]. Some professed personal concepts of [[deism]], as was characteristic of other European Enlightenment thinkers, such as [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[François-Marie Arouet]] (better known by his [[pen name]], [[Voltaire]]), and [[Rousseau]].<ref>[http://atheism.about.com/od/churchstatemyths/a/doi.htm "Declaration of Independence & Christianity Myth"] Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref>  However, an investigation of 106 contributors to the ''Declaration of Independence'' between September 5, 1774, and July 4, 1776, found that only two men (Franklin and Jefferson), both American Practical Idealists in their moral philosophy, might be called quasi-deists or non-denominational Christians;<ref>Olsen, p. 298.</ref> all the others were publicly members of denominational Christian churches. Even Franklin professed the need for a "public religion"<ref>Franklin, Benjamin, ''The works of Benjamin Franklin'', ed. Jared Sparks, Hillard, Gray, 1840, p. 573</ref> and would attend various churches from time to time. Jefferson was vestryman at the evangelical Calvinistical Reformed Church of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], a church he himself founded and named in 1777,<ref>Belies, Mark A., "Rev. Charles Clay, and the Calvinistical Reformed Church of Charlottesville, Virginia During the American Revolution", ''Providential Perspective'', Volume 12, No. 3, August 1977, pp. 2–3</ref> suggesting that at this time of life he was rather strongly affiliated with a denomination and that the influence of Whitefield and Edwards reached even into Virginia. But the founders who studied or embraced Johnson, Franklin, and Smith's non-denominational moral philosophy were at least influenced by the deistic tendencies of Wollaston's Natural Religion, as evidenced by "the Laws of Nature, and Nature's God" and "the pursuit of Happiness" in the ''Declaration''.<ref>Riley, Woodbridge, ''American philosophy: the early schools,'' Dodd, Mead, 1907, p. 11</ref>

An alternate moral philosophy to the domestic American Practical Idealism, called variously Scottish Innate Sense moral philosophy (by Jefferson),<ref>Jefferson, Thomas, ''The Political Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', UNC Press Books, 1993, p. 175</ref> Scottish Commonsense Philosophy,<ref>[[Asa Mahan]], ''A Critical History of Philosophy'', 2003, Volume 1, p. 9.</ref> or [[Scottish common sense realism]], was introduced into American Colleges in 1768<ref>Olsen, p. 213</ref> by [[John Witherspoon]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrant and educator who was invited to be President of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). He was a [[Presbyterian]] minister and a delegate who joined the [[Continental Congress]] just days before the ''Declaration'' was debated. His moral philosophy was based on the work of the Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], who also influenced John Adams.<ref>Olsen, p. 122</ref> When President Witherspoon arrived at the College of New Jersey in 1768, he expanded its natural philosophy offerings, purged the Berkeley adherents from the faculty, including [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Jonathan Edwards, Jr.]], and taught his own Hutcheson-influenced form of Scottish innate sense moral philosophy.<ref>Olsen, p. 388 n81</ref> Some revisionist commentators, including Garry Wills' ''Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', claimed in the 1970s that this imported Scottish philosophy was the basis for the founding documents of America.<ref>Wills, Garry, ''Inventing America : Jefferson's Declaration of Independence'', Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1978</ref><ref>Dimock, Wai Chee, ''Residues of Justice: Literature, Law, Philosophy'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, p. 147</ref><ref>Olsen, p. 195 and p. 288</ref>  However, other historians have questioned this assertion. Ronald Hamowy published a critique of Garry Wills's ''Inventing America'',<ref>Hamowy, Ronald, Jefferson and the Scottish Enlightenment: "A Critique of Garry Wills's Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence", ''William and Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 36, No. 4, Oct. 1979, pp. 503–23</ref> concluding that "the moment [Wills's] statements are subjected to scrutiny, they appear a mass of confusions, uneducated guesses, and blatant errors of fact."<ref>Hamowy, p. 523</ref>  Another investigation of all of the contributors to the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence]]'' suggests that only Jonathan Witherspoon and John Adams embraced the imported Scottish morality.<ref>Olsen, p. 185</ref> While Scottish innate sense realism would in the decades after the Revolution become the dominate moral philosophy in classrooms of American academia for almost 100 years,<ref>Ahlstrom, Sydney, E., ''The Scottish Philosophy and American Theology Church History'', Vol. 24, No. 3 (Sep., 1955), pp. 257–72</ref> it was not a strong influence at the time of the ''Declaration'' was crafted.<ref>Ellis, Joseph J., ''American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson'', Random House Digital, Inc., 1998, p. 96</ref> Johnson's American Practical Idealism  and Edwards' Reform Puritan Calvinism were far stronger influences on the men of the Continental Congress and on the ''Declaration''.<ref>Olsen, p. 299</ref>

[[Thomas Paine]], the English [[intellectual]], [[pamphleteer]], and [[revolutionary]] who wrote [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] and ''[[Rights of Man]]'' was an influential promoter of Enlightenment political ideas in America, though he was not a philosopher. ''Common Sense'', which has been described as "the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era",<ref>Gordon Wood, ''The American Revolution: A History'' (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 55</ref> provides justification for the American revolution and independence from the British Crown. Though popular in 1776, historian [[Pauline Maier]] cautions that, "Paine's influence was more modest than he claimed and than his more enthusiastic admirers assume."<ref>Maier, Pauline, ''From Resistance to Revolution: Colonial Radicals and the Development of American Opposition to Britain, 1765–1776'', p. 91</ref>

In summary, "in the middle eighteenth century," it was "the collegians who studied" the ideas of the new learning and moral philosophy taught in the Colonial colleges who "created new documents of American nationhood."<ref>Hoeveler, p. 349</ref>  It was the generation of "Founding Grandfathers", men such as President Samuel Johnson, President Jonathan Edwards, President Thomas Clap, Benjamin Franklin, and Provost William Smith, who "first created the idealistic moral philosophy of 'the pursuit of Happiness', and then taught it in American colleges to the generation of men who would become the Founding Fathers."<ref>Olsen, p. 13</ref>

==19th century==
{{See also|19th century philosophy}}

The 19th century saw the rise of [[Romanticism]] in America. The American incarnation of Romanticism was [[transcendentalism]] and it stands as a major American innovation. The 19th century also saw the rise of the school of pragmatism, along with a smaller, [[Hegelian]] philosophical movement led by [[George Holmes Howison]] that was focused in [[St. Louis]], though the influence of American pragmatism far outstripped that of the small Hegelian movement.<ref name="AmerIEP"/>

Other reactions to materialism included the "[[Objective idealism]]" of [[Josiah Royce]], and the "[[Personalism]]," sometimes called "Boston personalism," of [[Borden Parker Bowne]].

===Transcendentalism===
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Henry David Thoreau]], 1856]]
[[File:Ralph Waldo Emerson ca1857.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], ca. 1857]]
[[Transcendentalism]] in the United States was marked by an emphasis on subjective experience, and can be viewed as a reaction against [[modernism]] and [[intellectualism]] in general and the mechanistic, [[reductionism|reductionistic]] worldview in particular. Transcendentalism is marked by the [[holism|holistic]] belief in an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical, and this perfect state can only be attained by one's own intuition and personal reflection, as opposed to either industrial progress and scientific advancement or the principles and prescriptions of traditional, organized religion. The most notable transcendentalist writers include [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], and [[Margaret Fuller]].<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_transcendentalist.html "Famous Transcendentalists"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720172654/http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_transcendentalist.html |date=July 20, 2016 }} Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingeme0000sack|title=Understanding Emerson : "The American scholar" and his struggle for self-reliance|last=Kenneth.|first=Sacks|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691099820|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=50034887|url-access=registration}}</ref>

The transcendentalist writers all desired a deep return to [[nature]], and believed that real, true knowledge is intuitive and personal and arises out of personal immersion and reflection in nature, as opposed to scientific knowledge that is the result of [[empirical evidence|empirical sense experience]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ "Transcendentalism" at the SEP] Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref>

Things such as scientific tools, political institutions, and the conventional rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion need to be transcended. This is found in [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden; or, Life in the Woods]]'' where transcendence is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing of oneself from society.

===Darwinism in America===
The release of [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolutionary theory]] in his 1859 publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' had a strong impact on American philosophy. [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] and [[Chauncey Wright]] both wrote about and argued for the re-conceiving of philosophy through an evolutionary lens. They both wanted to understand [[morality]] and the [[mind]] in Darwinian terms, setting a precedent for [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[evolutionary ethics]].

Darwin's biological theory was also integrated into the social and political philosophies of [[English people|English]] thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] and American philosopher [[William Graham Sumner]]. Herbert Spencer, who coined the oft-misattributed term "[[survival of the fittest]]," believed that societies were in a struggle for survival, and that groups within society are where they are because of some level of fitness. This struggle is beneficial to human kind, as in the long run the weak will be weeded out and only the strong will survive. This position is often referred to as [[Social Darwinism]], though it is distinct from the [[eugenics]] movements with which social darwinism is often associated.  The [[laissez-faire]] beliefs of Sumner and Spencer do not advocate coercive breeding to achieve a planned outcome.

Sumner, much influenced by Spencer, believed along with the industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] that the social implication of the fact of the struggle for survival is that laissez-faire capitalism is the natural political-economic system and is the one that will lead to the greatest amount of well-being. William Sumner, in addition to his advocacy of free markets, also espoused [[anti-imperialism]] (having been credited with coining the term "[[ethnocentrism]]"), and advocated for the [[gold standard]].

===Pragmatism===
Perhaps the most influential school of thought that is uniquely American is [[pragmatism]]. It began in the late nineteenth century in the United States with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. Pragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that upon which one is willing to act. It holds that a proposition's meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the proposition as true.<ref name="IEPrag">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pragmati.htm "Pragmatism" at IEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2008</ref>

====Charles Sanders Peirce====
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]], an American pragmatist, logician, mathematician, philosopher, and scientist]]

[[Polymath]], [[logician]], [[mathematician]], philosopher, and [[scientist]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) coined the term "pragmatism" in the 1870s.<ref>[http://science.jrank.org/pages/10825/Pragmatism-Charles-Sanders-Peirce.html "Pragmatism - Charles Sanders Peirce"] Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref> He was a member of [[The Metaphysical Club]], which was a conversational club of intellectuals that also included [[Chauncey Wright]], future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], and another early figure of pragmatism, [[William James]].<ref name="IEPrag"/> In addition to making profound contributions to [[semiotics]], logic, and mathematics, Peirce wrote what are considered to be the founding documents of pragmatism, "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877) and [[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|"How to Make Our Ideas Clear"]] (1878).

In "The Fixation of Belief" Peirce argues for the superiority of the [[scientific method]] in settling belief on theoretical questions. In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" Peirce argued for pragmatism as summed up in that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]]: "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object". Peirce emphasized that a conception is general, such that its meaning is not a set of actual, definite effects themselves. Instead the conception of an object is equated to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of their conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning.

The maxim is intended to help fruitfully clarify confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make formal but not practical differences. Traditionally one analyzes an idea into parts (his example: a definition of truth as a sign's correspondence to its object). To that needful but confined step, the maxim adds a further and practice-oriented step (his example: a definition of truth as sufficient investigation's destined end).

It is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]<ref>Peirce (1902), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraph 13, note 1. See relevant quote at [[Pragmatic maxim#6]].</ref> arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.<ref>See ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'', v. 1, paragraph 34, [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce ascribes the success of modern science less to a novel interest in verification than to the improvement of verification.</ref> Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, though he himself was a [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Mathematics of logic|mathematician of logic]] and a [[Founders of statistics|founder of statistics]].

[[File:wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]], an American pragmatist and psychologist]]

[[William James]] (1842–1910) was "an original thinker in and between the disciplines of physiology, psychology and philosophy."<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/ "William James" at SEP] Retrieved on July 30, 2009</ref> He is famous as the author of ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', his monumental tome ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and his lecture "[[The Will to Believe]]."

James, along with Peirce,<ref>See "Pragmatism (Editor [3])", c. 1906, especially the portion published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5 (1934), paragraphs 11–12.</ref> saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes elaborated into a radical new philosophical method of clarifying ideas and thereby resolving dilemmas. In his 1910 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]],'' James paraphrased Peirce's pragmatic maxim as follows:
{{cquote|[T]he tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions, however subtle, is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind the object may involve — what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions we must prepare.}}
He then went on to characterize pragmatism as promoting not only a method of clarifying ideas but also as endorsing a particular theory of truth. Peirce rejected this latter move by James, preferring to describe the pragmatic maxim only as a maxim of logic and pragmatism as a methodological stance, explicitly denying that it was a substantive doctrine or theory about anything, truth or otherwise.<ref>Peirce (1903), ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 2, paragraph 99; v. 5, paragraphs 18, 195; v. 6, paragraph 482.</ref>

James is also known for his [[radical empiricism]] which holds that relations between objects are as real as the objects themselves. James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth. He rejected the [[correspondence theory of truth]] and instead held that truth involves a belief, facts about the world, other background beliefs, and future consequences of those beliefs. Later in his life James would also come to adopt [[neutral monism]], the view that the ultimate [[reality]] is of one kind, and is neither [[Mental substance|mental]] nor [[physical property|physical]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neutral-monism/ "Neutral Monism"] in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref>

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952), while still engaging in the lofty academic philosophical work of James and Peirce before him, also wrote extensively on political and social matters, and his presence in the public sphere was much greater than his pragmatist predecessors. In addition to being one of the founding members of pragmatism, John Dewey was one of the founders of [[functional psychology]] and was a leading figure of the [[Progressive education|progressive]] movement in U.S. schooling during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Violas, Paul C. |author2=Tozer, Steven |author3=Senese, Guy B. |title=School and Society: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages |page=121 |isbn=0-07-298556-9 |date=September 2004 }}</ref>

Dewey argued against the individualism of classical liberalism, asserting that social institutions are not "means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for creating individuals."<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dewey-political/#2 "Dewey's Political Philosophy"] in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Retrieved on July 30, 2009</ref> He held that individuals are not things that should be accommodated by social institutions, instead, social institutions are prior to and shape the individuals. These social arrangements are a means of creating individuals and promoting individual freedom.

Dewey is well known for his work in the [[applied philosophy]] of the [[philosophy of education]]. Dewey's philosophy of education is one where children learn by doing. Dewey believed that schooling was unnecessarily long and formal, and that children would be better suited to learn by engaging in real-life activities. For example, in math, students could learn by figuring out proportions in cooking or seeing how long it would take to travel distances with certain modes of transportation.<ref>[http://wilderdom.com/experiential/JohnDeweyPhilosophyEducation.html John Dewey: Philosophy of Education"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817083219/http://wilderdom.com/experiential/JohnDeweyPhilosophyEducation.html |date=August 17, 2016 }} Retrieved on July 30, 2009</ref>

==20th century==
[[File:George Santayana.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Santayana]], a Spanish-American philosopher]]
{{See also|20th-century philosophy}}

Pragmatism, which began in the 19th century in America, by the beginning of the 20th century began to be accompanied by other philosophical schools of thought, and was eventually eclipsed by them, though only temporarily. The 20th century saw the emergence of process philosophy, itself influenced by the scientific world-view and [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. The middle of the 20th century was witness to the increase in popularity of the [[philosophy of language]] and analytic philosophy in America. [[Existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], while very popular in Europe in the 20th century, never achieved the level of popularity in America as they did in continental Europe.<ref name="AmerIEP"/>

===Rejection of idealism===
Pragmatism continued its influence into the 20th century, and Spanish-born philosopher [[George Santayana]] was one of the leading proponents of pragmatism and realism in this period. He held that [[idealism]] was an outright contradiction and rejection of [[common sense]]. He held that, if something must be certain in order to be knowledge, then it seems no knowledge may be possible, and the result will be [[skepticism]]. According to Santayana, knowledge involved a sort of faith, which he termed "animal faith".

In his book ''[[Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' he asserts that knowledge is not the result of reasoning. Instead, knowledge is what is required in order to act and successfully engage with the world.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/ "George Santayana" at the Stanford Encylclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 9, 2009</ref> As a naturalist, Santayana was a harsh critic of [[Foundationalism|epistemological foundationalism]]. The explanation of events in the natural world is within the realm of science, while the meaning and value of this action should be studied by philosophers. Santayana was accompanied in the intellectual climate of 'common sense' philosophy by the thinkers of the [[New realism (philosophy)|New Realism]] movement, such as [[Ralph Barton Perry]].

Santayana was at one point aligned with early 20th-century American proponents of [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]]—such as [[Roy Wood Sellars]]—who were also critics of idealism,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Drake |first1=Durant |last2=Lovejoy |first2=Arthur O. |last3=Pratt |first3=James Bissett |last4=Rogers |first4=Arthur Kenyon |last5=Santayana |first5=George |last6=Sellars |first6=Roy Wood |last7=Strong |first7=Charles Augustus |date=1920 |title=Essays in critical realism: a co-operative study of the problem of knowledge |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |oclc=2951630 |url=https://archive.org/details/essayscriticalre00unknuoft}}</ref> but Sellars later concluded that Santayana and [[Charles Augustus Strong]] were closer to new realism in their emphasis on veridical perception, whereas Sellars and [[Arthur O. Lovejoy]] and [[James Bissett Pratt]] were more properly counted among the critical realists who emphasized "the distinction between intuition and denotative characterization".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sellars |first=Roy Wood |date=April 15, 1939 |title=A statement of critical realism |journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=472–498 |jstor=23932400}}</ref>

===Process philosophy===
[[Process philosophy]] embraces the Einsteinian world-view, and its main proponents include [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]]. The core belief of process philosophy is the claim that events and processes are the principal [[ontological]] categories.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/ "Process Philosophy" at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009</ref> Whitehead asserted in his book ''The Concept of Nature'' that the things in nature, what he referred to as "concresences" are a conjunction of events that maintain a permanence of character. Process philosophy is [[Heraclitan]] in the sense that a fundamental ontological category is change.<ref>[http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm "Process Philosophy and the New Thought Movement"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826153844/http://websyte.com/alan/process.htm |date=August 26, 2009 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref> Charles Hartshorne was also responsible for developing the process philosophy of Whitehead into [[process theology]].

===Analytic philosophy===
[[File:Wvq-passport-1975-400dpi-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|An image of [[W.V.O. Quine]] as seen on his [[passport]]]]
The middle of the 20th century was the beginning of the dominance of [[analytic philosophy]] in America. Analytic philosophy, prior to its arrival in America, had begun in Europe with the work of [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and the [[logical positivists]]. According to logical positivism, the truths of logic and mathematics are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science are empirically verifiable.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Any other claim, including the claims of ethics, aesthetics, theology, metaphysics, and ontology, are meaningless (this theory is called [[verificationism]]). With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], many positivists fled Germany to Britain and America, and this helped reinforce the dominance of analytic philosophy in the United States in subsequent years.<ref name="AmerIEP"/>

[[W.V.O. Quine]], while not a logical positivist, shared their view that philosophy should stand shoulder to shoulder with science in its pursuit of intellectual clarity and understanding of the world. He criticized the logical positivists and the [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic distinction of knowledge]] in his essay "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" and advocated for his "web of belief," which is a [[coherentism|coherentist]] theory of justification. In Quine's epistemology, since no experiences occur in isolation, there is actually a holistic approach to knowledge where every belief or experience is intertwined with the whole. Quine is also famous for inventing the term "gavagai" as part of his theory of the [[indeterminacy of translation]].<ref>[http://www.nickbostrom.com/old/quine.html "Understanding Quine's Theses of Indeterminacy" by Nick Bostrom] Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref>

[[File:Kripke.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Saul Kripke]] at [[Juquehy]] Beach]]

[[Saul Kripke]], a student of Quine at [[Harvard]], has profoundly influenced analytic philosophy. Kripke was ranked among the top ten most important philosophers of the past 200 years in a poll conducted by [[Brian Leiter]] (Leiter Reports: a Philosophy Blog; [[open access poll]])<ref>Brian Leiter, "The last poll about philosophers {{sic|hide=y|for a|while|expected=for a while}} – I promise!"

He has also made important contributions to [[set theory]] (see [[admissible ordinal]] and [[Kripke–Platek set theory]])

[[Thomas Kuhn]] was an important philosopher and writer who worked extensively in the fields of the [[history of science]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He is famous for writing ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', one of the most cited academic works of all time. The book argues that science proceeds through different ''[[paradigms]]'' as scientists find new puzzles to solve. There follows a widespread struggle to find answers to questions, and a shift in world views occurs, which is referred to by Kuhn as a ''[[paradigm shift]]''.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/#3 "Thomas Kuhn" at the SEP] Retrieved on September 7, 2009</ref> The work is considered a milestone in the [[sociology of knowledge]].

===Return of political philosophy===

The analytic philosophers troubled themselves with the abstract and the conceptual, and American philosophy did not fully return to social and political concerns (that dominated American philosophy at the time of the founding of the United States) until the 1970s.

The return to political and social concerns included the popularity of works of [[Ayn Rand]], who promoted [[ethical egoism]] (the praxis of the belief system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]) in her novels, ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943 and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' in 1957. These two novels gave birth to the [[Objectivist movement]] and would influence a small group of students called The Collective, one of whom was a young [[Alan Greenspan]], a self-described libertarian who would become [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]].<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Greg |last1=Ip |first2=Emily |last2=Steel |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118978549183327730 |title=Greenspan Book Criticizes Bush And Republicans |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=September 15, 2007 |page=A1}}</ref> Objectivism holds that there is an objective external reality that can be known with reason, that human beings should act in accordance with their own rational self-interest, and that the proper form of economic organization is [[laissez-faire]] capitalism.<ref>[http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro "ntroducing Objectivism" by Ayn Rand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501052124/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_intro |date=May 1, 2010 }} Retrieved on September 7, 2009</ref> Some academic philosophers have been highly critical of the quality and intellectual rigor of Rand's work,<ref>[http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/01/20/roderick-long/the-winnowing-of-ayn-rand/ "The Winnowing of Ayn Rand" by Roderick Long] Retrieved July 10, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/the-philosophical-art-of-looking-out-number-one-1.835066 "The philosophical art of looking out number one" at heraldscotland] Retrieved July 10, 2010</ref> but she remains a popular, albeit controversial, figure within the American libertarian movement.<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/rand/ "Ayn Rand" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved July 10, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html "Profile of Ayn Rand at the Cato Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728105617/http://www.cato.org/special/threewomen/rand.html |date=July 28, 2010 }} Retrieved July 10, 2010</ref>

In 1971 [[John Rawls]] published his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. The book puts forth Rawls' view of ''[[justice as fairness]]'', a version of [[social contract]] theory. Rawls employs a conceptual mechanism called the [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] to outline his idea of the [[original position]].<ref>[http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm "Philosophy: John Rawls vs. Robert Nozick"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616174432/http://jeffersonswall.blog-city.com/john_rawls_vs_robert_nozick.htm |date=June 16, 2009 }} Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref> In Rawls' philosophy, the original position is the correlate to the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[state of nature]]. While in the original position, persons are said to be behind the veil of ignorance, which makes these persons unaware of their individual characteristics and their place in society, such as their race, religion, wealth, etc. The principles of justice are chosen by rational persons while in this original position. The two principles of justice are the equal liberty principle and the principle which governs the distribution of social and economic inequalities. From this, Rawls argues for a system of [[distributive justice]] in accordance with the Difference Principle, which says that all social and economic inequalities must be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/ "Distributive Justice" at SEP] Retrieved December 18, 2009</ref>

Viewing Rawls as promoting excessive government control and rights violations, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Robert Nozick]] published ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974. The book advocates for a [[minarchism|minimal state]] and defends the liberty of the individual. He argues that the role of government should be limited to "police protection, national defense, and the administration of courts of law, with all other tasks commonly performed by modern governments – education, social insurance, welfare, and so forth – taken over by religious bodies, charities, and other private institutions operating in a free market."<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ "Robert Nozick (1938–2002)" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref>

Nozick asserts his view of the [[entitlement theory]] of justice, which says that if everyone in society has acquired their holdings in accordance with the principles of acquisition, transfer, and rectification, then any pattern of allocation, no matter how unequal the distribution may be, is just. The entitlement theory of justice holds that the "justice of a distribution is indeed determined by certain historical circumstances (contrary to end-state theories), but it has nothing to do with fitting any pattern guaranteeing that those who worked the hardest or are most deserving have the most shares."<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ "Robert Nozick" at IEP] Retrieved January 5, 2010</ref>

While there were earlier writers who would be considered feminist, such as [[Sarah Grimké]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Anne Hutchinson]], the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, also known as [[second-wave feminism]], is notable for its impact in philosophy.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-topics/ "Topics in Feminism" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved September 7, 2009</ref>

The popular mind was taken with [[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''. This was accompanied by other feminist philosophers, such as [[Alicia Ostriker]] and [[Adrienne Rich]]. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what they believe to be masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there is no such thing as a value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.
