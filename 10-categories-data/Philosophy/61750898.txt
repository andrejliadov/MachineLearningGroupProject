This led to the publication of a wide array of criticisms, attacking his [[Philosophical pessimism|pessimism]].<ref name=":1" /> The publication of Hartmann's ''[[Philosophy of the Unconscious]]'', in 1869, which reaffirmed and further developed Schopenhauer's doctrine, reinvigorated the controversy. He published a great number of articles and four books in response to his critics, throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Agnes Taubert (Hartmann's wife) published ''Der Pessimismus und seine Gegner'', in 1873, in response to criticism of her husband, which had a strong influence on the controversy.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Stern|first=Tom|title=The New Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2019|isbn=9781316676264|editor-last=Stern|editor-first=Tom|location=Cambridge|pages=352|chapter=Nietzche's Ethics of Affirmation}}</ref>
