'''Thought''' (or '''thinking''') encompasses an "aim-oriented flow of [[ideas]] and [[association (psychology)|associations]] that can lead to a reality-oriented conclusion".<ref>{{cite book |last=Marić |first=Jovan |date=2005 |title=Klinicka psihijatrija |url=http://www.datastatus.rs/proizvod/8040/klinicka-psihijatrija-11-izdanje |location=Belgrade |publisher=Naša knjiga |page=22 |isbn=978-86-901559-1-0 |author-link=Jovan Maric}}</ref> Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for [[humans]], there is still no consensus as to how it is adequately defined or understood.

Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and [[metaphysical]] origins and its effects has been a longstanding [[goal]] of many academic disciplines including [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[biology]], [[sociology]] and [[cognitive science]].

Thinking allows humans to make sense of, interpret, represent or [[Conceptual model|model]] the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes [[plans]] or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals.

==Etymology and usage==
[[File:Eugene de Blaas A Pensive Moment.jpg|thumb|right|228px|''A Pensive Moment'' (1904), by [[Eugene de Blaas]]]]

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Philosophy of mind}}
{{Quotation|What is most thought-provoking in these thought-provoking times, is that we are still not thinking.|[[Martin Heidegger]]<ref>Martin Heidegger, ''What is Called Thinking?''</ref>}}

[[File:Jardin du Musee Rodin Paris Le Penseur 20050402 (02).jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[The Thinker]]'' by [[Rodin]] (1840–1917), in the garden of the [[Musée Rodin]]]]
The phenomenology movement in philosophy saw a radical change in the way in which we understand thought. Martin Heidegger's phenomenological analyses of the existential structure of man in ''[[Being and Time]]'' cast new light on the issue of thinking, unsettling traditional cognitive or rational interpretations of man which affect the way we understand thought. The notion of the fundamental role of non-cognitive understanding in rendering possible thematic consciousness informed the discussion surrounding [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>Dreyfus, Hubert. Dreyfus, Stuart. ''Mind Over Machine''. Macmillan, 1987</ref>

Phenomenology, however, is not the only approach to thinking in modern Western philosophy. Philosophy of mind is a branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the [[mind]], [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain. The mind–body problem, i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.<ref name="Kim1"/>

===Mind–body dichotomy===
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}

The mind–body problem concerns the explanation of the relationship that exists between [[mind]]s, or mental processes, and bodily states or processes.<ref name="Kim1">{{cite book |last=Kim |first=J. |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=Problems in the Philosophy of Mind. Oxford Companion to Philosophy |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond |url-access=registration |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}<!--Kim, J., "Problems in the Philosophy of Mind". ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.--></ref> The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental states/processes, and how—or even if—minds are affected by and can affect the body.

Human perceptual experiences depend on [[stimulation|stimuli]] which arrive at one's various [[sensory system|sensory organs]] from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in one's mental state, ultimately causing one to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties. A related problem is to explain how someone's [[propositional attitude]]s (e.g. beliefs and desires) can cause that individual's [[neuron]]s to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner. These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted [[epistemologist]]s and philosophers of mind from at least the time of [[René Descartes]].<ref>''Companion to Metaphysics'', By Jaegwon Kim, Gary S. Rosenkrantz, Ernest Sosa, Contributor Jaegwon Kim, 2nd edition, Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5298-3}}</ref>

===Functionalism vs. embodiment===
The above reflects a classical, functional description of how we work as cognitive, thinking systems. However the apparently irresolvable mind–body problem is said to be overcome, and bypassed, by the [[embodied cognition]] approach, with its roots in the work of [[Heidegger]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], [[Vygotsky]], [[Merleau-Ponty]] and the pragmatist [[John Dewey]].<ref>Varela, Francisco J., Thompson, Evan T., and Rosch, Eleanor. (1992). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-72021-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Cowart |first=Monica |year=2004 |title=Embodied Cognition |encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |issn= 2161-0002 |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/ |accessdate= 27 February 2012}}</ref>

This approach states that the classical approach of separating the mind and analysing its processes is misguided: instead, we should see that the mind, actions of an embodied agent, and the environment it perceives and envisions, are all parts of a whole which determine each other. Therefore, functional analysis of the mind alone will always leave us with the mind–body problem which cannot be solved.<ref>{{cite web |author=Di Paolo, Ezequiel|title= Shallow and Deep Embodiment|publisher= University of Sussex|date= 2009  |format=Video, duration: 1:11:38 |url=https://cast.switch.ch/vod/clips/74nrkbwys |accessdate=27 February 2012}}</ref>

==Biology==
{{Main|Neuron}}

A neuron (also known as a neurone or nerve cell) is an excitable [[cell (biology)|cell]] in the [[nervous system]] that processes and transmits information by electrochemical [[signal (biology)|signaling]]. Neurons are the core components of the [[Human brain|brain]], the [[vertebrate]] [[spinal cord]], the [[invertebrate]] [[ventral nerve cord]] and the peripheral nerves. A number of specialized types of neurons exist: sensory neurons respond to touch, sound, light and numerous other stimuli affecting cells of the [[sense|sensory organs]] that then send signals to the spinal cord and brain. Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord that cause [[muscle contraction]]s and affect [[gland]]s. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the brain and spinal cord. Neurons respond to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and communicate the presence of stimuli to the central nervous system, which processes that information and sends responses to other parts of the body for action. Neurons do not go through [[mitosis]] and usually cannot be replaced after being destroyed, although [[astrocytes]] have been observed to turn into neurons, as they are sometimes [[pluripotent]].

{{Main|Cognitive psychology}}

Psychologists have concentrated on thinking as an intellectual exertion aimed at finding an answer to a question or the solution of a practical problem. Cognitive psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. The school of thought arising from this approach is known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], which is interested in how people mentally represent information processing. It had its foundations in the [[Gestalt psychology]] of [[Max Wertheimer]], [[Wolfgang Köhler]], and [[Kurt Koffka]],<ref>''Gestalt Theory'', By Max Wertheimer. Hayes Barton Press, 1944, {{ISBN|978-1-59377-695-4}}</ref> and in the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who provided a theory of stages/phases that describes children's cognitive development.

Cognitive psychologists use [[psychophysics|psychophysical]] and experimental approaches to understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes which mediate between stimulus and response. They study various aspects of thinking, including the [[psychology of reasoning]], and how people make decisions and choices, solve problems, as well as engage in creative discovery and imaginative thought. Cognitive theory contends that solutions to problems either take the form of [[algorithm]]s: rules that are not necessarily understood but promise a solution, or of [[heuristics]]: rules that are understood but that do not always guarantee solutions. [[Cognitive science]] differs from cognitive psychology in that algorithms that are intended to simulate human behavior are implemented or implementable on a computer. In other instances, solutions may be found through insight, a sudden awareness of relationships.

In [[developmental psychology]], [[Jean Piaget]] was a pioneer in the study of the development of thought from birth to maturity. In his [[theory of cognitive development]], thought is based on actions on the environment. That is, Piaget suggests that the environment is understood through assimilations of objects in the available schemes of action and these accommodate to the objects to the extent that the available schemes fall short of the demands. As a result of this interplay between assimilation and accommodation, thought develops through a sequence of stages that differ qualitatively from each other in mode of representation and complexity of inference and understanding. That is, thought evolves from being based on perceptions and actions at the sensorimotor stage in the first two years of life to internal representations in early childhood. Subsequently, representations are gradually organized into logical structures which first operate on the concrete properties of the reality, in the stage of concrete operations, and then operate on abstract principles that organize concrete properties, in the stage of formal operations.<ref>Piaget, J. (1951). ''Psychology of Intelligence''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul</ref> In recent years, the Piagetian conception of thought was integrated with information processing conceptions. Thus, thought is considered as the result of mechanisms that are responsible for the representation and processing of information. In this conception, [[cognitive processing speed|speed of processing]], [[cognitive control]], and [[working memory]] are the main functions underlying thought. In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], the development of thought is considered to come from increasing speed of processing, enhanced [[cognitive control]], and increasing working memory.<ref>{{cite book |last=Demetriou |first=A. |year=1998 |title=Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K. F. M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology''. pp. 179–269. London: Wiley }}</ref>

[[Positive psychology]] emphasizes the positive aspects of human psychology as equally important as the focus on mood disorders and other negative symptoms. In ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues]]'', [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] list a series of positive characteristics. One person is not expected to have every strength, nor are they meant to fully capsulate that characteristic entirely. The list encourages positive thought that builds on a person's strengths, rather than how to "fix" their "symptoms".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |year=2011 |title =Psychology Second Edition, "Positive Psychology" |location= New York}} 584 pp.</ref>

==Psychoanalysis==
{{Main|Id, ego and super-ego|Unconscious mind}}
The "id", "ego" and "super-ego" are the three parts of the "[[psychic apparatus]]" defined in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[ego psychology|structural model]] of the psyche; they are the three theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction mental life is described. According to this model, the uncoordinated instinctual trends are encompassed by the "id", the organized realistic part of the psyche is the "ego", and the critical, moralizing function is the "super-ego".<ref>{{cite book |title=Teach Yourself Freud |first= Ruth |last=Snowden |edition= illustrated |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-07-147274-6 |page=107 }}</ref>

For psychoanalysis, the unconscious does not include all that is not conscious, rather only what is actively repressed from conscious thought or what the person is averse to knowing consciously. In a sense this view places the self in relationship to their unconscious as an adversary, warring with itself to keep what is unconscious hidden. If a person feels pain, all he can think of is alleviating the pain. Any of his desires, to get rid of pain or enjoy something, command the mind what to do. For Freud, the unconscious was a repository for socially unacceptable ideas, wishes or desires, traumatic memories, and painful emotions put out of mind by the mechanism of [[psychological repression]]. However, the contents did not necessarily have to be solely negative. In the psychoanalytic view, the unconscious is a force that can only be recognized by its effects—it expresses itself in the [[symptom]].<ref>''The Cambridge companion to Freud'', By Jerome Neu. Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 29, {{ISBN|978-0-521-37779-9}}</ref>

[[File:Thought bubble.svg|thumb|A "[[thought bubble]]" is an illustration depicting thought.]]
{{Main|Social psychology}}

Social psychology is the study of how people and groups interact. Scholars in this [[interdisciplinary]] area are typically either [[psychology|psychologists]] or [[sociologists]], though all social psychologists employ both the [[individual]] and the [[group (sociology)|group]] as their [[unit of analysis|units of analysis]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology00myer_0 <!-- quote=social psychology. --> ''Social Psychology''], David G. Myers, McGraw Hill, 1993. {{ISBN|0-07-044292-4}}.</ref>

Despite their similarity, psychological and sociological researchers tend to differ in their goals, approaches, methods, and terminology. They also favor separate [[academic journals]] and [[learned society|professional societies]]. The greatest period of collaboration between sociologists and psychologists was during the years immediately following [[World War II]].<ref>Sewell, W.H. (1989). Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', Vol. 15.</ref> Although there has been increasing isolation and specialization in recent years, some degree of overlap and influence remains between the two disciplines.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nvz5Y8e1N84C ''The Psychology of the Social''], Uwe Flick, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-58851-0}}.</ref>

The [[collective unconscious]], sometimes known as collective subconscious, is a term of [[analytical psychology]], [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Carl Jung]]. It is a part of the [[unconscious mind]], shared by a [[society]], a people, or all [[human]]ity, in an interconnected system that is the product of all common experiences and contains such concepts as [[science]], [[religion]], and [[morality]]. While [[Freud]] did not distinguish between "individual psychology" and "collective psychology", Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the [[personal unconscious|personal]] [[unconscious mind|subconscious]] particular to each human being. The collective unconscious is also known as "a reservoir of the experiences of our species".<ref>Jensen, Peter S., Mrazek, David, Knapp, Penelope K., [[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, Laurence]], Pfeffer, Cynthia, Schowalter, John, & Shapiro, Theodore. (Dec 1997) "Evolution and revolution in child psychiatry: ADHD as a disorder of adaptation. (attention-deficit hyperactivity syndrome)". ''Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry''. 36. p. 1672. (10). July 14, 2007.</ref>

In the "Definitions" chapter of Jung's [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] work ''Psychological Types'', under the definition of "collective" Jung references ''representations collectives'', a term coined by [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]] in his 1910 book ''How Natives Think''. Jung says this is what he describes as the collective unconscious. Freud, on the other hand, did not accept the idea of a collective unconscious.
