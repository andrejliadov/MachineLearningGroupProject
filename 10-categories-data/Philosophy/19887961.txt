'''''Agora''''' ({{lang-es|Ágora}}) is a 2009 Spanish English-language [[historical drama film]] directed by [[Alejandro Amenábar]] and written by Amenábar and [[Mateo Gil]]. The [[biopic]] stars [[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia]], a mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], who investigates the flaws of the [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] and the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of [[classical antiquity]] from destruction. [[Max Minghella]] co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and [[Oscar Isaac]] as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]].

The story uses [[historical fiction]] to highlight the [[relationship between religion and science]] at the time amidst the [[decline of Greco-Roman polytheism]] and the [[Christianization of the Roman Empire]]. The title of the film takes its name from the ''[[agora]]'', a public gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]''. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of [[Malta]] from March to June 2008. [[Justin Pollard]], co-author of ''The Rise and Fall of Alexandria'' (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.

''Agora'' was screened out of competition at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, and opened in Spain on 9 October 2009 becoming the highest-grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and seven [[Goya Awards]] in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize]] at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].

==Plot==
In 391 AD, [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] is part of the [[Roman Empire]], and Greek philosopher [[Hypatia]] is a teacher at the [[Platonism|Platonic]] school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the daughter of [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]], the director of the [[Musaeum]] of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's [[slave]], Davus, and two of her pupils, [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]] and [[Synesius]], are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love as she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science. He is also secretly in love with her.

Meanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods and cause one of their priests to burn in a fire, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob. Theon is gravely injured, and Hypatia and the pagans take refuge in the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|Library of the Serapeum]]. The Christian siege of the library ends when an envoy of the Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]] declares that the pagans are pardoned, but the Christians shall be allowed to take possession of the library. Hypatia and the pagans flee while trying to save the most important [[scroll]]s before the Christians overtake the library and destroy its contents. Davus chooses to join the Christian forces. He later returns with a [[gladius]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaults]] her, but he begins to sob and offers his sword to her. However, she removes his slave collar and tells him that he is free.

Several years later, Orestes, now converted to Christianity, is [[prefect]] of Alexandria. Hypatia continues to investigate the motions of the [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#Prehistory|Sun, the Moon, the five known "wanderers" (planets)]], and the stars. Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]] by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus what his opinion is, he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.

Hypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship which demonstrates that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into violent conflict.

The leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia theorizes that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit]], not a circular orbit, with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]], and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured. They strip Hypatia and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead. When the mob goes outside to collect stones, Davus suffocates her to spare her the pain of being stoned and tells the mob that she fainted. Davus leaves as they begin to stone her.

==Cast==
*[[Rachel Weisz]] as [[Hypatia of Alexandria]]. Weisz was already a fan of Amenábar's work when she received the script, and was very interested in the role.<ref name="Zona">{{cite web |title="Agora" entrevista Rachel Weisz |url=https://www.youtube.com/watchv=uKHGdj_NqS4&feature=related |publisher=Zona Trailer }} See also: {{cite web |last=Fine |first=Marshall |author-link=Marshall fine |date=2010-06-01 |title=The Rachel Weisz theorem |url=http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p=742 |publisher=hollywoodandfine.com |access-date=2010-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605154843/http://hollywoodandfine.com/interviews/?p=742 |archive-date=2010-06-05 |url-status = dead}}</ref> Although she had not heard of Hypatia before, she felt that her history was still relevant to the contemporary world: "Really, nothing has changed. I mean, we have huge technological advances and medical advances, but in terms of people killing each other in the name of God, fundamentalism still abounds. And in certain cultures, women are still second-class citizens, and they’re denied education."<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |date=2009-05-19 |title=Hypatia, history and a never-ending story |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/articles/2009/05/19/1242498745843.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5qKVbewOE?url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/05/19/1242498745843.html?page=fullpage |archive-date=2010-06-08 |url-status = live}}</ref> Weisz wanted to delve more into Hypatia's sexuality and her desires, but Amenábar disagreed. She also received science lessons to help inform her depiction of the character.<ref name="Zona" /> At the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, Weisz spoke about her style and approach: "There's no way we could know how people behave in the 4th century. I imagine they were still human beings with the same emotions as we have now. There are cultural customs, I guess, which were different. We approach the acting style to make the people flesh and blood and to make the acting incredibly naturalistic."<ref>{{cite web |title=Rachel Weisz in Cannes for Agora |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBSioB9L9dw |publisher=Films & Stars}}</ref>
*[[Max Minghella]] as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave. Davus is in love with Hypatia, but it is an [[unrequited love]], and Davus turns towards Christianity instead. When Hypatia is about to be stoned to death at the end of the film, he decides to suffocate her because he still loves her and doesn't want her to suffer any physical pain.

*[[Oscar Isaac]] as [[Orestes (prefect)|Orestes]]. Student of Hypatia, Orestes is an aristocrat, who like Davus, falls in love with her, and has a strong friendship with Hypatia.<ref name="HolaTV" /> Isaac was familiar with the history of early Christianity during the period represented in the film, but like Weisz, he had not heard of Hypatia before joining the project.<ref>{{cite web |date=2009-10-08 |title=Agora - Oscar Isaac |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci13WRN2Sws |publisher=Estrenos de Cine}}</ref>

After Amenábar completed ''[[The Sea Inside]]'' (2004), he took a break and traveled to the island of Malta, where he used his free time to [[Amateur astronomy|explore the night sky]]. Seeing the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, Amenábar began to discuss astronomy with his friends, speculating about [[extraterrestrial life]] on [[extrasolar planet|other planets]].

To prepare for the task of recreating the ancient city of Alexandria without relying on computer generated imagery, Amenábar reviewed older [[sword-and-sandal]] films such as ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), and ''[[Pharaoh (film)|Pharaoh]]'' (1966).<ref name="Billington" /> A year before the start of pre-production, designer [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] spent three weeks with Amenábar in Madrid to do some preliminary work on the set designs and the recreation of the ancient city of Alexandria so that previous animations could be generated.

The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira, with Telecinco Cinema as the primary producer along with Mod Producciones, Himenoptero, and [[Sogecable]] as co-producers.<ref>{{cite news |date=2008-03-13 |title=Agora Starts Shooting Stars |url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=73034 |publisher=4RFV.co.uk}}</ref>

===Critical response===
{{rquote|right|''A visually imposing, high-minded epic that ambitiously puts one of the pivotal moments in Western history onscreen for the first time.''|Todd McCarthy, ''Variety''<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=2009-05-25 |title=Agora |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&jump=review&reviewid=VE1117940282&cs=1 |page=16}}</ref>}}

British writer and film critic [[Peter Bradshaw]], of ''[[The Guardian]]'', praised Alejandro Amenábar and his film, describing ''Agora'' as "an ambitious, cerebral and complex movie.... Unlike most toga movies, it doesn't rely on CGI spectacle, but real drama and ideas." Bradshaw also applauded Rachel Weisz's role as Hypatia, calling it "an outstanding performance".<ref>{{cite news |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Bradshaw |date=2010-04-22 |title=Agora |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/apr/22/agora-review |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |location=London}}</ref>
American screenwriter and critic [[Roger Ebert]] liked the film and gave it three stars out of four. He said: "I went to see ''Agora'' expecting an epic with swords, sandals and sex. I found swords and sandals, some unexpected opinions about sex, and a great deal more."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100721/REVIEWS/100729996/0/SCANNERS|title='Agora' review by Roger Ebert | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

The film holds a 53% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 92 reviews with an average score of 5.7/10.<ref name="rt" />

===Response from Christians===
Before its release, the distribution company insisted on screening the film at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. No objections were reported and Vatican officials assisted in some of the religious depictions. According to Amenábar, "There’s one scene in which Cyril reads from [[Pauline Epistles|St. Paul]] and [the Vatican] tried to look for the softest version. In the English version, [it is] taken from the [[Authorized King James Version|King James version]] of the [[Bible]]."<ref name="Holleran"/> The line is excerpted from {{bibleverse|1 Timothy|2:8-2:12|9}}.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+timothy%202:8-2:12&version=KJV The film uses a partial paraphrase of 1 Timothy 2:8 - 2:12, King James Version]</ref>

The Religious Anti-Defamation Observatory (Observatorio Antidifamación Religiosa), a [[Christianity in Spain|Spanish Catholic]] group, claimed that the film was responsible for "promoting [[anti-Christian sentiment|hatred of Christians]] and reinforcing false clichés about the Catholic Church."<ref name="cna">{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/civil_groups_protest_new_antichristian_film|title=Civil groups protest new anti-Christian film|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]}} See also: [http://www.oadir.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=33 Observatorio Antidifamación Religiosa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013113559/http://www.oadir.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=15&Itemid=33 |date=2009-10-13 }}</ref> Michael Ordoña of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' acknowledges that the film has been criticized for "perceived slights against Christians" but that "its lack of condemnation of specific dogma makes the film's target seem to be fundamentalism in general".<ref>{{cite news |last=Ordoña |first=Michael |date=2010-06-04 |title=Movie review: 'Agora' shows the true casualty of war|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/04/entertainment/la-et-capsules-20100604|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

In contrast, the New York-based Rev. Philip Grey wrote a positive review of the film and strongly recommended it: "Christians who see themselves in the fanatic, murderous monks of the film and feel offended need to do some serious soul-searching. (...) Hypatia as depicted in the film is firmly opposed to what, in her time and at her city, is offered&mdash;or rather, imposed by brute force&mdash;under the name of 'Christianity'. Nevertheless, she seems to me far more a follower of the precepts of Christianity than are her persecutors and tormentors. (...) In particular, in watching the deeply moving final scene, her going calmly to her death amidst the jeering mob, I could not help but strongly recall Jesus Christ on his own way to Golgotha".<ref>Rev. Philip B. Grey, "Real and perceived Christianity in today's mass media and popular culture" in 'Positive Christianity Review', Summer 2010 issue, p. 26,29</ref>

{{Interlanguage link|Antonio Mampaso|es}}, a Spanish astrophysicist and one of ''Agora'''s scientific advisors, stated in an interview that "We know that Hypatia lived in Alexandria in the IV and V centuries CE, until her death in 415. Only three primary sources mention Hypatia of Alexandria, apart from other secondary ones". He added that none of Hypatia's work has survived but it is thought, from secondary sources, that her main fields of study and work were geometry and astronomy. Mampaso claimed that Hypatia invented the [[hydrometer]], an instrument still in use today, and that probably her father [[Theon of Alexandria]], together with Hypatia, invented the [[astrolabe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sacristán|first=Enrique|date=2009-10-28|url=http://www.oei.es/divulgacioncientifica/entrevistas_034.htm|title=Antonio Mampaso: 'El mejor legado de Hipatia es su propia historia'|work=Servicio de Información y Noticias Científicas (SINC)|publisher=[[Organization of Ibero-American States]] (OEI) }}</ref> However, it is generally accepted that the astrolabe had already been invented a couple of centuries earlier, and that the instrument was known to the Greeks before the Christian era.<ref>'It is generally accepted that Greek astrologers, in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE, invented the astrolabe', Krebs, 'Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance', p. 196 (2004).</ref><ref>'The invention of the astrolabe is usually attributed to Hipparchus of the second century BC.

In this regard, [[Pappus of Alexandria]] was recorded as using the hydrometer before Hypatia was even born. [[Synesius]] sent Hypatia a letter describing a hydrometer, and requesting her to have one constructed for him.<ref>"Ep. 15 is rather short, but gives interesting information: it contains a detailed description of a hydroscope which Synesius asks Hypatia to order for him in Alexandria, requesting that she herself oversee its construction.", Kari Vogt, "The Hierophant of Philosophy" - Hypatia of Alexandria, Kari Elisabeth Boerresen and Kari Vogt, Women's studies of the Christian and Islamic traditions: ancient, medieval, and Renaissance foremothers, p. 161 (1993).</ref><ref>'For the sake of completeness we must mention that fact that SYNESIOS in his letter to HYPATIA mentions a hydrometer, which according to some was already known in the fourth century AD to PRISCIANUS, that is a century before SYNESIOS and HYPATIA.', Forbes, 'A Short History of the Art of Distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal', p. 25 (1970).</ref><ref>'In 402, Hypatia receives a letter from the ailing Synesius giving a brief description of what he calls a hydroscope. This is a scientific instrument which was then in common use, although Hypatian is often credited with its invention.', Waithe, 'Ancient women philosophers, 600 B.C.-500 A.D.', p. 192 (1987).</ref> There is no evidence that the historical Hypatia ever studied the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]<ref name="O'Neil"/> or that she ever found any evidence to support it.<ref name="O'Neil"/><ref name="Theodore"/>
