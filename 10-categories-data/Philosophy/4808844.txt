{{short description|American philosopher}}
'''Robert N. Audi''' (born November 1941) is an [[American philosopher]] whose major work has focused on [[epistemology]], [[ethics]] (especially on [[ethical intuitionism]]), [[rationality]] and the [[theory of action]]. He is O'Brien Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and previously held a Chair in the Business School there. His 2005 book, ''The Good in the Right'', updates and strengthens [[W D Ross|Rossian]] intuitionism and develops the epistemology of ethics. He has also written important works of [[political philosophy]], particularly on the relationship between [[church and state]]. He is a past president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]<ref>http://business.nd.edu/RobertAudi/</ref> and the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]].

Audi's contributions to epistemology include his defense of ''[[fallibilistic]] [[foundationalism]]''. Audi has expanded his theory of justification to non-doxastic states, e.g. desires and intentions, by developing a ''comprehensive account of rationality''. A mental state is rational if it is "well-grounded" in a ''source of justification''. Justification can come ''directly'' from experience (e.g. perception) or ''indirectly'' from other mental states that are themselves justified. Rationality is relative to a person's experiences, so what is rational to believe for one person may be irrational to believe for another. Audi has also developed an account of ''autonomy'', which he characterizes as the ''self-governing power'' to bring reasons to bear in directing one's conduct and influencing one's propositional attitudes. ''Self-legislation'' is necessary but not sufficient for autonomy since it lacks the power to govern by itself. Autonomy involves responding to reasons in a principled way by ''endorsing commitments'' to projects and practical principles.

== Life ==
Audi earned his BA from [[Colgate University]] and his MA and PhD from the [[University of Michigan]].  He taught initially at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and then for many years as the Charles J. Mach University Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Nebraska]], Lincoln before moving to [[University of Notre Dame]] as Professor of Philosophy, Professor of Management, and the David E. Gallo Chair in Ethics. In 2009 he vacated the Gallo Chair and took a chair as John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy. He has served as General Editor of the First Edition (1995) and Second Edition (1999) of ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]''. He has also served as the general editor for "Modern Readings in Epistemology", as well as for "Modern readings in Metaphysics".
In an interview for the [[Brooklyn Friends School]] of which he's an alumnus (year 1959), he revealed that his interest in philosophy came from his father, a businessman and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] immigrant with an interest in philosophy and history. His mother, a medical doctor and faculty at [[NYU]] Medical School, was also an influence. "'Both liked to explain and comment on things,' Robert mused, 'and they often entertained people from the diplomatic world and medicine who argued about politics, religion and ideas in general.'"<ref>[http://www.brooklynfriends.org/RelId/611065/ISvars/default/Alum_Profile%3A_Robert.htm "Alum Profile: Robert Audi '59, by Jeffrey Stanley]</ref> Audi was named a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2018.<ref name="AAAS">{{cite web |title=Newly Elected Fellows |url=https://members.amacad.org/content/members/newfellows.aspx?s=a |website=members.amacad.org |accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>

== Epistemology ==
Audi has defended a position he calls "[[fallibilistic]] [[foundationalism]]."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Müller |first1=Jochen |last2=Seidel |first2=Markus |title=Robert Audi: Critical Engagements |date=2018 |publisher=Springer Verlag |pages=43–69 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MLLWIF |chapter=What Is Fallibilist About Audi’s Fallibilist Foundationalism?}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Paxson |first1=Thomas D. |title=Review of The Structure of Justification |journal=Mind |date=1995 |volume=104 |issue=413 |pages=148–151 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2254611 |issn=0026-4423}}</ref> He thinks that the foundationalist response is the only tenable option of the [[epistemic regress]] argument. This states that if every belief has to be justified by some other, then the only options are four: [[infinite regress]], [[Circular definition|circularity]], stopping at a belief that isn't knowledge, and stopping at a basic belief that is itself justified. If the only alternative is the fourth, then if one has knowledge, one has foundational knowledge.
Audi considers that foundationalism is usually taken to be infallible. That is, it is normally associated with the view that knowledge is founded on basic beliefs that are axiomatic and [[logical truth|necessarily true]], and that the rest of knowledge is deduced from this set of beliefs. Audi thinks that foundationalism may be fallible, in the sense that the suprastructure of beliefs may be derived inductively from the basic beliefs, and hence may be fallible. He also thinks that basic beliefs need not be necessary truths, but merely have some structure which makes epistemic transition possible. For example, the belief that one is in the presence of an object arises causally from visual perception.

==Rationality==
The main account of Audi's theory of [[rationality]] is laid out in his book "The Architecture of Reason: The Structure and Substance of Rationality".<ref name="Architecture">{{cite book |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=The Architecture of Reason: The Structure and Substance of Rationality |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDTAO-3}}</ref> He develops a comprehensive account of rationality that covers both the theoretical and the practical side of rationality. Theoretical rationality concerns beliefs and counts towards truth while practical rationality covers desires, intentions, and actions and counts towards goodness.<ref name="Precis">{{cite journal |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=Précis of the Architecture of Reason |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |date=2003 |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=177–180 |doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2003.tb00031.x |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDPOT}}</ref>

===Ground===
The notion of a '''ground''' plays a central role for rationality: a [[mental state]] is rational if it is "well-grounded" in a source of [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]]. For example, the perceptual experience of a tree when looking outside the window can ground the belief that there is a tree outside. A ground can psychologically support a mental state. Mental states may be supported by several grounds at the same time. Audi compares such a mental state to a porch that is supported by various pillars.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|34}} For a mental state to be rational, it has to be ''well-grounded'', i.e. be supported by an ''adequate ground''.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|19}} Irrational mental states, on the other hand, lack a sufficient ground.

===Foundation and superstructure===
Audi is committed to a form of [[foundationalism]]: the idea that justified beliefs, or in his case, rational states in general, can be divided into two groups: the '''foundation''' and the '''superstructure'''.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|13,29-31}} The mental states in the superstructure receive their justification from other rational mental states while the foundational mental states receive their justification from a more basic source. These relations result in a hierarchy: justification is ''conveyed'' from the basic sources to the foundational mental states and ''transmitted'' from the foundational mental states to the mental states in the superstructure.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|16-18}} For example, the above-mentioned belief that there is a tree outside is foundational since it is based on a basic source: perception. Knowing that trees grow in soil, we may deduce that there is soil outside. This belief is equally rational, being supported by an adequate ground, but it belongs to the superstructure since its rationality is grounded in the rationality of another belief. Desires, like beliefs, form a hierarchy: intrinsic desires are at the foundation while instrumental desires belong to the superstructure. In order to link the instrumental desire to the intrinsic desire and extra element is needed: a belief that the fulfillment of the instrumental desire is a means to the fulfillment of the intrinsic desire.<ref name="Haji">{{cite web |last1=Haji |first1=Ish |title=Review of The Architecture of Reason: The Structure and Substance of Rationality |url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/the-architecture-of-reason-the-structure-and-substance-of-rationality/ |website=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews |date=9 March 2002}}</ref> Audi's foundationalism is different from what he terms "[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] foundationalism" in the sense that all justification, including justification from basic sources, is [[Defeater|defeasible]].<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|20-21}} The Cartesian view, on the other hand, ascribes certainty and infallibility to the foundational mental states.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|41-43}} 

===Beliefs and desires===
Audi asserts that all the basic sources providing justification for the foundational mental states come from [[experience]]. As for '''beliefs''', there are four types of experience that act as sources: perception, memory, introspection, and rational intuition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=The Oxford Handbook of Epistemology |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=71–94 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDTSO-3 |chapter=The Sources of Knowledge}}</ref> The main basic source of the rationality of '''desires''', on the other hand, comes in the form of hedonic experience: the experience of pleasure and pain.<ref name="Commitment">{{cite book |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=Rationality and Religious Commitment |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDRAR-2}}</ref>{{rp|20}} So, for example, a desire to eat ice-cream is rational if it is based on experiences in which the agent enjoyed the taste of ice-cream, and irrational if it lacks such a support. Because of its dependence on experience, rationality can be defined as a kind of responsiveness to experience.<ref name="Commitment"/>{{rp|21}}

===Actions===
'''Actions''', in contrast to beliefs and desires, don't have a source of justification of their own. Their rationality is grounded in the rationality of other states instead: in the rationality of beliefs and desires. Desires motivate actions. Beliefs are needed here, as in the case of instrumental desires, to bridge a gap and link two elements.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|62}} The link needed is that the execution of the action will contribute to the fulfillment of the desire.<ref name="Haji"/> So, for example, the intrinsic desire for ice-cream can motivate a person to perform the action of going to the freezer to get some. But in addition a belief is needed: that the freezer contains ice-cream. The rationality of the action depends on the rationality of both the desire and the belief. If there is no good reason to believe that the freezer contains ice-cream then the belief is irrational. Irrational beliefs can't transmit justification, so the action is also irrational.

===Persons===
Audi distinguishes the ''focal'' rationality of individual mental states from the ''global'' rationality of '''persons'''. Global rationality has a derivative status: it depends on the focal rationality.<ref name="Precis" /> Or more precisely: "Global rationality is reached when a person has a sufficiently integrated system of sufficiently well-grounded propositional attitudes, emotions, and actions".<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|232}} This allows for a certain number of irrational attitudes: global rationality doesn't require perfect rationality.

===Truth and relativity===
That a belief is rational doesn't entail that it is '''true'''.<ref name="Haji"/> This is the case, for example, when the experiences that act as the source of a belief are illusory without the subject being aware of this. In such cases, it is rational to have a false belief and it would be irrational to have a true belief.

Rationality is '''relative''' in the sense that it depends on the experience of the person in question. Since different people undergo different experiences, what is rational to believe for one person may be irrational to believe for another person.<ref name="Precis"/>

===Criticism===
Gilbert Harman has criticized Audi's account of rationality because of its reliance on experience as the ultimate source of justification. As he points out, our experience at any moment is very narrow compared to all the unconscious beliefs we carry with us all the time: beliefs about word meanings, acquaintances, historical dates, etc. So our experience at any time can only justify a very small number of the beliefs we have. This would mean that the great majority of our beliefs are irrational most of the time.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harman |first1=Gilbert |title=Review of The Architecture of Reason: The Structure and Substance of Rationality |journal=The Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=212 |pages=457–459 |jstor=3543135 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3543135 |issn=0031-8094}}</ref> This apparent consequence of Audi's account is opposed to the common-sense view that most people are rational at least some if not most of the time.

== Autonomy ==
Robert Audi characterizes [[autonomy]] as the self-governing power to bring reasons to bear in directing one's conduct and influencing one's propositional attitudes.<ref name="Architecture" />{{rp|211-2}}<ref name="Haji"/> Traditionally, autonomy is only concerned with practical matters. But, as Audi's definition suggests, autonomy may be applied to responding to reasons at large, not just to practical reasons. Autonomy is closely related to [[freedom]] but the two can come apart. An example would be a political prisoner who is forced to make a statement in favor of his opponents in order to ensure that his loved ones are not harmed. As Audi points out, the prisoner lacks freedom but still has autonomy since his statement, though not reflecting his political ideals, is still an expression of his commitment to his loved ones.<ref name="Autonomy">{{cite journal |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=Autonomy, Reason, and Desire |journal=Pacific Philosophical Quarterly |date=1991 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=247–271 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0114.1991.tb00320.x |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDARA}}</ref>{{rp|249}}

=== Self-legislation ===
Autonomy is often equated with self-legislation in the [[Kantian]] tradition.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kleingeld |first1=Pauline |last2=Willaschek |first2=Marcus |title=Autonomy Without Paradox: Kant, Self-Legislation and the Moral Law |journal=Philosophers' Imprint |date=2019 |volume=19 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KLEAWP}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Dryden |first1=Jane |title=Autonomy |url=https://iep.utm.edu/autonomy/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref> Self-legislation may be interpreted as laying down laws or principles that are to be followed. Audi agrees with this school in the sense that we should bring reasons to bear in a principled way. Responding to reasons by mere whim may still be considered free but not autonomous.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|249, 257}} A commitment to principles and projects, on the other hand, provides autonomous agents with an identity over time and gives them a sense of the kind of persons they want to be. But autonomy is neutral as to which principles or projects the agent endorses. So different autonomous agents may follow very different principles.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|258}}

=== Self-government ===
But, as Audi points out, self-legislation is not sufficient for autonomy since laws that don't have any practical impact don't constitute autonomy.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|247-8}} Some form of motivational force or executive power is necessary in order to get from mere self-legislation to self-government.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Audi |first1=Robert |title=Weakness of Will and Rational Action |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |date=1990 |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=270–281 |doi=10.1080/00048409012344301 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/AUDWOW}}</ref> This motivation may be inherent in the corresponding practical judgment itself, a position known as ''motivational internalism'', or may come to the practical judgment externally in the form of some desire independent of the judgment, as ''motivational externalism'' holds.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|251-2}}

=== Reasons ===
In the [[Humean]] tradition, intrinsic desires are the reasons the autonomous agent should respond to. This theory is called ''instrumentalism''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cohon |first1=Rachel |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |accessdate=20 November 2020 |date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Setiya |first1=Kieran |title=Hume on Practical Reason |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |date=2004 |volume=18 |pages=365–389 |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2004.00033.x |jstor=3840940 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3840940 |issn=1520-8583}}</ref> Given this outlook, autonomy would be the "capacity to subordinate one’s conduct to one’s strongest desire(s)"<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|259}} with the goal of satisfying as many desires as possible. One of the problems of instrumentalism is that it lacks the resources to distinguish between good and bad intrinsic desires. For example, if someone finds himself with an intrinsic desire to hurt others, instrumentalism recommends that he should try to do so as efficiently as possible. Audi suggests that we should adopt a position known as ''axiological objectivism'' in order to avoid this counterintuitive conclusion.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|261ff}} The central idea of this outlook is that objective values, and not subjective desires, are the sources of normativity and therefore determine what we should do. Reason can, through rational reflection, arrive at ideals of conduct in the light of these objective values, for example, to promote pleasure and to impede pain in oneself and others. The autonomous person would endorse the ideals arrived at and realize them in her behavior.<ref name="Autonomy"/>{{rp|262}}
