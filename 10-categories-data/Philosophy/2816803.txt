Zarathustra was known as a sage, magician and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture, though almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late eighteenth century. By this time his name was associated with lost ancient wisdom and was appropriated by [[Freemasons]] and other groups who claimed access to such knowledge. He appears in Mozart's opera [[The Magic Flute]] ("Die Zauberflöte") under the variant name "Sarastro", who represents moral order in opposition to the "Queen of the Night". [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

===Greco-Persian Era===
Little is known of the situation of philosophy during the time of the ancient Greek philosophers. We know that the Persian culture had influence on the creation of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of thought, but nothing has been left in Persian writings.

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}

[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualistic cosmology]]/[[theology]], which it shared with [[Mazdak]]ism, a philosophy founded by Mazdak. Under this dualism, there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, and man's role in this life was through good conduct to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. Mani saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, while Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

===Mazdakism===
{{main|Mazdak}}
[[File:The Iranian prophet Mazdak being executed.png|thumb|Execution of [[Mazdak]]]]
[[Mazdak]] (d. 524/528 CE) was a proto-[[Socialism|socialist]] Persian reformer who gained influence under the reign of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian]] king [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a [[prophet]] of God, and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs.

In many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]"<ref name="Quran">Wherry, Rev. E. M. "A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran and Preliminary Discourse", 1896. pp 66.</ref> or proto-socialism.<ref name="Manfred">{{Cite book|editor=Manfred, Albert Zakharovich|year=1974|title=A Short History of the World|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=182|others=(translated into English by Katherine Judelson)|oclc=1159025}}</ref>

===Zurvanism===
{{main|Zurvanism}}

[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its First Principle which is Time, "Zurvan", as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought all of which have classical Zurvanism as their foundation:

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]] which was apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind, viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated Time, which, under the influence of desire, divided into reason (a male principle) and concupiscence (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

==Classical Islamic period==
{{see also|Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy}}
The intellectual tradition in [[Persia]] continued after Islam and was of great influence on the further development of Iranian Philosophy. The main schools for such studies were, and to some extents still are, Shiraz, Khurasan, Maragheh, Isfahan, Tehran.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr,"Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy", SUNY Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7914-6799-6}}, Chapters 10-13.</ref>

===Avicennism===
{{main|Avicennism}}
[[File:IbnSinaCanon1.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]''.]]
In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], due to [[Avicenna]]'s (Ibn Sina's; born near [[Bukhara]]) successful reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century. Avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then, and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time:<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]</ref>

{{quote|"People nowadays [believe] that truth is whatever [Ibn Sina] says, that it is inconceivable for him to err, and that whoever contradicts him in anything he says cannot be rational."}}

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particularly his doctrines on the nature of the [[soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in [[Scholasticism|scholastic Europe]]. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], and his [[metaphysics]] influenced the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037)|website=utm.edu}}</ref>

===Illuminationism===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}

[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, along with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

===Transcendent theosophy===
{{main|Transcendent Theosophy}}

[[Transcendent theosophy]] is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Mulla Sadra]] in the 17th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.<ref name=Kamal>{{Cite book|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9 & 39}}</ref>

==Contemporary Iranian philosophy==
{{see also|Modern Islamic philosophy}}

Philosophy was and still is a popular subject of study in Iran. Previous to Western style universities, philosophy was a major field of study in religious seminaries.  Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060322165520/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2245/html/art.htm#53538][https://archive.is/20131204114301/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education]

On the diversity and expansion of philosophy in Iran, [[Khosrow Bagheri]] has stated "One part of philosophical endeavor in Iran today, and perhaps the main one, is concerned with the local philosophy which is dominated by the school of Mulla Sadra. He has provided a philosophy in line with the old metaphysical inclination but in the feature of a combination of mysticism, philosophy, and the Islamic religious views. On the other hand, a relatively strong translation movement has been shaped in which the Iranian readers are provided by some of the important sources of contemporary philosophy in Persian including both the analytic and continental traditions. In the former, Wittgenstein, Searle, and Kripke, and in the latter, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault can be mentioned. There have also been concentrations on a local polar contrast between Popper and Heidegger, and, due to the religious atmosphere, on philosophy of religion."<ref>http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Among journals being published in Iran on philosophy there are ''FALSAFEH-The Iranian Journal of Philosophy''[http://journals.ut.ac.ir/issueuser/AboutUs.aspx?MissID=46]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} published by the department of philosophy of the University of Tehran since 1972 and  ''Hikmat va Falsafeh'' published by Allamah Tabataba'i University in Tehran, ''Ma'rifat-e Falsafeh'' published by the Imam Khomeini Education and Research Institute in Qom, and many others. Also worthy of mention is the journal, ''Naqd o Nazar'' published by Daftar Tablighat in Qom, which often includes articles on philosophical topics and other issues of interest to religious thinkers and intellectuals.

It is important to note that [[Sufism]] has had a great amount of influence on Iranian/Persian philosophy.

In the history of Islamic philosophy, there were a few Persian philosophers who had their own schools of philosophy: [[Avicenna]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. Some philosophers did not offer a new philosophy, rather they had some innovations: Mirdamad, Khajeh Nasir and Qutb al-Din Shirazi belong to this group. Some philosophers had new narration of existing philosophies: Agha Ali Modarres is an example of such philosophers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303040754/http://www.kadivar.com/Index.asp?DocId=305&AC=1&AF=1&ASB=1&AGM=1&AL=1&DT=dtv]

===Greco-Persian Era===
Little is known of the situation of philosophy during the time of the ancient Greek philosophers. We know that the Persian culture had influence on the creation of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of thought, but nothing has been left in Persian writings.

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}

[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualistic cosmology]]/[[theology]], which it shared with [[Mazdak]]ism, a philosophy founded by Mazdak. Under this dualism, there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, and man's role in this life was through good conduct to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. Mani saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, while Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

===Mazdakism===
{{main|Mazdak}}
[[File:The Iranian prophet Mazdak being executed.png|thumb|Execution of [[Mazdak]]]]
[[Mazdak]] (d. 524/528 CE) was a proto-[[Socialism|socialist]] Persian reformer who gained influence under the reign of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian]] king [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a [[prophet]] of God, and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs.

In many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]"<ref name="Quran">Wherry, Rev. E. M.

===Zurvanism===
{{main|Zurvanism}}

[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its First Principle which is Time, "Zurvan", as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought all of which have classical Zurvanism as their foundation:

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]] which was apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind, viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated Time, which, under the influence of desire, divided into reason (a male principle) and concupiscence (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

The intellectual tradition in [[Persia]] continued after Islam and was of great influence on the further development of Iranian Philosophy.

===Avicennism===
{{main|Avicennism}}
[[File:IbnSinaCanon1.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]''.]]
In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], due to [[Avicenna]]'s (Ibn Sina's; born near [[Bukhara]]) successful reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century. Avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then, and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time:<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]</ref>

{{quote|"People nowadays [believe] that truth is whatever [Ibn Sina] says, that it is inconceivable for him to err, and that whoever contradicts him in anything he says cannot be rational."}}

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particularly his doctrines on the nature of the [[soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in [[Scholasticism|scholastic Europe]]. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], and his [[metaphysics]] influenced the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037)|website=utm.edu}}</ref>

===Illuminationism===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}

[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, along with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

===Transcendent theosophy===
{{main|Transcendent Theosophy}}

[[Transcendent theosophy]] is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Mulla Sadra]] in the 17th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.<ref name=Kamal>{{Cite book|title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy|first=Muhammad|last=Kamal|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-5271-8|pages=9 & 39}}</ref>

==Contemporary Iranian philosophy==
{{see also|Modern Islamic philosophy}}

Philosophy was and still is a popular subject of study in Iran. Previous to Western style universities, philosophy was a major field of study in religious seminaries.  Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060322165520/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2245/html/art.htm#53538][https://archive.is/20131204114301/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education]

On the diversity and expansion of philosophy in Iran, [[Khosrow Bagheri]] has stated "One part of philosophical endeavor in Iran today, and perhaps the main one, is concerned with the local philosophy which is dominated by the school of Mulla Sadra. He has provided a philosophy in line with the old metaphysical inclination but in the feature of a combination of mysticism, philosophy, and the Islamic religious views. On the other hand, a relatively strong translation movement has been shaped in which the Iranian readers are provided by some of the important sources of contemporary philosophy in Persian including both the analytic and continental traditions. In the former, Wittgenstein, Searle, and Kripke, and in the latter, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault can be mentioned. There have also been concentrations on a local polar contrast between Popper and Heidegger, and, due to the religious atmosphere, on philosophy of religion."<ref>http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=interviews:islam_philosophy_and_education{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Among journals being published in Iran on philosophy there are ''FALSAFEH-The Iranian Journal of Philosophy''[http://journals.ut.ac.ir/issueuser/AboutUs.aspx?MissID=46]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} published by the department of philosophy of the University of Tehran since 1972 and  ''Hikmat va Falsafeh'' published by Allamah Tabataba'i University in Tehran, ''Ma'rifat-e Falsafeh'' published by the Imam Khomeini Education and Research Institute in Qom, and many others. Also worthy of mention is the journal, ''Naqd o Nazar'' published by Daftar Tablighat in Qom, which often includes articles on philosophical topics and other issues of interest to religious thinkers and intellectuals.

It is important to note that [[Sufism]] has had a great amount of influence on Iranian/Persian philosophy.

In the history of Islamic philosophy, there were a few Persian philosophers who had their own schools of philosophy: [[Avicenna]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. Some philosophers did not offer a new philosophy, rather they had some innovations: Mirdamad, Khajeh Nasir and Qutb al-Din Shirazi belong to this group. Some philosophers had new narration of existing philosophies: Agha Ali Modarres is an example of such philosophers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303040754/http://www.kadivar.com/Index.asp?DocId=305&AC=1&AF=1&ASB=1&AGM=1&AL=1&DT=dtv]

According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]], the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathustra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through [[Judaism]], and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

Throughout [[History of Iran|Iranian history]] and due to remarkable political and social changes such as [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|the Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions, to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after the Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

Zarathustra was the first who treated the problem of evil in philosophical terms.<ref name="Whitley" /> He is also believed to be one of the oldest [[monotheism|monotheists]] in the history of religion{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. He espoused an ethical philosophy based on the primacy of ''good thoughts (andiše-e-nik), good words (goftâr-e-nik), and good deeds (kerdâr-e-nik).''

The works of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on [[Greek philosophy]] and [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosophy]]. Several [[ancient Greek]] writers such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Latin]] writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] praised Zoroastrian philosophy as "the most famous and most useful"{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. [[Plato]] learnt of Zoroastrian philosophy through Eudoxus and incorporated much of it into his own [[Platonic realism]].<ref>A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr.

Zarathustra was known as a sage, magician and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture, though almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late eighteenth century. By this time his name was associated with lost ancient wisdom and was appropriated by [[Freemasons]] and other groups who claimed access to such knowledge. He appears in Mozart's opera [[The Magic Flute]] ("Die Zauberflöte") under the variant name "Sarastro", who represents moral order in opposition to the "Queen of the Night". [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

In 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.<ref>Blackburn, S. (2005). p 409, The Oxford dictionary of philosophy.

Philosophy was and still is a popular subject of study in Iran. Previous to Western style universities, philosophy was a major field of study in religious seminaries.  Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books.

In the history of Islamic philosophy, there were a few Persian philosophers who had their own schools of philosophy: [[Avicenna]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. Some philosophers did not offer a new philosophy, rather they had some innovations: Mirdamad, Khajeh Nasir and Qutb al-Din Shirazi belong to this group. Some philosophers had new narration of existing philosophies: Agha Ali Modarres is an example of such philosophers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303040754/http://www.kadivar.com/Index.asp?DocId=305&AC=1&AF=1&ASB=1&AGM=1&AL=1&DT=dtv]

Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy: Brian Carr and Indira Mahalingam. Routledge, 2009.</ref> can be traced back as far as to [[Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] philosophical traditions and thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]], the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathustra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through [[Judaism]], and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

Throughout [[History of Iran|Iranian history]] and due to remarkable political and social changes such as [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|the Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions, to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after the Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Iranian philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

{{main|Zoroastrianism}}
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Zartosht.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] portrayed in a popular 18th century Indian [[Parsi people|Parsi]] Zoroastrian depiction.]] -->

The teachings of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]] (Zoroaster) appeared in [[Persia]] at some point during the period 1700-1800 BCE.<ref name="Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani">{{cite journal|title=Zarathushtra, Mazdayasna and Governance|author=Jalal-e-din Ashtiyani}}</ref><ref name="Whitley">{{cite journal|title=The Date and Teaching of Zarathustra|author=Whitley, C.F.|pages=219–223|journal=Numen|volume= 4|issue=3|date=Sep 1957|doi=10.2307/3269345}}</ref> His wisdom became the basis of the religion [[Zoroastrianism]], and generally influenced the development of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] branch of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] philosophy. Zarathustra was the first who treated the problem of evil in philosophical terms.<ref name="Whitley" /> He is also believed to be one of the oldest [[monotheism|monotheists]] in the history of religion{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. He espoused an ethical philosophy based on the primacy of ''good thoughts (andiše-e-nik), good words (goftâr-e-nik), and good deeds (kerdâr-e-nik).''

The works of Zoroaster and Zoroastrianism had a significant influence on [[Greek philosophy]] and [[History of Western philosophy|Roman philosophy]]. Several [[ancient Greek]] writers such as [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Latin]] writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] praised Zoroastrian philosophy as "the most famous and most useful"{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. [[Plato]] learnt of Zoroastrian philosophy through Eudoxus and incorporated much of it into his own [[Platonic realism]].<ref>A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116 [111].</ref> In the 3rd century BC, however, [[Colotes]] accused Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' of plagiarizing parts of Zoroaster's [[On Nature (Zoroaster)|On Nature]], such as the [[Myth of Er]].<ref>David N. Livingstone (2002), ''The Dying God: The Hidden History of Western Civilization'', p. 144-145, iUniverse, {{ISBN|0-595-23199-3}}.</ref><ref>A. D. Nock (1929), "''Studien zum antiken Synkretismus aus Iran und Griechenland'' by R. Reitzenstein, H. H. Schaeder, Fr. Saxl", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''49''' (1), p. 111-116.</ref>

Zarathustra was known as a sage, magician and miracle-worker in post-Classical Western culture, though almost nothing was known of his ideas until the late eighteenth century. By this time his name was associated with lost ancient wisdom and was appropriated by [[Freemasons]] and other groups who claimed access to such knowledge. He appears in Mozart's opera [[The Magic Flute]] ("Die Zauberflöte") under the variant name "Sarastro", who represents moral order in opposition to the "Queen of the Night". [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writers such as [[Voltaire]] promoted research into Zoroastrianism in the belief that it was a form of rational [[Deism]], preferable to [[Christianity]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

In 2005, the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy ranked Zarathustra as first in the chronology of philosophers.<ref>Blackburn, S. (2005). p 409, The Oxford dictionary of philosophy. Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Frankfort, H., Frankfort, H. A. G., Wilson, J. A., & Jacobsen, T. (1964). Before Philosophy. Penguin, Harmondsworth.</ref> Zarathustra's impact lingers today due in part to the system of rational ethics he founded called Mazda-Yasna. The word Mazda-Yasna is [[Avestan]] and is translated as "Worship of Wisdom" in English. The encyclopedia [[Natural History (Pliny)]] claims that Zoroastrians later educated the Greeks who, starting with [[Pythagoras]], used a similar term, philosophy, or “love of wisdom” to describe the search for ultimate truth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|title=Pliny Natural History Vol 8; Book XXX|last=Jones|first=W.H.S.|date=1963|publisher=Heinemann|access-date=December 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101063545/http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20XXX|archive-date=2017-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Greco-Persian Era===
Little is known of the situation of philosophy during the time of the ancient Greek philosophers. We know that the Persian culture had influence on the creation of [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school of thought, but nothing has been left in Persian writings.

===Manichaeism===
{{main|Manichaeism}}

[[Manichaeism]], founded by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], was influential from [[North Africa]] in the West, to [[China]] in the East. Its influence subtly continues in Western Christian thought via Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], who converted to Christianity from Manichaeism, which he passionately denounced in his writings, and whose writings continue to be influential among Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox [[theology|theologians]]. An important principle of Manichaeism was its [[dualistic cosmology]]/[[theology]], which it shared with [[Mazdak]]ism, a philosophy founded by Mazdak. Under this dualism, there were two original principles of the universe: Light, the good one; and Darkness, the evil one. These two had been mixed by a cosmic accident, and man's role in this life was through good conduct to release the parts of himself that belonged to Light. Mani saw the mixture of good and bad as a cosmic tragedy, while Mazdak viewed this in a more neutral, even optimistic way.

===Mazdakism===
{{main|Mazdak}}
[[File:The Iranian prophet Mazdak being executed.png|thumb|Execution of [[Mazdak]]]]
[[Mazdak]] (d. 524/528 CE) was a proto-[[Socialism|socialist]] Persian reformer who gained influence under the reign of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanian]] king [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh I]]. He claimed to be a [[prophet]] of God, and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs.

In many ways Mazdak's teaching can be understood as a call for social [[revolution]], and has been referred to as early "[[communism]]"<ref name="Quran">Wherry, Rev. E. M. "A Comprehensive Commentary on the Quran and Preliminary Discourse", 1896. pp 66.</ref> or proto-socialism.<ref name="Manfred">{{Cite book|editor=Manfred, Albert Zakharovich|year=1974|title=A Short History of the World|publisher=Progress Publishers|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=182|others=(translated into English by Katherine Judelson)|oclc=1159025}}</ref>

===Zurvanism===
{{main|Zurvanism}}

[[Zurvanism]] is characterized by the element of its First Principle which is Time, "Zurvan", as a primordial creator. According to Zaehner, Zurvanism appears to have three schools of thought all of which have classical Zurvanism as their foundation:

====Aesthetic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Aesthetic Zurvanism|Aesthetic Zurvanism]] which was apparently not as popular as the ''materialistic'' kind, viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated Time, which, under the influence of desire, divided into reason (a male principle) and concupiscence (a female principle).

====Materialist Zurvanism====
While Zoroaster's [[Ahura Mazda|Ormuzd]] created the universe with his thought, [[Zurvanism#Materialist Zurvanism|materialist Zurvanism]] challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing.

====Fatalistic Zurvanism====
[[Zurvanism#Fatalistic Zurvanism|Fatalistic Zurvanism]] resulted from the doctrine of limited time with the implication that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe and that the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. According to the [[Middle Persian]] work [[Menog-i Khrad]]: "[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets."

==Classical Islamic period==
{{see also|Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy}}
The intellectual tradition in [[Persia]] continued after Islam and was of great influence on the further development of Iranian Philosophy. The main schools for such studies were, and to some extents still are, Shiraz, Khurasan, Maragheh, Isfahan, Tehran.<ref>Seyyed Hossein Nasr,"Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy", SUNY Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7914-6799-6}}, Chapters 10-13.</ref>

===Avicennism===
{{main|Avicennism}}
[[File:IbnSinaCanon1.jpg|thumb|Manuscript of [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine|Canon of Medicine]]''.]]
In the [[Islamic Golden Age]], due to [[Avicenna]]'s (Ibn Sina's; born near [[Bukhara]]) successful reconciliation between [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] along with [[Kalam]], Avicennism eventually became the leading school of [[Islamic philosophy]] by the 12th century. Avicenna had become a central authority on philosophy by then, and several scholars in the 12th century commented on his strong influence at the time:<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), p. 80-81, "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]</ref>

{{quote|"People nowadays [believe] that truth is whatever [Ibn Sina] says, that it is inconceivable for him to err, and that whoever contradicts him in anything he says cannot be rational."}}

Avicennism was also influential in [[medieval Europe]], particularly his doctrines on the nature of the [[soul]] and his [[existence]]-[[essence]] distinction, along with the debates and censure that they raised in [[Scholasticism|scholastic Europe]]. This was particularly the case in [[Paris]], where Avicennism was later [[proscribed]] in 1210. Nevertheless, his [[psychology]] and theory of knowledge influenced [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]] and [[Albertus Magnus]], and his [[metaphysics]] influenced the thought of [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm#H5|title=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980-1037)|website=utm.edu}}</ref>

===Illuminationism===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}

[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient Iranian philosophy, along with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

In the history of Islamic philosophy, there were a few Persian philosophers who had their own schools of philosophy: [[Avicenna]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. Some philosophers did not offer a new philosophy, rather they had some innovations: Mirdamad, Khajeh Nasir and Qutb al-Din Shirazi belong to this group. Some philosophers had new narration of existing philosophies: Agha Ali Modarres is an example of such philosophers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110303040754/http://www.kadivar.com/Index.asp?DocId=305&AC=1&AF=1&ASB=1&AGM=1&AL=1&DT=dtv]
