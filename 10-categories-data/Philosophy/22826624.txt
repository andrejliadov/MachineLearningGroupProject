'''Dianoia''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:διάνοια|διάνοια]], ''[[ratio]]'' in Latin) is a term used by [[Plato]] for a type of [[thinking]], specifically about mathematical and technical subjects. It is the capacity for, process of, or result of discursive thinking, in contrast with the immediate apprehension that is characteristic of [[noesis]]. In [[Aristotle]], knowledge is further divided into the theoretical ([[episteme]]), and the practical, which includes [[techne]] and [[phronesis]].

Dianoia is also the [http://www.iciam.org/dianoia quarterly newsletter] of the [[International Council for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]].
