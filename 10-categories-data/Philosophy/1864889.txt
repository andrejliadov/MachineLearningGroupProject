'''Cosmology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] κόσμος, ''kosmos'' "world" and -λογία, ''-logia'' "study of") is a branch of [[astronomy]] concerned with the studies of the origin and evolution of the [[universe]], from the [[Big Bang]] to today and on into the [[future]]. It is the [[Scientific method|scientific study]] of the [[Chronology of the universe|origin, evolution, and eventual fate]] of the [[universe]]. [[Physical cosmology]] is the scientific study of the universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and its [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate]], as well as the [[laws of science]] that govern these areas.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9988-instant-expert-cosmology.html "Introduction: Cosmology – space"].

[[Physics]] and [[astrophysics]] have played a central role in shaping the understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment. [[Physical cosmology]] was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe. The universe is generally understood to have begun with the [[Big Bang]], followed almost instantaneously by [[cosmic inflation]]; an [[metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] from which the universe is thought to have emerged [[Age of the universe|13.799 ± 0.021]] [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago.<ref name="Planck 2015">{{cite journal|author=Planck Collaboration|title=Planck 2015 results.

Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities. This is exemplified by [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s observation that a man's place in that relationship: "He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is, and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists, does not know who he is, nor what the world is."<ref>{{Cite book | title = The thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antonius viii. 52 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15877/15877-h/15877-h.htm#viii._52}}</ref>

===Physical cosmology===
{{Main|Physical cosmology}}
Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the Universe. It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as "[[celestial mechanics]]", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.

[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]—that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.

Modern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper "Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst Öpik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.

{{Physical cosmology}}
In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way<!-- and has galaxies of their own--><!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.-->.

Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[redshift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].

Since around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the "golden age of cosmology".<ref>[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411071615/https://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html |date=11 April 2016 }}</ref>

| Hierarchical universe
| [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Lambert]], 18th century
| Static (evolving), steady state, infinite
| Matter is clustered on ever larger scales of hierarchy. Matter is endlessly recycled.
|-
| [[Static universe|Einstein Universe with a cosmological constant]]
| [[Albert Einstein]], 1917
| Static (nominally). Bounded (finite)
| "Matter without motion". Contains uniformly distributed matter. Uniformly curved spherical space; based on [[Riemann sphere|Riemann's hypersphere]]. Curvature is set equal to Λ. In effect Λ is equivalent to a repulsive force which counteracts gravity. Unstable.
|-
| [[De Sitter universe]]
| [[Willem de Sitter]], 1917
| [[Metric expansion of space|Expanding]] [[shape of the universe|flat space]].
Steady state.
Λ > 0
| "Motion without matter." Only apparently static. Based on Einstein's [[general relativity]]. Space expands with constant [[accelerating universe|acceleration]]. [[Scale factor (universe)|Scale factor]] increases exponentially (constant [[cosmic inflation|inflation]]).
|-
| MacMillan universe
| [[William Duncan MacMillan]] 1920s
| Static and steady state
| New matter is created from [[radiation]]; starlight perpetually recycled into new matter particles.
|-
| [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann universe]], spherical space
| [[Alexander Friedmann]] 1922
| Spherical expanding space.
''k'' = +1 ; no Λ
| Positive curvature. Curvature constant ''k'' = +1
[[Metric expansion of space|Expands]] then [[Big Crunch|recollapses]]. [[shape of the universe|Spatially closed]] (finite).
|-
| [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann universe]], hyperbolic space
| [[Alexander Friedmann]], 1924
| [[Hyperbolic space|Hyperbolic]] expanding space.
''k'' = −1 ; no Λ
| [[Shape of the universe|Negative curvature]]. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). Unbounded. Expands forever.
|-
| [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis]]
| [[Paul Dirac]] 1930s
| Expanding
| Demands a large variation in ''G'', which decreases with time. Gravity weakens as universe evolves.
|-
| Friedmann zero-curvature
| Einstein and De Sitter, 1932
| Expanding flat space
''k'' = 0 ; Λ = 0
Critical density
| Curvature constant ''k'' = 0. Said to be infinite (but ambiguous). "Unbounded cosmos of limited extent". Expands forever. "Simplest" of all known universes. Named after but not considered by Friedmann. Has a [[deceleration parameter|deceleration term]] ''q'' = 1/2, which means that its expansion rate slows down.
|-
| The original [[Big Bang]] (Friedmann-Lemaître)
| [[Georges Lemaître]] 1927–29
| Expansion
Λ > 0 ; Λ > |Gravity|
| Λ is positive and has a magnitude greater than gravity. Universe has initial high-density state ("primeval atom"). Followed by a two-stage expansion. Λ is used to destabilize the universe. (Lemaître is considered the father of the Big Bang model.)
|-
| [[Oscillating universe]] (Friedmann-Einstein)
| Favored by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]], 1920s
| Expanding and contracting in cycles
| Time is endless and beginningless; thus avoids the beginning-of-time paradox. Perpetual cycles of Big Bang followed by Big Crunch. (Einstein's first choice after he rejected his 1917 model.)
|-
| Eddington universe
| [[Arthur Eddington]] 1930
| First static then expands
| Static Einstein 1917 universe with its instability disturbed into expansion mode; with relentless matter dilution becomes a De Sitter universe. Λ dominates gravity.
|-
| [[Milne universe]] of kinematic relativity
| [[Edward Arthur Milne|Edward Milne]], 1933, 1935;
[[William H. McCrea]], 1930s
| Kinematic expansion without space expansion
| Rejects general relativity and the expanding space paradigm. Gravity not included as initial assumption. Obeys cosmological principle and [[special relativity]]; consists of a finite spherical cloud of particles (or galaxies) that expands within an infinite and otherwise empty flat space. It has a center and a cosmic edge (surface of the particle cloud) that expands at light speed. Explanation of gravity was elaborate and unconvincing.
|-
| [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] class of models
| [[Howard Percy Robertson|Howard Robertson]], [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker|Arthur Walker]], 1935
| Uniformly expanding
| Class of universes that are homogeneous and isotropic. Spacetime separates into uniformly curved space and cosmic time common to all co-moving observers. The formulation system is now known as the FLRW or Robertson–Walker metrics of cosmic time and curved space.
|-
| [[Steady state theory|Steady-state]]
| [[Hermann Bondi]], [[Thomas Gold]], 1948
| Expanding, steady state, infinite
| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. Continuous creation out of nothing from nowhere. Exponential expansion. Deceleration term ''q'' = −1.
|-
| Steady-state
| [[Fred Hoyle]] 1948
| Expanding, steady state; but unstable
| Matter creation rate maintains constant density. But since matter creation rate must be exactly balanced with the space expansion rate the system is unstable.
|-
| [[Ambiplasma]]
| [[Hannes Alfvén]] 1965 [[Oskar Klein]]
| Cellular universe, expanding by means of matter–antimatter annihilation
| Based on the concept of [[plasma cosmology]]. The universe is viewed as "meta-galaxies" divided by [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]] and thus a bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic matter-[[antimatter]] [[annihilation]]s keep the bubbles separated and moving apart preventing them from interacting.
|-
| [[Brans–Dicke theory]]
| [[Carl H. Brans]], [[Robert H. Dicke]]
| Expanding
| Based on [[Mach's principle]]. ''G'' varies with time as universe expands. "But nobody is quite sure what Mach's principle actually means."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
|-
| [[Cosmic inflation]]
| [[Alan Guth]] 1980
| [[Big Bang]] modified  to solve [[horizon problem|horizon]] and [[flatness problem]]s
| Based on the concept of hot inflation. The universe is viewed as a multiple quantum flux – hence its bubble-like nature. Other universes are formed from other bubbles. Ongoing cosmic expansion kept the bubbles separated and moving apart.
|-
| [[Chaotic inflation theory|Eternal inflation]] (a multiple universe model)
| [[Andrei Linde|Andreï Linde]], 1983
| Big Bang with [[cosmic inflation]]
| [[Multiverse]] based on the concept of cold inflation, in which inflationary events occur at random each with independent initial conditions; some expand into bubble universes supposedly like our entire cosmos. Bubbles nucleate in a [[Quantum foam|spacetime foam]].
|-
| [[Cyclic model]]
| [[Paul Steinhardt]]; [[Neil Turok]] 2002
| Expanding and contracting in cycles; [[M-theory]].
| Two parallel [[orbifold]] planes or [[Membrane (M-theory)|M-branes]] collide periodically in a higher-dimensional space. With [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or [[dark energy]].
|-
| [[Cyclic model]]
| Lauris Baum; [[Paul Frampton]] 2007
| Solution of [[Richard Tolman|Tolman]]'s entropy problem
| [[Phantom energy|Phantom dark energy]] fragments universe into large number of disconnected patches. Our patch contracts containing only dark energy with zero [[entropy]].

Table notes: the term "static" simply means not expanding and not contracting. Symbol ''G'' represents Newton's [[gravitational constant]]; Λ (Lambda) is the [[cosmological constant]].
