The '''American Philosophical Society''' ('''APS'''), founded in 1743 in [[Philadelphia]], is a scholarly organization that promotes knowledge in the sciences and humanities through research, professional meetings, publications, library resources, and community outreach. Considered the first learned society in the United States, it has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life for over 270 years.

Through research grants, published journals, the American Philosophical Society Museum, an extensive library, and regular meetings, the society continues to advance a variety of disciplines in the humanities and the sciences. [[Philosophical Hall]], now a museum, is just east of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Independence National Historical Park]]; it was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.

[[Linda Greenhouse]], Knight Distinguished Journalist in Residence and Joseph Goldstein Lecturer in Law at Yale Law School, was elected president of the American Philosophical Society in 2017.<ref>https://www.amphilsoc.org/elected-members#paragraph-311</ref> She was elected to the Society in 2001.

[[Robert M. Hauser]], Vilas Research Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, became Executive Officer of the American Philosophical Society in 2017.<ref>https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/american-philosophical-society-announces-appointment-robert-mason-hauser-executive-officer</ref> He was elected to the Society in 2005.

==History==
The '''Philosophical Society''', as it was originally called, was founded in 1743 by [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Alexander (lawyer)]], [[Francis Hopkinson]], [[John Bartram]], [[Philip Syng|Philip Syng, Jr.]] and others<ref>Duer, William Alexander. [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwilliamale00duerw#page/4/mode/2up ''The life of William Alexander, Earl of Stirling, Major-General in the Army of the United States during the Revolution''] New York: Wiley & Putnam for the New Jersey Historical Society, 1847. p.5</ref><ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/biography/14388.html "Philip Syng, Jr."], Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved 31 December 2015.</ref> as an offshoot of an earlier club, the [[Junto (club)|Junto]].

Early members included [[John Dickinson]], [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]],<ref name="AAA">{{cite web | year=2011 | title=American Philosophical Society selected records, 1784–1954 | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-philosophical-society-selected-records-10947 | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James McHenry]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Rittenhouse]], [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], [[Owen Biddle, Sr.|Owen Biddle]], [[Benjamin Rush]], [[James Madison]], [[Michael Hillegas]], [[John Marshall]], and [[John Andrews (clergyman)|John Andrews]]. 

It was common at the time for intellectual societies to invite members from around the world. And so the society recruited members from other countries, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]], the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Baron von Steuben]], [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], and [[Princess Dashkova]].

The society lapsed into inactivity by 1746, but in 1767 it was revived. On January 2, 1769, it united with the American Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge under the name '''American Philosophical Society Held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge'''. Franklin was elected the first president.<ref>[[New International Encyclopedia]]</ref> During this time, the society maintained a standing Committee on American Improvements; one of its investigations was to study the prospects for a canal to connect the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodrich|first=Carter|title=Government Promotion of American Canals and Railroads, 1800–1890|year=1974|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0837177731}}</ref> The [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]], which had been proposed by Thomas Gilpin,&nbsp;Sr., was built in the 1820s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kozel |first=Scott M. |title=Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C & D Canal) |url=http://www.pennways.com/CD_Canal.html |work=PENNWAYS: Roads to the Future |publisher=Scott M.

After the [[American Revolution]], the society looked for leadership to [[Francis Hopkinson]], one of the signatories of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Under his influence, the society received land from the government of Pennsylvania, along with a plot of land in Philadelphia, where Philosophical Hall now stands.

[[Charles Darwin]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Louis Pasteur]], [[Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz]], [[John James Audubon]], [[Linus Pauling]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Maria Mitchell]], and [[Thomas Edison]] became members of the society. It continues to attract scholars today, with 920 members as of 2005, including 772 resident members (citizens or residents of the United States) and 148 foreign members representing more than two dozen countries.

Many members of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] were among the APS's first board members and contributors; the APS and SOC still maintain an informal, collegial relationship.

==Awards==
In 1786, the society established the [[Magellanic Premium]], a prize for achievement in "navigation, [[astronomy]], or natural philosophy," the oldest scientific prize awarded by an American institution, which it still awards. Other awards include the Barzun Prize for [[cultural history]], the Judson Daland Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Clinical Investigation, the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (American Philosophical Society)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]], the [[Lashley Award]] for [[neurobiology]], the Lewis Award, and the Thomas Jefferson Medal for distinguished achievement in the arts, humanities, or social sciences.

==Publications, archive==
The APS has published the ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' since 1771. Five issues appear each year. The ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|Proceedings]]'' have appeared since 1838; they publish the papers delivered at the society's biannual meetings. The society has also published the collected papers of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Joseph Henry]], [[William Penn]], and [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]]. [[Jane Aitken]] bound 400 volumes for the society.{{sfn|James|1971|p=26}}

The society also has an expansive archive on framer of the [[U.S. constitution]] [[John Dickinson]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John H.

The museum features works of art, scientific instruments, original manuscripts, rare books, natural history specimens, and curiosities of all kinds from the APS's own collections, along with objects on loan from other institutions.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=American Philosophical Society Museum: About |publisher=ARTINFO |year=2008 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/22252/8770/about/american-philosophical-society-philadelphia/ |accessdate=2008-07-25 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Library Hall===
[[Image:American Philosophical Society Library Hall reading room.jpg|thumb|left|Reading room for researchers at Library Hall (2019)]]
In 1789–90, the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] (LCP) built its headquarters directly across 5th Street from APS. In 1884 LCP sold its building, which was demolished for the expansion of the Drexel & Company Building in 1887. This building was demolished in the mid-1950s, during the creation of Independence National Historical Park.

APS built a library on the site in 1958, and recreated the facade of the old LCP building. 

According to historical ghost stories, Franklin's spirit haunts the library, and his statue at the front of the building "comes to life and dances in the streets."<ref name=History.com>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/historical-ghost-stories |title=History of Ghost Stories |author=History.com Editors |date=October 29, 2009 |website=History |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=7 February 2019}}</ref>
