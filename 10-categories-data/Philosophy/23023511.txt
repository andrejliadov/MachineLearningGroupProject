'''British philosophy''' refers to the [[philosophical]] tradition of the [[British people]]. "The native characteristics of British philosophy are these: common sense, dislike of complication, a strong preference for the concrete over the abstract and a certain awkward honesty of method in which an occasional pearl of poetry is embedded".<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Philosophers|last=Matthews|first=Kenneth|publisher=William Collins|year=1943|location=Great Britain|pages=7}}</ref>

[[File:Anselm of Canterbury.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A colourised 16th-century portrait of Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury]]
Saint Anselm of Canterbury (c. 1033 – 1109) was an important philosopher and theologian of the Catholic Church, who held the office of [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] from 1093 to 1109. Anselm is famed as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God and of the satisfaction theory of atonement. Anselm's works are considered philosophical as well as theological since they endeavour to render Christian tenets of faith, traditionally taken as a revealed truth, as a rational system.{{sfnp|Davies & al.|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&pg=PA2 2]}}

===William of Sherwood===
{{Main|William of Sherwood}}
William of Sherwood ({{circa|lk=no|1200|1272}}) was a [[medieval]] [[English people|English]] [[scholastic philosopher]], [[logician]], and teacher. Little is known of his life, but he is thought to have studied in [[Paris]] and he was a master at [[Oxford]] in 1252.  He was the author of two books which were an important influence on the development of [[scholastic logic]]: ''Introductiones in Logicam'' (Introduction to Logic), and ''[[Syncategorematic term|Syncategoremata]]''. These are the first known works to deal in a systematic way with what is now called [[supposition theory]], and were influential on the development of logic in both England and on the continent.  According to [[Roger Bacon]], Sherwood was among "the more famous wise men of Christendom", of whom he names another as [[Albertus Magnus]].  Bacon judged Sherwood to be "much wiser than Albert".<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Bacon |author-first=Roger |chapter=Preface |title=Fr.

===Duns Scotus===
{{Main|Duns Scotus}}
John Duns Scotus (c. 1265 – 8 November 1308) was an important philosopher and theologian of the [[High Middle Ages]]. Scotus was born around 1265,<ref>Brampton 'Duns Scotus at Oxford, 1288-1301', Franciscan Studies, 24 (1964) 17.</ref> at [[Duns, Scottish Borders|Duns]], in [[Berwickshire]], [[Scotland]]. In 1291 he was ordained as a priest in [[Northampton, England|Northampton]], [[England]]. A note in Codex 66 of [[Merton College, Oxford]], records that Scotus "flourished at [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], [[Oxford, England|Oxford]] and [[Paris]]". He died in [[Cologne]] in 1308. He is buried in the "Minoritenkirche", the Church of the [[Franciscans]] (or Minor Friars) in Cologne. He was [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 20 March 1993.

Nicknamed ''Doctor Subtilis'' (''the subtle doctor''), he is well known for the "univocity of being," the formal distinction, and the idea of [[haecceity]].  The univocity of being holds that existence is the most abstract concept we have and is applicable to everything that exists. The formal distinction is a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing such that the distinction is intermediate between what is merely conceptual, and what is fully real or mind-independent. Haecceity (from the [[Latin]] ''haecceitas'') is the idea of "thisness," a concept which denotes the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a thing which make it a particular thing.

===William of Ockham===
{{Main|William of Ockham}}
William of Ockham (c. 1288 – c. 1348) was an [[England|English]] [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]]. He is perhaps most well known for his principle of parsimony, famously known as [[Occam's razor]].  This actual term is claimed not to appear in his writings,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/02/11/what-ockham-really-said.html |title=What Ockham really said |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> but rather summarizes the principle he expressed in passages such as ''[[q:William of Occam|Numquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necessitate]] [Plurality must never be posited without necessity]''<ref>'Sentences of Peter Lombard', ''Quaestiones et decisiones in quattuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi'' (ed.

==Early modern period==

===Francis Bacon===
{{Main|Francis Bacon}}
[[File:Somer Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Francis Bacon]]
Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was an Englishman who was a [[politician|statesman]], [[scientist]], [[lawyer]], [[jurist]] and [[author]] in addition to being a philosopher. He famously died of pneumonia contracted while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat.  He served both as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. Although his political career ended in disgrace, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the [[scientific method]] and pioneer in the [[scientific revolution]].

Bacon has been called the father of empiricism.<ref>[http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm Home | Sweet Briar College] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708012140/http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm |date=July 8, 2013 }}. Psychology.sbc.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.</ref> His works established and popularized deductive methodologies for [[science|scientific]] inquiry, often called the ''[[Baconian method]]'' or simply, the [[scientific method]]. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper [[methodology]] today. His dedication probably led to his death, so bringing him into a rare historical group of scientists who were killed by their own experiments.

===Thomas Hobbes===
{{Main|Thomas Hobbes}}
Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) was an English philosopher, remembered today for his work on [[political philosophy]]. His 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' established the foundation for most of Western political philosophy from the perspective of [[social contract]] theory.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Hobbes's Moral and Political Philosophy |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/}} . Retrieved March 11, 2009.</ref>

Hobbes was a  champion of absolutism for the sovereign but he also developed some of the fundamentals  of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between [[civil society]] and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of  law which  leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.<ref>Pierre Manent, ''An Intellectual History of Liberalism'' (1994) pp 20–38</ref>

Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of fields, including [[history]], [[geometry]], physics of [[gas]]es, [[theology]], [[ethics]], general philosophy, and [[political science]]. His account of human nature as self-interested cooperation has proved to be an enduring theory in the field of [[philosophical anthropology]]. He was one of the key founders of philosophical [[materialism]].

===The classic trio of British empiricists===
The three 'classic' British [[empiricism|empiricists]] in the early modern era were John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The term "British empiricism" refers to the philosophical tradition in Britain that was epitomised by these thinkers (though this tradition did have precursors in Britain stretching back to [[Roger Bacon]]). Berkeley, despite being Irish, was referred to as British as [[County Kilkenny]], where he lived in [[Ireland]], was a part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] at the time.

====John Locke====
{{Main|John Locke}}
[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|John Locke]]
John Locke (1632–1704) was an empiricist at the beginning of the [[Modern philosophy|Modern period]] of philosophy.  As such (and in contrast to [[René Descartes]]), he held that all of the objects of the understanding are ideas, where ideas exist in the mind.  One of his goals in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' is to trace the origin of ideas.  There are no innate ideas “stamped upon the mind” from birth, and all knowledge is rooted in experience.  Further, there are also ''simple ideas'' and ''complex ideas''.  Simple ideas enter by the senses, and they are simple and unmixed.  Complex ideas are simple ideas that have been combined and related together using the abstracting activity of the mind.

Locke is also responsible for an early theory of [[personal identity]]. He thought that our being the same person from one time to another consists, not in our having the same soul or the same body, but rather the same series of psychological connections. For Locke, to be a person is to be an intelligent thinking being that can know itself as itself, the same thinking thing in different times and places.

====George Berkeley====
{{Main|George Berkeley}}
George Berkeley (1685–1753) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] philosopher who served as [[Bishop of Cloyne]] from 1734 until his death.  He was a British [[Empiricism|empiricist]],<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/berkeley/ Berkeley, George] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208050311/http://www.iep.utm.edu/berkeley/ |date=2015-12-08 }} – [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]</ref> an [[Immaterialism|immaterialist]], and an [[idealism|idealist]]. Many of his most important ideas were first put forth in ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'', a work which was critical of John Locke's philosophy.  Berkeley agreed with Locke that there was an outside world which caused the ideas within the mind, but Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world was also composed solely of ideas. Berkeley thought that the ideas that we possessed could only resemble other ideas (not physical objects) and thus the external world consisted not of physical form, but rather of ideas. This world was given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley concluded was God.

Berkeley is famous for his motto ''"esse est percipi aut percipere"'', or otherwise, ''"to exist is to be perceived, or to perceive"''.  This means that there are no things other than ideas and the minds that house them.  There is no such thing as a mind-independent entity.

====David Hume====
{{Main|David Hume}}
{{See also|Scottish Enlightenment}}
David Hume (1711–1776) was a Scottish [[philosopher]], [[economist]], and [[historian]].  His major works, ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' (1739–1740), the ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1748), ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (1751), and ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) remain widely influential.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved May 15, 2010</ref> His ideas regarding free will and determinism, causation, personal identity, induction, and morality still inspire discussion.

Hume famously described the [[problem of induction]]. He argues that [[inductive reasoning]] cannot be rationally employed, since, in order to justify induction, one would either have to provide a sound deductive argument or an inductively strong argument.  But there is no sound deductive argument for induction, and to ask for an inductive argument to justify induction would be to [[Begging the question|beg the question]].

Hume's problem of causation is related to his problem of induction. He held that there is no empirical access to the supposed necessary connection between cause and effect. In seeking to justify the belief that A causes B, one would point out that, in the past, B has always closely followed A in both space and time. But the special necessary connection that is supposed to be causation is never given to us in experience.  We only observe a constant conjunction of events, with no necessity whatsoever.

In personal identity, Hume was a [[bundle theory|bundle theorist]].  He said that there is no robust self to which properties adhere.  Experience only shows us that there is only a bundle of perceptions.

===Adam Smith===
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
Adam Smith (1723–1790) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Ethics|moral philosopher]] and a pioneer of [[political economy|political economics]]. Smith wrote ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' and ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. The latter, usually abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of [[economics]]. Smith is widely cited as the father of modern economics.

Smith studied [[moral philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at [[Glasgow]] teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''.

==19th century==

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Jeremy Bentham}}
Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) is well known for beginning the tradition of classical utilitarianism in Britain.  [[Utilitarianism]] is a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] theory of [[normative ethics]] which holds that an act is morally right if and only if that act maximizes happiness or pleasure.  Classical utilitarianism is said to be hedonistic because it regards pleasure as the only intrinsic good and pain as the only intrinsic evil.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/ "Consequentialism" at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>

Utilitarianism was described by Bentham as "the ''greatest happiness'' or ''greatest felicity'' principle".<ref name="BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples">AN INTRODUCTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS AND LEGISLATION, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (“printed” in 1780, “first published” in 1789, "corrected by the Author" in 1823.)  See Chapter I: Of the Principle of Utility.  For Bentham on animals, see Ch. XVII Note 122.</ref> Bentham's utilitarianism is known for arguing that the [[felicific calculus]] should be used to determine the rightness and wrongness of acts.  It does this by measuring the amount of pain and pleasure for various acts.  Bentham thought that pleasure and pain be broke down in distinct units called hedons and dolors.

===John Stuart Mill===
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
[[File:John Stuart Mill by London Stereoscopic Company, c1870.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|John Stuart Mill]]
John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was an influential contributor to [[social theory]], [[political theory]], and [[political economy]]. His conception of  [[liberty]] justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state control.<ref>{{cite web

| quote       = On Liberty is a rational justification of the freedom of the individual in opposition to the claims of the state to impose unlimited control and is thus a defence of the rights of the individual against the state.}}</ref>

Mill also continued Bentham's tradition of advancing and defending utilitarianism.  Mill's book ''Utilitarianism'' is a philosophical defense of utilitarianism. The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861; the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863.

===Henry Sidgwick===
{{Main|Henry Sidgwick}}
Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900) also focused on utilitarian ethics and was one of the founders and first president of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], was a member of the [[Metaphysical Society]], and promoted the [[Female education|higher education of women]].  ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'' is a book on [[utilitarianism]] written by Sidgwick that was first published in 1874.<ref>[http://homepage.newschool.edu/het//profiles/sidgwick.htm "Henry Sidgwick, 1838-1900" at The History of Economic Thought  Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807182704/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/sidgwick.htm |date=2010-08-07 }} Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>  The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' indicates that ''The Methods of Ethics'' "in many ways marked the culmination of the classical utilitarian tradition."  Well-known contemporary utilitarian philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has said that the ''Methods'' "is simply the best book on ethics ever written."<ref>[http://www.normativeethics.com/interviews/singer.html Peter Singer - Interview at NormativeEthics.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714194546/http://www.normativeethics.com/interviews/singer.html |date=2011-07-14 }} Retrieved April 10, 2011</ref>

===British idealism===
{{Main|British idealism}}
As an area of [[absolute idealism]], British idealism was a philosophical movement that was influential in Britain from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century. Important representatives included [[T. H. Green]], [[F. H. Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], [[H. H. Joachim]], [[J. H. Muirhead]], and [[G. R. G. Mure]]. Two British philosophers, [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], were brought up in this tradition and then reacted against it by pioneering [[analytic philosophy]].

==20th century and beyond==

===Analytic philosophy===
Analytic philosophy was based on traditional British empiricism, updated to accommodate the new developments in logic pioneered by German mathematician [[Gottlob Frege]]. It has dominated philosophy in the English-speaking world since the early 20th century.

====G. E. Moore====
{{Main|G. E. Moore}}

George Edward Moore (1873–1958) was an English philosopher. One of the founders of the [[analytic tradition]], he led the British 'revolt against idealism' at the turn of the twentieth century, along with Bertrand Russell - while Russell is better known, he stated that it was in fact Moore who "led the way".<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521872720&ss=exc Analytic Philosophy And Return Hegelian Thought :: Philosophy: general interest :: Cambridge University Press]. Cambridge.org. Retrieved on 2013-07-29.</ref>

Moore is best known today for his defence of [[ethical non-naturalism]], his emphasis on [[common sense]] in philosophical method, and the [[Moore's paradox|paradox that bears his name]]. He was admired by and influential among other philosophers, and also by the [[Bloomsbury Group]], but is (unlike his  colleague Russell) mostly unknown today outside of academic philosophy. Moore's essays are known for his clear, circumspect writing style, and for his methodical and patient approach to philosophical problems. He was critical of philosophy for its lack of [[Philosophical progress|progress]], which he believed was in stark contrast to the dramatic advances in the [[natural sciences]] since the [[Renaissance]].  He often praised the analytic reasoning of [[Thales of Miletus]], an early Greek philosopher, for his analysis of the meaning of the term "[[landscaping]]".  Moore thought Thales' [[reasoning]] was one of the few historical examples of philosophical inquiry resulting in practical advances.  Among his most famous works are his book ''[http://fair-use.org/g-e-moore/principia-ethica Principia Ethica]'', and his essays, "The Refutation of Idealism", "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", and "A Proof of the External World".

He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1918 to 1919.<ref>[http://www.aristoteliansociety.org.uk/about/the-council/ The Aristotelian Society – The Council]</ref>

====Bertrand Russell====
{{Main|Bertrand Russell}}
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) led the British "revolt against [[idealism]]" in the early 1900s, along with G. E. Moore. He was influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]], and was the mentor of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He is widely held to be one of the 20th century's premier logicians.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/ "Bertrand Russell" at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philososophy] Retrieved May 15, 2010</ref> He co-authored, with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a set of [[axiom]]s using [[rule of inference|rules of inference]] in [[symbolic logic]]. His philosophical essay "[[On Denoting]]" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy."<ref>Ludlow, Peter, "Descriptions", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/descriptions/].</ref> Both works have had a considerable influence on [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[set theory]], [[linguistics]], and philosophy.

Russell's [[theory of descriptions]] has been profoundly influential in the [[philosophy of language]] and the analysis of [[definite description]]s.  His theory was first developed in his 1905 paper "On Denoting".

Russell was a prominent [[anti-war]] [[activism|activist]]; he championed [[free trade]] and [[anti-imperialism]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Richard Rempel|year=1979|title=From Imperialism to Free Trade: Couturat, Halevy and Russell's First Crusade|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=40|issue=3|pages=423–443|doi=10.2307/2709246|jstor=2709246|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russell|title=Political Ideals|publisher=Routledge|orig-year=1917|year=1988|isbn=0-415-10907-8}}</ref> Russell went to prison for his pacifist activism during World War I. Later, he campaigned against [[Adolf Hitler]], then criticised [[Stalinist]] [[totalitarianism]], attacked the United States of America's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], and finally became an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear disarmament]].<ref name="Gallery">[http://russell.mcmaster.ca/~bertrand/ The Bertrand Russell Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928232717/http://russell.mcmaster.ca/~bertrand/ |date=2011-09-28 }}</ref>

In 1950, Russell was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions [[humanitarian]] ideals and [[freethought|freedom of thought]]."<ref name="nobel prize">The Nobel Foundation (1950).

====A. J. Ayer====
{{Main|A. J. Ayer}}
Sir Alfred Jules Ayer (29 October 1910, London – 27 June 1989, London), better known as A. J. Ayer or "Freddie" to friends, was a British analytic philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

====Ordinary language philosophy====
{{Main|Ordinary language philosophy}}
Ordinary language philosophy is a philosophical school that approaches traditional philosophical problems as rooted in [[:wikt:Misunderstanding|misunderstandings]] that philosophers develop by forgetting what words mean in their everyday use.

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical theories in favour of close attention to the detail of everyday language. Sometimes also called "Oxford philosophy", it is generally associated with the work of a number of mid-century [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professors: mainly [[J. L. Austin]], but also [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[H. L. A. Hart]], and [[P.F. Strawson]].

It was a major philosophic school between 1930 and 1970.

===Contemporary times===
Recent British philosophers particularly active in the [[philosophy of religion]] have included [[Antony Flew]], [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[John Hick]].

Important moral and political philosophers have included [[R. M. Hare]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Roger Scruton]]. 

Other recent figures in the British analytic tradition include [[David Wiggins]], [[Derek Parfit]], and [[P. F. Strawson]], who have focused on fields such as [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[logic]], and the [[philosophy of language]].
