A '''miracle''' is an event not explicable by [[physical laws|natural]] or [[scientific law]]s.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/miracle?q=miracle Miracle]</ref> Such an event may be attributed to a [[supernatural]] being (especially a [[deity]]), [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], a [[thaumaturgy|miracle worker]], a [[saint]], or a religious leader.

Informally, the word ''miracle'' is often used to characterise any beneficial event that is statistically unlikely but not contrary to the [[laws of science|laws of nature]], such as surviving a [[natural disaster]], or simply a "wonderful" occurrence, regardless of likelihood. Some [[coincidence]]s may be seen as miracles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halbersam |first=Yitta |title=Small Miracles |publisher=Adams Media |year=1890 |isbn=1-55850-646-2}}</ref>

A true miracle would, by definition, be a non-natural phenomenon, leading many writers to dismiss them as physically impossible (that is, requiring violation of established laws of physics within their domain of validity) or impossible to confirm by their nature (because all possible physical mechanisms can never be ruled out). The former position is expressed for instance by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the latter by [[David Hume]]. [[Theologian]]s typically say that, with [[divine providence]], God regularly works through nature yet, as a creator, is free to work without, above, or against it as well.<ref name="Miracles">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/ Miracles] on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>...

===Law of truly large numbers===
{{main|Law of truly large numbers|Littlewood's law}}
Statistically "impossible" events are often called miracles. For instance, when three classmates accidentally meet in a different country decades after having left school, they could consider this as "miraculous". However, a colossal number of events happen every moment on earth; thus extremely unlikely coincidences also happen every moment. Events that are considered "impossible" are therefore not impossible at all &mdash; they are just increasingly rare and dependent on the number of individual events. British mathematician [[J. E. Littlewood]] suggested that individuals should statistically expect one-in-a-million events ("miracles") to happen to them at the rate of about one per month. By Littlewood's definition, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace.

==Supernatural explanations==
A miracle is a phenomenon not explained by known [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Criteria for classifying an event as a miracle vary. Often a [[religious text]], such as the [[Bible]] or [[Quran]], states that a miracle occurred, and believers may accept this as a fact.

We should not treat them as having no cause or of having a cause immediately available. Rather the miracle is for combating the ignorance it entails, like a political project.{{clarify|date=July 2014}}

====David Hume====
{{Main|Of Miracles}}
According to the philosopher [[David Hume]], a miracle is "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent".<ref name="Miracles" /> The crux of his argument is this: "No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact which it endeavours to establish." Hume defines miracles as "a violation of the laws of nature", or more fully, "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent." By this definition, a miracle goes against our regular experience of how the universe works. As miracles are single events, the evidence for them is always limited and we experience them rarely. On the basis of experience and evidence, the probability that miracle occurred is always less than the probability that it did not occur. As it is rational to believe what is more probable, we are not supposed to have a good reason to believe that a miracle occurred.

====Friedrich Schleiermacher====
According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] "every event, even the most natural and usual, becomes a miracle as soon as the religious view of it can be the dominant".<ref>{{cite book|title=On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despirers|year=1893|location=London|publisher=Paul, Trench, Trubner|page=23|chapter=Second Speech: The Nature of Religion}}</ref>

====Søren Kierkegaard====
The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], following Hume and [[Johann Georg Hamann]], a Humean scholar, agrees with Hume's definition of a miracle as a transgression of a law of nature,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1198939 Hume and Kierkegaard] by Richard Popkin</ref> but Kierkegaard, writing as his pseudonym ''Johannes Climacus'', regards any historical reports to be less than certain, including historical reports of miracles, as all historical knowledge is always doubtful and open to approximation.<ref>[http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletters/Newsletter43.pdf Kierkegaard on Miracles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606165846/http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletters/Newsletter43.pdf |date=2010-06-06 }}</ref>

====James Keller====
[[James Keller]] states that "The claim that God has worked a miracle implies that God has singled out certain persons for some benefit which many others do not receive implies that God is unfair."<ref>Keller, James. "A Moral Argument against Miracles", Faith and Philosophy. vol. 12, no 1. Jan 1995. 54–78</ref>

==Religious views==
According to a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, more than 90 percent of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]] believe miracles still take place.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/the-story-of-god-with-morgan-freeman/articles/what-do-the-worlds-religions-say-about-miracles/|title=What Do the World's Religions Say About Miracles?|date=2016-04-28|work=National Geographic Channel|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref> While Christians see God as sometimes intervening in human activities, Muslims see Allah as a direct cause of all events.

===Buddhism===
{{main|Miracles of Gautama Buddha|}}
The ''Haedong Kosung-jon'' of Korea (Biographies of High Monks) records that King [[Beopheung of Silla]] had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", [[Ichadon]], devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527 CE.<ref>Korea: a religious history, James Huntley Grayson, p. 34</ref>

The ''[[Honchō Hokke Reigenki]]'' (c. 1040) of Japan contains a collection of Buddhist miracle stories.<ref>Keene, Donald. ''Twenty Plays of the Nō Theater.'' Columbia University Press, New York, 1970. Page 238.</ref>

Miracles play an important role in the veneration of Buddhist relics in Southern Asia. Thus, Somawathie Stupa in Sri Lanka is an increasingly popular site of pilgrimage and tourist destination thanks to multiple reports about miraculous rays of light, apparitions and modern [[legend]]s, which often have been fixed in photographs and movies.

The scene shows a saint intervening to make a slave who is about to be martyred invulnerable.]]
The gospels record three sorts of miracles performed by Jesus: exorcisms, cures, and nature wonders.<ref name = "ActJIntro">[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]] and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The acts of Jesus: the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1998. Introduction, p. 1–40</ref> In the [[Gospel of John]] the miracles are referred to as "signs" and the emphasis is on God demonstrating his underlying normal activity in remarkable ways.<ref>see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne|Polkinghorne]] op cit. and a commentary on the Gospel of John, such as [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]'s ''Readings in St John's Gospel'' (see e.g. p. 33) or [[Tom Wright (theologian)|Tom Wright]]'s ''John for Everyone''</ref> In the New Testament, the greatest miracle is the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the event central to Christian faith.

Jesus explains in the [[New Testament]] that miracles are performed by [[faith]] in God. "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'move from here to there' and it will move." ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 17:20). After Jesus returned to heaven, the Book of Acts records the disciples of Jesus praying to God to grant that miracles be done in his name for the purpose of convincing onlookers that he is alive. ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:29–31).

Other passages mention [[false prophet]]s who will be able to perform miracles to deceive "if possible, even the elect of Christ" (Matthew 24:24). 2 Thessalonians 2:9 says, "And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved." Revelation 13:13,14 says, "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live." Revelation 16:14 says, "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." Revelation 19:20 says, "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." These passages indicate that signs, wonders, and miracles are not necessarily committed by God. These miracles not committed by God are labeled as false(pseudo) miracles though which could mean that they are deceptive in nature and are not the same as the true miracles committed by God.

In [[early Christianity]] miracles were the most often attested motivations for conversions of [[pagan]]s; pagan Romans took the existence of miracles for granted; Christian texts reporting them offered miracles as divine proof of the Christian God's unique claim to authority, relegating all other gods to the lower status of ''[[daimon]]es'':<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire, AD 100-400'' 1984:23, 108.</ref> "of all worships, the Christian best and most particularly advertised its miracles by [[Exorcism|driving out of spirits]] and [[laying on of hands]]".<ref>MacMullen 1984:40.</ref> The [[Gospel of John]] is structured around miraculous "signs": The success of the Apostles according to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] lay in their miracles: "though laymen in their language", he asserted, "they drew courage from divine, miraculous powers".<ref>Quoted in MacMullen 1984:22.</ref> The [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] by a miraculous sign in heaven is a prominent fourth-century example.
 
Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], miracles have often needed to be rationalized: [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Norman Geisler]], [[William Lane Craig]], and other 20th-century Christians have argued that miracles are reasonable and plausible. For example, Lewis said that a miracle is something that comes totally out of the blue. If for thousands of years a woman can become pregnant only by sexual intercourse with a man, then if she were to become pregnant without a man, it would be a miracle.<ref>{{cite web| title =Are Miracles Logically Impossible?| publisher =Come Reason Ministries, Convincing Christianity| url =http://www.comereason.org/phil_qstn/phi060.asp| accessdate =2007-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title ="Miracles are not possible," some claim.

There have been numerous claims of miracles by people of most Christian denominations, including but not limited to [[faith healing]]s and [[exorcism|casting out demon]]s. Miracle reports are especially prevalent in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] churches.

====Catholic Church====

The [[Catholic Church]] believes miracles are works of [[God]], either directly, or through the prayers and [[intercession of saints|intercessions]] of a specific [[saint]] or saints. There is usually a specific purpose connected to a miracle, e.g. the conversion of a person or persons to the Catholic faith or the construction of a church desired by God. The Church says that it tries to be very cautious to approve the validity of putative miracles. The Catholic Church says that it maintains particularly stringent requirements in validating the miracle's authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982807,00.html |publisher = Pathfinder.com|title = Modern Miracles Have Strict Rules|date= 10 April 1995|last = Van Biema|first = David|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713212401/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982807,00.html|archive-date = 13 July 2007}}</ref> The process is overseen by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=3664|website = 30giorni.it|title = The necessity of miracles|date = 2004|last = Falasca|first = Stefania|access-date = 2006-12-13|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084326/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=3664|archive-date = 2007-09-29|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The Catholic Church has listed several events as miracles, some of them occurring in modern times. Before a person can be accepted as a saint, they must be posthumously confirmed to have performed two miracles. In the procedure of [[Beatification and canonisation of Pope John Paul II|beatification of Pope John Paul II]], who died in 2005, the Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that [[Pope Benedict XVI]] had confirmed that the recovery of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre from [[Parkinson's disease]] was a miracle.<ref name="BBC-beatify">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12191423|title=Pope Benedict Paves Way to Beatification of John Paul II|work=bbc.news.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=14 January 2011}}</ref>

Among the more notable miracles approved by the Church are several [[Eucharistic miracle]]s wherein the [[sacramental bread]] and wine are [[transubstantiation|transformed into Christ's flesh and blood]], such as the [[Miracle of Lanciano]] and cures in [[Lourdes]].

According to 17th century documents, a young Spanish [[miracle of Calanda|man's leg was miraculously restored]] to him in 1640 after having been amputated two and a half years earlier.<ref>[[Messori, Vittorio]] (2000): Il miracolo. Indagine sul più sconvolgente prodigio mariano. – Rizzoli: Bur.</ref>

Another miracle approved by the Church is the [[Miracle of the Sun]], which is said to have occurred near [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fátima, Portugal]] on October 13, 1917. According to legend, between 70,000 and 100,000 people, who were gathered at a [[Cova da Iria|cove]] near Fátima, witnessed the sunlight dim and change colors, and the Sun spin, dance about in the sky, and appear to plummet to earth, radiating great heat in the process. After the ten-minute event, the ground and the people's clothing, which had been drenched by a previous rainstorm, were both dry.

[[Velankanni]] (Mary) can be traced to the mid-16th century and is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Christ]] Child to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the rescue of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors from a violent sea storm.<ref>[http://www.vailankannishrine.org/miracle.php Velankanni shrine miracle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128052924/http://vailankannishrine.org/miracle.php |date=2011-01-28 }}</ref>

In addition to these, the Catholic Church attributes miraculous causes to many otherwise inexplicable phenomena on a case-by-case basis. Only after all other possible explanations have been asserted to be inadequate will the Church assume ''divine intervention'' and declare the miracle worthy of veneration by their followers. The Church does not, however, enjoin belief in any extra-Scriptural miracle as an [[creed|article of faith]] or as necessary for [[salvation]].

[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], a prominent [[Doctor of the Church]], divided miracles into three types in his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'':<blockquote>These works that are done by God outside the usual order assigned to things are wont to be called miracles: because we are astonished (''admiramur'') at a thing when we see an effect without knowing the cause. And since at times one and the same cause is known to some and unknown to others, it happens that of several who see an effect, some are astonished and some not: thus an astronomer is not astonished when he sees an eclipse of the sun, for he knows the cause; whereas one who is ignorant of this [[science]] must needs wonder, since he knows not the cause. Wherefore it is wonderful to the latter but not to the former. Accordingly a thing is wonderful simply, when its cause is hidden simply: and this is what we mean by a miracle: something, to wit, that is wonderful in itself and not only in respect of this person or that. Now God is the cause which is hidden to every man simply: for we have proved above that in this state of life no man can comprehend Him by his intellect. Therefore properly speaking miracles are works done by God outside the order usually observed in things.

Of these miracles there are various degrees and orders. The <span style="color:red;">highest degree</span> in miracles comprises those works wherein something is done by God, that nature can never do: for instance, that two bodies occupy the same place, that the sun recede or stand still, that the sea be divided and make way to passers by. Among these there is a certain order: for the greater the work done by God, and the further it is removed from the capability of nature, the greater the miracle: thus it is a greater miracle that the sun recede, than that the waters be divided.

The <span style="color:red;">second degree</span> in miracles belongs to those whereby God does something that nature can do, but not in the same order: thus it is a work of nature that an animal live, see and walk: but that an animal live after being dead, see after being blind, walk after being lame, this nature cannot do, but God does these things sometimes by a miracle. Among these miracles also, there are degrees, according as the thing done is further removed from the faculty of nature.

The <span style="color:red;">third degree</span> of miracles is when God does what is wont to be done by the operation of nature, but without the operation of the natural principles: for instance when by the power of God a man is cured of a fever that nature is able to cure; or when it rains without the operation of the principles of nature.<ref>{{cite book|title=Contra Gentiles, lib.

====Evangelicalism====
For a majority of [[Evangelical]] Christians, [[biblicism]] ensures that the miracles described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer.<ref>Sébastien Fath, ''Du ghetto au réseau: Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005'', Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 28</ref><ref>James Innell Packer, Thomas C.

In Hinduism, miracles are focused on episodes of liberation of the spirit.<ref name="Wonder">{{cite book

}}</ref> A key example is the revelation of [[Krishna]] to [[Arjuna]], wherein Krishna persuades Arjuna to rejoin the battle against his cousins by briefly and miraculously giving Arjuna the power to see the true scope of the Universe, and its sustainment within Krishna, which requires divine vision. This is a typical situation in Hindu mythology wherein "wondrous acts are performed for the purpose of bringing spiritual liberation to those who witness or read about them."<ref name="Wonder"/>

Hindu sages have criticized both expectation and reliance on miracles as cheats, situations where people have sought to earn a benefit without doing the work necessary to merit it.<ref name="Wonder"/> Miracles continue to be occasionally reported in the practice of Hinduism, with an example of a miracle modernly reported in Hinduism being the [[Hindu milk miracle]] of September 1995, with additional occurrences in 2006 and 2010, wherein statues of certain Hindu deities were seen to drink milk offered to them.The scientific explanation for the incident, attested by Indian academics, was that the material was wicked from the offering bowls by [[capillary action]].

In the [[Quran]], a miracle can be defined as a supernatural intervention in the life of human beings.<ref name="EoQ-Miracle">Denis Gril, ''Miracles'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]</ref> According to this definition, miracles are present "in a threefold sense: in sacred [[history]], in connection with [[Muhammad]] himself and in relation to [[revelation in Islam|revelation]]".<ref name="EoQ-Miracle"/> The Quran does not use the technical [[Arabic]] word for miracle (''Muʿd̲j̲iza'') literally meaning "that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents". It rather uses the term 'Ayah' (literally meaning sign).<ref name="EoI-Miracle">A.J. Wensinck, ''Muʿd̲j̲iza'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopedia of Islam]]</ref> The term ''Ayah'' is used in the Quran in the above-mentioned threefold sense: it refers to the "verses" of the Quran (believed to be the divine speech in [[Natural language|human language]]; presented by Muhammad as his chief miracle); as well as to miracles of it and the signs (particularly those of creation).<ref name="EoQ-Miracle"/><ref name="EoI-Miracle"/>

To defend the possibility of miracles and God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes, some medieval [[Islamic theology|Muslim theologians]] such as [[Al-Ghazali]] rejected the idea of [[Causality|cause and effect]] in essence, but accepted it as something that facilitates humankind's investigation and comprehension of natural processes. They argued that the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were "re-created" at every instant by God. Thus if the soil was to fall, God would have to create and re-create the accident of heaviness for as long as the soil was to fall. For Muslim theologians, the laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes: customs of God.<ref>Robert G. Mourison, The Portrayal of Nature in a Medieval Quran Commentary, Studia Islamica, 2002</ref>

[[Sufi]] biographical literature records claims of miraculous accounts of men and women. The miraculous prowess of the Sufi holy men includes ''firasa'' ([[clairvoyance]]), the ability to disappear from sight, to become completely invisible and practice ''buruz'' ([[exteriorization]]). The holy men reportedly tame wild beasts and traverse long distances in a very short time span. They could also produce food and rain in seasons of drought, heal the sick and help barren women conceive.<ref name="sufi">[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nWa8y-HiB0C&pg=PA48 The heirs of the prophet: charisma and religious authority in Shi'ite Islam By Liyakatali Takim]</ref><ref>[http://www.sufismjournal.org/history/history.html SAINTS AND MIRACLES]</ref>

===Judaism===
Descriptions of miracles (Hebrew ''Ness, נס'') appear in the [[Tanakh]]. Examples include prophets, such as [[Elijah]] who performed miracles like the [[Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath|raising of a widow's dead son]] (1 Kings 17:17–24) and [[Elisha]] whose miracles include multiplying the poor widow's jar of oil (2 Kings 4:1–7) and [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|restoring to life]] the son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:18–37). The [[Torah]] describes many miracles related to [[Moses]] during his time as a prophet and [[the Exodus]] of the Israelites. [[Crossing the Red Sea|Parting the Red Sea]], and facilitating the [[Plagues of Egypt]] are among the most famous.

During the first century BCE, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in [[Iudaea Province|Judea]]. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of [[Moses]], [[Elijah]], and [[Elisha]], the Jewish prophets. The Talmud provides some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, one of whom is [[Honi HaM'agel]], who was famous for his ability to successfully pray for rain.<ref>Mishnah [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] 3:8 [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h29.htm Hebrew text at Mechon-Mamre]</ref>

A '''miracle''' is an event not explicable by [[physical laws|natural]] or [[scientific law]]s.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/miracle?q=miracle Miracle]</ref> Such an event may be attributed to a [[supernatural]] being (especially a [[deity]]), [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], a [[thaumaturgy|miracle worker]], a [[saint]], or a religious leader.

Informally, the word ''miracle'' is often used to characterise any beneficial event that is statistically unlikely but not contrary to the [[laws of science|laws of nature]], such as surviving a [[natural disaster]], or simply a "wonderful" occurrence, regardless of likelihood. Some [[coincidence]]s may be seen as miracles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halbersam |first=Yitta |title=Small Miracles |publisher=Adams Media |year=1890 |isbn=1-55850-646-2}}</ref>

A true miracle would, by definition, be a non-natural phenomenon, leading many writers to dismiss them as physically impossible (that is, requiring violation of established laws of physics within their domain of validity) or impossible to confirm by their nature (because all possible physical mechanisms can never be ruled out). The former position is expressed for instance by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the latter by [[David Hume]]. [[Theologian]]s typically say that, with [[divine providence]], God regularly works through nature yet, as a creator, is free to work without, above, or against it as well.<ref name="Miracles">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/miracles/ Miracles] on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>...

===Law of truly large numbers===
{{main|Law of truly large numbers|Littlewood's law}}
Statistically "impossible" events are often called miracles. For instance, when three classmates accidentally meet in a different country decades after having left school, they could consider this as "miraculous". However, a colossal number of events happen every moment on earth; thus extremely unlikely coincidences also happen every moment. Events that are considered "impossible" are therefore not impossible at all &mdash; they are just increasingly rare and dependent on the number of individual events. British mathematician [[J. E. Littlewood]] suggested that individuals should statistically expect one-in-a-million events ("miracles") to happen to them at the rate of about one per month. By Littlewood's definition, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace.

==Supernatural explanations==
A miracle is a phenomenon not explained by known [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. Criteria for classifying an event as a miracle vary. Often a [[religious text]], such as the [[Bible]] or [[Quran]], states that a miracle occurred, and believers may accept this as a fact.

===Philosophical explanations===

====Aristotelian and Neo-Aristotelian====
The [[Aristotelian view of God]] has God as pure actuality<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adamson |first1=Peter |title=The Theology of Aristotle |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/theology-aristotle/ |website=stanford.edu |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> and considers him as the prime mover doing only what a perfect being can do, think.<ref>{{cite web |title=ARISTOTLE ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD |url=http://www.logicmuseum.com/ontological/aristotleontological.htm |website=logicmuseum.com |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref> [[Jew]]ish neo-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[philosophy|philosophers]],<ref name="Afterman 2016 p. 102">{{cite book | last=Afterman | first=A. | title="And They Shall Be One Flesh": On The Language of Mystical Union in Judaism | publisher=Brill | series=Supplements to The Journal of Jewish Thought and Philosophy | year=2016 | isbn=978-90-04-32873-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOEzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA102 | access-date=31 July 2018 | page=102}}</ref> who are still influential today, include [[Maimonides]], [[Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon]], and [[Gersonides]].

====Baruch Spinoza====
{{See also|Epistemic theory of miracles}}
In his ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'' [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] claims<ref>{{cite book|author=Benedictus de Spinoza|others=translated by Robert Willis|title=Thelogico-Political Treatise|chapter=Chapter 6: Of Miracles|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Theologico-Political_Treatise_1862/Chapter_6}}</ref> that miracles are merely lawlike events whose causes we are ignorant of. We should not treat them as having no cause or of having a cause immediately available. Rather the miracle is for combating the ignorance it entails, like a political project.{{clarify|date=July 2014}}

====David Hume====
{{Main|Of Miracles}}
According to the philosopher [[David Hume]], a miracle is "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent".<ref name="Miracles" /> The crux of his argument is this: "No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact which it endeavours to establish." Hume defines miracles as "a violation of the laws of nature", or more fully, "a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent." By this definition, a miracle goes against our regular experience of how the universe works. As miracles are single events, the evidence for them is always limited and we experience them rarely. On the basis of experience and evidence, the probability that miracle occurred is always less than the probability that it did not occur. As it is rational to believe what is more probable, we are not supposed to have a good reason to believe that a miracle occurred.

====Friedrich Schleiermacher====
According to the [[Christian theologian]] [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] "every event, even the most natural and usual, becomes a miracle as soon as the religious view of it can be the dominant".<ref>{{cite book|title=On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despirers|year=1893|location=London|publisher=Paul, Trench, Trubner|page=23|chapter=Second Speech: The Nature of Religion}}</ref>

====Søren Kierkegaard====
The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], following Hume and [[Johann Georg Hamann]], a Humean scholar, agrees with Hume's definition of a miracle as a transgression of a law of nature,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1198939 Hume and Kierkegaard] by Richard Popkin</ref> but Kierkegaard, writing as his pseudonym ''Johannes Climacus'', regards any historical reports to be less than certain, including historical reports of miracles, as all historical knowledge is always doubtful and open to approximation.<ref>[http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletters/Newsletter43.pdf Kierkegaard on Miracles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606165846/http://www.stolaf.edu/collections/kierkegaard/newsletters/Newsletter43.pdf |date=2010-06-06 }}</ref>

====James Keller====
[[James Keller]] states that "The claim that God has worked a miracle implies that God has singled out certain persons for some benefit which many others do not receive implies that God is unfair."<ref>Keller, James. "A Moral Argument against Miracles", Faith and Philosophy. vol. 12, no 1. Jan 1995. 54–78</ref>

==Religious views==
According to a 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, more than 90 percent of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]] believe miracles still take place.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/the-story-of-god-with-morgan-freeman/articles/what-do-the-worlds-religions-say-about-miracles/|title=What Do the World's Religions Say About Miracles?|date=2016-04-28|work=National Geographic Channel|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}</ref> While Christians see God as sometimes intervening in human activities, Muslims see Allah as a direct cause of all events. "God’s overwhelming closeness makes it easy for Muslims to admit the miraculous in the world."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Miracle|publisher=Cambridge|year=2011}}</ref> 

===Buddhism===
{{main|Miracles of Gautama Buddha|}}
The ''Haedong Kosung-jon'' of Korea (Biographies of High Monks) records that King [[Beopheung of Silla]] had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", [[Ichadon]], devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527 CE.<ref>Korea: a religious history, James Huntley Grayson, p. 34</ref>

The ''[[Honchō Hokke Reigenki]]'' (c. 1040) of Japan contains a collection of Buddhist miracle stories.<ref>Keene, Donald. ''Twenty Plays of the Nō Theater.'' Columbia University Press, New York, 1970. Page 238.</ref>

Miracles play an important role in the veneration of Buddhist relics in Southern Asia. Thus, Somawathie Stupa in Sri Lanka is an increasingly popular site of pilgrimage and tourist destination thanks to multiple reports about miraculous rays of light, apparitions and modern [[legend]]s, which often have been fixed in photographs and movies.

Introduction, p. 1–40</ref> In the [[Gospel of John]] the miracles are referred to as "signs" and the emphasis is on God demonstrating his underlying normal activity in remarkable ways.<ref>see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne|Polkinghorne]] op cit. and a commentary on the Gospel of John, such as [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]]'s ''Readings in St John's Gospel'' (see e.g. p. 33) or [[Tom Wright (theologian)|Tom Wright]]'s ''John for Everyone''</ref> In the New Testament, the greatest miracle is the [[resurrection of Jesus]], the event central to Christian faith.

Jesus explains in the [[New Testament]] that miracles are performed by [[faith]] in God. "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'move from here to there' and it will move." ([[Gospel of Matthew]] 17:20). After Jesus returned to heaven, the Book of Acts records the disciples of Jesus praying to God to grant that miracles be done in his name for the purpose of convincing onlookers that he is alive. ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:29–31).

Other passages mention [[false prophet]]s who will be able to perform miracles to deceive "if possible, even the elect of Christ" (Matthew 24:24). 2 Thessalonians 2:9 says, "And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved." Revelation 13:13,14 says, "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live." Revelation 16:14 says, "For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." Revelation 19:20 says, "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." These passages indicate that signs, wonders, and miracles are not necessarily committed by God. These miracles not committed by God are labeled as false(pseudo) miracles though which could mean that they are deceptive in nature and are not the same as the true miracles committed by God.

In [[early Christianity]] miracles were the most often attested motivations for conversions of [[pagan]]s; pagan Romans took the existence of miracles for granted; Christian texts reporting them offered miracles as divine proof of the Christian God's unique claim to authority, relegating all other gods to the lower status of ''[[daimon]]es'':<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianizing the Roman Empire, AD 100-400'' 1984:23, 108.</ref> "of all worships, the Christian best and most particularly advertised its miracles by [[Exorcism|driving out of spirits]] and [[laying on of hands]]".<ref>MacMullen 1984:40.</ref> The [[Gospel of John]] is structured around miraculous "signs": The success of the Apostles according to the church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] lay in their miracles: "though laymen in their language", he asserted, "they drew courage from divine, miraculous powers".<ref>Quoted in MacMullen 1984:22.</ref> The [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|conversion of Constantine]] by a miraculous sign in heaven is a prominent fourth-century example.
 
Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], miracles have often needed to be rationalized: [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Norman Geisler]], [[William Lane Craig]], and other 20th-century Christians have argued that miracles are reasonable and plausible. For example, Lewis said that a miracle is something that comes totally out of the blue. If for thousands of years a woman can become pregnant only by sexual intercourse with a man, then if she were to become pregnant without a man, it would be a miracle.<ref>{{cite web| title =Are Miracles Logically Impossible?| publisher =Come Reason Ministries, Convincing Christianity| url =http://www.comereason.org/phil_qstn/phi060.asp| accessdate =2007-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title ="Miracles are not possible," some claim.

There have been numerous claims of miracles by people of most Christian denominations, including but not limited to [[faith healing]]s and [[exorcism|casting out demon]]s. Miracle reports are especially prevalent in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|Charismatic]] churches.

====Catholic Church====

The [[Catholic Church]] believes miracles are works of [[God]], either directly, or through the prayers and [[intercession of saints|intercessions]] of a specific [[saint]] or saints. There is usually a specific purpose connected to a miracle, e.g. the conversion of a person or persons to the Catholic faith or the construction of a church desired by God. The Church says that it tries to be very cautious to approve the validity of putative miracles. The Catholic Church says that it maintains particularly stringent requirements in validating the miracle's authenticity.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982807,00.html |publisher = Pathfinder.com|title = Modern Miracles Have Strict Rules|date= 10 April 1995|last = Van Biema|first = David|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070713212401/http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982807,00.html|archive-date = 13 July 2007}}</ref> The process is overseen by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=3664|website = 30giorni.it|title = The necessity of miracles|date = 2004|last = Falasca|first = Stefania|access-date = 2006-12-13|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084326/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=3664|archive-date = 2007-09-29|url-status = dead}}</ref>

The Catholic Church has listed several events as miracles, some of them occurring in modern times. Before a person can be accepted as a saint, they must be posthumously confirmed to have performed two miracles. In the procedure of [[Beatification and canonisation of Pope John Paul II|beatification of Pope John Paul II]], who died in 2005, the Vatican announced on 14 January 2011 that [[Pope Benedict XVI]] had confirmed that the recovery of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre from [[Parkinson's disease]] was a miracle.<ref name="BBC-beatify">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12191423|title=Pope Benedict Paves Way to Beatification of John Paul II|work=bbc.news.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2011|date=14 January 2011}}</ref>

Among the more notable miracles approved by the Church are several [[Eucharistic miracle]]s wherein the [[sacramental bread]] and wine are [[transubstantiation|transformed into Christ's flesh and blood]], such as the [[Miracle of Lanciano]] and cures in [[Lourdes]].

According to 17th century documents, a young Spanish [[miracle of Calanda|man's leg was miraculously restored]] to him in 1640 after having been amputated two and a half years earlier.<ref>[[Messori, Vittorio]] (2000): Il miracolo. Indagine sul più sconvolgente prodigio mariano. – Rizzoli: Bur.</ref>

Another miracle approved by the Church is the [[Miracle of the Sun]], which is said to have occurred near [[Our Lady of Fatima|Fátima, Portugal]] on October 13, 1917. According to legend, between 70,000 and 100,000 people, who were gathered at a [[Cova da Iria|cove]] near Fátima, witnessed the sunlight dim and change colors, and the Sun spin, dance about in the sky, and appear to plummet to earth, radiating great heat in the process. After the ten-minute event, the ground and the people's clothing, which had been drenched by a previous rainstorm, were both dry.

[[Velankanni]] (Mary) can be traced to the mid-16th century and is attributed to three miracles: the apparition of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Christ]] Child to a slumbering shepherd boy, the curing of a lame buttermilk vendor, and the rescue of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors from a violent sea storm.<ref>[http://www.vailankannishrine.org/miracle.php Velankanni shrine miracle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128052924/http://vailankannishrine.org/miracle.php |date=2011-01-28 }}</ref>

In addition to these, the Catholic Church attributes miraculous causes to many otherwise inexplicable phenomena on a case-by-case basis. Only after all other possible explanations have been asserted to be inadequate will the Church assume ''divine intervention'' and declare the miracle worthy of veneration by their followers. The Church does not, however, enjoin belief in any extra-Scriptural miracle as an [[creed|article of faith]] or as necessary for [[salvation]].

[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], a prominent [[Doctor of the Church]], divided miracles into three types in his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'':<blockquote>These works that are done by God outside the usual order assigned to things are wont to be called miracles: because we are astonished (''admiramur'') at a thing when we see an effect without knowing the cause. And since at times one and the same cause is known to some and unknown to others, it happens that of several who see an effect, some are astonished and some not: thus an astronomer is not astonished when he sees an eclipse of the sun, for he knows the cause; whereas one who is ignorant of this [[science]] must needs wonder, since he knows not the cause. Wherefore it is wonderful to the latter but not to the former. Accordingly a thing is wonderful simply, when its cause is hidden simply: and this is what we mean by a miracle: something, to wit, that is wonderful in itself and not only in respect of this person or that. Now God is the cause which is hidden to every man simply: for we have proved above that in this state of life no man can comprehend Him by his intellect. Therefore properly speaking miracles are works done by God outside the order usually observed in things.

Of these miracles there are various degrees and orders. The <span style="color:red;">highest degree</span> in miracles comprises those works wherein something is done by God, that nature can never do: for instance, that two bodies occupy the same place, that the sun recede or stand still, that the sea be divided and make way to passers by. Among these there is a certain order: for the greater the work done by God, and the further it is removed from the capability of nature, the greater the miracle: thus it is a greater miracle that the sun recede, than that the waters be divided.

The <span style="color:red;">second degree</span> in miracles belongs to those whereby God does something that nature can do, but not in the same order: thus it is a work of nature that an animal live, see and walk: but that an animal live after being dead, see after being blind, walk after being lame, this nature cannot do, but God does these things sometimes by a miracle. Among these miracles also, there are degrees, according as the thing done is further removed from the faculty of nature.

The <span style="color:red;">third degree</span> of miracles is when God does what is wont to be done by the operation of nature, but without the operation of the natural principles: for instance when by the power of God a man is cured of a fever that nature is able to cure; or when it rains without the operation of the principles of nature.<ref>{{cite book|title=Contra Gentiles, lib. III cap. 101|first=St. Thomas|last=Aquinas|author-link=Thomas Aquinas|url=http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3b.htm#101}}</ref></blockquote>

====Evangelicalism====
For a majority of [[Evangelical]] Christians, [[biblicism]] ensures that the miracles described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer.<ref>Sébastien Fath, ''Du ghetto au réseau: Le protestantisme évangélique en France, 1800-2005'', Édition Labor et Fides, France, 2005, p. 28</ref><ref>James Innell Packer, Thomas C. Oden, ''One Faith: The Evangelical Consensus'', InterVarsity Press, USA, 2004, p. 104</ref>  Healings, academic or professional successes, the birth of a child after several attempts, the end of an [[addiction]], etc., would be tangible examples of God's intervention with the [[Christian faith|faith]] and [[Christian prayer|prayer]], by the [[Holy Spirit]]. <ref>Franck Poiraud, ''Les évangéliques dans la France du XXIe siècle'', Editions Edilivre, France, 2007, p. 69, 73, 75</ref> In the 1980s, the [[neo-charismatic movement]] re-emphasized miracles and [[faith healing]]. <ref>George Thomas Kurian, Mark A. Lamport, ''Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 1069</ref> In certain churches, a special place is thus reserved for [[faith healing]]s with [[laying on of hands]] during [[Worship service (evangelicalism)|worship services]] or for campaigns evangelization. <ref>Cecil M.

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism, miracles are focused on episodes of liberation of the spirit.<ref name="Wonder">{{cite book
|title= Miracles: Wonder and Meaning in World Religions
|author = David L. Weddle
|year = 2010
|isbn = 978-0-81479-483-8

}}</ref> A key example is the revelation of [[Krishna]] to [[Arjuna]], wherein Krishna persuades Arjuna to rejoin the battle against his cousins by briefly and miraculously giving Arjuna the power to see the true scope of the Universe, and its sustainment within Krishna, which requires divine vision. This is a typical situation in Hindu mythology wherein "wondrous acts are performed for the purpose of bringing spiritual liberation to those who witness or read about them."<ref name="Wonder"/>

Hindu sages have criticized both expectation and reliance on miracles as cheats, situations where people have sought to earn a benefit without doing the work necessary to merit it.<ref name="Wonder"/> Miracles continue to be occasionally reported in the practice of Hinduism, with an example of a miracle modernly reported in Hinduism being the [[Hindu milk miracle]] of September 1995, with additional occurrences in 2006 and 2010, wherein statues of certain Hindu deities were seen to drink milk offered to them.The scientific explanation for the incident, attested by Indian academics, was that the material was wicked from the offering bowls by [[capillary action]].

===Islam===

{{Main|Islamic view of miracles|Quran and miracles |Miracles of Muhammad}}
{{See also|Occasionalism}}
In the [[Quran]], a miracle can be defined as a supernatural intervention in the life of human beings.<ref name="EoQ-Miracle">Denis Gril, ''Miracles'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]</ref> According to this definition, miracles are present "in a threefold sense: in sacred [[history]], in connection with [[Muhammad]] himself and in relation to [[revelation in Islam|revelation]]".<ref name="EoQ-Miracle"/> The Quran does not use the technical [[Arabic]] word for miracle (''Muʿd̲j̲iza'') literally meaning "that by means of which [the Prophet] confounds, overwhelms, his opponents". It rather uses the term 'Ayah' (literally meaning sign).<ref name="EoI-Miracle">A.J. Wensinck, ''Muʿd̲j̲iza'', [[Encyclopaedia of Islam|Encyclopedia of Islam]]</ref> The term ''Ayah'' is used in the Quran in the above-mentioned threefold sense: it refers to the "verses" of the Quran (believed to be the divine speech in [[Natural language|human language]]; presented by Muhammad as his chief miracle); as well as to miracles of it and the signs (particularly those of creation).<ref name="EoQ-Miracle"/><ref name="EoI-Miracle"/>

To defend the possibility of miracles and God's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes, some medieval [[Islamic theology|Muslim theologians]] such as [[Al-Ghazali]] rejected the idea of [[Causality|cause and effect]] in essence, but accepted it as something that facilitates humankind's investigation and comprehension of natural processes. They argued that the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were "re-created" at every instant by God. Thus if the soil was to fall, God would have to create and re-create the accident of heaviness for as long as the soil was to fall. For Muslim theologians, the laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes: customs of God.<ref>Robert G. Mourison, The Portrayal of Nature in a Medieval Quran Commentary, Studia Islamica, 2002</ref>

[[Sufi]] biographical literature records claims of miraculous accounts of men and women. The miraculous prowess of the Sufi holy men includes ''firasa'' ([[clairvoyance]]), the ability to disappear from sight, to become completely invisible and practice ''buruz'' ([[exteriorization]]). The holy men reportedly tame wild beasts and traverse long distances in a very short time span. They could also produce food and rain in seasons of drought, heal the sick and help barren women conceive.<ref name="sufi">[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nWa8y-HiB0C&pg=PA48 The heirs of the prophet: charisma and religious authority in Shi'ite Islam By Liyakatali Takim]</ref><ref>[http://www.sufismjournal.org/history/history.html SAINTS AND MIRACLES]</ref>

===Judaism===
Descriptions of miracles (Hebrew ''Ness, נס'') appear in the [[Tanakh]]. Examples include prophets, such as [[Elijah]] who performed miracles like the [[Raising of the son of the widow of Zarephath|raising of a widow's dead son]] (1 Kings 17:17–24) and [[Elisha]] whose miracles include multiplying the poor widow's jar of oil (2 Kings 4:1–7) and [[Raising of the son of the woman of Shunem|restoring to life]] the son of the woman of Shunem (2 Kings 4:18–37). The [[Torah]] describes many miracles related to [[Moses]] during his time as a prophet and [[the Exodus]] of the Israelites. [[Crossing the Red Sea|Parting the Red Sea]], and facilitating the [[Plagues of Egypt]] are among the most famous.

During the first century BCE, a variety of religious movements and splinter groups developed amongst the Jews in [[Iudaea Province|Judea]]. A number of individuals claimed to be miracle workers in the tradition of [[Moses]], [[Elijah]], and [[Elisha]], the Jewish prophets. The Talmud provides some examples of such Jewish miracle workers, one of whom is [[Honi HaM'agel]], who was famous for his ability to successfully pray for rain.<ref>Mishnah [[Ta'anit (Talmud)|Ta'anit]] 3:8 [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h29.htm Hebrew text at Mechon-Mamre]</ref>

Most [[Chasidic]] communities are rife with tales of miracles that follow a ''yechidut'', a spiritual audience with a ''[[tzadik]]'': barren women become pregnant, cancer tumors shrink, wayward children become pious.<ref>The encyclopedia of Jewish myth, magic and mysticism, Geoffrey W. Dennis, p. 49</ref> Many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] claim that miracles can take place in merit of partaking of the ''shirayim'' (the leftovers from the [[rebbe]]'s meal), such as miraculous healing or blessings of wealth or piety.
