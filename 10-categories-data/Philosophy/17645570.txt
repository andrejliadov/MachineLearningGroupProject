A '''philosophical theory''' or '''philosophical position'''<ref name="dot">''Dictionary of Theories'', [[Jennifer Bothamley]]</ref> is a view that attempts to explain or account for a particular problem in [[philosophy]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} The use of the term theory here is a statement of colloquial English and not reflective of the term [[theory]].<ref name="Lacey">{{cite book |last=Lacey |first=A.R. |title=A Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |date=1976 |edition=second |page=122 |isbn=0-415-05872-4}}</ref> While any sort of [[thesis]] or opinion may be termed a position, in [[analytic philosophy]] it is thought best to reserve the word "theory" for systematic, comprehensive attempts to solve problems.<ref name="Sparkes">{{cite book |last=Sparkes |first=A.W. |title=Talking Philosophy: a wordbook |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, New York |date=1991 |page=114 |isbn=0-415-04222-4}}</ref>

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy. Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

The collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[dogma|dogmas]], [[doctrine|doctrines]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].<ref name="dot"/>

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,<ref>[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)</ref> such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.<ref>See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)</ref> In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.<ref>"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''</ref>  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[religion]], [[philosophy of life]],  [[ideology]],  [[world view]], or [[life stance]].
