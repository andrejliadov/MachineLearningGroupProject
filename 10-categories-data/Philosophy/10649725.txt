'''Hellenistic philosophy''' is the period of [[Western philosophy]] and [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] during the [[Hellenistic period]]. 

== Background ==
[[File:Hellenistic_world_300BC_blank.png|thumb|The Hellenistic world in 300 BCE.]]
The [[Hellenistic period]] followed the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BCE), who had spread [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[Western Asia]], following the previous cultural period of [[Classical Greece]]. The classical period in [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] had begun with [[Socrates]] (c. 470-399 BCE), whose student [[Plato]] had taught [[Aristotle]], who in turn had tutored Alexander. While the classical thinkers were mostly based in [[Athens]], the Hellenistic period saw philosophers active around the empire. The period began with the death Alexander in 323 BCE (following that of Aristotle in 322), and was followed by the predominance of [[Ancient Roman philosophy]] during the [[Roman empire|Roman Imperial period]].

== Developments and debates in thought ==
{{Under construction|section}}
The founders of the Academy, the Peripatetics, Cynicism and Cyrenaicism had all been students of [[Socrates]], while Stoicism was indirectly influenced by him.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDJwDwAAQBAJ&q=history+of+philosophy|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-06-20|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-241-98086-6|pages=99|language=en|quote="Although the founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium, lived nearly a century later – he was a child of eight when Aristotle died in 322 BCE – his school shared these Socratic roots; he was influenced by the Cynics who had taken their cue from the hardier and more convention-opposing aspects of Socrates’ outlook and style of life."}}</ref> Socrates' thought was therefore influential for many of these schools of the period, leading them to focus on [[ethics]] and how to reach ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (the good life), and some of them followed his example of using self-discipline and [[autarky]] to this end.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=8–9|language=en}}</ref> According to [[A. C. Grayling]], the greater insecurity and loss of autonomy of the era drove some to use philosophy as a means to seek inner security from the external world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

=== Epistemology ===
The [[epistemology]] of the Epicureans was [[Empiricism|empiricist]], with knowledge being ultimately sourced from the senses.<ref name="Sellars"/> Epicurus argued that sensory information is never false, though it may be misleading sometimes, and that "If you fight against all sensations, you will not have a standard against to which judge even those of them you say are mistaken".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=26|language=en}}</ref> He responded to an objection to empiricism made by [[Plato]] in ''[[Meno]]'', according to which one cannot search for information without having some pre-existing idea of what to search for, hence meaning that knowledge must precede experience.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Sellars|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNPdtAEACAAJ|title=Hellenistic Philosophy|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967412-1|pages=36|language=en}}</ref> The Epicurean response is that ''prolepsis'' (preconceptions) are general concepts which allow particular things to be recognised, and that these emerge from repeated experiences of similar things.<ref name=":0" />

== Platonism ==
[[Platonism]] represents the philosophy of [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] and philosophical systems closely derived from it. 

===Old Academy===
Early Platonism, known as the "Old Academy" begins with Plato, followed by [[Speusippus]] (Plato's nephew), who succeeded him as the head of the school (until 339 BC), and [[Xenocrates]] (until 313 BC). Both of them sought to fuse [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] speculations on [[number]] with Plato's [[theory of forms]].

===Academic Skepticism===
[[File:Head Karneades Glyptothek Munich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Carneades]], Roman copy after the statue exhibited on the [[agora of Athens]], c. 150 BC, [[Glyptothek]] Museum]]
[[Academic Skepticism]] is the period of ancient Platonism dating from around 266 BC, when [[Arcesilaus]] became head of the [[Platonic Academy]], until around 90 BC, when [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] rejected skepticism, although individual philosophers, such as [[Favorinus]] and his teacher [[Plutarch]] continued to defend Academic Skepticism after this date. The Academic Skeptics maintained that [[acatalepsia|knowledge of things is impossible]]. Ideas or notions are never true; nevertheless, there are degrees of truth-likeness, and hence degrees of belief, which allow one to act. The school was characterized by its attacks on the [[Stoics]] and on the Stoic [[dogma]] that [[Katalepsis|convincing impressions]] led to true [[episteme|knowledge]]. 
* [[Arcesilaus]] (316–232 BC)
* [[Carneades]] (214–129 BC)
* [[Cicero]] (106–43 BC)

===Middle Platonism===
Around 90 BC, [[Antiochus of Ascalon]] rejected skepticism, making way for the period known as [[Middle Platonism]], in which Platonism was fused with certain [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] and many [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[dogma]]s. In Middle Platonism, the Platonic Forms were not transcendent but immanent to rational minds, and the physical world was a living, ensouled being, the [[Anima mundi|World-Soul]]. The eclectic nature of Platonism during this time is shown by its incorporation into [[Pythagoreanism]] ([[Numenius of Apamea]]) and into [[Jewish philosophy]]<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Platonism/Medieval-Platonism#ref32576</ref> ([[Philo of Alexandria]]).
* [[Plutarch]] (46–after 119 AD)

===Neoplatonism===
[[Neoplatonism]], or ''Plotinism'', is a school of religious and mystical philosophy founded by [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century AD and based on the teachings of Plato and the other Platonists. The summit of existence was [[Absolute (philosophy)|the One]] or the Good, the source of all things. In [[virtue]] and [[meditation]] the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One, the true function of human beings. Non-Christian Neoplatonists used to attack Christianity until Christians such as [[Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Eriugena]] adopt Neoplatonism.  
* [[Plotinus]] (205–270 AD)
* [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (233–309 AD)
* [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] (245–325 AD)
* [[Proclus]] (412–485 AD)

== Cyrenaicism ==
[[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaicism]] was founded in the fourth century BC by [[Aristippus]] (ca. 435-356), who was a student of [[Socrates]].  [[Aristippus the Younger]], the grandson of the founder, argued that the reason pleasure was good was that  it was evident in human behavior from the youngest age, because this made it natural and [[Natural law|therefore good]] (the so-called ''cradle argument'').<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=20|language=en}}</ref> The Cyrenaics also believed that present pleasure freed one from anxiety of the future and regrets of the past, leaving one at peace of mind.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=21|language=en}}</ref> These ideas were taken further by [[Anniceris]] (fl. 300 BCE), who expanded pleasure to include things like friendship and honour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=22|language=en}}</ref> [[Theodorus the Atheist |Theodorus]] (ca. 340-250) disagreed with this, and instead argued that social ties should be cut and self-sufficiency be espoused instead.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=23|language=en}}</ref> [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] (fl. 290) on the other hand claimed that life could ultimately not be overall pleasurable.<ref name=":4" />

== Cynicism ==
The [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] thought was based on living with bare necessities and in accordance with [[nature]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=10|language=en}}</ref> The first Cynic was [[Antisthenes]] (ca. 446–366 BCE), who was a student of Socrates.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=10|language=en}}</ref> He introduced the ideas of [[Asceticism|ascetism]] and opposition to social norms.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=11|language=en}}</ref> His follower was [[Diogenes]] (ca. 412–323 BCE), who followed in this direction.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=14|language=en}}</ref> Instead of pleasure, the Cynics promoted purposefully living in hardship (''[[ponos]].'')<ref name=":2" /> All of this was because it was seen as natural and therefore as good, whereas society was innately unnatural and therefore bad, as were material benefits.<ref name=":2" /> Pleasures provided by nature (which would be immediately accessible) were acceptable, however.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=15|language=en}}</ref>  The Cynic [[Crates of Thebes]] (365–285 BC) hence claimed that "Philosophy is a quart of beans and to care for nothing".<ref name=":3" /> Other Cynics included [[Menippus]] (c. 275 BCE) and [[Demetrius the Cynic|Demetrius]] (10–80 CE).

== Peripatetic school ==
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|A marble bust of [[Aristotle]]]]
[[Peripatetic school]] composed the philosophers who maintained and developed the philosophy of [[Aristotle]]. They advocated examination of the world to understand the ultimate foundation of things. The goal of life was the [[eudaimonia]] which originated from [[virtue|virtuous]] actions, which consisted in keeping the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]] between the two extremes of the too much and the too little.
* [[Theophrastus]] (371–287 BC)
* [[Strato of Lampsacus]] (335–269 BC)
* [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (c. 200 AD)
* [[Aristocles of Messene]] (c. 1st century AD)

==Pyrrhonism==
[[File:Philosopher, marble head, Roman copy, AM Corfu, Krfm22.jpg|thumb|[[Pyrrho of Elis]], marble head, Roman copy, Archeological Museum of Corfu]]
[[Pyrrhonism]] is a school of [[philosophical skepticism]] that originated with [[Pyrrho]] in the 3rd century BC, and was further advanced by [[Aenesidemus]] in the 1st century BC. Its objective is [[ataraxia]] (being mentally unperturbed), which is achieved through [[epoché]] (i.e. [[suspension of judgment]]) about non-evident matters (i.e., matters of [[belief]]). 
* [[Pyrrho]] (365–275 BC)
* [[Timon of Phlius]] (320–230 BC)
* [[Aenesidemus]] (1st century BC)
* [[Sextus Empiricus]] (2nd century AD)

==Epicureanism==
[[Image:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[Epicurus]] bust]]
{{Under construction|section}}
[[Epicureanism]] was founded by Epicurus in the 3rd century BC. Its epistemology was based on [[empiricism]], believing that sensual experiences cannot be false, even if they can be misleading, as they are product of the world interacting with one's body.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=26|language=en}}</ref> Repeated sensory experiences can then be used to form concepts (''prolepsis'') about the world, and such concepts which are widely shared ('common conceptions') can further provide the basis for philosophy.<ref name=":5" /> Applying his empricism, Epicurus supported [[atomism]] by noting that matter could not be destroyed as it would eventually dwindle down to nothing, and that there must be [[Vacuum|void]] for matter to move around.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=27|language=en}}</ref> While this in itself did not prove the existence of atoms, he argued against the alternative by noting that infinitely divisible objects would be infinitely large, similar to [[Zeno's paradoxes]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Adamson|first=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5_oCQAAQBAJ|title=Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872802-3|pages=28|language=en}}</ref>  

It viewed the [[universe]] as being ruled by [[chance (philosophy)|chance]], with no interference from [[gods]]. It regarded [[aponia|absence of pain]] as the greatest pleasure, and advocated a simple life. 
* [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BC)
* [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]] (331–278 BC)
* [[Hermarchus]] (325-250 BC)

[[Stoicism]] was founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in the 3rd century BC. Based on the ethical ideas of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], it taught that the goal of life was to live in accordance with [[Nature]]. It advocated the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotions]].

==Neopythagoreanism==
[[Neopythagoreanism]] was a school of philosophy reviving [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrines, which was prominent in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.
