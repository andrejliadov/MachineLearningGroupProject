The [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of [[white]] and [[black]] ([[light]] and [[darkness]], [[day]] and [[night]]) has a long tradition of [[metaphor]]ical usage, traceable to the [[Ancient Near East]], and explicitly in the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] ''[[Table of Opposites]]''.
In [[Western culture]] as well as in [[Confucianism]], the contrast symbolizes the moral dichotomy of [[good and evil]].

== Description ==
Day, light, and good are often linked together, in opposition to night, darkness, and evil. These contrasting metaphors may go back as far as human history, and appear in many cultures, including both the ancient Chinese and the ancient Persians. The philosophy of [[neoplatonism]] is strongly imbued with the metaphor of goodness as light.<ref name=arnheim>[[Rudolf Arnheim]]. (1974). Art and visual perception. Univ of California Press. "The Symbolism of Light" (pp. 324-5)</ref>

== Examples ==

=== Religion and mythology ===

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] has God "separate light from darkness" on the First Day.

*The Bible associates light with God, truth, and virtue; darkness is associated with sin and the Devil. Painters such as [[Rembrandt]] portrayed divine light illuminating an otherwise dark world.<ref name="arnheim" />
*''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', part of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].
*The [[underworld]] ([[Hades]], [[Tartarus]]) was imagined as a [[chthonic]] place of darkness, contrasting with the [[Heaven|celestial]] realm of the [[gods]]. Christian notions of [[heaven]] and [[hell]] inherit this conception, as do the "[[fallen angel|dark angel]]s" vs. the unfallen [[angels]], often with [[aureola]] ([[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]]), in [[Christian mythology]].
*Day and night are personified as deities in various [[mythology|mythologies]] (e.g. [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Dagr]] and [[Nótt]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Hemera]] and [[Nyx]], et cetera).

=== Dress ===

* White often represents purity or innocence in Western culture,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_62UMAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Encyclopedia Americana Corp.|year=1918|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_62UMAAAAYAAJ/page/n375 329]}}</ref> particularly as white clothing or objects can be stained easily.  In most Western countries white is the color worn by brides at weddings.  [[Angels]] are typically depicted as clothed in white robes.
**In many [[Western (genre)|Hollywood Westerns]], bad cowboys wear [[black and white hat symbolism in film|black hats]] while the good ones wear white. 
**[[Melodrama]] villains are dressed in black and heroines in white dresses. 
**This can be reversed as a deliberate play on conventions, by having the evil character dress in white, as a symbol of their hypocrisy or arrogance. For example, [[Don Fanucci]] in ''[[The Godfather, Part II]]'' is an evil character, but wears an expensive all-white suit as a sign of his esteem, power and prestige. Sometimes protagonists can wear black too, as in ''[[Return of the Jedi]],'' wherein [[Luke Skywalker]] wears black during the final battle. This may symbolize the danger of Luke turning to the dark side, but once he has prevailed (in the scene where he removes [[Darth Vader]]'s helmet), his jacket has opened up to reveal that it has a lighter color in the inside, as if to indicate that Luke "on the inside" was always good. Darth Vader himself, while still in the grip of the dark side, dresses all in black and may be regarded as a science fiction version of a [[Black knight|Dark Knight]]. The chief antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, the evil Emperor [[Palpatine]], wears a black cloak.
**In [[computer security]], a [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] is an attacker with evil intentions, while a [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]] bears no such ill will.  (This is derived from the Western movie convention.)

=== Magic ===
* Healing or "good" paranormal magic is called [[magic (paranormal)|White magic]]. [[Black magic]] is a destructive or evil form of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].
** ''[[A Treatise on White Magic]]'' is a book by [[Alice Bailey]], a [[Neo-Theosophy|Theosophist]].<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic'' New York: 1934 Lucis Publishing Co.</ref>
** [[White witch]].
** Evil [[witches]] are stereotypically dressed in black and good [[fairies]] in white.

=== In popular culture ===
* The [[Inventio#Topoi|topos]] of "light and darkness" is also reflected in numerous titles in popular culture, such as ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), ''[[Light in My Darkness]]'' (1927), ''[[Darkness and the Light]]'' (1942), ''[[Creatures of Light and Darkness]]'' (1969), ''[[From Darkness to Light]]'' (1973), ''[[Darkness and Light (novel)|Darkness and Light]]'' (1989), ''[[The Lord of the Light and of the Darkness]]'' (1993), the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9]]'' episode "[[The Darkness and the Light (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' episode "[[Between the Darkness and the Light]]" (1997), and ''[[Out of the Darkness, Into the Light]]'' (1998).
* In works of [[fantasy]] fiction, the main antagonist is often called a "[[Dark Lord (fiction)|Dark Lord]]", for example Sauron in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.
* The space-opera franchise ''[[Star Wars]]'' also depicts Light and Dark aspects in the form of the fictional energy field called [[The Force]] where there are two sides, [[Light Side|light side]] and [[Dark Side of the Force|dark side]] wherein the protagonists, the [[Jedi]] practice and propagate the use of the former and the antagonists, the [[Sith]] use the latter. 
* [[George Orwell]] makes a bitterly ironic use of the "light and darkness" topos in his ''[[Nineteen Eighty Four]]''. In the early part of the book the protagonist gets a promise that "We will meet in the place where there is no darkness" – which he interprets as referring to a place where the oppressive totalitarian state does not rule. But the man who made the promise was in fact an agent of the [[Thought Police]] – and they eventually meet as prisoner and interrogator where there is indeed no darkness, in detention cells where the light remains on permanently, day and night, as an additional means of torturing detainees.
* ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' explains the two split halves of a balanced whole, reflecting the impossibility of acknowledging any metaphorical divine balance without the combination of both the light(the Mystics) and the dark(the Skesis).

=== Other examples ===
* The [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] vs. the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
* "[[False dilemma#Black-and-white thinking|Black and white thinking]]" is the [[false dichotomy]] of assuming anything not good is evil and vice versa.
* [[Freemasonry]] has a black-and-white [[checkerboard]] as a central symbol within the lodge and all rituals occur on or around this checkerboard. Also known as a Mosaic Pavement, it represents the floor of King Solomon's Temple and according to [[Shakespeare]], represents man's natural duality.
