'''Religious philosophy''' is philosophical thinking that is influenced and directed as a consequence to teachings from a particular [[religion]]. It can be done objectively, but may also be done as a persuasion tool by believers in that [[faith]]. Religious [[philosophy]] is predominantly concerned with the [[Conceptions of God|conceptions of god]], gods, and/or the divine.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Taliaferro|first=Charles|date=2007-03-12|title=Philosophy of Religion|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/philosophy-religion/}}</ref>

Due to historical development of religions, many religions share commonalities with respect to their philosophies. These philosophies are often considered to be universal and include beliefs pertaining to concepts such as [[afterlife]], [[soul]]s, and [[miracle]]s.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=De Cruz|first=Helen|date=2014|title=Cognitive Science of Religion and the Study of Theological Concepts|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|journal=Topoi|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|page=487|doi=10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|issn=0167-7411}}</ref>

Each religion also has unique philosophies that distinguish them from other religions, and these philosophies are guided through the concepts and values behind the teaching pertaining to that belief-system. Different religious philosophies include:

== Philosophical commonalities ==
Religious faith and philosophical reflection are connected to one another. Religious tradition influences the philosophical thinking and beliefs of followers of that religion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cruz|first=Helen|date=2014|title=Cognitive Science of Religion and the Study of Theological Concepts|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|journal=Topoi|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=498|doi=10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|issn=0167-7411}}</ref>

Many philosophical commonalities have arisen amongst religions due to core historical foundations. For example, [[Abrahamic religions]], which encompass [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Baháʼí Faith|Baha’i Faith]], [[Yazidis|Yezidi]], [[Druze]], [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] and [[Rastafari]], share philosophical commonalities, although differ in their presentation of these philosophical concepts through their respective [[religious text]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vitkovic|first=Scott|date=2018|title=THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/doi/10.18769/ijasos.455673|journal=IJASOS- International E-journal of Advances in Social Sciences|volume=4|issue=11|page=456|doi=10.18769/ijasos.455673|issn=2411-183X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kunst|first=Jonas R.|last2=Thomsen|first2=Lotte|date=2015-10-02|title=Prodigal Sons: Dual Abrahamic Categorization Mediates the Detrimental Effects of Religious Fundamentalism on Christian–Muslim Relations|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508619.2014.937965|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=293–306|doi=10.1080/10508619.2014.937965|issn=1050-8619}}</ref>

There are also philosophical concepts and reasoning in religious teachings that were conceived independently from one another, however, are still similar and reflect analogous ideas.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=De Cruz|first=Helen|date=2014|title=Cognitive Science of Religion and the Study of Theological Concepts|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|journal=Topoi|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|page=491|doi=10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|issn=0167-7411}}</ref> For example, the argument and reasoning for the existence of an omniscient [[god]] or multiple gods can be found in several religions including Christianity, Islam, and [[Hinduism]]. Another example includes the philosophical concept of [[free will]]; present in [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions as well as in [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions.<ref name=":6" />

== Types ==

=== Intuitive religious philosophy ===
Many religious concepts are considered to be ‘cross-culturally ubiquitous’<ref name=":5" /> as they are ‘cognitively natural’.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McCauley, Robert N.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869781247|title=Why religion is natural and science is not|isbn=978-0-19-934154-2|location=Oxford|oclc=869781247}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> They are considered to be intuitive, meaning that they arise without much direction, instruction, or coaching in early stages of our intellectual development,<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=De Cruz|first=Helen|date=2014|title=Cognitive Science of Religion and the Study of Theological Concepts|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|journal=Topoi|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|page=488|doi=10.1007/s11245-013-9168-9|issn=0167-7411}}</ref> and do not necessarily arise from cultural influence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sperber|first=Dan|date=2008-06-28|title=Intuitive and Reflective Beliefs|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0017.1997.tb00062.x|journal=Mind & Language|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.1997.tb00062.x}}</ref> Such religious concepts include beliefs concerning ‘afterlife, souls, [[supernatural]] agents, and miraculous events’.<ref name=":5" />

=== Reflective religious philosophy ===
Some religious concepts require deliberate teaching to ensure transmission of their ideas and beliefs to others.<ref name=":7" /> These beliefs are categorised as reflective, and are often stored in linguistic format that allows for ease of transmission. Reflective philosophies are thought to contribute significantly to the continuation of cultural and religious beliefs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sperber|first=Dan|date=2008-06-28|title=Intuitive and Reflective Beliefs|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-0017.1997.tb00062.x|journal=Mind & Language|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|page=83|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.1997.tb00062.x}}</ref> Such religious philosophies include [[karma]], divine immanent justice, or providence, and also encompass theological concepts such as [[Trinity]] in Christianity or [[Brahman]] in Hinduism.<ref name=":7" />

== God ==
Religious philosophy is predominantly concerned with the conceptions of god, gods, and/or the divine.<ref name=":0" />

=== Ontological arguments ===
{{Main|Ontological argument}}
Ontological arguments are arguments based on reason with the conclusion that God exists.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last=Oppy|first=Graham|date=1996-02-08|title=Ontological Arguments|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2020/entries/ontological-arguments/}}</ref> There are many notable contributors to the development of various ontological arguments.

In the 11th century C.E., [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109) reasoned in his work ''[[Proslogion]]'' the existence of God in an ontological argument based on the idea that a ‘being than which no greater can be conceived’.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Thomas|date=2000-05-18|title=Saint Anselm|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/anselm/}}</ref>

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225-1274) extracted components of philosophical teaching relevant to Christianity, using philosophy as a means to demonstrate God’s existence.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aquinas’ Philosophical Theology {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=https://iep.utm.edu/aq-ph-th/|access-date=2020-11-20|language=en-US}}</ref> In his work ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Aquinas presents 5 arguments for the existence of God, known as ‘[[Five Ways (Aquinas)|quinque viae]]’ or ‘five ways’.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McInerny|first=Ralph|last2=O'Callaghan|first2=John|date=1999-07-12|title=Saint Thomas Aquinas|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/}}</ref>
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of René Descartes]]
In the 17th century, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) proposed similar arguments to that of Saint Anselm of Canterbury. For example, in his work ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Fifth Meditation]]'' he provides an ontological argument based on the reasoning that if we are able to conceive the idea of a supremely perfect being (i.e. that we have an idea of a supremely perfect being) then, he claims, we are able to reach the conclusion that there exists a supremely perfect being.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Nolan|first=Lawrence|date=2001-06-18|title=Descartes’ Ontological Argument|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2020/entries/descartes-ontological/}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last=Abbruzzese|first=John Edward|date=2007|title=The structure of Descartes's ontological proof|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09608780701255394|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=253–282|doi=10.1080/09608780701255394|issn=0960-8788}}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite journal|last=Wee|first=Cecilia|date=2012|title=Descartes's Ontological Proof of God's Existence|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09608788.2011.650973|journal=British Journal for the History of Philosophy|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=23–40|doi=10.1080/09608788.2011.650973|issn=0960-8788}}</ref> Two version for Descartes’ ontological argument exist:<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /><ref name=":11" />
* Version A:

# Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the idea of something is true of that thing.
# I clearly and distinctly perceive that necessary existence is contained in the idea of God.
# Therefore, God exists.

* Version B:

# I have an idea of supremely perfect being, i.e. a being having all perfections.
# Necessary existence is a perfection.
# Therefore, a supremely perfect being exists.

In the 18th century, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] (1464 – 1716) further developed Descartes ontological argument through attempting to satisfy a shortcoming in Descartes’ proposal which did not address the coherence of a supremely perfect being. Leibniz reasoned that perfections are compatible as they are unable to be analysed, and therefore are able to exist in a single entity thereby validating Descartes argument.<ref name=":8" />

More recently, individuals such as [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Norman Malcolm]], and [[Alvin Plantinga]] have proposed ontological arguments, many of which elaborate or are connected to older ontological arguments presented by individuals such as St. Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz.<ref name=":8" /> For example, Kurt Godel (1905-1978) used modal logic to elaborate and clarify Leibniz's version of Saint Anselm of Canterbury's ontological proof of the existence of God, known as [[Gödel's ontological proof|Godel’s Ontological Proof]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Kennedy|first=Juliette|title=Kurt Gödel|date=2020|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/goedel/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-11-20}}</ref>

An individual’s perception of the concept of God influences their [[coping]] style.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Elizabeth|last2=Gorsuch|first2=Richard|last3=Bjorck|first3=Jeff|date=2001|title=Religious Coping Style, Concept of God, and Personal Religious Variables in Threat, Loss, and Challenge Situations|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0021-8294.00038|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|language=en|volume=40|issue=1|pages=65–74|doi=10.1111/0021-8294.00038|issn=0021-8294}}</ref> There are four main religiously affiliated coping mechanisms as follows:

== Impacts ==
Religious philosophy influences many aspects of an individuals’ conception and outlook on life. For example, empirical studies concentrating on the philosophical concept of [[spirituality]] at or near the end of life, conducted in India, found that individuals who follow Indian philosophical concepts are influenced by these concepts in their ‘perception of spirituality’.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Inbadas|first=Hamilton|date=2018-10-02|title=Indian philosophical foundations of spirituality at the end of life|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13576275.2017.1351936|journal=Mortality|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|page=320|doi=10.1080/13576275.2017.1351936|issn=1357-6275|pmc=6157526|pmid=30294243}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Inbadas|first=Hamilton|date=2018-10-02|title=Indian philosophical foundations of spirituality at the end of life|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13576275.2017.1351936|journal=Mortality|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=320–333|doi=10.1080/13576275.2017.1351936|issn=1357-6275|pmc=6157526|pmid=30294243}}</ref>

Much of the opposition towards legislation of euthanasia is due to religious beliefs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danyliv|first=Andriy|last2=O'Neill|first2=Ciaran|date=2015|title=Attitudes towards legalising physician provided euthanasia in Britain: The role of religion over time|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953614008387|journal=Social Science & Medicine|language=en|volume=128|page=53|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.030}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hains|first=Carrie-Anne Marie|last2=Hulbert-Williams|first2=Nicholas J|date=2013|title=Attitudes toward euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: a study of the multivariate effects of healthcare training, patient characteristics, religion and locus of control|url=https://jme.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/medethics-2012-100729|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=39|issue=11|pages=713–716|doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100729|issn=0306-6800}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aghababaei|first=Naser|date=2013|title=The Euthanasia-Religion Nexus: Exploring Religious Orientation and Euthanasia Attitude Measures in a Muslim Context|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/OM.66.4.d|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=333–341|doi=10.2190/OM.66.4.d|issn=0030-2228}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marsala|first=Miles S.|date=2019|title=Approval of Euthanasia: Differences Between Cohorts and Religion|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244019835921|journal=SAGE Open|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1177/2158244019835921|issn=2158-2440}}</ref> Individuals who express a belief in God as an entity who controls [[destiny]] were more opposed to legalisation of euthanasia and physician [[assisted suicide]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gielen|first=Joris|last2=van den Branden|first2=Stef|last3=Broeckaert|first3=Bert|date=2009|title=Religion and Nurses' Attitudes To Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0969733009102692|journal=Nursing Ethics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|page=311|doi=10.1177/0969733009102692|issn=0969-7330}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bendiane|first=M.|last2=Galinier|first2=A|last3=Favre|first3=R|last4=Ribiere|first4=C|last5=Lapiana|first5=J-M|last6=Obadia|first6=Y|last7=Peretti-Watel|first7=P|date=2007-12-01|title=French district nurses' opinions towards euthanasia, involvement in end-of-life care and nurse patient relationship: a national phone survey|url=https://jme.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jme.2006.018374|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=12|pages=708–711|doi=10.1136/jme.2006.018374|issn=0306-6800|pmc=2598217|pmid=18055901}}</ref> For example, religions such as Christian Science, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hinduism, Islam, Jehovah’s Witness, Seventh-day Adventist generally do not allow for or practice euthanasia.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burdette|first=Amy M.|last2=Hill|first2=Terrence D.|last3=Moulton|first3=Benjamin E.|date=2005|title=Religion and Attitudes Toward Physician-Assisted Suicide and Terminal Palliative Care|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00266.x|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|language=en|volume=44|issue=1|pages=79–93|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00266.x|issn=0021-8294}}</ref>

Islamic jurisprudence does not condone or allow for an individual to die voluntarily.<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last=Isgandarova|first=Nazila|date=2015|title=Physician-Assisted Suicide and Other Forms of Euthanasia in Islamic Spiritual Care|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1542305015616099|journal=Journal of Pastoral Care & Counseling: Advancing theory and professional practice through scholarly and reflective publications|language=en|volume=69|issue=4|pages=215–221|doi=10.1177/1542305015616099|issn=1542-3050}}</ref><ref name=":23">{{Cite journal|last=Rm|first=Yousuf|last2=Ar|first2=Mohammed Fauzi|date=2012|title=Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide: A Review from Islamic Point of View|url=https://journals.iium.edu.my/kom/index.php/imjm/article/view/556|journal=IIUM Medical Journal Malaysia|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.31436/imjm.v11i1.556|issn=2735-2285}}</ref> Islamic philosophies indicate that life is a divine, sacred gift, with Allah deciding how long each individual will live.<ref name=":24">{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Aramesh|last2=H|first2=Shadi|date=2007-01-01|title=EUTHANASIA: AN ISLAMIC ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE|url=https://www.sid.ir/en/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=83985|journal=Iranian Journal of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology|language=En|volume=6|issue=5|page=37}}</ref><ref name=":23" /> The moment of death, known as ''ajal'', cannot be hastened by any form of passive or active voluntary intervention (e.g. in the form of euthanasia) as this is completely under the control of Allah.<ref name=":24" /><ref name=":25">{{Cite journal|last=Ayuba|first=Mahmud Adesina|date=2016|title=EUTHANASIA: A MUSLIM’S PERSPECTIVE|url=http://scriptura.journals.ac.za/pub/article/view/1175|journal=Scriptura|volume=115|issue=0|doi=10.7833/115-0-1175}}</ref> Only Allah has the absolute authority and ability to give life as well as take it away.<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":23" /> Islamic philosophies emphasise that life does not belong to the human, but to Allah.<ref name=":24" /> Although the Qur'an states '‘Nor take life – which Allah has made sacred – except for just cause’ (Quran 17:33), ''[[hadith]]'' literature indicates that despite intolerable pain and suffering, euthanasia is not condoned.<ref name=":22" /> For example, according to ''[[Sahih Muslim]],'' in the [[Battle of Hunayn]] a Muslim warrior committed [[suicide]] due to the pain of his wound however Prophet Muhammad declared that this act negated his courage and service to Allah and doomed him to Hell.<ref name=":22" />

==== Abortion ====
{{Main|Abortion}}
Many religions hold philosophical value toward life of all forms and are thus completely against abortion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Richard J.|last2=Mills|first2=Edgar W.|date=1985|title=Religion, Values and Attitudes toward Abortion|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386338?origin=crossref|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=24|issue=2|pages=137|doi=10.2307/1386338}}</ref> However abortion is tolerated in specific cases, such as rape or when the mother’s life is in danger.<ref name=":1" />

===== Hindu philosophy =====
Hindu philosophies prohibit abortion, in line with ''[[Dharmaśāstra|dharmasastras]]''. Hindu philosophy regarding conception involve the belief that both physical and spiritual qualities, like an individual’s past karma, exist and enter the human [[embryo]] from the moment of conception.<ref name=":16">{{Citation|last=Maguire|first=Daniel C.|title=Abortion and Religion|date=2016-04-21|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss267|work=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|pages=1–5|editor-last=Wong|editor-first=Angela|place=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss267|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|access-date=2020-11-20|editor2-last=Wickramasinghe|editor2-first=Maithree|editor3-last=hoogland|editor3-first=renee|editor4-last=Naples|editor4-first=Nancy A}}</ref>

===== Buddhist philosophy =====
In Buddhist philosophies, much like Hindu philosophies, there is a morally negative view towards abortion<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maguire|first=Daniel C.|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195160017.001.0001/acprof-9780195160017|title=Sacred Rights|date=2003-04-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516001-7|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195160017.001.0001}}</ref> in accordance to the [[Five precepts|Five Precepts]].<ref name=":16" /> However, the intention behind an action is an important consideration,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Maguire, Daniel C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149656|title=Ethics : a complete method for moral choice|date=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-6443-5|location=Minneapolis, MN|oclc=297149656}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Florida|first=R.

===== Jewish philosophy =====
Jewish philosophies in Rabbinical works generally condemn abortion, [[foeticide]], or [[infanticide]] as it is viewed as an immoral action on human life.<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":17">{{Cite journal|last=Jakobovits|first=I.|date=1968|title=Jewish views on abortion|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12309928|journal=Child and Family|volume=7|issue=2|pages=142–156|issn=0009-3882|pmid=12309928}}</ref> However, ‘abortion appears as an option for Jewish women from the earliest sources of the Bible and Mishnaic commentary’,<ref name=":18">{{Citation|last=Maguire|first=Daniel C.|title=Abortion and Religion|date=2016-04-21|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss267|work=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|page=3|editor-last=Wong|editor-first=Angela|place=Singapore|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss267|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|access-date=2020-11-20|editor2-last=Wickramasinghe|editor2-first=Maithree|editor3-last=hoogland|editor3-first=renee|editor4-last=Naples|editor4-first=Nancy A}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Zoloth|first=Laurie|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50080419|title=Sacred rights : the case for contraception and abortion in world religions|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Maguire, Daniel C.|isbn=0195160002|page=38|oclc=50080419}}</ref> where the Talmud indicates that a mother’s life is prioritised if her life or wellbeing is put at risk by the child, thereby permitting abortion.<ref name=":17" /> Jewish laws do not condone abortion in scenarios involving [[rape]] or [[incest]].<ref name=":17" />

===== Taoist philosophy =====
Taoist philosophy expresses a desire to find and maintain a balance between populations and their resources.<ref name=":18" /> Therefore, due to these philosophies, population management were of national interests observed in China’s [[One-child policy|‘one child’ policy]].<ref name=":18" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Shang|first=Geling|date=2003|title=Excess, Lack, and Harmony: Some Confucian and Taoist Approaches to Family Planning and Population Management -- Tradition and the Modern Challenge|url=https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1004682|access-date=2020-11-20|website=eweb:254212|language=en}}</ref> However, abortion is not encouraged as it would ‘corrupt the body and would wrongly negate the body’s capacity to give life’.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=La Salle University|date=1995-10-01|title=Gender Lines Fall 1995|url=https://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/gender_lines/5|journal=Gender Lines|page=48}}</ref>

=== Diet ===
Many religions follow dietary habits. For example, a [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet is adhered to by individuals who follow Buddhism, Hinduism, Seventh-day Adventist.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sabaté|first=Joan|date=2004|title=Religion, diet and research|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0007114504001485/type/journal_article|journal=British Journal of Nutrition|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=199–201|doi=10.1079/BJN20041229|issn=0007-1145}}</ref><ref name=":19">{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Jo Ann|date=2007-01-01|title=World Religions and the Vegetarian Diet|url=https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/pd/vol12/iss1/3|journal=Perspective Digest|volume=12|issue=1}}</ref> The emphasis on sanctity of all life in the ethical doctrine known as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-injury to living beings) in Buddhist and Hindu philosophies encompass human as well as animal life, and influence this vegetarian tradition, with modern influence including the concept of [[reincarnation]].<ref name=":19" />

[[Fasting]] of various forms (exclusion of specific foods or food groups, or exclusion of food for certain periods of time) are undertaken by individuals who follow philosophies of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Eastern Orthodox, Islam, Roman Catholicism.<ref name=":1" />

Some religions require for food to be invoked in God’s name.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":20">{{Cite journal|last=Regenstein|first=J. M.|last2=Chaudry|first2=M. M.|last3=Regenstein|first3=C.
