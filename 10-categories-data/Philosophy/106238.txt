'''Cognition''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|ɡ|ˈ|n|ɪ|ʃ|(|ə|)|n
| audio = En-us-cognition.ogg
}}) refers to "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cognition|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/cognition |website=Lexico|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] and [[Dictionary.com]]|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref> It encompasses many aspects of [[intellectual function]]s and processes such as: [[attention]], the formation of [[knowledge]], [[memory]] and [[working memory]], [[Value judgment|judgment]] and [[evaluation]], [[reason]]ing and "[[computation]]", [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]], [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and production of [[language]]. Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge.

Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[anesthesia]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychiatry]], [[psychology]], [[education]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[systemics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Von Eckardt|first=Barbara | name-list-style = vanc |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8l48-DZln0C&q=what+is+cognition&pg=PA13|title=What is cognitive science?|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=9780262720236|location=Princeton, MA|pages=45–72}}</ref> These and other different approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesised in the developing field of [[cognitive science]], a progressively autonomous [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]].

== Etymology ==
The word ''cognition'' dates back to the 15th century, where it meant "thinking and awareness".<ref name=":0">{{cite book | vauthors = Revlin R | title = Cognition: Theory and Practice }}</ref> The term comes from the [[Latin]] noun {{Lang-la|{{wikt-lang|en|i=no|cognitio}}|label=none}} ('examination,' 'learning,' or 'knowledge'), derived from the verb {{Lang-la|{{wikt-lang|en|i=no|cognosco}}|label=none}}, a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of {{Lang-la|{{wikt-lang|en|i=no|con}}|label=none}} ('with') and {{Lang-la|{{wikt-lang|en|i=no|gnosco|gnōscō}}|label=none}} ('know'). The latter half, ''gnōscō'', itself is a [[cognate]] of a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb, ''{{Lang-grc|gi(g)nόsko|label=none|italic=yes}}'' ({{Lang-grc|γι(γ)νώσκω|label=none|lit=I know,' or 'perceive}}).<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Liddell HG, Scott R | author-link1 = Henry Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | date = 1940 | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=gignw/skw | title = γιγνώσκω | work = [[A Greek–English Lexicon|A Greek-English Lexicon]] | veditors = Jones HS, McKenzie R | editor-link1 = Henry Stuart Jones | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]] | via = [[Perseus Project]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Franchi S, Bianchini F | author-link2 = Francesco Bianchini | date = 2011 | chapter = On The Historical Dynamics Of Cognitive Science: A View From The Periphery. | title = The Search for a Theory of Cognition: Early Mechanisms and New Ideas | location = Amsterdam | publisher = [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]] | page =  XIV }}</ref>

== Early studies ==
Despite the word ''cognitive'' itself dating back to the 15th century,<ref name=":0" /> attention to ''cognitive processes'' came about more than eighteen centuries earlier, beginning with [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) and his interest in the inner workings of the mind and how they affect the human experience. Aristotle focused on cognitive areas pertaining to memory, perception, and mental imagery. He placed great importance on ensuring that his studies were based on empirical evidence, that is, scientific information that is gathered through observation and conscientious experimentation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret | name-list-style = vanc |title=Cognition|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2009|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=4}}</ref> Two millennia later, the groundwork for modern concepts of cognition was laid during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] by thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Dugald Stewart]] who sought to develop a model of the mind in which ideas were acquired, remembered and manipulated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel | name-list-style = vanc |title=The Cognitive Unity of Calvinist Pedagogy in Enlightenment Scotland|url=https://www.academia.edu/28249746|journal=Ábrahám Kovács (Ed.), Reformed Churches Working Unity in Diversity: Global Historical, Theological and Ethical Perspectives (Budapest: l'Harmattan, 2016)|pages=46–60}}</ref>

During the early nineteenth century cognitive models were developed both in [[philosophy]]—particularly by authors writing about the [[philosophy of mind]]—and within [[medicine]], especially by physicians seeking to understand how to cure madness. In [[England|Britain]], these models were studied in the academy by scholars such as [[James Sully]] at [[University College London]], and they were even used by politicians when considering the national [[Elementary Education Act 1870|''Elementary Education Act'']] of 1870.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eddy MD | title = The politics of cognition: liberalism and the evolutionary origins of Victorian education | journal = British Journal for the History of Science | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 677–699 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29019300 | doi = 10.1017/S0007087417000863 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

As [[psychology]] emerged as a burgeoning field of study in [[Europe]], whilst also gaining a following in [[United States|America]], scientists such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Hermann Ebbinghaus|Herman Ebbinghaus]], [[Mary Whiton Calkins]], and [[William James]] would offer their contributions to the study of human cognition.

=== Early theorists ===
[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832–1920) emphasized the notion of what he called ''[[introspection]]'': examining the inner feelings of an individual. With introspection, the subject had to be careful to describe their feelings in the most objective manner possible in order for Wundt to find the information scientific.<ref name="Fuchs">{{cite journal| vauthors = Fuchs AH, Milar KJ |title=Psychology as a science|journal=Handbook of Psychology|year=2003|volume=1|issue=The history of psychology|pages=1–26|doi=10.1002/0471264385.wei0101|isbn=0471264385}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Zangwill OL |title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=951–952}}</ref> Though Wundt's contributions are by no means minimal, modern psychologists find his methods to be quite subjective and choose to rely on more objective procedures of experimentation to make conclusions about the human cognitive process.

[[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1850–1909) conducted cognitive studies that mainly examined the function and capacity of human memory. Ebbinghaus developed his own experiment in which he constructed over 2,000 syllables made out of nonexistent words, for instance EAS. He then examined his own personal ability to learn these non-words. He purposely chose non-words as opposed to real words to control for the influence of pre-existing experience on what the words might symbolize, thus enabling easier recollection of them.<ref name="Fuchs" /><ref name="Zangwill">{{cite book| vauthors = Zangwill OL |title=The Oxford companion to the mind|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=276}}</ref> Ebbinghaus observed and hypothesized a number of variables that may have affected his ability to learn and recall the non-words he created. One of the reasons, he concluded, was the amount of time between the presentation of the list of stimuli and the recitation or recall of same.  Ebbinghaus was the first to record and plot a "[[learning curve]]" and a "[[forgetting curve]]".<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Brink TL | date = 2008 | chapter = "Memory." Unit 7 | title = Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach | page = 126 }}</ref> His work heavily influenced the study of serial position and its effect on memory (discussed further below).

[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an influential American pioneer in the realm of psychology. Her work also focused on the human memory capacity. A common theory, called the [[recency effect]], can be attributed to the studies that she conducted.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Madigan S, O'Hara R |title=Short-term memory at the turn of the century: Mary Whiton Calkin's memory research|journal=American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|pages=170–174|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.170|issue=2}}</ref> The recency effect, also discussed in the subsequent experiment section, is the tendency for individuals to be able to accurately recollect the final items presented in a sequence of stimuli. Calkin's theory is closely related to the aforementioned study and conclusion of the memory experiments conducted by Hermann Ebbinghaus.<ref name="Matlin">{{cite book|last=Matlin|first=Margaret | name-list-style = vanc |title=Cognition|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=5}}</ref>

[[William James]] (1842–1910) is another pivotal figure in the history of cognitive science. James was quite discontent with Wundt's emphasis on introspection and Ebbinghaus' use of nonsense stimuli. He instead chose to focus on the human learning experience in everyday life and its importance to the study of cognition. James' most significant contribution to the study and theory of cognition was his textbook ''Principles of Psychology'' that preliminarily examines aspects of cognition such as perception, memory, reasoning, and attention.<ref name="Matlin" />

[[René Descartes]] (1596-1650) was a seventeenth-century philosopher who came up with the phrase "Cogito, ergo sum." Which means "I think, therefore I am." He took a philosophical approach to the study of cognition and the mind, with his Meditations he wanted people to meditate along with him to come to the same conclusions as he did but in their own free cognition.<ref>{{cite web |title=René Descartes |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/#H3 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the [[concept]] of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables higher-level thinking (abstract thinking).]]{{See also|Cognitivism (psychology)}}
In [[psychology]], the term "cognition" is usually used within an [[information processing]] view of an individual's psychological [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functions]],<ref name="Sternberg2009">{{cite book | vauthors = Sternberg RJ, Sternberg K | date = 2009 | title = Cognitive Psychology | edition = 6th | location = Belmont, CA | publisher = [[Cengage|Wadsworth Cengage]] Learning }}</ref> and such is the same in [[cognitive engineering]].<ref name="Blomberg">{{cite journal| vauthors = Blomberg O |year = 2011|title = Concepts of cognition for cognitive engineering|journal = [[International Journal of Aviation Psychology]]|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 85–104|doi = 10.1080/10508414.2011.537561|s2cid = 144876967}}</ref> In the study of [[social cognition]], a branch of [[social psychology]], the term is used to explain [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], and [[group dynamics]].<ref name="Sternberg2009" />

Human cognition is conscious and [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[Tangibility|concrete]] or [[Abstraction|abstract]], as well as [[Intuition|intuitive]] (like knowledge of a language) and [[Conceptualism|conceptual]] (like a model of a language). It encompasses processes such as [[memory]], [[Association of Ideas|association]], [[concept formation]], [[pattern recognition]], [[language]], [[attention]], [[perception]], [[action (philosophy)|action]], [[problem solving]], and [[mental image]]ry.<ref>[[Stanley Coren|Coren, Stanley]], [[Lawrence M. Ward]], and James T. Enns. 1999. ''Sensation and Perception'' (5th ed.)''.''

While few people would deny that cognitive processes are a function of the [[brain]], a cognitive theory will not necessarily make reference to the brain or to biological processes ([[cf.]] [[neurocognitive]]). It may purely describe behavior in terms of information flow or function. Relatively recent fields of study such as [[neuropsychology]] aim to bridge this gap, using cognitive paradigms to understand how the brain implements the information-processing functions (cf. [[cognitive neuroscience]]), or to understand how pure information-processing systems (e.g., computers) can simulate human cognition (cf. [[artificial intelligence]]). The branch of psychology that studies brain injury to infer normal cognitive function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]]. The links of cognition to [[evolution]]ary demands are studied through the investigation of [[animal cognition]].

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
For years, [[List of sociologists|sociologists]] and [[psychologist]]s have conducted studies on [[cognitive development]], i.e. the construction of human thought or mental processes.

[[Jean Piaget]] was one of the most important and influential people in the field of [[developmental psychology]]. He believed that humans are unique in comparison to animals because we have the capacity to do "abstract symbolic reasoning". His work can be compared to [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Erik Erikson]] who were also great contributors in the field of developmental psychology. Today, Piaget is known for studying the cognitive development in children, having studied his own three children and their intellectual development, from which he would come to a [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] that describes the developmental stages of childhood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra | name-list-style = vanc |title=Jean Piaget Biography|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/profilesofmajorthinkers/p/piaget.htm|publisher=The New York Times Company|access-date=18 September 2012}}</ref>

=== Common types on human cognition ===
'''Serial position'''

The ''[[Serial-position effect|serial position]] experiment'' is meant to test a theory of memory that states that when information is given in a serial manner, we tend to remember information in the beginning of the sequence, called the ''primacy effect'', and information in the end of the sequence, called the ''recency effect''. Consequently, information given in the middle of the sequence is typically forgotten, or not recalled as easily. This study predicts that the recency effect is stronger than the primacy effect, because the information that is most recently learned is still in working memory when asked to be recalled. Information that is learned first still has to go through a retrieval process. This experiment focuses on human memory processes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Surprenant AM | title = Distinctiveness and serial position effects in tonal sequences | journal = Perception & Psychophysics | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 737–45 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11436742 | doi = 10.3758/BF03194434 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

'''Word superiority'''

The ''[[Word superiority effect|word superiority]] experiment'' presents a subject with a word, or a letter by itself, for a brief period of time, i.e. 40ms, and they are then asked to recall the letter that was in a particular location in the word. In theory, the subject should be better able to correctly recall the letter when it was presented in a word than when it was presented in isolation. This experiment focuses on human speech and language.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krueger LE | title = The word-superiority effect and phonological recoding | journal = Memory & Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 685–94 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1435271 | doi = 10.3758/BF03202718 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

'''Brown-Peterson'''

In the ''[[Brown–Peterson cohomology|Brown-Peterson]] experiment'', participants are briefly presented with a [[trigram]] and in one particular version of the experiment, they are then given a distractor task, asking them to identify whether a sequence of words are in fact words, or non-words (due to being misspelled, etc.). After the distractor task, they are asked to recall the trigram from before the distractor task. In theory, the longer the distractor task, the harder it will be for participants to correctly recall the trigram. This experiment focuses on human [[short-term memory]].<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Nairne J, Whiteman H, Kelley M |title=Short-term forgetting of order under conditions of reduced interference|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology |year=1999 |volume=52 |pages=241–251 |doi=10.1080/713755806 |s2cid=15713857|url=http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~nairne/pdfs/32.pdf}}</ref>

'''Memory span'''

During the ''[[memory span]] experiment'', each subject is presented with a sequence of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters that sound similar, and letters that sound dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order in which it was given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length was increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters that sound dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters that sound similar and with longer words.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = May CP, Hasher L, Kane MJ | title = The role of interference in memory span | journal = Memory & Cognition | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–67 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10540805 | doi = 10.3758/BF03198529 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

'''Visual search'''

In one version of the ''[[visual search]] experiment'', a participant is presented with a window that displays circles and squares scattered across it. The participant is to identify whether there is a green circle on the window. In the ''featured'' search, the subject is presented with several trial windows that have blue squares or circles and one green circle or no green circle in it at all. In the ''[[Conjunctive tasks|conjunctive]]'' search, the subject is presented with trial windows that have blue circles or green squares and a present or absent green circle whose presence the participant is asked to identify. What is expected is that in the feature searches, reaction time, that is the time it takes for a participant to identify whether a green circle is present or not, should not change as the number of distractors increases. Conjunctive searches where the target is absent should have a longer reaction time than the conjunctive searches where the target is present. The theory is that in feature searches, it is easy to spot the target, or if it is absent, because of the difference in color between the target and the distractors. In conjunctive searches where the target is absent, reaction time increases because the subject has to look at each shape to determine whether it is the target or not because some of the distractors if not all of them, are the same color as the target stimuli. Conjunctive searches where the target is present take less time because if the target is found, the search between each shape stops.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Wolfe J, Cave K, Franzel S |title=Guided search: An alternative to the feature integration model for visual search|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1989|volume=15|pages=419–433|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419 |issue=3 |pmid=2527952|citeseerx=10.1.1.551.1667 }}</ref>

'''Knowledge representation'''

The [[semantic network]] of [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge representation]] systems has been studied in various paradigms. One of the oldest paradigms is the [[leveling]] and [[sharpening]] of stories as they are repeated from memory studied by [[Frederic Bartlett|Bartlett]]. The [[semantic differential]] used [[factor analysis]] to determine the main meanings of words, finding that [[value (ethics)|value]] or "goodness" of words is the first factor. More controlled experiments examine the categorical relationships of words in [[free recall]]. The hierarchical structure of words has been explicitly mapped in [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]]'s [[Wordnet]]. More dynamic models of semantic networks have been created and tested with [[neural network]] experiments based on computational systems such as [[latent semantic analysis]] (LSA), [[Thomas Bayes|Bayesian]] analysis, and multidimensional [[factor analysis]]. The semantics (meaning) of words is studied by all the disciplines of [[cognitive science]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinker S, Bloom P | title = Natural language and natural selection. |date=December 1990 |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707–727 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 }}</ref>

'''Physical exercise'''

Aerobic and [[anaerobic exercise]] has been studied concerning cognitive improvement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanders LM, Hortobágyi T, la Bastide-van Gemert S, van der Zee EA, van Heuvelen MJ | title = Dose-response relationship between exercise and cognitive function in older adults with and without cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = e0210036 | date = 2019-01-10 | pmid = 30629631 | pmc = 6328108 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0210036 | bibcode = 2019PLoSO..1410036S | url = https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210036 | veditors = Regnaux JP }}</ref> There appears to be short-term increases in attention span, verbal and visual memory in some studies.

'''Dietary supplements'''

Studies evaluating [[phytoestrogen]], blueberry supplementation and antioxidants showed minor increases in cognitive function after the supplementation compared to before but no significant effects compared to [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barfoot KL, May G, Lamport DJ, Ricketts J, Riddell PM, Williams CM | title = The effects of acute wild blueberry supplementation on the cognition of 7-10-year-old schoolchildren | journal = European Journal of Nutrition | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 2911–2920 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 30327868 | pmc = 6768899 | doi = 10.1007/s00394-018-1843-6 | url = http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00394-018-1843-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thaung Zaw JJ, Howe PR, Wong RH | title = Does phytoestrogen supplementation improve cognition in humans?

'''Pleasurable social stimulation'''

Exposing individuals with cognitive impairment (i.e., [[Dementia]]) to daily activities designed to stimulate thinking and memory in a social setting, seems to improve cognition. Although study materials are small, and larger studies need to confirm the results, the effect of social cognitive stimulation seems to be larger than the effects of some drug treatments.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Woods B, Aguirre E, Spector AE, Orrell M | title = Cognitive stimulation to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005562 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22336813 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005562.pub2  | collaboration = Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group }}</ref>

'''Other methods'''

[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) has been shown to improve cognition in individuals without dementia 1 month after treatment session compared to before treatment. The effect was not significantly larger compared to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trung J, Hanganu A, Jobert S, Degroot C, Mejia-Constain B, Kibreab M, Bruneau MA, Lafontaine AL, Strafella A, Monchi O | display-authors = 6 | title = Transcranial magnetic stimulation improves cognition over time in Parkinson's disease | journal = Parkinsonism & Related Disorders | volume = 66 | pages = 3–8 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31300260 | doi = 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2019.07.006 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1353802019302962 }}</ref> Computerized cognitive training, utilising a computer based training regime for different cognitive functions has been examined in a clinical setting but no lasting effects has been shown.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gates NJ, Rutjes AW, Di Nisio M, Karim S, Chong LY, March E, Martínez G, Vernooij RW | display-authors = 6 | title = Computerised cognitive training for 12 or more weeks for maintaining cognitive function in cognitively healthy people in late life | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD012277 | date = February 2020 | pmid = 32104914 | pmc = 7045394 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012277.pub3 | url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14651858.CD012277.pub3 | collaboration = Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group }}</ref>
