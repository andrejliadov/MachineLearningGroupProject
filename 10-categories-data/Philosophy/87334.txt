{{short description|Message that is claimed by a prophet to have been communicated to them by a deity}}
{{Other uses}}
A '''prophecy''' is a message that is claimed by a [[prophet]] to have been communicated to them by a [[deity]]. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or [[revelation]] of divine will concerning the prophet's social world and events to come (compare [[Light (theology)|divine knowledge]]). 

==Etymology==
The English noun "prophecy", in the sense of "function of a prophet" appeared from about 1225, from [[Old French]] ''profecie'' (12th century), and from ''prophetia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''propheteia'' "gift of interpreting the will of God", from Greek ''prophetes'' (see [[prophet]]). The related meaning, "thing spoken or written by a prophet", dates from {{circa}} 1300, while the verb "to prophesy" is recorded by 1377.<ref>

The Hebrew term for prophet, ''[[Neviim|Navi]]'', literally means "spokesperson"; he speaks to the people as a mouthpiece of their [[god in Judaism|God]], and to their god on behalf of the people. "The name ''prophet,'' from the Greek meaning "forespeaker" (πρὸ being used in the original local sense), is an equivalent of the Hebrew [[Nevi'im|נבוא]], which signifies properly a delegate or mouthpiece of another."<ref name="JE-Prophecy"/>

</ref>

The [[Torah]] contains laws concerning the ''false prophet'' (Deuteronomy 13:2-6, 18:20-22). Prophets in Islam like [[Lot in Islam|Lot]], for example, are false prophets according to Jewish standards.

In the Torah, prophecy often consisted of a conditioned warning by their [[God]] of the consequences should the society, specific communities, or their leaders not adhere to Torah's instructions in the time contemporary with the prophet's life. Prophecies sometimes included conditioned promises of blessing for obeying their god, and returning to behaviors and laws as written in the Torah. Conditioned warning prophecies feature in all Jewish works of the [[Tanakh]].
 
Notably [[Maimonides]], philosophically suggested there once were many levels of prophecy, from the highest such as those experienced by [[Moses]], to the lowest where the individuals were able to apprehend the Divine Will, but not respond or even describe this experience to others, citing in example, Shem, Eber and most notably, [[Noah in rabbinic literature|Noah]], who, in biblical narrative, does not issue prophetic declarations.<ref>The Guide for the Perplexed /Part II/Chapter XXXIX</ref>

Maimonides, in his philosophical work ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', outlines twelve modes of prophecy<ref>The Guide for the Perplexed (Friedlander)/Part II/Chapters#CHAPTER XLV</ref> from lesser to greater degree of clarity:

# Inspired actions
# Inspired words
# [[Allegorical]] [[dream]] revelations
# [[Auditory imagery|Auditory]] dream revelations
# Audiovisual dream revelations/human speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/Divine speaker
# Allegorical waking [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]
# Auditory waking revelation
# Audiovisual waking revelation/human speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/Divine speaker (that refers implicitly to Moses)

The Tanakh contains prophecies from various [[Prophets in Judaism|Hebrew prophets]] (55 in total) who communicated messages from God to the [[nation of Israel]], and later the population of [[Judea]] and elsewhere. Experience of prophecy in the Torah and the rest of Tanakh was not restricted to Jews. Nor was the prophetic experience restricted to the [[Hebrew]] language.

==Christianity==
{{See also|Predictions and claims for the Second Coming of Christ|Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions|Prophets of Christianity}}
The [[New Testament]] refers to prophecy as one of the [[spiritual gifts]] given by the indwelling [[Holy Spirit]]{{Bibleref2c|Rom|12:6}}. From this, many Christians believe that the gift of prophecy is the [[supernatural]] ability to receive and convey a message from [[God]]. The purpose of the message may be to "edify, exhort and comfort" the members of the Church. In this context, not all prophecies contain [[predictions]] about the future. The [[Apostle Paul]] teaches in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Corinthians]] that prophecy is for the benefit of the whole Church and not just of the individual exercising the gift.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|14:22||1 Cor. 14:22}}

According to [[Walter Brueggemann]], the task of prophetic (Christian) ministry is to nurture, nourish and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture.<ref>[[Walter Brueggemann]], The Prophetic Imagination, (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 1978), 13.</ref> A recognized form of Christian prophecy is the "prophetic drama" which [[Frederick William Dillistone|Frederick Dillistone]] describes as a "metaphorical conjunction between present situations and future events".<ref>F.W.Dillstone; Christianity and Symbolism; London 1955, p275; referenced in 'The function of prophetic drama' in "The place is too small for us": the Israelite prophets in recent scholarship, by R. P. Gordon, 1995 Eisenbrauns, (cf Galatians 4:24)</ref>

=== Later Christianity ===
In his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', [[Justin Martyr]] argued that prophets were no longer among Israel but were in the Church.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'', written around the mid-2nd century, describes the way prophecy was being used within the church of that time. [[Irenaeus]] confirms the existence of such spiritual gifts in his ''[[Against Heresies]]''. Although some modern commentators claim that [[Montanus]] was rejected because he claimed to be a prophet, a careful examination of history shows that the gift of prophecy was still acknowledged during the time of Montanus, and that he was controversial because of the manner in which he prophesied and the doctrines he propagated.<ref>[http://newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History, Book V, Chapter 16 & 18] Montanus...became beside himself, and being suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to babble and utter strange things, prophesying in a manner contrary to the constant custom of the Church handed down by tradition from the beginning.... His actions and his teaching show who this new teacher is. This is he who taught the dissolution of marriage; who made laws for fasting; who named Pepuza and Tymion, small towns in Phrygia, Jerusalem, wishing to gather people to them from all directions; who appointed collectors of money; who contrived the receiving of gifts under the name of offerings; who provided salaries for those who preached his doctrine, that its teaching might prevail through gluttony.</ref>

Prophecy and other spiritual gifts were somewhat rarely acknowledged throughout church history and there are few examples of the prophetic and certain other gifts until the Scottish [[Covenanter]]s like [[Prophet Peden]] and [[John Wishart (bishop)|John Wishart]]. From 1904 to 1906, the [[Azusa Street Revival]] occurred in Los Angeles, California and is sometimes considered the birthplace of [[Pentecostalism]]. This revival is well known for the "[[speaking in tongues]]" that occurred there. Some participants of the Azusa Street Revival are claimed to have prophesied. Pentecostals believe prophecy and certain other gifts are once again being given to Christians. The [[Charismatic Movement]] also accepts spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues and prophecy.

Since 1972, the [[neo-Pentecostal]] [[Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International]] has expressed a belief in prophecy. The church claims this gift is manifested by one person (the prophesier) laying their hands on another person, who receives an individual message said by the prophesier. Prophesiers are believed to be used by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]] as instruments through whom their God expresses his promises, advice and commandments. The church claims people receive messages about their future, in the form of promises given by their God and expected to be fulfilled by divine action.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025080417/http://www.idmji.org/index.php/en/historiaiglesia History of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International (official page)]</ref>

=== Prophetic word in the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement ===
In the [[Apostolic-Prophetic Movement]], a prophesy is simply a word delivered under the inspiration of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] that accurately communicates God's "thoughts and intention".<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hamon|first1=Bill|title=Prophets and Personal Prophesy.

The Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders was a council of prophetic elders co-convened by [[C.

===Latter Day Saint movement===
{{See also|Joseph Smith|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] maintains that its first prophet, [[Joseph Smith]], was visited by [[God in Mormonism|God]] and Jesus Christ in 1820. The Latter Day Saints further claims that God communicated directly with Joseph Smith on many subsequent occasions, and that following the death of Joseph Smith God has continued to speak through subsequent prophets. Joseph Smith claims to have been led by an angel to a large hill in upstate New York, where he was shown an ancient manuscript engraved on plates of gold metal. Joseph Smith claimed to have translated this manuscript into modern English under divine inspiration by the gift and power of God, and the publication of this translation are known as the [[Book of Mormon]].

Following Smith's murder, there was a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that resulted in a great schism. The majority of [[Latter-day Saints]] believing [[Brigham Young]] to be the next prophet and following him out to Utah, while a minority returned to Missouri with Emma Smith, believing Joseph Smith Junior's son, [[Joseph Smith III]], to be the next legitimate prophet (forming the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]], now the Community of Christ). Since even before the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, there have been numerous separatist [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint sects]] that have splintered from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. To this day, there are an unknown number of organizations within the Latter Day Saint movement, each with their own proposed prophet.

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the largest Latter Day Saint body. The current [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|Prophet/President]] of the LDS Church is [[Russell M. Nelson]]. The church has, since [[Death of Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith's death]] on June 27, 1844, held a belief that the president of their church is also a literal prophet of God. The church also maintains that further revelations claimed to have been given through Joseph Smith are published in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], one of the [[Standard Works]]. Additional revelations and prophecies outside the Standard Works, such as Joseph Smith's "[[White Horse Prophecy]]", concerning a great and final war in the United States before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, can be found in other church published works.

The Arabic term for prophecy ''[[Prophets in Islam|nubuwwa]]'' ({{lang-ar|نُبُوَّة}}) occurs five times in the [[Quran]] and stems from the term for prophets, ''[[Prophets in Islam|nabī]]'' ({{lang-ar|نَبِي}}; pl.

In the sense of predicting events, the [[Quran]] contains verses believed to have predicted many events years before they happened and that such prophecies are proof of the divine origin of the Qur'an. The Qur'an itself states "For every announcement there is a term, and ye will come to know." {{quran-usc|6|67}} Muslims also recognize the validity of some prophecies in other sacred texts like in the [[Bible]]; however, they believe that, unlike the Qur'an, some parts of the Bible have been corrupted over the years, and as a result, not all of the prophecies and verses in the Bible are accurate.<ref>[http://islam.thetruecall.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=357 The Corruption of the Bible – A Fact Attested by the Quran" The True Call] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904131728/http://islam.thetruecall.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=357 |date=2012-09-04 }}</ref>

==Buddhism==
The ''Haedong Kosung-jon'' (Biographies of High Monks) records that King [[Beopheung of Silla]] had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", [[Ichadon]], devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527.<ref>Korea: a religious history, James Huntley Grayson, p. 34</ref>

==China==
In ancient Chinese, prophetic texts are known as [[Chen prophecy|Chen]] (谶).  The most famous Chinese prophecy is the [[Tui bei tu]] (推背圖).

==Native American prophecy==
There exists a problem in verifying most Native American prophecy, in that they remain primarily an [[oral tradition]], and thus there is no way to cite references of where writings have been committed to paper. In their system, the best reference is an Elder, who acts as a repository of the accumulated wisdom of their tradition.

In another type of example, it is recorded that there are three [[Tli Cho|Dogrib]] prophets who had claimed to have been divinely inspired to bring the message of Christianity's God to their people.<ref>p.27, Helm</ref> This prophecy among the Dogrib involves elements such as dances and trance-like states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texts.00.gs/Dogrib_prophecy.htm|title=Dogrib prophecy}}</ref>

==Nostradamus==
[[Esotericism|Esoteric]] prophecy has been claimed for, but not by, Michel de Nostredame, popularly referred to as [[Nostradamus]], who claimed to be a [[Conversion to Christianity|converted Christian]]. It is known that he suffered several tragedies in his life, and was persecuted to some degree for his cryptic esoteric writings about the future, reportedly derived through a use of a [[crystal ball]]. Nostradamus was a French [[apothecary]] and reputed seer who published collections of foreknowledge of future events. He is best known for his book ''Les Propheties'' ("The Prophecies"), the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since ''Les Propheties'' was published, Nostradamus has attracted an esoteric following that, along with the popularistic press, credits him with foreseeing world events. His esoteric cryptic foreseeings have in some cases been assimilated to the results of applying the alleged [[Bible code]], as well as to other purported pseudo-prophetic works.

Most reliable academic sources maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's [[quatrain]]s are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power. Moreover, none of the sources listed offers any evidence that anyone has ever interpreted any of Nostradamus's pseudo-prophetic works specifically enough to allow a clear identification of any event in advance.<ref name="ref2">Lemesurier, Peter, ''The Unknown Nostradamus'', 2003</ref>

==Skepticism==
According to skeptics, many apparently fulfilled prophecies can be explained as [[coincidence]]s (possibly aided by the prophecy's own vagueness), or that some prophecies were actually invented after the fact to match the circumstances of a past event ("[[postdiction]]").<ref name="Hines 2003">[[Terence Hines| Hines, Terence]].

Many prophets make a large number of prophecies. This makes the chances of at least one prophecy being correct much higher by sheer weight of numbers.<ref>[http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=449 Skeptic report, Prophesies for dummies by Allan Glenn]</ref>

==Psychology==
The phenomenon of prophecy is not well understood in psychology research literature.  Psychiatrist and neurologist Arthur Deikman describes the phenomenon as an "intuitive knowing, a type of perception that bypasses the usual sensory channels and rational intellect."<ref>{{cite book |author = Deikman, A. J. |year = 1982 |title = The Observing self: Mysticism and psychotherapy |publisher = Beacon Press |location = Boston | page = 21 |isbn = 0-8070-2950-5}}</ref>

"(P)rophecy can be likened to a bridge between the individual 'mystical self' and the communal 'mystical body'," writes religious sociologist [[Margaret Poloma]].<ref>{{cite book |author = Poloma, Margaret |year = 2003 |title = Main street mystics: The Toronto blessing & reviving Pentecostalism |url = https://archive.org/details/mainstreetmystic00polo |url-access = limited |publisher = Alta Mira Press |location = Walnut Creek, CA | page = [https://archive.org/details/mainstreetmystic00polo/page/n123 115] |isbn = 0-7591-0353-4}}</ref> Prophecy seems to involve "the free association that occurred through the workings of the right brain."<ref>{{cite book |author = Poloma, M.

Psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that this is a temporary accessing of the bicameral mind; that is, a temporary separating of functions, such that the authoritarian part of the mind seems to literally be speaking to the person as if a separate (and external) voice.  Jaynes posits that the gods heard as voices in the head were and are organizations of the central nervous system. God speaking through man, according to Jaynes, is a more recent vestige of God speaking to man; the product of a more integrated higher self. When the bicameral mind speaks, there is no introspection. In earlier times, posits Jaynes, there was additionally a visual component, now lost.<ref>{{cite book |author = Jaynes, J. |year = 1976 |title = Main street mystics: The origins of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind |publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company |location = Boston | page = 74}}</ref>

Child development and consciousness author [[Joseph Chilton Pearce]] remarked that revelation typically appears in symbolic form and "in a single flash of insight."<ref>{{cite book |author = Pearce, J. C. |year = 2002–2004 |title = The Biology of Transcendence: A blueprint of the human spirit |publisher = Inner Traditions International |location = Rochester, VT | page = 191 |isbn = 0-89281-990-1}}</ref>  He used the metaphor of lightning striking and suggests that the revelation is "a result of a buildup of resonant potential."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Biology of Transcendence|author = Pearce, J. C. | page = 192}}</ref>  Pearce compared it to the earth asking a question and the sky answering it. Focus, he said, feeds into "a unified field of like resonance (and becomes) capable of attracting and receiving the field's answer when it does form."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Biology of Transcendence|author = Pearce, J. C. | pages = 194 & 196}}</ref>

Some cite aspects of [[cognitive psychology]] such as pattern forming and attention to the formation of prophecy in modern-day society as well as the declining influence of religion in daily life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeginner.eu/curious/481-the-fallacy-of-prophecy |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425152322/http://www.thebeginner.eu/curious/481-the-fallacy-of-prophecy |archive-date=2011-04-25 }}</ref>

== Poetry and prophecy ==
For the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], prediction, prophesy, and poetry were often intertwined.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foundation|first=Poetry|date=2020-08-22|title=Poetry and Prophecy by A.E.

In ancient China, divination is regarded as the oldest form of occult inquiry and was often expressed in verse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pettit|first=Jonathan|date=2006|title=Review of Chinese Poetry and Prophecy: The Written Oracle in East Asia|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23732747|journal=China Review International|volume=13|issue=2|pages=512–517|jstor=23732747|issn=1069-5834}}</ref> In contemporary Western cultures, theological revelation and poetry are typically seen as distinct and often even as opposed to each other.

[[Middle English]] poems of a political nature are linked with Latin and vernacular prophecies. Prophecies in this sense are predictions concerning kingdoms or peoples; and these predictions are often [[eschatological]] or [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Poems of Political Prophecy: Introduction {{!}} Robbins Library Digital Projects|url=https://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/dean-medieval-english-political-writings-poems-of-political-prophecy-introduction|access-date=2020-08-22|website=d.lib.rochester.edu}}</ref> The prophetic tradition in English derives in from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History Of The Kings Of Britain|History of the Kings of Britain]]'' (1136), otherwise called "[[Prophecies of Merlin]];" this work is prelude to numerous books devoted to [[King Arthur]].  In 18th century England, prophecy as poetry is revived by [[William Blake]] <ref>{{Cite web|last=Armenti|first=Peter|date=2017-10-24|title=Poetry, and history, and prophecy!

Contemporary American poetry is also rich in lyrics about prophesy, including poems entitled Prophecy by [[Dana Gioia]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Poets|first=Academy of American|title=Prophecy by Dana Gioia - Poems {{!}} Academy of American Poets|url=https://poets.org/poem/prophecy|access-date=2020-08-22|website=poets.org}}</ref> and [[Eileen Myles]].
