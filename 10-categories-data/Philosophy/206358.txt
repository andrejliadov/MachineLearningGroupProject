{{short description|Philosophical position that systems should be analyzed as wholes, not just as collections of parts}}
'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that various [[system]]s (e.g. physical, biological, social) should be viewed as wholes, not merely as a collection of parts.<ref>{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.</ref> The term "holism" was coined by [[Jan Smuts]] in his 1926 book ''[[Holism and Evolution]]''.<ref name=oed>"holism, n." OED Online, [[Oxford University Press]], September 2019, www.oed.com/view/Entry/87726. Accessed 23 October 2019.</ref>

==Meaning==
The exact meaning of "holism" depends on context. Smuts originally used "holism" to refer to the tendency in nature to produce wholes from the ordered grouping of unit structures.<ref name=oed /> However, in common usage, "holism" usually refers to the idea that a whole is greater than the sum of its parts.<ref name=poynton>J. C. Poynton (1987) SMUTS'S HOLISM AND EVOLUTION SIXTY YEARS ON, Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, 46:3, 181-189, DOI:10.1080/00359198709520121</ref> In this sense, "holism" may also be spelled "'''wholism'''", and it may be contrasted with [[reductionism]] or [[atomism]].<ref> "wholism, n."
