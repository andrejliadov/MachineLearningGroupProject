'''Agathism''', from the Greek ἀγαθός ''agathos'' (good)<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=agathism</ref> is, according to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', "The doctrine that all things tend towards ultimate good, as distinguished from [[optimism]], which holds that all things are now for the best". An agathist accepts that [[evil]] and misfortune will ultimately happen, but that the eventual outcome leads towards the good.<ref>''There's A Word for It! A Grandiloquent Guide to Life'' by Charles Harrington Lester, p. 124</ref> In other words, an agathist may see the world as essentially good but a place in which bad things can and do happen to good people.{{cn|date=June 2014}}

==In theology==
Agathism is offered as an [[apologetic]] in [[theodicy]] to address the problem of reconciling a benevolent [[God]] with the [[existence of evil]] in the world. A form of agathism is found in [[Muslim]] thought and in some [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs. The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] believes that even the punishment of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] in [[hell]] is not eternal, but that the wicked perish.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In [[theology|theologies]] which hold human history to be a narrative authored by God, agathism forms the basis for the development of [[Messianism]].<ref>Tischner on Agathology</ref><ref>The Axiological Impressions in The Controversy Over the Existence of Man</ref><ref>The Tischner Institute Journal of Philosophy</ref>
