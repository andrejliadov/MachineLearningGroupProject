The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a [[Academic tenure|tenure-track]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref name=Brubaker18May2017>{{cite news |last1=Brubaker |first1=Rogers |author-link1=Rogers Brubaker |title=The Uproar Over 'Transracialism' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html |work=The New York Times |date=18 May 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170521012826/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html?_r=0 |archive-date=21 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2019|loc=223}} The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.<ref name=Singal2May2017>Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017).

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} After a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] criticized the article and attacked Tuvel, an open letter began circulating, naming one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact and urging the journal to retract the article. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".<ref name=letter/><ref name=Singal2May2017/>

On 1 May the journal's Facebook page apologized for the article's publication on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.<ref name=Heyes30April2017/><ref name=Singal2May2017/> By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,<ref name=Anderson18May2017/> including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]].

===Author===
Rebecca Tuvel was born in Toronto to a [[Jew]]ish family; her mother is a pharmacist and her father a dentist.

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] article after noticing the contrast between the reception given in 2015 to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.<ref>Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref> Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===

}}
Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." [[Self-identification]] and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change. As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]; if there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the [[rabbi]] doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the [[Jewish identity|new identity]] will be accepted.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Arguing for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&nbsp;... self-identification",{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} she maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Dolezal's self-identification as black, her living as someone society had accepted as black, and her exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], would be enough to deem her black, according to Tuvel.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Tuvel addresses four objections to transracialism. First, a claim to be black requires the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] called this the "one thing that binds black people".<ref>{{harvnb|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"]. ''RealClear Politics''.</ref> That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Therefore, in Tuvel's view, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}} A second objection is that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed in America on ancestry; no matter the facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters. Tuvel argues that this position holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo".{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white person seeks to enter it; Dolezal's passing as black was compared to [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification was not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there was nothing insulting about it; it did not appear to be temporary; there were no questionable ends; and there was no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It was therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}} A fourth objection is that Dolezal was engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege": a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it, while a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

Baird Callicott]] ([[University of North Texas|UNT]]), Andrew Forcehimes ([[Nanyang Technological University|NTU]]) and David Gray ([[University of Memphis|UofM]]) for having read earlier drafts.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=275}} Tuvel submitted the article to ''Hypatia'' on 12 February 2016,<ref name=history>[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full "Publication history"], "In Defense of Transracialism", ''Hypatia'', 25 April 2017.</ref> and on 26 February she presented it to a conference at the [[University of Waterloo]].<ref>[https://uwaterloo.ca/philosophy/events/philosophy-colloquium-series-2015-2016-5 "Philosophy Colloquium Series 2015-2016"], University of Waterloo.

American Philosophical Association. Retrieved 7 May 2017.</ref> The scheduled commentators were Kris Sealey ([[Fairfield University|Fairfield]]), a ''Hypatia'' reviewer in 2016,<ref>{{cite journal| volume=32 | issue=2|title=Thanks to Reviewers | date=25 April 2017 | journal=Hypatia | pages=468–471| doi=10.1111/hypa.12332 }}</ref><ref name=APAmeeting/> and [[Tina Fernandes Botts]] ([[Fresno State]]).<ref name=APAmeeting>{{cite web |title=113th Annual Meeting Program |url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/eastern2017/E2017_Meeting_Program.pdf |publisher=American Philosophical Association Eastern Division |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521194820/https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/eastern2017/E2017_Meeting_Program.pdf |archive-date=21 May 2017 |page=10 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=McKenzie6May2017/> Sealey's rebuttal included that the biology of race "is really about a relationship between actual genetic ancestry (on the one hand), and the cultural and social signification of that ancestry (on the other)". The role of ancestry is therefore not biological but cultural, she argued.{{sfn|Sealey|2018|loc=23}} She argued further that "the white person who attempts to shed her white identity becomes blind to the racial privilege that she cannot opt out of".{{sfn|Sealey|2018|loc=27–28}}

Botts did not attend the meeting but submitted a short reply, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the US sees it as an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".<ref name=Botts2018pp52-53>{{harvnb|Botts|2018|loc=52–53}}.</ref> She presented a more detailed position at a Fresno State meeting in March and at the ''[[Res Philosophica]]'' conference in April.<ref>{{harvnb|Botts|2018|loc=52–53}}; Uribes, Tom (9 March 2017).

==Social-media response==
===Criticism===
On 28 April 2017, Tuvel and the article came under attack on Facebook and Twitter. Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy, and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in "epistemic violence".<ref name=Oliver7May2017>{{harvnb|Oliver|2017}}.</ref> Several feminists referred to her as a "[[Becky (slang)|Becky]]".<ref name=Sosis/><ref name=Tuvel2018>{{harvnb|Tuvel|2018|loc=74}}.</ref><ref>Brean, Joseph (3 May 2017).

''The National Post''.</ref> The article was called violent, crap, and "wack shit".<ref name=Oliver7May2017/><ref name=McKenzie1May2017/> The philosopher [[Kelly Oliver]], who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,<ref name=PhDcommittee/> defended Tuvel on Facebook by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable" and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].<ref name=Oliver7May2017/>

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up; several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article. A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."<ref name=Oliver7May2017/> Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.<ref name=Sosis/>

Nora Berenstain, assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]], wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained "egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/><ref name=Whittington2018pp170-171/>{{efn|Berenstain said that the term "violence" referred to "structural violence", which she described as "a range of systemic harms that go beyond direct interpersonal physical contact".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/>}} Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite black women philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name ([[deadnaming]]) and her use of the terms "transgenderism", "biological sex" and "male genitalia". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".<ref name=Singal2May2017/>

{{quote|1.  It uses vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields; for example, the author uses the language of "transgenderism" and engages in [[deadnaming]] a trans woman;

2.  It mischaracterizes various theories and practices relating to religious identity and conversion; for example, the author gives an off-hand example about conversion to Judaism;

3.  It misrepresents leading accounts of belonging to a racial group; for example, the author incorrectly cites [[Charles W. Mills|Charles Mills]] as a defender of voluntary racial identification;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of “transracialism”.&nbsp;...<ref name=Singal2May2017/><ref name=letter>"Open letter to Hypatia".

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to the philosopher Justin Weinberg, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/> [[GLAAD]] does caution against using the term ''transgenderism''. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.<ref name=Singal2May2017/>{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."<ref>Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.</ref>}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/>{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Tuvel did not identify Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; Weinberg wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/>{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including "self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification" (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}} The criticism that Tuvel did not cite enough women of color might be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.<ref name=Singal2May2017/> Weinberg wrote that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out any work that was directly relevant and had been omitted.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017>{{cite web |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Philosopher's Article On Transracialism Sparks Controversy (Updated with response from author) |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/ |website=[[Daily Nous]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503040024/http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |date=1 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The philosopher [[Justin E. H. Smith]] described the claim that Tuvel did not cite the relevant literature as "fatuous nonsense": "None of the experts within the narrow community of scholars Tuvel was faulted for ignoring had themselves cited more than the tiniest fraction of potentially relevant literature ...".{{sfn|Smith|2019|loc=223}}

===Associate editors' apology===
On 30 April 2017—two days before the open letter was delivered to ''Hypatia''—[[Cressida Heyes]], then one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s 10 associate editors,<ref name=editorialboardJune2017/> posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors". On 1 May it was reposted to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page, this time from "a majority" of the associate editors.<ref name=Heyes30April2017>{{cite web |last1=Heyes |first1=Cressida |author-link=Cressida Heyes |title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |publisher=Personal Facebook page |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170501235735/https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |archive-date=9 May 2017 |date=30 April 2017 |url-status=dead|access-date=23 July 2018 }}{{pb}}

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published" and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined, the letter said, to name the anonymous reviewers.<ref name=Singal2May2017/>

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement on 1 May 2017 saying she had written the article "from a place of support for those with non-normative identities", because she had perceived a "transphobic logic that lay at the heart" of the attacks against Dolezal. Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the reference to Jenner's previous name,<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/> which was removed from the article at her request on 4&nbsp;May.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017}} Regarding the personal attacks, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger" and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/><ref name=McKenzie1May2017>McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' response===
[[Sally Scholz]], the editor-in-chief, called the associate editor's repudiation of the article "utterly inappropriate".{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating—students and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/>}} Scholz was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. The journal referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/> On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.<ref>Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017).

===Academic response===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel,{{sfn|Whittington|2018|loc=171}} particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/><ref>Leiter, Brian (1 May 2017).

''Leiter Reports''.</ref> Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".<ref name=Singal2May2017/> Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archive-date=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".<ref name=Singal2May2017/> The associate editors' letter had twisted the concept of harm "beyond all recognition", according to the philosopher José Luis Bermúdez.<ref>Bermúdez, José Luis (5 May 2017).

Commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/><ref name=Oliver7May2017/><ref name=Walters5May2017/> In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".<ref name=Walters5May2017/> The philosopher Dan Kaufman blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".<ref>Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018).

''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.</ref> [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues.<ref name=Brubaker18May2017/> There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process, which she said had allowed the paper to be published without ensuring that it was "situated within contemporary scholarly discussions".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/>

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
[[Sally Haslanger]], later co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.<ref>[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' resignations===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.<ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/> On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Sally Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of ''Hypatia Reviews Online''. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.<ref name=Weinberg21July2017>{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia's Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archive-date=26 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=resignation>{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archive-date=24 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=interim>{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}</ref>

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".<ref name=Weinberg24July2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017>{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a [[Academic tenure|tenure-track]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref name=Brubaker18May2017>{{cite news |last1=Brubaker |first1=Rogers |author-link1=Rogers Brubaker |title=The Uproar Over 'Transracialism' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html |work=The New York Times |date=18 May 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170521012826/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html?_r=0 |archive-date=21 May 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2019|loc=223}} The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.<ref name=Singal2May2017>Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"].

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} After a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] criticized the article and attacked Tuvel, an open letter began circulating, naming one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact and urging the journal to retract the article. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".<ref name=letter/><ref name=Singal2May2017/>

On 1 May the journal's Facebook page apologized for the article's publication on behalf of "a majority" of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s associate editors.<ref name=Heyes30April2017/><ref name=Singal2May2017/> By the following day the open letter had 830 signatories,<ref name=Anderson18May2017/> including scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' and two members of Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]].

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] article after noticing the contrast between the reception given in 2015 to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.<ref>Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref> Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===
{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 180 <!--thumb-->

}}
Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." [[Self-identification]] and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change. As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]; if there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the [[rabbi]] doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the [[Jewish identity|new identity]] will be accepted.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Arguing for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&nbsp;... self-identification",{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} she maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Dolezal's self-identification as black, her living as someone society had accepted as black, and her exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], would be enough to deem her black, according to Tuvel.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Tuvel addresses four objections to transracialism. First, a claim to be black requires the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]] called this the "one thing that binds black people".<ref>{{harvnb|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"]. ''RealClear Politics''.</ref> That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Therefore, in Tuvel's view, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}} A second objection is that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed in America on ancestry; no matter the facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters. Tuvel argues that this position holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo".{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white person seeks to enter it; Dolezal's passing as black was compared to [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification was not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there was nothing insulting about it; it did not appear to be temporary; there were no questionable ends; and there was no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It was therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}} A fourth objection is that Dolezal was engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege": a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it, while a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

==Social-media response==
===Criticism===
On 28 April 2017, Tuvel and the article came under attack on Facebook and Twitter. Tuvel was called transphobic, racist, crazy, and stupid, and was accused of having engaged in "epistemic violence".<ref name=Oliver7May2017>{{harvnb|Oliver|2017}}.</ref> Several feminists referred to her as a "[[Becky (slang)|Becky]]".<ref name=Sosis/><ref name=Tuvel2018>{{harvnb|Tuvel|2018|loc=74}}.</ref><ref>Brean, Joseph (3 May 2017).

''The National Post''.</ref> The article was called violent, crap, and "wack shit".<ref name=Oliver7May2017/><ref name=McKenzie1May2017/> The philosopher [[Kelly Oliver]], who chaired Tuvel's [[dissertation committee]] in 2014,<ref name=PhDcommittee/> defended Tuvel on Facebook by asking for arguments rather than insults, and suggested that ''Hypatia'' invite critical responses. She was told her comments were "unforgivable" and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].<ref name=Oliver7May2017/>

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up; several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article. A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."<ref name=Oliver7May2017/> Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.<ref name=Sosis/>

Nora Berenstain, assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]], wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained "egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/><ref name=Whittington2018pp170-171/>{{efn|Berenstain said that the term "violence" referred to "structural violence", which she described as "a range of systemic harms that go beyond direct interpersonal physical contact".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/>}} Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite black women philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name ([[deadnaming]]) and her use of the terms "transgenderism", "biological sex" and "male genitalia". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".<ref name=Singal2May2017/>

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to the philosopher Justin Weinberg, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/> [[GLAAD]] does caution against using the term ''transgenderism''. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.<ref name=Singal2May2017/>{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."<ref>Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.</ref>}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/>{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Tuvel did not identify Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; Weinberg wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/>{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including "self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification" (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfn|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}} The criticism that Tuvel did not cite enough women of color might be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.<ref name=Singal2May2017/> Weinberg wrote that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out any work that was directly relevant and had been omitted.<ref name=Weinberg1May2017>{{cite web |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Philosopher's Article On Transracialism Sparks Controversy (Updated with response from author) |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/ |website=[[Daily Nous]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503040024/http://dailynous.com/2017/05/01/philosophers-article-transracialism-sparks-controversy/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |date=1 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The philosopher [[Justin E.

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published" and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined, the letter said, to name the anonymous reviewers.<ref name=Singal2May2017/>

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement on 1 May 2017 saying she had written the article "from a place of support for those with non-normative identities", because she had perceived a "transphobic logic that lay at the heart" of the attacks against Dolezal. Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the reference to Jenner's previous name,<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/> which was removed from the article at her request on 4&nbsp;May.{{sfn|Tuvel|2017}} Regarding the personal attacks, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger" and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".<ref name=Weinberg1May2017/><ref name=McKenzie1May2017>McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' response===
[[Sally Scholz]], the editor-in-chief, called the associate editor's repudiation of the article "utterly inappropriate".{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J.

Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process, which she said had allowed the paper to be published without ensuring that it was "situated within contemporary scholarly discussions".<ref name=McKenzie6May2017/>

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
[[Sally Haslanger]], later co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view.

===''Hypatia'' resignations===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.<ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/> On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Sally Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of ''Hypatia Reviews Online''. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.<ref name=Weinberg21July2017>{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia's Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archive-date=26 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=resignation>{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archive-date=24 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=interim>{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}</ref>

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".<ref name=Weinberg24July2017>{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017>{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}</ref>
