In a [[religion|religious]] context, '''sin''' is a transgression against [[divine law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sin|title=sin|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> Each [[culture]] has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin. While sins are generally actions, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed "sinful".<ref name=":0" />

== Etymology ==
The word derives from "[[Old English]] ''syn(n)'', for original *''sunjō''. The stem may be related to that of Latin '<nowiki/>''sons'', ''sont-is''' (guilty). In Old English there are examples of the original general sense, ‘offence, wrong-doing, misdeed'".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url= http://oed.com/view/Entry/180030?isAdvanced=false&result=1&rskey=9Bb3P3& |title=sin |work=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate= 16 September 2013}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Bahá'í faith }}
{{Main|Bahá'í views on sin}}
Baháʼís consider humans to be naturally good, fundamentally spiritual beings. Human beings were created because of God's immeasurable love for us. However, the Baháʼí teachings compare the human heart to a mirror, which, if turned away from the light of the sun (i.e. God), is incapable of receiving God's love. It is only by turning unto God that the spiritual advancement can be made. In this sense, "sinning" is to follow the inclinations of one's own lower nature, to turn the mirror of one's heart away from God. One of the main hindrances to spiritual development is the Baháʼí concept of the "insistent self" which is a self-serving inclination within all people. Baháʼís interpret this to be the true meaning of Satan, often referred to in the Baháʼí Writings as "the Evil One".<blockquote>Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One is lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices, and, led by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the darkness that surroundeth you. — [[Baháʼu'lláh]]</blockquote><blockquote>This lower nature in humans is symbolized as Satan — the evil ego within us, not an evil personality outside. — [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]]</blockquote>

{{Main|Buddhist views on sin}}
There are a few differing Buddhist views on sin. American [[Zen]] author [[Brad Warner]] states that in Buddhism there is no concept of sin at all.<ref>{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| author-link =Brad Warner| title =[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies & the Truth About Reality]]| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2003| pages =144| isbn = 0-86171-380-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| author-link =Brad Warner|  title =[[Sex, Sin, and Zen |Sex, Sin, and Zen: A Buddhist Exploration of Sex from Celibacy to Polyamory and Everything in Between]]| publisher =New World Library| year =2010| pages =72| isbn = 978-1-57731-910-8 }}</ref> The Buddha Dharma Education Association also expressly states "The idea of sin or original sin has no place in Buddhism."<ref>{{cite web|title=Buddhism: Major Differences|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot01.htm|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}</ref>

[[ethnology|Ethnologist]] [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] explained, "In Buddhist thinking the whole universe, men as well as gods, are subject to a reign of law. Every action, good or bad, has an inevitable and automatic effect in a long chain of causes, an effect which is independent of the will of any deity. Even though this may leave no room for the concept of 'sin' in the sense of an act of defiance against the authority of a personal god, Buddhists speak of 'sin' when referring to transgressions against the universal moral code."<ref>{{cite journal|last=von Fürer-Haimendorf|first=Christoph|year=1974|title=The Sense of Sin in Cross-Cultural Perspective|journal = Man|volume = New Series 9.4|pages=539–556}}</ref>

== Christianity ==
===Hamartiology===
{{Main|Christian views on sin}}
{{See also|Seven deadly sins}}
The doctrine of sin is central to Christianity, since its [[The gospel|basic message]] is about [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]].<ref>Rahner, p. 1588</ref> [[Christianity|Christian]] [[hamartiology]] describes sin as an act of offense against [[God in Christianity|God]] by despising his [[Trinity|persons]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity|Christian biblical law]], and by injuring others.<ref>Sabourin, p. 696</ref> In Christian views it is an [[evil]] human act, which violates the rational nature of man as well as [[Trinity|God's nature]] and his [[eternal law]]. According to the classical definition of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] sin is "a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God."<ref>''Contra Faustum Manichaeum'', 22,27; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 42,418; cf. [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Summa Theologica|STh]] I–II q71 a6.</ref><ref>Mc Guinness, p. 241</ref>

Among some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of [[Christian ethics]], and so [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] tends to be viewed in legal terms.  Other Christian scholars understand sin to be fundamentally relational—a loss of love for the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and an elevation of [[self-love]] ("concupiscence", in this sense), as was later propounded by Augustine in his debate with the [[Pelagianism|Pelagians]].<ref>''On Grace and Free Will'' (see ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', trans. P.Holmes, vol. 5; 30–31 [14–15]).</ref>  As with the legal definition of sin, this definition also affects the understanding of [[Grace in Christianity|Christian grace]] and salvation, which are thus viewed in relational terms.<ref>For a historical review of this understanding, see R.N.Frost, "Sin and Grace", in Paul L. Metzger, ''Trinitarian Soundings'', T&T Clark, 2005.</ref>

===Original sin{{Anchor|Original sin}}===
[[File:Forbidden fruit.jpg|thumb|A [[Sistine Chapel]] [[fresco]] depicts the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden|expulsion]] of [[Adam and Eve]] for [[Original sin|transgressing God's command]] not to eat [[Forbidden fruit|the fruit]] of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]].]]

This condition has been characterized in many ways, ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency, or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt, referred to as a "sin nature", to something as drastic as [[total depravity]] or automatic guilt of all humans through [[Collective accountability|collective guilt]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Brodd|first=Jeffrey|title=World Religions|publisher=Saint Mary's Press|year=2003|location=Winona, MN|isbn=978-0-88489-725-5}}</ref>

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] formulation of original sin after 412 CE was popular among [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant reformers]], such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], who equated original sin with [[concupiscence]] (or "hurtful desire"), affirming that it persisted even after [[baptism]] and completely destroyed freedom to do good. Before 412 CE, Augustine said that free will was weakened but not destroyed by original sin. But after 412 CE this changed to a loss of free will except to sin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Kenneth |title=Augustine's Conversion from Traditional Free Choice to "Non-free Free Will": A Comprehensive Methodology |date=2018 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=9783161557538 |pages=16–18, 157–187}}</ref> Modern [[Augustinian Calvinism]] holds this later view.

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islamic views on sin}}
Sin is an important concept in [[Islamic ethics]]. [[Muslim]]s see sin as anything that goes against the commands of [[God in Islam|God]] ([[Allah]]), a breach of the laws and norms laid down by religion.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies">{{cite web|title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2211|work=Sin|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[Islam]] teaches that sin is an act and not a state of being. It is believed that God weighs an individual's good deeds against his or her sins on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and punishes those individuals whose evil deeds outweigh their good deeds. These individuals are thought to be sentenced to afterlife in the fires of ''[[jahannam]]'' (Hell).

Islamic terms for sin include ''dhanb'' and ''khaṭīʾa'', which are synonymous and refer to intentional sins; ''khiṭʾ'', which means simply a sin; and ''ithm'', which is used for grave sins.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Wensinck, A.

== Judaism ==
{{Main|Jewish views on sin}}
[[Judaism]] regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil.  Sin has many classifications and degrees, but the principal classification is that of "missing the mark" (cheit in Hebrew).<ref>Silver, Jonathan, host.  [https://tikvahfund.org/library/podcast-david-bashevkin-on-sin-and-failure-in-jewish-thought/ "Podcast: David Bashevkin on Sin and Failure in Jewish Thought."] ''The Tikvah Podcast'', The Tikvah Fund, 3 Oct. 2019.</ref> Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin cannot be a sin if the one who committed it did not know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/qorbanot.html</ref>

Sins between people are considered much more serious in Judaism than sins between man and God. [[Yom Kippur]], the main day of repentance in Judaism, can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.<ref>[[Mishnah]], [[Yoma]],8:9</ref> [[Eleazar ben Azariah]] derived [this from the verse]: "From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed" ([[Book of Leviticus]], 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.<ref name="Schuster 1986">Simon and Schuster, 1986, Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism, New York: Touchstone book.</ref><ref name="thetorah.com">http://thetorah.com/historical-uniqueness-and-centrality-of-yom-kippur/</ref>

When the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer [[Korbanot]] (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of ''korbanot'' is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, ''korbanot'' only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by mistake. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, ''korbanot'' cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, ''korbanot'' have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely [[Repentance in Judaism|repents]] of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/>

Judaism teaches that all willful sin has consequences. The completely righteous suffer for their sins (by humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them) in this world and receive their reward in the world to come. The in-between (not completely righteous or completely wicked), suffer for and repent their sins after death and thereafter join the righteous. The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave ''[[Gehenna|gehinnom]]'', because they do not or cannot repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this.<ref>

== Shinto ==
The Shinto concept of sin is inexorably linked to concepts of purity and pollution. Shinto does not have a concept of original sin, instead believing that all human beings are born pure.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Shinto Concept of Sin (Tsumi) and Impurity (Kegare)｜TSURUGAOKA HACHIMANGU|url=http://www.tsurugaoka-hachimangu.jp/shinto_is/shinto_concept.html|access-date=2020-09-23|website=www.tsurugaoka-hachimangu.jp}}</ref> Sin, also called [[Tsumi]], is anything that makes people impure (i.e. anything that separates them from the ''kami'').<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=BBC - Religions - Shinto: Purity in Shinto|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/beliefs/purity.shtml|access-date=2020-09-23|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref> However, Shinto does not believe this impurity is the result of human actions, but rather the result of evil spirits or other external factors.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Sin can have a variety of consequences in Japan, including disaster and disease.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Because of this, purification rituals, or [[Harae]], are viewed as important not just to the spiritual and physical health of the individual, but to the well-being of the nation.<ref name=":1" />
