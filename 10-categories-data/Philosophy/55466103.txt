In [[folklore]], the '''witching hour''' or '''devil's hour''' is a time of night associated with [[supernatural]] events. [[Witches]], [[demons]] and [[ghosts]] are thought to appear and to be at their most powerful. [[Black magic]] is thought to be most effective at this time due to the veil between worlds being thinner. <ref name="Sedgwick">{{cite web |last1=Sedgwick |first1=Icy |title=What time is the witching hour and does it even exist |url=https://www.icysedgwick.com/witching-hour/ |website=Icy Sedgwick |accessdate=14 November 2020}}</ref> There are multiple times that can be considered the witching hour. Some claim the time is between 12 and 1 a.m., while others claim there is increased supernatural activity between sunset and sunrise. In the [[Western Christian]] tradition, the hour between 3 and 4 a.m. was considered a period of peak supernatural activity. This time is also referred to as the "Devil's hour" due to it being an inversion of the time in which Christ supposedly died.<ref name="Sedgwick" /> The phrase "witching hour" began at least as early as 1775, in the poem "Night, an Ode." by Rev. Matthew West.<ref name="West">{{cite web |last1=West|first1=Matthew |title=Poems, &c. on several occasions. By Matthew West, A.M.

[[Oxford English Dictionary|The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary]] identifies [[midnight]] as the time when witches are supposedly active.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Zealand Oxford Dictionary|ISBN=0-19-558451-1|page=1298}}</ref> However, during the time in which this term originated, most people had abnormal sleeping schedules which meant a lot of people were aware during the middle of the night. <ref name="Sedgwick" /> The association with witches could have been one way in which to shame and persecute women who were believed to go against the status quo.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosker |first1=Bianca |title=Why is Witchraft on the Rise |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/witchcraft-juliet-diaz/605518/ |website=Atlantic |accessdate=14 November 2020}}</ref> Nonetheless, there is psychological literature suggesting that [[apparitional experience]]s and sensed presences are most common between the hours of 2 and 4 a.m., corresponding with a 3 a.m. peak in the amount of [[melatonin]] in the body.<ref name=Luke>{{cite journal |last1=Luke |first1=David P. |last2=Zychowicz |first2=Karolina |date=2014 |title=Working the graveyard shift at the witching hour: Further exploration of dreams, psi and circadian rhythms |url=http://gala.gre.ac.uk/12514/1/2014_-_IJDR_-_Luke_%26_Zychowicz.pdf |journal=International Journal of Dream Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=105â€“112 |doi=10.11588/ijodr.2014.2.12000 |access-date=2017-10-06 }}</ref>
