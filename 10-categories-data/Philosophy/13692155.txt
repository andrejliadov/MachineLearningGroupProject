"Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved." (p. 666).</ref>

Historically, ''philosophy'' encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a ''[[philosopher]]''.<ref name=":0">"The English word "philosophy" is first attested to c. 1300, meaning "knowledge, body of knowledge."

== Origins and evolution ==
Initially the term referred to any body of [[knowledge]].<ref name=":0" /> In this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics. Though it has since been classified as a book of physics, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]'' (1687) uses the term ''[[natural philosophy]]'' as it was understood at the time, encompassing disciplines such as [[astronomy]], [[medicine]] and [[physics]] that later became associated with [[Science|the sciences]].{{sfn|Lindberg|2007|p=3}}

In section thirteen of his [[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|''Lives and Opinions of the Eminent Philosophers'']], the oldest surviving history of philosophy (3rd century),  

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] presents a three-part division of ancient Greek philosophical inquiry:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YASbAEhCLw0C}}|title=Kant: Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107401068|edition=2nd|quote=Ancient Greek philosophy was divided into three branches of knowledge: natural science, ethics, and logic.}}</ref>

*[[Science|Natural philosophy]] (i.e. physics, from {{Lang-el|ta physika|lit=things having to do with ''physis'' [nature]|italic=yes}}) was the study of the constitution and processes of transformation in the physical world
*[[Ethics|Moral philosophy]] (i.e. ethics, from {{Lang-el|êthika|lit=having to do with character, disposition, manners|italic=yes|label=none}}) was the study of goodness, right and wrong, justice and virtue
*[[Metaphysics|Metaphysical philosophy]] (i.e. logic, from {{Lang-el|logikós|lit=of or pertaining to reason or speech|italic=yes|label=none}}) was the study of [[existence]], causation, [[God]], [[logic]], [[Universal (metaphysics)|forms]], and other abstract objects ({{Lang-el|meta ta physika|lit=after the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''|italic=yes|label=none}})

In ''Against the Logicians'' the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient Greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by Plato, Aristotle, Xenocrates, and the Stoics.<ref>[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Against the Logicians'', Book I, Section 16</ref> The [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptic]] philosopher [[Cicero]] also followed this three-part division.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''Academica'' Book I Section 1.</ref>

This division is not obsolete, but has changed: ''natural philosophy'' has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, [[astronomy]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[cosmology]]; ''moral philosophy'' has birthed the [[Social science|social sciences]], while still including [[value theory]] (e.g. ethics, [[aesthetics]], [[political philosophy]], etc.); and ''metaphysical philosophy'' has given way to formal sciences such as logic, [[mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]], while still including epistemology, cosmology, etc.

Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today.

== Historical overview <!--'History of philosophy' redirects here--> ==
In one general sense, philosophy is associated with [[wisdom]], intellectual culture, and a search for knowledge. In this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as "how are we to live" and "what is the nature of reality." A broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as [[reality]], [[morality]], and life in all world civilizations.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|date=2011-06-09|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195328998|editor1-last=Garfield|editor1-first=Jay L|chapter=Introduction|editor2-last=Edelglass|editor2-first=William|chapter-url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195328998.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195328998}}</ref>

=== Western philosophy<!--'History of Western philosophy' and 'History of western philosophy' redirect here--> ===
{{Main|Western philosophy}}
[[File:Aristoteles_der_Stagirit.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), a major figure of ancient Greek philosophy, in the Aristotlepark, [[Stagira]]]]
[[Western philosophy]] is the philosophical tradition of the [[Western world]], dating back to [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] thinkers who were active in 6th-century [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] (BCE), such as [[Thales]] ({{Circa|624|lk=yes}} – 546 BCE) and [[Pythagoras]] ({{Circa|570|lk=no}} – 495 BCE) who practiced a 'love of wisdom' ({{Lang-la|philosophia}})<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=b_VvghYDArwC}}|title=Lectures on the History of Philosophy: Greek philosophy|last2=Brown|first2=Robert F.|date=2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-927906-7|page=33}}</ref> and were also termed 'students of nature' ({{Lang-la|physiologoi|label=none}}).

[[Western philosophy]] can be divided into three eras:

# [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient]] ([[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]])
# [[Medieval philosophy]] (referring to Christian European thought)
# [[Modern philosophy]] (beginning in the 17th century)

==== Ancient era ====
While our knowledge of the ancient era begins with [[Thales]] in the 6th century BCE, little is known about the philosophers who came before [[Socrates]] (commonly known as [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|the pre-Socratics]]). The ancient era was dominated by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical schools]]. Most notable among the schools influenced by Socrates' teachings were [[Plato]], who founded the [[Platonic Academy]], and his student [[Aristotle]],<ref name="process" /> who founded the [[Peripatetic school]]. Other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by Socrates included [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaicism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Academic Skepticism]]. Two other traditions were influenced by Socrates' contemporary, [[Democritus]]: [[Pyrrhonism]] and [[Epicureanism]]. Important topics covered by the Greeks included [[metaphysics]] (with competing theories such as [[atomism]] and [[monism]]), [[cosmology]], the nature of the well-lived life (''[[eudaimonia]]''), the [[Epistemology|possibility of knowledge]], and the nature of reason ([[logos]]). With the rise of the [[Roman empire]], Greek philosophy was increasingly discussed in [[Latin]] by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] such as [[Cicero]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (see [[Roman philosophy]]).

==== Medieval era ====
[[Medieval philosophy]] (5th–16th centuries) is the period following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and was dominated by the rise of [[Christianity]] and hence reflects [[Judeo-Christian]] theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of [[God]], the nature of [[faith]] and reason, metaphysics, the [[problem of evil]] were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Laon|Anselm]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to [[Theology]] ({{Lang-la|ancilla theologiae|label=none}}) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of [[Scholasticism]], a text critical method developed in [[medieval universities]] based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The [[Renaissance]] period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust [[Humanism]].

==== Modern era ====
[[File:Kant doerstling2.jpg|thumb|A painting of the influential modern philosopher Immanuel Kant (in the blue coat) with his friends. Other figures include [[Christian Jakob Kraus]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]], [[Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Elder|Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel]] and [[Karl Gottfried Hagen]]]]
[[Early modern philosophy]] in the Western world begins with thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).<ref name="diane">{{cite book|author=Collinson, Diane|title=Fifty Major Philosophers, A Reference Guide|page=125}}</ref> Following the rise of natural science, [[modern philosophy]] was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].

[[19th-century philosophy]] (sometimes called [[late modern philosophy]]) was influenced by the wider 18th-century movement termed "[[the Enlightenment]]", and includes figures such as [[Hegel]] a key figure in [[German idealism]], [[Kierkegaard]] who developed the foundations for [[existentialism]], [[Nietzsche]] a famed anti-Christian, [[John Stuart Mill]] who promoted [[utilitarianism]], [[Karl Marx]] who developed the foundations for [[communism]] and the American [[William James]]. The 20th century saw the split between [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], as well as philosophical trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[logical positivism]], [[pragmatism]] and the [[linguistic turn]] (see [[Contemporary philosophy]]).

=== Middle Eastern philosophy ===

==== Pre-Islamic philosophy ====
{{See also|Middle Eastern philosophy|}}The regions of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Iran]] and [[Arabia]] are home to the earliest known philosophical wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by [[Islamic culture]].

Early [[Wisdom literature|Wisdom Literature]] from the Fertile Crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action, practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs. In [[Ancient Egypt]], these texts were known as ''[[sebayt]]'' ('teachings') and they are central to our understandings of [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy]]. [[Babylonian astronomy]] also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks.

[[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]] are religio-philosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe, which both share certain early Judaic texts (mainly the [[Tanakh]]) and monotheistic beliefs. Jewish thinkers such as the [[Geonim]] of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]] and [[Maimonides]] engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy. Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] who ushered in the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish Enlightenment), [[Jewish existentialism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].

The various traditions of [[Gnosticism]], which were influenced by both Greek and Abrahamic currents, originated around the first century and emphasized spiritual knowledge (''[[gnosis]]''). 

Pre-Islamic [[Iranian philosophy]] begins with the work of [[Zoroaster]], one of the first promoters of [[monotheism]] and of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] between good and evil. This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mazdakism]], and [[Zurvanism]].

==== Islamic philosophy ====
{{See also|Islamic philosophy|}}[[File:Avicenna_Portrait_on_Silver_Vase_-_Museum_at_BuAli_Sina_(Avicenna)_Mausoleum_-_Hamadan_-_Western_Iran_(7423560860).jpg|right|thumb|An Iranian portrait of [[Avicenna]] on a Silver Vase. He was one of the most influential philosophers of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].]]
[[Islamic philosophy]] is the philosophical work originating in the [[Islamic culture|Islamic tradition]] and is mostly done in [[Arabic]]. It draws from the religion of Islam as well as from Greco-Roman philosophy. After the [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Translation Movement|translation movement]] (mid-eighth to the late tenth century) resulted in the works of Greek philosophy becoming available in Arabic.<ref>Gutas, Dimitri (1998). Greek Thought, Arabic Culture: The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early Abbasid Society (2nd-4th/8th-10th centuries). Routledge. pp. 1–26.</ref> 

[[Early Islamic philosophy]] developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. This intellectual work inagurated what is known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The two main currents of early Islamic thought are [[Kalam]], which focuses on [[Islamic theology]], and [[Falsafa]], which was based on [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The work of Aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as [[Al-Kindi]] (9th century), [[Avicenna]] (980 – June 1037) and [[Averroes]] (12th century). Others such as [[Al-Ghazali]] were highly critical of the methods of the Islamic Aristotelians and saw their metaphysical ideas as heretical. Islamic thinkers like [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Al-Biruni]] also developed a [[scientific method]], experimental medicine, a theory of optics and a legal philosophy. [[Ibn Khaldun]] was an influential thinker in [[philosophy of history]].

Islamic thought also deeply influenced European intellectual developments, especially through the commentaries of Averroes on Aristotle. The [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|Mongol invasions]] and the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad]] in 1258 is often seen as marking the end of the Golden Age.<ref>Cooper, William W.; Yue, Piyu (2008). ''Challenges of the Muslim world: present, future and past.'' Emerald Group Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-444-53243-5}}. Retrieved 2014-04-11.</ref> Several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age however, and include currents such as [[Illuminationist philosophy]], [[Sufi philosophy]], and [[Transcendent theosophy]]. 

The 19th- and 20th-century [[Arab world]] saw the ''[[Nahda]]'' movement (literally meaning 'The Awakening'; also known as the 'Arab Renaissance'), which had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Islamic philosophy]].

Some of the earliest surviving Indian philosophical texts are the [[Upanishads]] of the [[Vedic period#Later Vedic period (1000–500 BCE)|later Vedic period]] (1000–500 BCE), which are considered to preserve the ideas of [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]]. Indian philosophy is commonly grouped based on their relationship to the Vedas and the ideas contained in them. [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] originated at the end of the [[Vedic period]], while the various traditions grouped under [[Hinduism]] mostly emerged after the Vedic period as independent traditions. Hindus generally classify Indian philosophical traditions as either orthodox ([[Āstika and nāstika|''āstika'']]) or heterodox (''nāstika'') depending on whether they accept the authority of the [[Vedas]] and the theories of ''[[brahman]]'' and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|''ātman'']] found therein.<ref>[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]].

The schools which align themselves with the thought of the Upanishads, the so called "orthodox" or "[[Hinduism|Hindu]]" traditions, are often classified into six ''[[Hindu philosophy|darśanas]]'' or philosophies:[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Nyaya|Nyāya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimāmsā]] and [[Vedanta|Vedānta]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kesarcodi-Watson|first=Ian|year=1978|title=Hindu Metaphysics and Its Philosophies: Śruti and Darsána|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|volume=18|issue=4|pages=413–432|doi=10.5840/ipq197818440}}</ref>

The doctrines of the Vedas and Upanishads were interpreted differently by these six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], with varying degrees of overlap. They represent a "collection of philosophical views that share a textual connection," according to Chadha (2015).<ref>Chadha, M. 2015. The ''Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion'', edited by [[Graham Oppy|G. Oppy]]. London: [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|978-1844658312}}. pp. 127–28.</ref> They also reflect a tolerance for a diversity of philosophical interpretations within Hinduism while sharing the same foundation.<ref name="Sharma1990p1" group="lower-roman">{{cite book|author=Sharma|first=Arvind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKewCwAAQBAJ|title=A Hindu Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1990|isbn=978-1-349-20797-8}} 

"The attitude towards the existence of God varies within the Hindu religious tradition. This may not be entirely unexpected given the tolerance for doctrinal diversity for which the tradition is known. Thus of the six orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy, only three address the question in some detail. These are the schools of thought known as Nyaya, Yoga and the theistic forms of Vedanta." (pp. 1–2).</ref>

Hindu philosophers of the six orthodox schools developed systems of epistemology (''[[pramana]]'') and investigated topics such as metaphysics, ethics, psychology (''[[guṇa]]''), [[hermeneutics]], and [[soteriology]] within the framework of the Vedic knowledge, while presenting a diverse collection of interpretations.<ref name="frazierintrop2">{{cite book|last1=Frazier|first1=Jessica|url=https://archive.org/details/continuumcompani00fraz|title=The Continuum companion to Hindu studies|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-9966-0|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/continuumcompani00fraz/page/n15 1]–15|url-access=limited}}</ref><ref>Olson, Carl. 2007.

There are also other schools of thought which are often seen as "Hindu", though not necessarily orthodox (since they may accept different scriptures as normative, such as the [[Tantras (Hinduism)|Shaiva Agamas and Tantras]]), these include different schools of [[Shaivism|Shavism]] such as [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata]], [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], [[Kashmir Shaivism|non-dual tantric Shavism]] (i.e. Trika, Kaula, etc).<ref>Cowell and Gough (1882, Translators), ''The Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha or Review of the Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy by Madhva Acharya'', Trubner's Oriental Series</ref>

The "Hindu" and "Orthodox" traditions are often contrasted with the "unorthodox" traditions (''nāstika,'' literally "those who reject"), though this is a label that is not used by the "unorthodox" schools themselves. These traditions reject the Vedas as authoritative and often reject major concepts and ideas that are widely accepted by the orthodox schools (such as ''Ātman'', ''Brahman'', and [[Ishvara|''Īśvara'']]).<ref name="bilimoriaastika">Bilimoria, P. 2000.

[[Jain philosophy]] is one of the only two surviving "unorthodox" traditions (along with Buddhism). It generally accepts the concept of a permanent soul (''[[jiva]]'') as one of the five ''[[Āstika and nāstika|astikayas]]'' (eternal, infinite categories that make up the substance of existence). The other four being [[Dharma|''dhárma'']], ''[[adharma]]'', ''[[Akasha|ākāśa]]'' ('space'), and ''[[pudgala]]'' ('matter').

==== Buddhist philosophy ====
{{Main|Buddhist philosophy}}
[[File:Monks_debating_at_Sera_monastery,_2013.webm|thumb|Monks debating at [[Sera monastery]], Tibet, 2013. According to Jan Westerhoff, "public debates constituted the most important and most visible forms of philosophical exchange" in ancient Indian intellectual life.<ref>Westerhoff, Jan, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 13.</ref>]]

Buddhist philosophy begins with the thought of [[Gautama Buddha]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] between 6th and 4th century BCE) and is preserved in the [[Early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]]. It originated in the Indian region of [[Magadha]] and later spread to the rest of the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. In these regions, Buddhist thought developed into different philosophical traditions which used various languages (like [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Classical Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Pali]]). As such, Buddhist philosophy is a [[Transculturalism|trans-cultural]] and international phenomenon. 

The dominant Buddhist philosophical traditions in East Asian nations are mainly based on Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. The philosophy of the [[Theravada]] school is dominant in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries like [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]].

Because [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|ignorance]] to the true nature of things is considered one of the roots of suffering (''[[dukkha]]''), Buddhist philosophy is concerned with epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and psychology. Buddhist philosophical texts must also be understood within the context of [[Buddhist meditation|meditative practices]] which are supposed to bring about certain cognitive shifts.<ref name=":17">[[Jan Westerhoff|Westerhoff, Jan]]. 2018. ''The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]].</ref>{{Rp|8}} Key innovative concepts include the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] as an analysis of ''dukkha'', [[Impermanence|''anicca'']] (impermanence), and ''[[anatta]]'' (non-self).<ref group="lower-roman">{{cite book|author=Gombrich, Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|title=Theravada Buddhism|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8}} "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."

After the death of the Buddha, various groups began to systematize his main teachings, eventually developing comprehensive philosophical systems termed ''[[Abhidharma]]''.<ref name=":17" />{{Rp|37}} Following the Abhidharma schools, Indian [[Mahayana]] philosophers such as [[Nagarjuna]] and [[Vasubandhu]] developed the theories of ''[[śūnyatā]]'' ('emptiness of all phenomena') and [[Yogachara#Vijñapti-mātra|''vijñapti-matra'']] ('appearance only'), a form of phenomenology or [[transcendental idealism]]. The [[Dignāga]] school of ''[[Pramana|pramāṇa]]'' ('means of knowledge') promoted a sophisticated form of [[Buddhist logico-epistemology|Buddhist epistemology]].

There were numerous schools, sub-schools, and traditions of Buddhist philosophy in ancient and medieval India. According to Oxford professor of Buddhist philosophy [[Jan Westerhoff]], the major Indian schools from 300 BCE to 1000 CE were:<ref name=":17" />{{Rp|xxiv}} the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] tradition (now extinct), the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthavira]] schools (such as [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]], [[Vibhajyavāda]] and [[Pudgalavada|Pudgalavāda]]) and the [[Mahayana]] schools. Many of these traditions were also studied in other regions, like Central Asia and China, having been brought there by Buddhist missionaries.  

After the disappearance of Buddhism from India, some of these philosophical traditions continued to develop in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]], [[East Asian Buddhist]] and [[Theravada Buddhist]] traditions.<ref>Dreyfus, Georges B.

East Asian philosophical thought began in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] begins during the [[Western Zhou]] Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" flourished (6th century to 221 BCE).<ref>Garfield, Jay L., and William Edelglass, eds. 2011. "Chinese Philosophy." ''The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780195328998}}.</ref><ref name="pe">{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China such as [[Confucianism]] (also known as Ruism), [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Daoism|Taoism]] as well as numerous other less influential schools like [[Mohism]] and [[School of Naturalists|Naturalism]]. These philosophical traditions developed metaphysical, political and ethical theories such [[Tao]], [[Yin and yang]], [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] and [[Li (Confucianism)|Li]]. 
These schools of thought further developed during the [[Han dynasty|Han]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907 CE) eras, forming new philosophical movements like ''[[Xuanxue]]'' (also called ''Neo-Taoism''), and [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Neo-Confucianism was a syncretic philosophy, which incorporated the ideas of different Chinese philosophical traditions, including Buddhism and Taoism. Neo-Confucianism came to dominate the education system during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297), and its ideas served as the philosophical basis of the [[imperial exams]] for the [[Scholar-officials|scholar official class]]. Some of the most important Neo-Confucian thinkers are the Tang scholars [[Han Yu]] and [[Li Ao (philosopher)|Li Ao]] as well as the Song thinkers [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) and [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). Zhu Xi compiled the Confucian canon, which consists of the [[Four Books]] (the ''[[Great Learning]]'', the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', the ''[[Analects]]'' of Confucius, and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]''). The Ming scholar [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) is a later but important philosopher of this tradition as well. 

Buddhism began arriving in China during the Han Dynasty, through a [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|gradual Silk road transmission]] and through native influences developed distinct Chinese forms (such as Chan/[[Zen]]) which spread throughout the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. 

Chinese culture was highly influential on the traditions of other East Asian states and its philosophy directly influenced [[Korean philosophy]], [[Vietnamese philosophy]] and [[Japanese philosophy]]. During later Chinese dynasties like the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644) as well as in the Korean [[Joseon dynasty]] (1392–1897) a resurgent [[Neo-Confucianism]] led by thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] (1472–1529) became the dominant school of thought, and was promoted by the imperial state. In Japan, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1603–1867) was also strongly influenced by Confucian philosophy.<ref>Perez, Louis G. (1998). The History of Japan, pp. 57–59. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. {{ISBN|978-0-313-30296-1}}. </ref> Confucianism continues to influence the ideas and worldview of the nations of the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese cultural sphere]] today. 

In the Modern era, Chinese thinkers incorporated ideas from Western philosophy. [[Chinese Marxist philosophy]] developed under the influence of [[Mao Zedong]], while a Chinese pragmatism developed under [[Hu Shih]]. The old traditional philosophies also began to reassert themselves in the 20th century. For example, [[New Confucianism]], led by figures such as [[Xiong Shili]], has become quite influential. Likewise, [[Humanistic Buddhism]] is a recent modernist Buddhist movement.

Modern Japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong Western influences such as the study of Western Sciences ([[Rangaku]]) and the modernist [[Meirokusha]] intellectual society which drew from European enlightenment thought and promoted liberal reforms as well as Western philosophies like Liberalism and Utilitarianism. Another trend in modern Japanese philosophy was the "National Studies" ([[Kokugaku]]) tradition. This intellectual trend sought to study and promote ancient Japanese thought and culture. Kokugaku thinkers such as [[Motoori Norinaga]] sought to return to a pure Japanese tradition which they called [[Shinto]] that they saw as untainted by foreign elements. 

During the 20th century, the [[Kyoto School]], an influential and unique Japanese philosophical school developed from Western [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and Medieval Japanese Buddhist philosophy such as that of [[Dogen]].

=== African philosophy ===

[[File:Zera_Yacob.jpg|thumb|Painting of Zera Yacob from [[Claude Sumner]]'s ''Classical Ethiopian Philosophy.'']]
African philosophy is philosophy produced by [[African people]], philosophy that presents African worldviews, ideas and themes, or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods. Modern African thought has been occupied with [[Ethnophilosophy]], with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be [[African people|African]].<ref>Janz, Bruce B. 2009.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0739136682 Philosophy in an African Place]''. Plymouth, UK: [[Lexington Books]]. pp. 74–79.</ref>

During the 17th century, [[Ethiopian philosophy]] developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]]. Another early African philosopher was [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]] (c. 1703–1759) who became a respected philosopher in Germany. Distinct African philosophical ideas include [[Ujamaa]], the [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu]] idea of [[Bantu Philosophy|'Force']], [[Négritude]], [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]. Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of [[Africana philosophy]], the philosophical literature of the [[African diaspora]] which includes currents such as [[black existentialism]] by [[African-Americans]]. Some modern African thinkers have been influenced by [[Marxism]], [[African-American literature]], [[Critical theory]], [[Critical race theory]], [[Postcolonialism]] and [[African feminism|Feminism]].

[[File:Tlamatini_observe_stars_-_Codex_Mendoza.jpg|thumb|A [[Tlamatini]] (Aztec philosopher) observing the stars, from the [[Codex Mendoza]].]]
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous-American]] philosophical thought consists of a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among different American cultures. Among some of [[Native Americans in the United States|U.S. Native American]] communities, there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the '[[Great Spirit]]'  ([[Siouan languages|Siouan]]: ''[[Wakan Tanka|wakȟáŋ tȟáŋka]]''; [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]: [[Gitche Manitou|''gitche manitou'']]). Another widely shared concept was that of ''[[orenda]]'' ('spiritual power'). According to Whiteley (1998), for the Native Americans, "mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason."<ref name="rep.routledge.com">Whiteley, Peter M. 1998.

In [[Mesoamerica]], [[Aztec philosophy]] was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called ''[[Tlamatini]]'' ('those who know something')<ref>{{cite book|last1=Portilla|first1=Miguel León|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OI9J7R-R1awC&q=120|title=Use of "Tlamatini" in ''Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind – Miguel León Portilla''|year=1990|isbn=9780806122953|accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and its ideas are preserved in various [[Aztec codices]]. The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called ''[[Ōmeteōtl]]'' ('Dual Cosmic Energy') which sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing, "slippery" world.

The theory of ''[[Teotl]]'' can be seen as a form of [[Pantheism]].<ref name="iep.utm.edu">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Aztec Philosophy|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/}}</ref> Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics, epistemology, values, and aesthetics. Aztec ethics was focused on seeking ''tlamatiliztli'' ('knowledge', 'wisdom') which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the [[Nahuas|Nahua]] proverb "the middle good is necessary."<ref name="iep.utm.edu" />

The [[Inca civilization]] also had an elite class of philosopher-scholars termed the ''Amawtakuna'' who were important in the [[Inca education]] system as teachers of religion, tradition, history and ethics. Key concepts of Andean thought are [[Yanantin]] and [[Yanantin#Masintin|Masintin]] which involve a theory of “complementary opposites” that sees polarities (such as male/female, dark/light) as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole.<ref>Webb, Hillary S. 2012.

== Branches of philosophy<span id="Branches"></span> ==
Philosophical questions can be grouped into various branches. These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions. 

These divisions are neither exhaustive, nor mutually exclusive. (A philosopher might specialize in [[Kant]]ian epistemology, or [[Plato]]nic aesthetics, or modern political philosophy). Furthermore, these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science, religion or mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/religion-science/|title=Religion and Science|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|date=2014|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition= Spring 2014}}</ref>

[[File:BeijingConfuciusTemple9.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The [[Beijing]] [[Guozijian (Beijing)|imperial college]] was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties.]]
Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, studies what constitutes good and bad [[Action (philosophy)|conduct]], right and [[wrong]] [[values (philosophy)|values]], and [[good and evil]]. Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of [[morality]]. It also includes investigating whether or not there ''is'' a best way to live or a universal moral standard, and if so, how we come to learn about it. The main branches of ethics are [[normative ethics]], [[meta-ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].<ref name="IEP Ethics">{{cite web|title=Ethics|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/|accessdate=6 July 2020|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

The three main views in ethics about what constitute moral actions are:<ref name="IEP Ethics" />
*[[Consequentialism]], which judges actions based on their consequences. One such view is [[utilitarianism]], which judges actions based on the net happiness (or pleasure) and/or lack of suffering (or pain) that they produce.
*[[Deontology]], which judges actions based on whether or not they are in accordance with one's moral duty. In the standard form defended by [[Immanuel Kant]], deontology is concerned with whether or not a choice respects the moral agency of other people, regardless of its consequences.
*[[Virtue ethics]], which judges actions based on the moral character of the agent who performs them and whether they conform to what an ideally virtuous agent would do.

It arose early in [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]] and became formalized with [[Pyrrho]], the founder of the [[Pyrrhonism|earliest Western school of philosophical skepticism]]. It features prominently in the works of modern philosophers [[René Descartes]] and [[David Hume]], and has remained a central topic in contemporary epistemological debates.<ref name="SEP Epistemology"/>

One of the most notable epistemological debates is between [[empiricism]] and [[rationalism]]. Empiricism places emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge. Empiricism is associated with [[a posteriori knowledge]], which is obtained through experience (such as [[Philosophy of science|scientific knowledge]]). Rationalism places emphasis on reason as a source of knowledge. Rationalism is associated with [[a priori knowledge]], which is independent of experience (such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]]).

One central debate in contemporary epistemology is about the conditions required for a [[belief]] to constitute knowledge, which might include [[truth]] and [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]]. This debate was largely the result of attempts to solve the [[Gettier problem]].<ref name="SEP Epistemology"/> Another common subject of contemporary debates is the [[Regress argument|regress problem]], which occurs when trying to offer proof or justification for any belief, statement, or proposition. The problem is that whatever the source of justification may be, that source must either be without justification (in which case it must be treated as an arbitrary [[Foundationalism|foundation]] for belief), or it must have some further justification (in which case justification must either be the result of [[circular reasoning]], as in [[coherentism]], or the result of an [[infinite regress]], as in [[infinitism]]).<ref name="SEP Epistemology"/>

=== Metaphysics ===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}
[[File:Aristotle, Metaphysics, Incunabulum.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|The beginning of [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'']] in an incunabulum decorated with hand-painted miniatures. ]]
Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of [[reality]], such as [[existence]], [[time]], [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], wholes and their parts, events, processes and [[Causality|causation]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]]. Metaphysics includes [[cosmology]], the study of the [[world]] in its entirety and [[ontology]], the study of [[being]].

A major point of debate is between [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and [[idealism]], which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial. Metaphysics deals with the topic of [[Personal identity|identity]]. [[Essence]] is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] is a property that the object has, without which the object can still retain its identity. [[Particular]]s are objects that are said to exist in space and time, as opposed to [[abstract object]]s, such as numbers, and [[universals]], which are properties held by multiple particulars, such as redness or a gender. The type of existence, if any, of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate.

=== Logic ===
{{Main|Logic}}
[[Logic]] is the study of reasoning and argument.

[[Deductive reasoning]] is when, given certain premises, conclusions are [[Logical consequence|unavoidably implied]]. [[Rules of inference]] are used to infer conclusions such as, [[modus ponens]], where given “A” and “If A then B”, then “B” must be concluded.

Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carnap|first=Rudolf|date=1953|title=Inductive Logic and Science|jstor=20023651|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|volume=80|issue=3|pages=189–197|doi=10.2307/20023651}}</ref> social sciences and humanities disciplines, logic became a [[formal science]]. Sub-fields include [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], [[Modal logic]], [[computational logic]] and [[non-classical logic]]s. A major question in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered, called mathematical realism, or invented, called mathematical antirealism.

=== Other subfields ===

====Mind and language====
{{Main|Philosophy of language|philosophy of mind}}
[[Philosophy of language]] explores the nature, origins, and use of language. [[Philosophy of mind]] explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, as typified by disputes between [[materialism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. In recent years, this branch has become related to [[cognitive science]].

==== Philosophy of science ====
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
The [[philosophy of science]] explores the foundations, methods, history, implications and purpose of science. Many of its subdivisions correspond to specific branches of science. For example, [[philosophy of biology]] deals specifically with the metaphysical, epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences.

==== Political philosophy ====
{{Main|Political philosophy}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]], best known for his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', which expounded an influential formulation of [[social contract]] theory.]]

Political philosophy is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} It includes questions about justice, law, property and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects, as both discuss the question of how people should live together.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

====Philosophy of religion====
{{Main|Philosophy of religion}}

Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve [[religion]] and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective (as opposed to [[theology]] which begins from religious convictions).<ref>[[Andrew Louth|Louth, Andrew]], and [[Helmut Thielicke]]. 2014 [1999]. "[https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology/Relationship-to-philosophy Relationship to Philosophy | Theology]." ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]].''</ref> Traditionally, religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper, the idea of a separate field only arose in the 19th century.<ref group="lower-roman">Wainwright, William J. 2005. "Introduction." Pp. 3–11 in ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=GbcuCf9TlDgC The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Religion]'', edited by W. J. Wainwright. New York: Oxford University Press.

"The expression “philosophy of religion” did not come into general use until the nineteenth century, when it was employed to refer to the articulation and criticism of humanity's religious consciousness and its cultural expressions in thought, language, feeling, and practice." ({{Google books|id=GbcuCf9TlDgC|page=3|title=Oxford Handbook}}).</ref>

Issues include the [[existence of God]], the relationship between reason and [[faith]], questions of [[religious epistemology]], the [[relationship between religion and science]], how to interpret [[religious experiences]], questions about the possibility of an [[afterlife]], the [[problem of religious language]] and the existence of [[souls]] and responses to [[religious pluralism]] and diversity.

====Metaphilosophy====
[[Metaphilosophy]] explores the aims of philosophy, its boundaries and its methods.

Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.}} in {{harvnb|Honderich|1995}}.</ref>
