An '''abstract structure''' is a [[formal object]] that is defined by a set of laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.  Abstract structures are studied not only in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] but in the fields that apply them, as [[computer science]], and in the studies that reflect on them, such as [[philosophy]] (especially the [[philosophy of mathematics]]).  Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group: see discussion there, at [[algebraic structure]] and also structure).

An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects{{snd}} this is called an implementation or [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a [[concept]] or an [[idea]]. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of [[democracy]], but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess.   

==Examples==   
* A [[sorting algorithm]] is an abstract structure, but a [[recipe]] is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
* A simple [[melody]] is an abstract structure, but an [[orchestration]] is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
* [[Euclidean geometry]] is an abstract structure, but the theory of [[continental drift]] is not, because it depends on the geology of the [[Earth]].
* A [[formal language]] is an abstract structure, but a [[natural language]] is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.
