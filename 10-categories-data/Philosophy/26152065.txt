== Origin of Religious Values ==
Religious values are usually based on values reflected within religious texts or by the influence of the lives of religious persons.<ref name=":0" />

Known as the ‘''Indigenous Religious Values Hypothesis''’, the origin of religious values can be seen as the product of the values held by the society in which the religion originated from.<ref name=":0" /> The beliefs of an individual are often centred around a religion, so the religion can be the origin of that individual’s values.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Where Values Come From|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/where-value-come-from_b_10934032|last1=Fowler|first1=Susan|last2=ContributorAuthor|date=2016-07-12|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23|last3=Partner|first3=Ken Blanchard Co Sr Consulting}}</ref> When religion is defined [[Heuristic|heuristically]], it can be used by individuals, communities or societies to answer their existential questions with the beliefs that the religion teaches.<ref name=Neville2018>{{cite journal |last1=Neville |first1=Robert |title=Philosophy of religion and the big questions |journal=Palgrave Communications |date=23 October 2018 |volume=4 |issue=1 |doi=10.1057/s41599-018-0182-9 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Values develop from the answers religions give to those existential questions.<ref name=Neville2018/>

== Significance of Religious Values  ==
Every individual does not consider religion to affect the actions and thoughts of a person.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelsay |first1=John |title=THE PRESENT STATE OF THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELIGIOUS ETHICS: An Update |journal=Journal of Religious Ethics |date=December 2012 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=583–602 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2012.00539.x }}</ref> Though in some communities [[Secularization|secularisation]] is considered dominant, it does not mean that religion is insignificant in those communities.<ref name=":1" />

=== Money ===
Monetary Intelligence is greater among individuals who have a lower interest in making money but are more religious, along with those who wish to make ethical decisions.<ref name=Tang2014/> In a study by Thomas Tang on monetary intelligence found that making ethical decisions in the study was related to recalling the [[Ten Commandments]], which are a Christian set of ethical teachings from which Christian values are developed.<ref name=Tang2014/> These developed values are uniform across many religions, though not all of them from the Ten Commandments.<ref name=Tang2014/> 

=== Environment ===
The Roman Catholic leader, Pope Francis wrote an [[encyclical]] called ‘''[[Laudato si'|Laudato Sí]]''’. It focused on the environment and it was thought that it would change the attitudes of Roman Catholics.<ref name="Ives & Kidwell 2019"/> A study by Associated Press-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research and [[Yale University]] researchers, found that 40% of American Catholics were only aware of the encyclical and the encyclical did not produce much of a difference in their reaction to [[Global warming|climate change]].<ref name="Ives & Kidwell 2019"/>

=== Abortion ===
A study done by Harris and Mills found that those who associate more with values of [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]] are more likely to agree to [[abortion]] than those who associate with values which reflect responsibility for others.<ref name="Harris & Mills 1985"/> Persons who associate with values of self-determination are not as religious as those who identify with values of responsibility for others.<ref name="Harris & Mills 1985"/> 

Joseph Tamney and his colleagues conducted a study to create a model representing the reasons why or why not individuals support legalised abortion in the American population.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last1=Tamney|first1=Joseph B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Burton|first3=Ronald|date=March 1992|title=The Abortion Controversy: Conflicting Beliefs and Values in American Society|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=31|issue=1|pages=32|doi=10.2307/1386830|jstor=1386830}}</ref> They mention that [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] possess values which limits an individual’s freedom.<ref name=":9" /> Christianity values the preservation of natural processes and human life.<ref name=":9" /> This is why adherents of Christianity oppose abortion.<ref name=":9" />

=== Homosexuality ===
A study investigated the role of religion in how attitudes about homosexuality is shaped in 33 countries.<ref name=":6" /> Some countries have liberal policies while others punish homosexuality.<ref name=":6" /> They found that nations who value self-expression are more accepting of homosexuality than nations who are focused on survival.<ref name=":6" /> Nations which survival values are not tolerant of ideas that are not traditional.<ref name=":6" /> Being self-expressive allow more opportunity for personal religious beliefs to be displayed.<ref name=":6" /> [[Muslim nations]] have harsher punishments for those found guilty of homosexuality.<ref name=":6" /> Their attitudes are no different to countries that are [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] or Orthodox whose penalties are not as harsh.<ref name=":6" /> Just living in Muslim countries encourages inhabitants, including those who do not adhere to the religion, to have these attitudes about homosexuality than living in a [[Catholic Church by country|Catholic country]].<ref name=":6" /> 

=== Divorce ===
Religious values are against [[divorce]] unless during a situation of abuse or [[adultery]].<ref name="Stokes & Ellison 2010"/> Studies show that this is due to the fact that religions benefit from [[marriage]].<ref name="Stokes & Ellison 2010"/> The value of family is evident in many religions, especially Christianity.<ref name="Stokes & Ellison 2010"/> Christian teachings, which mainly originate in 
the [[Bible]], consider divorce to be a sin.<ref name="Stokes & Ellison 2010"/> This is why marriage is considered to be sacred and in need of preservation.<ref name="Stokes & Ellison 2010"/> 

Religion is considered to promote sustaining marriage and traditional sexual norms.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Tuttle |first1=Joshua D. |last2=Davis |first2=Shannon N. |title=Religion, Infidelity, and Divorce: Reexamining the Effect of Religious Behavior on Divorce Among Long-Married Couples |journal=Journal of Divorce & Remarriage |date=10 September 2015 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=475–489 |doi=10.1080/10502556.2015.1058660 }}</ref> Being religious indicates that marriages are more likely to be stable and be happy.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> Religious couples are not likely to cheat on their spouses than non-religious, married individuals.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> Married couples who are religious are less likely to separate or divorce.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> A study held by Joshua Tuttle and Shannon Davis found that religion decreases the occurrence of infidelity in married couples.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> They claimed that this was because religions promote traditional sexual and marital norms and discourage extramarital sexual activity.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> They also found that being religious did not stop marital infidelity from occurring, but it also did not change the chance of divorce.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/> Marital infidelity also does not appear to have an effect of the chance of divorce in long-married couples.<ref name="Tuttle & Davis 2015"/>

=== Consumer Behaviour ===
Religion influences consumer's purchase.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Some religions do not allow the consumption of certain foods such as Islam, which [[Halal|does not allow pork]] and Hinduism [[Hinduism and beef|which does not allow beef]].<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Those who are adherents of Islam may shop without much thought and research of the product they purchase.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Muslims are also more likely to try new brands and new stores as their religious philosophy is that the outcome of their actions are God’s will.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Hindus are more likely to be rational with their purchases, which follows their religious philosophy.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Adherents of Catholicism are more likely to purchase popular products and from well-known brands.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Catholics are also likely to research their products and actively search for their desired product.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> Nittin Essoo and Sally Dibb found in their study that religious consumers were more practical in their shopping than devout shoppers, focusing more on the deals on the price and the credit which is available.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> They also found that adherents of Catholicism had a more demanding shopping behaviour compared to the shopping behaviour of Hindus and Muslims shoppers.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> When analysing Hindu behaviours when shopping, Essoo and Dibb described it as [[fatalism]] which sided with the religion’s beliefs of self-control, calmness, detachment and compassion, which the researchers claimed explained their passive shopping behaviour.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> The studies result suggested that Hindu consumers were less demanding, less thoughtful of their purchases, they were less traditional, less practical with their purchase and their shopping behaviour was also less innovative compared to Muslim and Catholic shoppers.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/> This meant they were less likely to put effort into purchasing and were more accepting of poor service and high prices.<ref name="Essoo & Dibb 2004"/>

=== Gender Discrimination ===
In [[Australia]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984|Sex Discrimination Act]] does not allow gender discrimination in any organisation except in religious grounds.<ref name=Alba2019>{{cite news |last1=Alba |first1=Beatrice |title=If we reject gender discrimination in every other arena, why do we accept it in religion? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/if-we-reject-gender-discrimination-in-every-other-arena-why-do-we-accept-it-in-religion |work=The Guardian |date=5 March 2019 }}</ref> Due to this, religions are allowed to not allow women to perform certain duties or actions, such as the Catholic Church's refusal to allow women to be ordained as clergy.<ref name=Alba2019/> Woman are not allowed to sit at the front of religious places of worship in some religions.<ref name=Alba2019/> Some religions do not allow the entry of women into places of religious worship.<ref name=Alba2019/> 

== The Study of Religious Values ==
William Schweiker points out that religion, unlike philosophy, is influenced by the lives of persons significant to a religion, places which are considered important and principles which are unique to a religion, differing one religion from the other.<ref name=":12">{{Citation|chapter=The Blackwell Companion to Religious Ethics|date=2004|pages=112–119|editor-last=Schweiker|editor-first=William|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|doi=10.1111/b.9780631216346.2004.00015.x|isbn=978-0-631-21634-6}}</ref> Religious values can be studied with different approaches.<ref name=":12" /> Schweiker mentions five of these listed below: 

*[[Formalism (literature)|Formalist approach]]
** When a group of values, practices and principles are considered to be part of a ‘[[Religion]]’, focusing on the moral implications on an individual’s life through this manifestation of qualities is called a formalist approach.<ref name=":12" />
*[[Sociolinguistics|Sociolinguistic approach]]
** Studying the ways in which communities live.<ref name=":12" />
*[[Ethical naturalism]]
** Where propositions of ethics by the world is examined to define general ethical concepts.<ref name=":12" />
*[[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutical]]
** Looks at the perspective of traditions on any given situation.<ref name=":12" />
* Multidimensional
** Is similar to a formalist approach, only differing in that it is more perceiving of how knowledge and disciplines were made among the specific labels given by the formalist aspect of this approach.<ref name=":12" />

== The Practice of Religious Values in Society ==

=== Law in Countries ===
Saudi Arabia and [[Application of Islamic law by country|other countries]] enforces Islamic law.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|title=Local laws and customs - Saudi Arabia travel advice|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/local-laws-and-customs|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> The public practice of religions other than Islam is illegal, however private practice and religious texts only for personal use are permitted.<ref name=":13" /> 

=== Pledging at Court ===
In [[Law of Australia|Australia]], witnesses and jurors who appear at court are asked to make either an oath or affirmation upon any religious text if they wish and by any god recognised by their religion, if they do identify with one.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|title=Oaths and affirmations|url=https://www.courts.vic.gov.au/court-system/appearing-court/oaths-and-affirmations|last=leesa|date=2014-07-24|website=Court Services Victoria|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> Court Services Victoria<ref name=":14" /> detailed the pledge on their website:<blockquote>“I swear (or the person taking the oath may promise) by Almighty God (or the person may name a god recognised by his or her religion) that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” (para. 3).<ref name=":14" /></blockquote>

=== Clothing ===
Female adherents of Islam are advised to wear the [[hijab]] in public (in-front of anyone they could marry), which is a veil covering their hair.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Hijab|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> It is [[Hijab by country|compulsory in countries]] such as Saudi Arabia and Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MAP: Where Islamic veils are banned - and where they are mandatory|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/07/01/map-where-islamic-veils-are-banned-and-where-they-are-mandatory/|last=Sharma|first=Swati|date=July 2, 2014|website=The Washington Post|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Environment ===
The Mosques and Schools in [[Jordan]] are nearing 100% powered by [[renewable energy]], using the energy for activities such as lights and heating water.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jordan's capital is creating green mosques and schools to tackle emissions|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/with-green-mosques-and-schools-amman-pushes-for-zero-emissions/|website=World Economic Forum|language=en|access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref>
