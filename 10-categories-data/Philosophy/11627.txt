'''Faith healing''' is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as [[laying on of hands]]) that are believed by some to elicit [[miracle|divine intervention]] in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Faith healing|url=http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp#F|website=thearda.com|location=University Park, PA|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|access-date=2015-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101012004/http://www.thearda.com/learningcenter/religiondictionary.asp|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=live}} Citing {{cite encyclopedia|year=1995|editor1-last=Smith|editor1-first=Jonathan|editor2-last=Green|editor2-first=William Scott|title=The Harper Collins Dictionary of Religion|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=HarperCollins|page=355}}</ref> Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a [[divine presence]] and power.

Many people interpret the [[Bible]], especially the [[New Testament]], as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing.

==In various belief systems==

===Christianity===

====Overview====
[[File:FvfFaithhealing6177 15.JPG|thumb|Faith healing by [[Fernando Suarez]], Philippines]]
Regarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the [[Holy Spirit]], faith healing often involves the [[laying on of hands]]. It is also called supernatural healing, divine healing, and [[miracle]] healing, among other things. Healing in the Bible is often associated with the ministry of specific individuals including [[Elijah]], [[Jesus]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]].<ref name="Village" />

Christian physician Reginald B. Cherry views faith healing as a pathway of healing in which God uses both the natural and the supernatural to heal.<ref name="Cherry">{{cite book |first= Reginald B. |last= Cherry |title= The Bible Cure |publisher= HarperOne |year= 1999 |orig-year= 1998 |edition= reprint |isbn= 978-0062516152}}{{Page needed|date=January 2014}} Citing: {{Bibleref2|John|9:1–7}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:46–52}}.</ref> Being healed has been described as a privilege of accepting Christ's redemption on the cross.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=32}} Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of [[salvation]].<ref>{{cite book |first= Wilfred Jr. |last= Graves |author-link= Wilfred Graves Jr. |title= In Pursuit of Wholeness: Experiencing God's Salvation for the Total Person |page= 52 |location= Shippensburg, PA |publisher= Destiny Image |isbn= 9780768437942|year= 2011 }}</ref> {{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:17|NIV}}, after describing [[Jesus exorcising at sunset]] and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|53:5|NIV}}: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases".

Even those Christian writers who believe in faith healing do not all believe that one's faith presently brings about the desired healing. "[Y]our faith does not effect your healing now. When you are healed rests entirely on what the sovereign purposes of the Healer are."<ref name="Charisma1">{{cite news |first= Larry |last= Keefauver |title= The myths of faith healing |date= June 17, 2009 |url= http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |magazine= [[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511085525/http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/charisma-channels/spiritled-living/20588-the-myths-of-faith-healing |archive-date= 2009-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> Larry Keefauver cautions against allowing enthusiasm for faith healing to stir up false hopes. "Just believing hard enough, long enough or strong enough will not strengthen you or prompt your healing. Doing mental gymnastics to 'hold on to your miracle' will not cause your healing to manifest now."<ref name="Charisma1" /> Those who actively lay hands on others and pray with them to be healed are usually aware that healing may not always follow immediately. Proponents of faith healing say it may come later, and it may not come in this life. "The truth is that your healing may manifest in eternity, not in time".<ref name="Charisma1" />

====New Testament====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=September 2015}}
Parts of the four [[gospel]]s in the [[New Testament]] say that [[Jesus]] cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. Jesus’ healing acts are considered miraculous and spectacular due to the results being impossible or statistically improbable. <ref>Ehrman, B. D. (2016). ''The New Testament: a historical introduction to the early Christian writings'' (6th ed.) New York, NY: Oxford University Press. 251-253.
</ref> One example is the case of "a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not better but rather grew worse".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:26–27}} After healing her, Jesus tells her "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace! Be cured from your illness".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|5:34|GW}} At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed: {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:52}} and {{bibleref2|Luke|19:10}}.

Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the [[Good Samaritan]] (Luke 10:25–37), who "bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, "And who is my neighbor?" in verse 29) to "go, and do likewise" in loving others with whom he would never ordinarily associate (verse 37).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://thefaithfulword.org/faithhealing.html |title= Faith Healing – God's Compassion, God's Power, and God's Sovereignty: Is a Christian permitted to seek medical assistance and to use medicine? |date= December 16, 2003 |first= Craig W. |last= Booth |access-date= 2007-05-01 |work= thefaithfulword.org}}</ref>

The healing in the gospels is referred to as a "sign"{{Bibleref2c|John|6:2}} to prove Jesus' divinity and to foster belief in him as the Christ.{{Bibleref2c|John|4:48}} However, when asked for other types of miracles, Jesus refused some{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–42}} but granted others{{Bibleref2c|Luke|9:38–43}} in consideration of the motive of the request. Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed ''all'' who were present every single time.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|p=61}} Sometimes he determines whether they had faith that he would heal them.{{sfn|Bosworth|2001|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Four of the seven miraculous signs performed in the [[Fourth Gospel]] that indicated he was sent from God were acts of healing or resurrection. He heals the Capernaum official's son, heals a paralytic by the pool in [[Bethsaida]], healing a man born blind, and resurrecting [[Lazarus of Bethany]].<ref>Ehrman, B. D. (2016). ''The New Testament: a historical introduction to the early Christian writings'' (6th ed.) New York, NY: Oxford University Press. 171-172.</ref>

Jesus told his followers to heal the sick <ref>Crossan, J. D. (1994). ''Jesus: a revolutionary biography''. New York, NY: HarperOne. 119-123.</ref> and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to "cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. You received free, give free".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|10:8}}{{Bibleref2c|Mark|16:17–18}}

Jesus sternly ordered many who received healing from him: "Do not tell anyone!"<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matthew|8:4}}; {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|9:30}}; {{Bibleref2|Mark|5:43}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:24}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|7:36}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|8:30}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|Mark|9:9}}; {{Bibleref2|Luke|5:14}}</ref> Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a "wicked and adulterous generation".{{Bibleref2c|Matthew|12:38–39}}

The apostle Paul believed healing is one of the special gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]],{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|12:9||1 Corinthians 12:9}} <ref>Harris, S. L. (2015). ''The New Testament: a student's introduction'' (8th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. 345.</ref> and that the possibility exists that certain persons may possess this gift to an extraordinarily high degree.<ref>{{cite book |last= Price |first= Charles P. |chapter-url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |chapter= Faith Healing |title= Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia. |year= 2009 |archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpJ3YJj?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761560864/Faith_Healing.html |archive-date= 2009-11-01}}</ref>

In the New Testament [[Epistle of James]],{{Bibleref2c-nb|James|5:14}} the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord.

The New Testament says that during Jesus' [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], the [[Apostle (Christian)|apostles]] healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Apostles were holy men who had direct access to God and could channel his power to help and heal people.<ref>Pilch, J. J. (2004). ''Visions and healing in the Acts of the Apostles: how the early believers experienced God''. Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press. 40.</ref> For example, [[Saint Peter]] healed a crippled man.<ref>Harris, S. L. (2015). The New Testament: a student's introduction (8th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. 292-293.</ref>{{Bibleref2c|Luke|3:1-10}}

Jesus used miracles to convince people that he was inaugurating the [[Messianic Age]], as in Mt 12.28. Scholars have described Jesus' miracles as establishing the kingdom during his lifetime.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Jerome Biblical Commentary|last=Brown|display-authors=etal|first=Raymond E.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1990|isbn=978-0-13-614934-7|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|chapter=78:20; 81:106,112,113,117}}</ref>

* healing by divine grace "interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental [[Christian laying on of hands|laying on of hands]] and [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|anointing with oil]] or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an [[Intercession of saints|appeal to the saints for their aid]]"<ref name="USCCB2009"/>{{rp|at=n2}}

In 2000, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued "Instruction on prayers for healing" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing,<ref name="CDF2000"/> which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.<ref name="Ascoli2009">{{cite book|last=Ascoli|first=Micol|year=2009|chapter=Psychotherapy or religious healing? : the 'therapeutic' cult of charismatic Catholics in Italy|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Su9Zhe3HglsC&pg=PA229|editor1-last=Incayawar|editor1-first=Mario|editor2-last=Wintrob|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Bouchard|editor3-first=Lise|title=Psychiatrist and traditional healers : unwitting partners in global mental health|pages=229–236|series=WPA series, evidence and experience in psychiatry|location=Hoboken, NJ|publisher=J.

It accepts "that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science",<ref name="USCCB2009"/>{{rp|at=n6}}{{efn|According to a ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article about [[psychotherapy]] from 1911, the application of scientific principles has probably been the responsible cause of more faith cures than anything else. Faith in a [[scientific discovery]] acts through the mind of a patient to bring about an improvement of symptoms, if not a cure of the disease. The patients who are cured usually suffer from [[chronic condition]]s, they either have only a [[persuasion]] that they are ill or have some physical ailment, but the patients inhibit through {{linktext|solicitude}} and worry the natural forces that would bring about a cure. This inhibition cannot be lifted until the mind is relieved by confidence in a remedy or scientific discovery that gives them a conviction of cure.<ref name="Walsh1911"/>}} but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence.<ref name="USCCB2009"/>{{rp|at=nn11–12}}

Faith healing is reported by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] as the result of [[intercessory prayer]] to a [[saint]] or to a person with the [[gifts of healing|gift of healing]]. According to ''[[U.S. Catholic]]'' magazine, "Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific age—miracles really are possible." According to a ''Newsweek'' poll, three-fourths of American Catholics say they pray for "miracles" of some sort.<ref name=Scanlon>{{cite news |first= Leslie |last= Scanlon |title= It's a miracle! |magazine= [[U.S. Catholic (magazine)|U.S. Catholic]] |date= June 2009 |volume= 74 |issue= 6 |page= 12 |url= http://www.uscatholic.org/church/2009/05/its-miracle}}</ref>

According to John Cavadini, when healing is granted, "The miracle is not primarily for the person healed, but for all people, as a sign of God's work in the ultimate healing called 'salvation', or a sign of the kingdom that is coming."

The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Pope Francis tightened the rules on money and miracles in the canonization process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|title=Vatican tightens rules on miracles and money in sainthood cases|date=2016-09-23|work=Crux|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427101140/https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2016/09/23/vatican-tightens-rules-miracles-money-sainthood-cases/|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles.

According to ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', it is often said that cures at [[shrine]]s and during [[Christian pilgrimage]]s are mainly due to psychotherapy — partly to confident trust in [[Divine providence]], and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places.<ref name="Walsh1911">{{Catholic|inline=1|title=Psychotherapy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12549a.htm|first=James J.|last=Walsh|volume=12}}</ref>{{efn|A pre-1911 analysis of the records of cures shows that the majority of accepted cures have been in patients suffering from demonstrable physical conditions.<ref name="Walsh1911"/>}}

Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]] at the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] in [[France]] and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to [[Saint Jude]], who is known as the "[[patron saint]] of lost causes".

At the beginning of the 20th century, the new [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement drew participants from the [[Holiness movement]] and other movements in America that already believed in divine healing. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings.

The first Pentecostals in the modern sense appeared in [[Topeka, Kansas]], in a Bible school conducted by [[Charles Fox Parham]], a holiness teacher and former [[Methodist]] pastor. Pentecostalism achieved worldwide attention in 1906 through the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in [[Los Angeles]] led by [[William Joseph Seymour]].<ref>{{cite web |last= Synan |first= Vinson |title= The Origins of the Pentecostal Movement |url= http://webapps.oru.edu/new_php/library/holyspirit/pentorg1.html |publisher= Holy Spirit Research Center, Oral Roberts University |date= 14 June 2009}}</ref>

[[Smith Wigglesworth]] was also a well-known figure in the early part of the 20th century. A former English plumber turned [[evangelism|evangelist]] who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. Wigglesworth claimed to raise several people from the dead in Jesus' name in his meetings.<ref>{{cite book |first1= Sarah |last1= Posner |first2= Joe |last2= Conason |title= God's Profits: Faith, Fraud, and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters |publisher= Polipoint Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0979482212 |page= [https://archive.org/details/godsprofitsfaith0000posn/page/67 67] |url= https://archive.org/details/godsprofitsfaith0000posn/page/67 }}</ref>

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) has had a long history of faith healings. Many members of the LDS Church have told their stories of healing within the LDS publication, the ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Brandon J. |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2001/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= I needed a blessing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|The Ensign of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Ensign) |date= September 2001 |pages= 64–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Ribeiro |first= Sérgio |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2004/01/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= He restoreth my soul |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 2004 |pages= 70–3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Heal |first= Simon |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2010/04/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= Call an ambulance! |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= April 2010 |pages= 60–3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Peñate de Guerra |first= Magdalena |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2005/09/latter-day-saint-voices?lang=eng |title= We rejoiced in her healing |department= Latter-day Saint Voices |magazine= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= September 2005 |pages= 66–9}}</ref> The church believes healings come most often as a result of [[priesthood blessing]]s given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Healing is always attributed to be God's power. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, [[Joseph Smith]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |title= Joseph Smith/Healings and miracles |publisher= [[FairMormon]] |work= fairmormon.org |date= May 23, 2010 |access-date= 2010-09-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201100307/http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith_healings_and_miracles |archive-date= 2010-02-01 |url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.josephsmith.net/josephsmith/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=041579179acbff00VgnVCM1000001f5e340aRCRD&locale=0 |title= Joseph Smith: Prophet of God |work= Josephsmith.net |publisher= [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS)}}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>

According to LDS doctrine, even though members may have the restored [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood authority]] to heal in the name of Jesus Christ, all efforts should be made to seek the appropriate medical help. [[Brigham Young]] stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God.<ref>{{harvnb|Young, Brigham|1997|loc= Chapter 34: "Strengthening the Saints Through the Gifts of the Spirit".

A review in 1954 investigated [[energy medicine|spiritual healing]], [[therapeutic touch]] and faith healing. Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Louis |last= Rose |title= Some aspects of paranormal healing |journal= [[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]] |volume= 2 |issue= 4900 |year= 1954 |pages= 1329–32 |pmid= 13209112 |pmc= 2080217 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.4900.1329}}</ref>

The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient's records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. “The overall goal of GMRI is to promote an empirically grounded understanding of the physiological, emotional, and sociological effects of Christian Spiritual Healing practices”.<ref name="GMRI">{{cite web | title=About GMRI – Global Medical Research Institute | website=Global Medical Research Institute – Applying rigorous methods of evidence-based medicine to study Christian Spiritual Healing practices | url=http://www.globalmri.org/index.php/about | access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> This is accomplished by applying the same rigorous standards used in other forms of medical and scientific research.

Skeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural.{{efn|"Benefits may result because of the natural progression of the illness, rarely but regularly occurring spontaneous remission or through the placebo effect."

According to the [[American Cancer Society]]:
{{quote|... available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can actually cure physical ailments... One review published in 1998 looked at 172 cases of deaths among children treated by faith healing instead of conventional methods. These researchers estimated that if conventional treatment had been given, the survival rate for most of these children would have been more than 90 percent, with the remainder of the children also having a good chance of survival. A more recent study found that more than 200 children had died of treatable illnesses in the United States over the past thirty years because their parents relied on spiritual healing rather than conventional medical treatment.}}

Belgian [[philosopher]] and [[skeptic]] [[Etienne Vermeersch]] coined the term [[Lourdes effect]] as a criticism of the [[magical thinking]] and [[placebo effect]] possibilities for the claimed miraculous cures as there are no documented events where a severed arm has been reattached through faith healing at Lourdes.

===Negative impact on public health===
Reliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques.{{efn|"Faith healing can cause patients to shun effective medical care". Bruce Flamm<ref name='SRAM_Flamm'>{{cite journal|title=Inherent Dangers of Faith Healing Studies|journal=Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|date=2004|first=Bruce L.|last=Flamm|volume=8|issue=2|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|access-date=2008-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816154915/http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html|archive-date=2007-08-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}{{efn|"It is often claimed that faith healing may not work but at least does no harm. In fact, reliance on faith healing can cause serious harm and even death." Bruce Flamm<ref name= "Flamm2004"/>}}{{efn|"Faith-healers take from their subjects any hope of managing on their own. And they may very well take them away from legitimate treatments that could really help them." [[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} This is evident in both higher mortality rates for children<ref name="AsserSwan1998"/> and in reduced life expectancy for adults.<ref name='JAMA longevity' /> Critics have also made note of serious injury that has resulted from falsely labelled "healings", where patients erroneously consider themselves cured and cease or withdraw from treatment.<ref name= "Barrett2009"/>{{efn|"These [discarded medications] are substances without which those people might well die."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} For example, at least six people have died after faith healing by their church and being told they had been healed of HIV and could stop taking their medications.<ref>{{cite news|date=November 25, 2011|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|title=Church tells HIV patients to stop treatment|first=Liz|last=Lane|publisher=[[Sky News]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145744/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269|archive-date=November 26, 2011}}</ref> It is the stated position of the AMA that "prayer as therapy should not delay access to traditional medical care".<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Choosing faith healing while rejecting [[modern medicine]] can and does cause people to die needlessly.<ref name=Cogan1998>{{cite book|author=Robert Cogan|title=Critical Thinking: Step by Step|url=https://archive.org/details/criticalthinking0000coga|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-1067-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/criticalthinking0000coga/page/217 217]}}</ref>

===Christian theological criticism of faith healing===
Christian theological criticism of faith healing broadly falls into two distinct levels of disagreement.

The first is widely termed the "open-but-cautious" view of the miraculous in the church today. This term is deliberately used by [[Robert L. Saucy]] in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today?''.<ref name="grudem et al.">{{cite book |last= Saucy |first= Robert L. |author-link= Robert L. Saucy |title= Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? |editor-last= Grudem |editor-first= Wayne |editor-link= Wayne Grudem |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-0310201557 }}{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}</ref> [[Don Carson]] is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an "open-but-cautious" view.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.monergism.com/thethreshold/articles/bio/dacarson.html |title= D.A. Carson: Biographical Sketch |work= Monergism.com |publisher= Christian Publication Resource Foundation |location= Portland, OR |access-date= 2014-01-23}}</ref> In dealing with the claims of [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|Warfield]], particularly "Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased",{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} Carson asserts, "But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so."{{sfn|Carson|1987|page=156}} However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, "Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith."{{sfn|Carson|1987|pages=174–5}}

The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. Commonly referred to as [[cessationism]], its adherents either claim that faith healing will not happen today at all, or may happen today, but it would be unusual. [[Richard Gaffin]] argues for a form of cessationism in an essay alongside Saucy's in the book ''Are Miraculous Gifts for Today''? In his book ''Perspectives on Pentecost''{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|loc={{Page needed|date=January 2014}}}} Gaffin states of healing and related gifts that "the conclusion to be drawn is that as listed in 1 Corinthians 12(vv. 9f., 29f.) and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts, particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|pages=113–4}} Gaffin qualifies this, however, by saying "At the same time, however, the sovereign will and power of God today to heal the sick, particularly in response to prayer (see e.g. James 5:14,15), ought to be acknowledged and insisted on."{{sfn|Gaffin|1979|page=114}}

===Fraud===
Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a [[quackery|quack]] practice in which the "healers" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} [[James Randi]]'s ''[[The Faith Healers]]'' investigates Christian evangelists such as [[Peter Popoff]], who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience. Popoff pretended to know private details about participants' lives by receiving radio transmissions from his wife who was off-stage and had gathered information from audience members prior to the show.{{sfn|Randi|1989|p=10}} According to this book, many of the leading modern evangelistic healers have engaged in deception and fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/faith.html|title=Some Thoughts about Faith Healing|website=www.quackwatch.com|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref> The book also questioned how faith healers use funds that were sent to them for specific purposes.{{efn|"[Some] faith-healers have been less than careful in their use of funds sent to them for specific purposes."[[James Randi]]{{sfn|Randi|1989|page=141}}}} Physicist [[Robert L. Park]]<ref name="Park"/> and doctor and consumer advocate [[Stephen Barrett]]<ref name= "Barrett2009"/> have called into question the ethics of some exorbitant fees.

There have also been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a [[Jack Coe]] revival service in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio.<ref name="Courier19561218">{{cite news |url= http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20130129191538/http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= January 29, 2013 |title= Faith healer dies – Victim of bulbar polio |newspaper= [[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |location= Yavapai County, AZ |date= December 18, 1956 |access-date= 2007-11-12 }}</ref><ref name= "Salina19561217">{{cite news |title= 'Faith-healer' dies of polio |date= December 17, 1956 |newspaper= [[The Salina Journal]] |location= Salina, KS |page= 5 |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/40757536/ |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].<ref name="Courier19561218"/><ref name= "Salina19561217"/> However, their son was not cured of polio and removing the braces left the boy in constant pain.<ref name="Courier19561218"/><ref name= "Salina19561217"/><ref>{{cite news |last= Davis |first= Mike |title= Lost faith: Mother's story of healer |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19560208&id=AJ0yAAAAIBAJ&pg=3001,2779353 |date= February 8, 1956 |page= 7A |newspaper= [[The Miami News|The Miami Daily News]] |location= Miami, FL |access-date= 2014-01-23}}</ref> As a result, through the efforts of [[Joseph L.

===Miracles for sale===

(a) In General. – Nothing in this Act shall be construed –

"(1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; and "(2) to require that a State find, or to prohibit a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian.

"(b) State Requirement. – Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State shall, at a minimum, have in place authority under State law to permit the child protective services system of the State to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions. Except with respect to the withholding of medically indicated treatments from disabled infants with life threatening conditions, case by case determinations concerning the exercise of the authority of this subsection shall be within the sole discretion of the State.}}
