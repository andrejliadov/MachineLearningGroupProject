==Overview==
In [[Sweden]]<ref>[https://www.philosophy.su.se/english/ Department of Philosophy, Stockholm University]</ref> and [[Finland]] courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately, and are separate degrees. Other countries may use a similar scheme—some [[Scotland|Scottish]] universities, for example, divide philosophy into [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[ethics]]—but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject. There is also a unified philosophy subject in some Swedish universities, such as [[Södertörn University College|Södertörns Högskola]].

==Subjects of practical philosophy==
Examples of practical philosophy subjects are:
*[[Ethics]]
*[[Aesthetics]]
*[[Decision theory]]
