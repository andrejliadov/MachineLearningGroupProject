'''Jihadist extremism in the United States''' (or '''Islamist extremism in the United States''') refers to Islamic extremism occurring within the United States. [[Islamic extremism]] is adherence to a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam (see [[Islamic fundamentalism]]), potentially including the promotion of violence to achieve political goals (see [[Jihadism]]). In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terror attacks]], Islamic extremism became a prioritized national security concern of the United States government and a focus by many subsidiary security and law enforcement entities. Initially, the focus of concern was on foreign terrorist groups, particularly [[al-Qaeda]], but in the course of the years since 9/11 the focus has shifted more towards Islamic extremism ''within'' the United States.<ref name='Hamilton Test'>{{cite news | first = Lee | last = Hamilton | title = The Attacks of September 11th: Where We Are Today | date = 2011-09-08 | url = http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Hamilton%20Testimony.pdf | work = U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security | page = 3 | accessdate = 2011-11-13}}</ref> The number of American citizens or long-term residents involved in extremist activity is small, but nevertheless is a national security concern.<ref name='Bipartisan'>{{cite journal | title = Assessing the Terrorist Threat: A Report of the Bipartisan Policy Center's National Security Preparedness Group | journal = Bipartisan Policy Center | date = 2010-09-10 | first = Peter | last = Bergen |author2=Bruce Hoffman| url = http://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/NSPG%20Final%20Threat%20Assessment.pdf | page = 30 | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}</ref>

Zeyno Baran, senior fellow and director of the Center for Eurasian Policy at the Hudson Institute, argues a more appropriate term is ''[[Islamism|Islami''st'']] extremism'' to distinguish the religion from the political ideology that leads to extremism:
<blockquote>Islam, the religion, deals with piety, ethics, and beliefs, and can be compatible with secular liberal democracy and basic civil liberties. Islamists, however, believe Islam is the only basis for the legal and political system that governs the world's economic, social, and judicial mechanisms. Islamic law, or sharia, must shape all aspects of human society, from politics and education to history, science, the arts, and more. It is diametrically opposed to liberal democracy.<ref name='Baran'>{{cite web | url = http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/071008baran | title = The Roots of Violent Islamist Extremism and Efforts to Counter It | accessdate = 2011-11-11 | last = Baran | first = Zeyno | date = 2008-07-10 | format = PDF | work = Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs }}</ref></blockquote>
With the value placed on freedom of religion in the United States, religious extremism is a difficult and divisive topic. [[Zuhdi Jasser|Dr. M. Zuhdi Jasser]], president and founder of the [[American Islamic Forum for Democracy]], testified before Congress that the United States is "polarized on its perceptions of Muslims and the radicalization that occurs within our communities... One camp refuses to believe any Muslim could be radicalized living in blind multiculturalism, apologetics, and denial, and the other camp believes all devout Muslims and the faith of Islam are radicalized..."<ref name='Jasser Test'>{{cite news | first = M.

==Places for radicalization==

{{see also|Conversion to Islam in U.S. prisons}}

Reports have cautioned for the potential for radicalization as a result of vulnerable inmates having little exposure to mainstream Islam and monitoring of religious services activities in the event they may be exposed to extremist versions of the religion from inadequate religious service providers or other inmates via anti-US sermons and extremist media; which may be embraced or influenced by the [[Salafi]] form of [[Sunni Islam]] (including revisionist versions commonly known as “prison Islam”) and an extremist view of [[Shia Islam]].<ref name='Shadows' /><ref name='Duyn'>{{cite web | url = http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=bba49f1b-4881-423d-8054-4b9dd78bd5d4 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090830104241/http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&FileStore_id=bba49f1b-4881-423d-8054-4b9dd78bd5d4 | url-status = live | archive-date = 2009-08-30 | title = Prison Radicalization: The Environment, the Threat, and the Response | accessdate = 2011-11-11 | last = Van Duyn | first = Donald | date = 2006-09-19 | format = PDF | work = Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs }}</ref>  The term "Prison" or "Jailhouse Islam" is unique to prison and incorporates values of gang loyalty and violence into the religion.<ref name='Shadows' /> In spite of the fact of there being over 350,000 Muslim inmates in the United States, little evidence indicates widespread radicalization or foreign recruitment.<ref name="Spearlt"/>   

Some argue that empirical studies have not supported the claims that prions are fertile grounds for terrorism.<ref name='Oxford'/> Only one Black American prison convert was convicted for involvement among the millions of adult males under supervision in the United States.<ref name='Oxford'/> This individual founded a prison extremist group, called Jami'iy yat Ul-Isla Is Saheeh (JIS), from New Folsom State Prison in California and hatched a plot to attack numerous local government and Jewish targets.<ref name='Shadows' /> In July 2005, members of JIS "were involved in almost a dozen armed gas station robberies in Los Angeles with the goal of financing terrorist operations."<ref name='Duyn' /> 

Statistics are not kept on the religious orientation of inmates in the U.S. prison system, limiting the ability to adequately judge the potential for Islamic extremism. A report published by the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General in 2004 on the issue of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]' selection of Muslim chaplains, estimated that 6% of the federal inmate population seek Muslim Islamic services.<ref name='DOJ Prison'>{{cite news | author = Office of the Inspector General | title = A Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Selection of Muslim Religious Services Providers | date = April 2004 | url = http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0404/final.pdf | work = Department of Justice | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}</ref> Through prisoner self-reporting, the majority of Muslims in federal prison are Sunni or Nation of Islam followers.<ref name='DOJ Prison' /> The federal prison population is only a small percentage of the total U.S. prison population, however, and cannot provide an overall representation of Muslims inmates in the United States.

==U.S.-specific extremist narrative==
Key to the trend of increasing Islamic extremism in the United States “has been the development of a US-specific narrative that motivates individuals to violence.”<ref name='Leiter' /> “This narrative—a blend of al-Qa‘ida inspiration, perceived victimization, and glorification of past plotting—has become increasingly accessible through the Internet, and English-language websites are tailored to address the unique concerns of US-based extremists.”<ref name='Leiter' /> “To disaffected, aggrieved, or troubled individuals, this narrative explains in a simple framework the ills around them and the geopolitical discord they see on their television sets and on the Internet.” <ref name='Zarate'>{{cite news | first = Juan | last = Zarate | title = Al Qa'ida in 2010: How Should the U.S. Respond? | date = 2010-01-27 | url = http://csis.org/files/ts_100127_Zarate.pdf | work = Testimony before House Armed Services Committee | accessdate = 2010-11-12}}</ref> The narrative is easy to understand and grants “meaning and heroic outlet” for the discontented and alienated.<ref name='Zarate' />

==U.S. government response==
The President, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), and the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) are the most relevant elements of the U.S. government to the threat of American Islamic extremism and each has taken steps to address and counter the issue. Since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] the government has worked to improve information sharing "within the government, and between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement, as well as with the public."<ref name='Olsen' /> The "If You See Something, Say Something" campaign, instituted by DHS and local law enforcement, was created to raise public awareness of the potential dangers.<ref name='Napolitano' /> In August 2011, the Office of the President released a strategy to counter violent extremism called [[Empowering local partners to prevent violent extremism in the United States|''Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'']].<ref name='President'>{{cite news | title = Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States |date=August 2011| url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/empowering_local_partners.pdf | work = Office of President of the United States | accessdate = 2011-11-15 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111111164048/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/empowering_local_partners.pdf | archive-date = 2011-11-11 }}</ref> The strategy takes a three-pronged approach of community engagement, better training, and counternarratives. The plan states: "We must actively and aggressively counter the range of ideologies violent extremists employ to radicalize and recruit individuals by challenging justifications for violence and by actively promoting the unifying and inclusive visions of our American ideals," challenging extremist propaganda through words and deeds.<ref name='President' /> The goal is to "prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence."<ref name='President' />

King#Radicalization hearings|House hearing on Muslim radicalization in the U.S.]] in early 2010:<blockquote> For me it is a very personal mission to leave my American Muslim children a legacy that their faith is based in the unalienable right to liberty and to teach them that the principles that founded America do not contradict their faith but strengthen it. Our founding principle is that I as a Muslim am able to best practice my faith in a society like the United States that guarantees the rights of every individual blind to faith with no governmental intermediary stepping between the individual and the creator to interpret the will of God. Because of this, our mission is to advocate for the principles of the Constitution of the United States of America, liberty and freedom and the separation of mosque and state. We believe that this mission from within the “House of Islam” is the only way to inoculate Muslim youth and young adults against radicalization. The “Liberty narrative” is the only effective counter to the “Islamist narrative."<ref name='Jasser Test' /></blockquote>
Another voice, that warned of Islamic extremism before the [[September 11 attacks]] is [[Hisham Kabbani|Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani]], chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of America.<ref name='Shaykh' />

== Media attention in the US on Islamic Terrorism ==
{{See also|Mass media in the United States}}
The Universities of Georgia and Alabama in the United States conducted a study comparing media coverage of "terrorist attacks" committed by Islamist militants with those of non-Muslims in the United States.&nbsp; Researchers found that "terrorist attacks" by Islamist militants receive 357% more media attention than attacks committed by non-Muslims or whites. Terrorist attacks committed by non-Muslims (or where the religion was unknown) received an average of 15 headlines, while those committed by Muslim extremists received 105 headlines.<ref name="Chalabi">{{cite web|last1=Chalabi|first1=Mona|date=20 July 2018|title=Terror attacks by Muslims receive 357% more press attention, study finds|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/20/muslim-terror-attacks-press-coverage-study|accessdate=5 September 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref> The study was based on an analysis of news reports covering terrorist attacks in the United States between 2005 and 2015.<ref name="Kearns">{{cite journal|last1=Kearns|first1=Erin M.|last2=Betus|first2=Allison E.|last3=Lemieux|first3=Anthony F.|date=19 September 2019|title=Why Do Some Terrorist Attacks Receive More Media Attention Than Others?|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2018.1524507|journal=Justice Quarterly|volume=36|issue=6|pages=985–1022|doi=10.1080/07418825.2018.1524507|issn=0741-8825}}</ref>
