The '''Abrahamites''' were a [[sect]] of [[deist]]s in [[Bohemia]] in the 18th century, who professed to be followers of the pre-circumcised [[Abraham]]. Believing in one God, but [[Nontrinitarianism|rejecting the Trinity]], [[original sin]], and the perpetuity of punishment for [[sin]] they contented themselves with the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Declining to be classed either as Christians or Jews, they were excluded from the [[edict of toleration]] promulgated by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in 1781, and deported to various parts of the country, the men being drafted into frontier regiments. Some became [[Roman Catholic]]s, and those who retained their "Abrahamite" views were not able to hand them on to the next generation.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abrahamites|volume=1|page=72}}</ref>

They are not to be confused with the ninth century Syrian group also known as the [[Abrahamite monks]], who were exterminated by the iconoclastic emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Abrahamites|author=John Joseph A'Becket}}</ref>
