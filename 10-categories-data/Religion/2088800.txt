'''Sacred mysteries''' are the areas of [[supernatural]] phenomena associated with a [[divinity]] or a [[religious belief|religious ideology]]. Sacred mysteries may be either: 
# Religious beliefs, [[ritual]]s or practices which are kept secret from non-believers, or lower levels of believers, who have not had an [[initiation]] into the higher levels of belief (the concealed knowledge may be called [[esoteric]]).
# Beliefs of the religion which are public knowledge but cannot be easily explained by normal rational or scientific means.
Although the term "mystery" is not often used in [[anthropology]], access by initiation or [[rite of passage]] to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of [[indigenous religion]]s all over the world.

A [[mystagogue]] or [[hierophant]] is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, [[mysticism]] may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above. 
 
==Greco-Roman mysteries==
{{Main|Greco-Roman mysteries}}
The [[mystery religions]] of antiquity were religious cults which required [[initiation]] of an "initiate" or new member before they were accepted, and sometimes had different levels of initiation, as well as doctrines which were mysteries in the sense of requiring supernatural explanation. In some, parts of the doctrine were apparently only known to priests. They included the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], [[Mithraism]], the  [[Isis|Cult of Isis]], the [[Sol Invictus|Cult of Sol Invictus]], and the [[Essenes]]. Mystery traditions were popular in [[ancient Greece]] and during the height of the [[Roman Empire]],<ref>[[Antonio Virgili]], Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008</ref> and parts of [[Early Christianity]] used secrecy in the same way.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Mystery}}</ref>

==Christian mysteries==
<!-- [[Holy Mysteries]] redirects here -->
Although the term is not used equally by all Christian traditions, many if not most basic aspects of [[Christian theology]] require a supernatural explanation. To name but a few key examples, these include the nature of the [[Trinity]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], and the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. These are mysteries in the sense that they cannot be explained or apprehended by reason alone.

The word ''mysterion'' (μυστήριον) is used 27 times in the [[New Testament]]. It denotes not so much the meaning of the modern English term ''mystery'', but rather something that is ''[[mystical]]''. In the [[biblical Greek]], the term refers to "that which awaits disclosure or interpretation".<ref>Danker, Frederick William, ''The Concise Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2009, {{ISBN|0-226-13615-9}}), Kindle location. 4417.</ref> In the Catholic church the Latin term is [[The mystery of faith|''mysterium fidei'']], "mystery of faith", defined in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997) to mean a mystery hidden in God, which can never be known unless revealed by God.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism_lt/p1s2c1p2_lt.htm# |title='&#39;Catechismus Ecclesiae Catholicae'&#39;, 237 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1992-06-25 |accessdate=2019-05-20}}</ref>

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] the [[First Vatican Council]] re-affirmed the existence of mysteries as a doctrine of Catholic faith as follows: "If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (''vera et proprie dicta mysteria''), but that through reason rightly developed (''per rationem rite excultam'') all the dogmas of faith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be [[anathema]]" (Sess. III, ''De fide et ratione'', can. i). The position, if not the terminology, of other Christian churches is essentially the same.

In parts of the [[Early Church|Early Christian Church]], many aspects of Christian theology, including some [[sacraments]] and [[sacramentals]], the so-called ''[[disciplina arcani]]'', were kept hidden from the [[paganism|pagans]] lest they become objects of ridicule, and were also introduced gradually to [[catechumen]]s or new converts. As the [[Persecution of Christians|Age of Persecution]] ended, the secrecy was gradually relaxed.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05032a.htm Discipline of the Secret] article in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]</ref> But the term continued to be used, and the same word is used in the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es to describe "mysteries" and "sacraments". This is not usually so in the West, although theologically many aspects of sacraments are recognized as mysteries in the main sense described above, especially (for those churches accepting it) the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] in the [[Eucharist]]. Hence [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[papal encyclical]] of 3 September 1965 on the Eucharist was titled, from its opening words, ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]''. In the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Catholic Mass]] within or immediately after the [[Words of Institution|formula of consecration]] of the wine, the celebrant says "The mystery of faith". Originally the term "Mystery" was used for the sacraments generally in both the East and the West, as shown from the "[[Mystagogue|Mystagogical]] Homilies" of St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] and the work, ''On the Mysteries'' by St. [[Ambrose of Milan]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3405.htm On the Mysteries] by St. Ambrose of Milan, 
[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310119.htm Mystagogical Lectures] St. Cyril of Jerusalem</ref>

Although all the official doctrines of Christian churches have long been fully public, the loosely defined area of Christian thought called [[Christian mysticism]] often concerns the contemplation of sacred mysteries and may include the development of personal theories about them, undertaken in the knowledge that they can never be fully apprehended by man.

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Sacrament}}
The term is used in [[Eastern Christianity]] to refer to what the [[Western Church]] currently calls [[sacraments]] and [[sacramentals]], terms which the Western Church has carefully defined in [[canon law]]. Thus, for instance, the [[Council of Trent]] declared there to be ''exactly'' [[seven sacraments]]. The [[Eastern Church]]es, in contrast, have never defined the Mysteries in such precise terms. And, although the Western Church teaches that the [[consecrated]] bread and wine of the [[Eucharist]] are one sacrament, the [[Divine Liturgy]] refers to the Eucharist as the ''Mysteries'', in the plural. [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] have always received Holy Communion in both [[Eucharist#Eucharistic theology|species]] (both the [[Body of Christ|body]] and the [[Blood of Christ|blood]]), and even reserve both in the [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]]. The sacred mysteries can be defined as "those holy acts through which the Holy Spirit mysteriously and invisibly confers Grace (the saving power of God) upon man".<ref>[[Archpriest]] Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. [[Job of Pochaev]], Jordanville, NY, 1996, {{ISBN|0-88465-044-8}}), p. 471.</ref>

Although Orthodox instructional materials may list seven sacred mysteries, the same as the Western seven sacraments: [[Baptism]], [[Chrismation]] (Confirmation), [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] (Penance, Reconciliation or Confession), [[Holy Communion]] (Eucharist or Holy Communion), [[Marriage]] (Holy Matrimony), [[Ordination]] (Holy Orders), and [[Unction]] (Anointing of the Sick. Archaic: Extreme Unction) (Western names in parentheses), the term is not limited to these seven. As in the West, all faithful men are expected to receive six of the seven listed above, and may or may not receive either marriage or ordination, or both; women may not be received into the priesthood, but may be given monastic orders.

Christian life is centered in the mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation of Christ]], the union of God and man. However, the redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]].<ref>''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective'', (St. John of Kronstadt Press, Liberty, TN, 1986), p. 6.</ref> The Sacraments, or Sacred Mysteries are the most important means by which the faithful may obtain union with God, provided they are received with [[faith]] after [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|appropriate preparation]]. Christians believe that God is present everywhere and fills all things by his [[divine grace]], and that all of creation is, in some sense, a "sacrament". However, they believe that "He is more specifically and intensively present in [those] particular and reliable manners which He Himself has established,"<ref>''The Sacramental Life'' (1986), p. 7.</ref> i.e., in the Sacred Mysteries.

==Other religions and groups==
{{main|Esotericism}}
{{expand section|date=March 2019}}
In several other religions, knowledge of some esoteric parts of the doctrine or teachings is reserved only for certain members. This has been a feature of [[Tantric Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Catharism]], some parts of [[Shia Islam]], and the [[Druze]] religion. In traditional [[Judaism]], study of much of the mystical tradition of [[Kabbalah]] is reserved for scholars. Esotericism is a strong characteristic of many modern movements such as [[Freemasonry]], [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[Scientology]].
