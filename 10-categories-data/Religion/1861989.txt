'''''{{transl|ar|ALA|Da‘wah}}''''' ({{lang-ar|دعوة}}, [[Help:IPA/Arabic|[ˈdæʕwæh]]] "invitation", also spelt '''''daawa''''', '''''dawah''''', '''''daawah''''' or '''''dakwah''''';<ref>{{cite web|title=Dakwah (Malaysia)|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e480|accessdate=2 November 2018|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kahin|first1=Audrey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcuhCgAAQBAJ|title=Historical Dictionary of Indonesia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780810874565|page=112|language=en}}</ref>) is the act of inviting or calling people to embrace Islam. For certain groups within Islam like the [[Salafi movement|Salafis]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], Dawah is also considered as a political activity. For these groups, the aim of Dawah outreach is also to engineer a reversal of what they perceive as the decline of Islam in the modern era, through the systematic propagation of Islamist ideology and ultimately enable the establishment of an Islamic state.<ref name="Hudson Institute">{{cite web |last= Weidl|first= Nina|date= 14 December 2009|title=Dawa and the Islamist Revival in the West|url=https://www.hudson.org/research/9789-dawa-and-the-islamist-revival-in-the-west|publisher=Hudson Institute|access-date=17 October 2020}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Da‘wah'' {{IPA-ar|ˈdæʕwæh|}} literally means "issuing a summons" or "making an invitation". Grammatically, the word represents a [[gerund]] of a verb with the  [[triconsonantal root]] ''d-ʕ-w'' {{lang|ar|دع&zwnj;و}} meaning variously "to summon" or "to invite". A [[Muslim]] who practices ''da‘wah'', either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[da'i|dā‘ī]]}}'' ({{lang|ar|داعي}}, plural ''{{transl|ar|ALA|du‘āh}}'' {{lang|ar|دعاة}} {{IPA-ar|dʊˈʕæː|}}).

A ''dā‘ī'', is a person who invites people to understand and accept Islam through [[dialogue]] and other techniques, may be regarded{{by whom?|date=November 2018}} as a [[missionary]] inviting people to the faith, prayer and manner of Islamic life.<ref>

== Early Islam ==

The term ''da'wah'' has other senses in the [[Qur'an]]. In ''[[sura]]'' (chapter) 30:25, for example, it denotes the call to the [[Resurrection of the dead|dead to rise]] on the [[Day of Judgment]]. When used in the Qur'an, it generally refers to [[Allah]]'s invitation to live according to His will. Thus, when used in the first centuries of Islam, it usually referred to that message and was sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[Sharia|sharī‘a]]'' and ''[[Deen (Arabic term)|dīn]]''.

''Da‘wah'' is also described as the duty to "actively encourage fellow Muslims in the pursuance of greater piety in all aspects of their lives", a definition which has become central to [[contemporary Islamic thought]].<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Islam">See entry for ''da‘wah'' in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''.</ref>

===Post-Muhammad===
After Muhammad's death in 632, from the available historical evidence, it appears that after Muhammad's death Muslims did not immediately embark upon da'wa activities—during and after the rapid conquests of the Byzantine and Persian lands, they ventured little if at all to preach to local non-Muslims. Da'wa came into wider usage almost a hundred years after Muhammad's death, in the wake of 'Abbasid propaganda against the then ruling Umayyad clan in the 720s. However, the 'Abbasid da'wa ceased as soon as the 'Abbasids were in power—a fact that attests to its political nature. Da'wa as a truly missionary activity, albeit still within the Muslim Umma, appeared in the form of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] da'wa of the 9th through 13th centuries. Isma'ilis, in many ways, can be seen as the pioneers of the organized Muslim missionary activities: their highly institutionalized and sophisticated da'wa structure has hardly been repeated until today. Moreover, for the Isma'ilis, da'wa was a state priority. The Isma'ili da'wa encompassed extra- and intra-ummatic forms and blended both theology and politics.<ref>[Racius, Egdunas. "Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa." Politologija.2 (2005): 91–122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016.]</ref>

The [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Da'i|dāʿīs]] were known to spread the faith and share the daʿwa. Ever since the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] era, the Ismaili Imams would send the dāʿīs to the Indian subcontinent to spread the faith and explain the Path of Truth (''[[Satpanth]]''). When the Ismaili Imams went into hiding following the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol invasions]], the dāʿīs continued the daʿwa, but had to do so secretly, in order to ensure their own safety. This task was one of great responsibility, and was often done through the use of ''[[Ginans|gināns]]'' (sacred literature of the Nizari Ismailis). These ''gināns'' vary in length, ranging from three verses to hundreds of pages, and address various topics, including divine love, cosmology, meditation, ritual practice, eschatology and ethical behavior.  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Virani|first=Shafique|title=Symphony of Gnosis: A Self-Definition of the Ismaili Ginan Literature|url=https://www.academia.edu/36984287|journal=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought|language=en}}</ref>

== Purpose ==

In [[Islamic theology]], the purpose of ''da‘wah'' is to invite people, Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the worship of God as expressed in the Qur'an and the ''[[sunnah]]'' of the [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and to inform them about Muhammad.<ref name="Encyclopaedia of Islam quote">"''Da‘wah'' produces converts to Islam, which in turn [increases] the size of the Muslim ''[[Ummah]]'' [community of Muslims]."</ref>

''Da'wah'' as the "Call towards God" is the means by which Muhammad began spreading the message of the Qur'an to mankind. After Muhammad, his followers and the ''[[Ummah]]'' (Muslim community) assumed responsibility for it.<ref name="The Encyclopaedia of Islam"/> They convey the message of the Qur'an by providing information on why and how the Qur'an preaches [[Tawhid|monotheism]].<ref>See, for example, Qur'an ''[[Ayah|ayat]]'' (verses) 6:19 and 16:36.</ref> Muhammad saw Islam as the true religion and mission of all earlier prophets.  He believed that their call had been limited to their own people but that his was universal. His mission as the final prophet was to repeat to the whole world this call and invitation (dawa) to Islam.  Muhammad wrote to various non-Muslim rulers, inviting them to convert.<ref>[Sookhdeo Patrick, and Murray, Douglas. 2014. Dawa: The Islamic Strategy for Reshaping the Modern World. Isaac Publishing.]</ref>

== Scriptural basis ==


The importance of ''Dawah'' has been emphasised many times in the Quran:

{{Quote| Who is better in speech than one who calls to Allah, does righteous deeds and says indeed I am among the Muslims.|Quran |Sura 41 (HAA-meem-shisdah), ayah 33<ref>{{Cite quran|41|33|t=y|s=ns}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|You are the best nation raised up for humankind. You enjoin righteousness, forbid corruption and you believe in [[Allah]].|Quran |Sura 3 (Al-Imran), ayah 110<ref>{{Cite quran|3|110|t=y|s=ns}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|Let there arise among you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining righteousness and forbidding evil. Those are the successful ones.|Quran |Sura 3 (Al-Imran), ayah 104<ref>{{Cite quran|3|104|t=y|s=ns}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good preaching.|Quran |Sura 16 (An-Nahl), ayah 125<ref>{{Cite quran|16|125|t=y|s=ns}}</ref>}}

In the ''[[Hadith]]'' ("sayings") of [[Muhammad]], ''dawah'' is mentioned to emphasise importance and virtues:

: "Whoever directs someone to do good will gain the same reward as the one who does good."<ref>Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|3}}, {{p.|1050}}, {{no.|4665}}.</ref>
: "Whoever calls to guidance will receive the same reward as the one who follows him without any decrease in the reward of his follower."<ref>Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|1406}}, {{no.|6470}}.</ref>
: "For Allah to guide someone by your hand is better for you than having red camels."<ref>Sahih Al Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{pp.|156|7}}, {{no.|253}}.</ref><br />(In [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|ancient Arabia]], [[camel]]s{{spaced ndash}}especially of a reddish hue{{spaced ndash}}were considered particularly valuable property.)
: "Convey from me, even if it be only a single verse."<ref>Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|442}}, {{no.|667}}.</ref>

[[Muhammad]] sent [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] to [[Yemen]] and told him “You will be going to Christians and Jews, so the first thing you should invite them to is the assertion of the oneness of Allah, Most High. If they realize that, then inform them that Allah has made five daily prayers obligatory on them. If they pray them, then inform them that Allah has made the payment of charity from their wealth obligatory on their rich to be given to their poor. If they accept that, then take it from them and avoid the best part of people's property.”<ref>Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|9}}, {{pp.|348|9}}, {{no.|469}} and Sahih Muslim, {{vol.|1}}, {{pp.|15}}, {{no.|28}}.</ref>

== Methods ==

===Gentleness===
With regard to Muhammad's mild nature in preaching [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] says:
<blockquote>And by the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently. If you were harsh and hardhearted, they would have fled from around you. ({{cite quran|3|159|s=ns|link=no}}).</blockquote>

The Quran says about [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]] who preached to Pharaoh, the claimant of God:
<blockquote>So speak to him, both of you, mildly in order that he may reflect or fear God. ({{cite quran|20|44|s=ns|link=no}}).</blockquote>

Muhammad was reported by his wife, [[Aisha]] to have said “Whenever gentleness is in a thing, it beautifies it, and whenever it is withdrawn from something, it defaces.”<ref>Sahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, p. 1370, no. 6274.</ref>

Muhammad was quoted by Jareer as saying,“One deprived of gentleness is deprived of all good."<ref>Sahih Al-Bukhari, {{vol.|4}}, {{p.|1370}}, {{nos.|6270|6271}}.</ref>

===Influence in politics===
Muslims made it a part of their political theory (through relating da'wa to jihad) and life (using the concept of da'wa in their political agendas). Taken in general, the intertwining of da'wa and politics, then, has been a feature throughout the Muslim history, though practical implications of this have been different in different ages.<ref>Racius, Egdunas. "Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa." Politologija.2 (2005): 91–122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016.</ref>

===Wisdom===
:"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided ...". ({{cite Quran|16|125|s=ns|link=no}}).

A classical example of diversion in ''dawah'' can be seen in the case of Prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]] in prison when two prisoners asked him to interpret their dreams. One of them said: “I saw myself pressing wine.” The other said: “I saw myself carrying bread on my head and birds were eating from it.” They asked: “Inform us of the interpretation of these things. Indeed, we believe you are one of the righteous.” He replied: “Whenever food came to you as your provision, I informed you about it before it came. That is from what my Lord has taught me.... As for one of you, he will pour wine for his lord to drink, and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. This is the case judged concerning which you both inquire.” ({{cite Quran|12|35|end=41|s=ns|link=no}})

===Speaking a common language===
:“I did not send any messenger except that he spoke the language of his people to explain to them.” ({{cite Quran|14|4|s=ns|link=no}})

===Location===
Doing ''dawah'' in the right location. For example, [[Mount Safa]] in the time of Muhammad was used for announcements. So Muhammad went there to make his point. He chose that particular location because he knew the people who he was inviting to [[Islam]]. He knew their nature and characteristics, so he chose Mount Safa. He climbed up to its summit and addressed his people saying: “O people of [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]], if I were to tell you there was an army behind this hill would you listen to me?”<ref>http://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Dawah.pdf</ref>

==Dawah training==
Various Islamic institutions provide elaborate manuals, trainings and workshops to ''da‘i'' to prepare them for successful dawah.

===Dawah manual===
Dawah manuals, booklets or guides are training material that give a framework and methodology for a ''da‘i'' to invite non-Muslims to accept and convert to Islam.<ref name="Message International"/><ref name="iERA"/> The manuals present detailed guidance on how to carry out dialogue, various techniques and detailed steps of implementing dawah for non-muslim individual or collective audiences as well as socio-religious groups like atheists, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus etc.<ref name="MI">{{cite web |last= Sultan|first= Dr. Talat|title=Book Review: Manual of Dawah for Islamic Workers|url=https://messageinternational.org/community/manual_of_dawah_for_islamic_workers/|publisher=The Message International|access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref><ref name="Message International">{{cite web |title=The Methodology of Dawah Manual & Method|url=https://justdawah.org/resources/dawah-manual|publisher=Just Dawah|access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref>

== Movements ==

Modern ''dawah'' movements are varied in their objectives and activities. Examples include:
* The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] has focused on a methodology of building [[grassroots]] institutions and funding welfare projects, which has helped it survive decades of repression under various dictatorships in many Middle Eastern countries, with the group and its many offshoots still enjoying popular support and power.<ref>[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=30044 32,000 Muslim Brothers Detained Under Old Regime Emergency Law].

* [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has focused on presenting Islam as a complete way of life and on the methodology of building [[grassroots]] institutions and funding welfare projects.
* [[Tablighi Jamaat]] works on trying to bring the Muslims back to the fundamental practices of Islam such as worship; they do this by encouraging members to speak and to teach them the virtues of good actions. The movement has a following of between 20 and 80 million people and, though it originated in India, now has a global following.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Timol |first1=Riyaz |title=Structures of Organisation and Loci of Authority in a Glocal Islamic Movement: The Tablighi Jama'at in Britain |journal=Religions |date=14 October 2019 |volume=10 |issue=10 |page=573 |doi=10.3390/rel10100573 |url=https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/10/10/573/htm}}</ref>
* [[Ahmed Deedat]] was a notable debater who was a [[revolutionary]] figure among Muslims for his effort in debating Christian polemics.

==Setting==
Methods may also depend upon specific creeds. For instance, among Ismailis, [[al-Naysaburi]]'s Code of Conduct depicts the values in which dais should spread the word of Islam to Muslims and non-Muslims.<ref>[lemm, Verena, and Walker, Paul E. 2011. Code of Conduct: A Treatise on Etiquette of the Fatimid Ismaili Mission. I.B. Tauris.</ref>  [[Idris Imad al-Din]]'s work presents us with an indigenous account of the traditions of the da'wa in Yaman. His account of the [[Nizari]]–[[Musta'li]] succession dispute reflects the official view of the [[Tayyibis]].<ref>Farah, Caesar E. "The Fatmids and their Successors in Yemen: The History of an Islamic Community." Domes 12.2 (2003): 100. ProQuest.
