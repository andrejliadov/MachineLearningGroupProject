{{Gospel Jesus}}
The '''burial of Jesus''' refers to the burial of the body of [[Jesus]] after crucifixion, described in the [[New Testament]]. According to the [[Gospels|canonical gospel accounts]], he was placed in a [[Tomb of Jesus|tomb]] by a man named [[Joseph of Arimathea]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Kaitholil. com|title=Inside the church of the holy sepulchre in Jerusalem|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfFLc33_B_E|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> In art, it is often called the '''Entombment of Christ'''.

== Biblical accounts ==
[[File:Mosaic - Entombment of Jesus.JPG|thumbnail|Wall mosaic of entombment of Jesus near [[Anointing|Stone of anointing]] at [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].|300px]]
The earliest reference to the burial of Jesus is in a letter of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Writing to the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Corinthians]] around the year 54 AD,<ref>Watson E. Mills, ''Acts and Pauline Writings'', Mercer University Press 1997, page 175.</ref> he refers to the account he had received of the death and resurrection of Jesus ("and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures").<ref>{{bibleref2|1COR|15:3-4|NASB}}</ref>

The four [[canonical gospels]], written between 66 and 95AD, all conclude with an extended narrative of [[Arrest of Jesus|Jesus' arrest]], [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], burial, and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref name=Powell>Powell, Mark A. ''Introducing the New Testament''. Baker Academic, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8010-2868-7}}</ref>{{rp|p.91}}  All four state that, on the evening of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], [[Joseph of Arimathea]] asked Pilate for the body, and, after [[Pilate]] granted his request, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and [[Descent from the Cross|laid it]] in a [[Tomb of Jesus|tomb]].

Modern scholarship emphasizes contrasting the gospel accounts, and finds the Mark portrayal more probable.<ref name="Hare" /><ref>[[Maurice Casey]], ''Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching'' (Continuum, 2010) page 449.</ref>

=== Gospel of Mark ===
In the [[Markan priority|earliest of the gospels]], the Gospel of Mark, was written around the years 50 to 70,{{sfnp|Witherington|2001|p=31|ps=: 'from 66 to 70, and probably closer to the latter'}}{{sfnp|Hooker|1991|p=8|ps=: 'the Gospel is usually dated between AD 65 and 75.'}} Joseph of Arimathea is a member of the Jewish Council – the [[Sanhedrin]] which had condemned Jesus – who wishes to ensure that the corpse is buried in accordance with Jewish law, according to which dead bodies could not be left exposed overnight. He puts the body in a new shroud and lays it in a tomb carved into the rock.<ref name="Hare">Douglas R. A. Hare, ''Mark'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996) page 220.</ref> The Jewish historian [[Josephus]], writing later in the century, described how the Jews regarded this law as so important that even the bodies of crucified criminals would be taken down and buried before sunset.<ref>James F. McGrath, "Burial of Jesus. II. Christianity. B. Modern Europe and America" in ''The Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception. Vol.4'', ed. by Dale C. Allison Jr., Volker Leppin, Choon-Leong Seow, Hermann Spieckermann, Barry Dov Walfish, and Eric Ziolkowski, (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2012), p. 923</ref> In this account, Joseph does only the bare minimum needed for observance of the law, wrapping the body in a cloth, with no mention in the Book of Mark about washing or anointing it. This may explain why Mark has a story prior to the Crucifixion, in which a woman pours perfume over Jesus ({{bibleverse|Mark|14:3-9|KJV}}): Jesus is thereby prepared for burial even before his death.<ref>McGrath, 2012, p.937</ref>

=== Gospel of Matthew ===
The [[Gospel of Matthew]] was written around the years 50 to 70, presumably using the Gospel of Mark as a source.{{sfnp|Harrington|1991|p=8}} In this account Joseph of Arimathea is not referenced as a member of the Sanhedrin, but a wealthy disciple of Jesus.<ref>Daniel J. Harrington, The Gospel of Matthew (Liturgical Press, 1991) page 406.</ref><ref name="Donald Senior 1990 page 151">Donald Senior, ''The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew'' (Liturgical Press, 1990) page 151.</ref> Many interpreters have read this as a subtle orientation by the author towards wealthy supporters,<ref name="Donald Senior 1990 page 151" /> while others believe this is a fulfillment of prophecy from Isaiah 53:9: <blockquote>"And they made his grave with the wicked, And with the rich his tomb; Although he had done no violence, Neither was any deceit in his mouth."</blockquote> This version suggests a more honourable burial: Joseph wraps the body in a clean shroud and places it in his own tomb, and the word used is ''soma'' (body) rather than ''ptoma'' (corpse).<ref>Donald Senior, ''The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew'' (Liturgical Press, 1990) page 151-2.</ref> The author adds that the Roman authorities "made the tomb secure by putting a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] on the stone and posting the guard."

=== Gospel of Luke ===
The Gospel of Mark is also a source for the account given in the [[Gospel of Luke]], written around the year 60-61.{{sfnp|Davies|2004|p=xii}} As in the Markan version, Joseph is described as a member of the Sanhedrin,<ref>N. T. Wright, ''Luke For Everyone'' (Westminster John Knox Press), page 286.</ref> but as not having agreed with the Sanhedrin's decision regarding Jesus; he is said to have been "waiting for the kingdom of God" rather than a disciple of Jesus.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:50-55|NKJV}}</ref>

=== Gospel of John ===
The last of the gospels, John was written around the years 80 to 90, and it differs from Mark on this point, depicting Joseph as a disciple who gives Jesus an honourable burial. John says that Joseph was assisted in the burial process by [[Nicodemus]], who brought a mixture of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]] and included these spices in the burial cloth according to Jewish customs.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

== Theological significance ==
[[Paul the Apostle]] includes the burial in his statement of the gospel in [[1 Corinthians 15#Verses 3–7|verses 3 and 4]] of [[1 Corinthians 15]]: "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures" ([[KJV]]). This appears to be an early pre-Pauline [[creed|credal statement]].<ref>[[Hans Conzelmann]], ''1 Corinthians'', translated James W. Leitch (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1969), 251.</ref>

The burial of Christ is specifically mentioned in the [[Apostles' Creed]], where it says that Jesus was "[[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], dead, and buried." The [[Heidelberg Catechism]] asks "Why was he buried?" and gives the answer "His burial testified that He had really died."<ref>[http://www.wts.edu/resources/creeds/heidelberg.html Heidelberg Catechism], Q & A 41.</ref>
[[File:Gotland-Dalhem Kyrka Glasmalerei 12.jpg|thumb|230px|A 13th century version of the Entombment of Christ in [[stained-glass]]]]

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that, "It is the mystery of [[Holy Saturday]], when Christ, lying in the tomb, reveals God's great sabbath rest after the fulfillment of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe" and that "Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his [[wiktionary:passible|passible]] state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today."<ref>[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], [https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p122a4p3.htm 624-625] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225102202/https://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p122a4p3.htm |date=December 25, 2010 }}.</ref>

== Depiction in art ==
{{Death of Jesus}}

The Entombment of Christ has been a popular subject in art, being developed in Western Europe in the 10th century. It appears in cycles of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', where it follows the [[Deposition of Christ]] or the [[Lamentation of Christ]]. Since the Renaissance, it has sometimes been combined or conflated with one of these.<ref>G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'',1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.164 ff, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}</ref>
