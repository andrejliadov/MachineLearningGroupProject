'''Adelophagi''' (from the Greek terms ἄδηλος ''adelos'' "secretly," and φάγω ''phago'' "I eat") were a sect mentioned by the anonymous author known as [[Praedestinatus]]. They believed that a Christian ought to conceal himself from other men to take his [[nourishment]], imagining that thus he imitated the [[Prophet]]s. Members cited 1 Kings 13:8-9 <ref>1 Kings 13:8-9 (NKGV) But the man of God said to the king, "If you were to give me half of your house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. For so it was commanded my by the word of the LORD, saying, 'You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the same way you came.'"</ref> and Ezekiel 24:17 <ref>Ezekiel 24:17 (NKJV) Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips, and do not eat man's bread of sorrow.</ref> as inspiration for their belief; it is unclear whether they excluded everyone or only members of other sects.  [[Philastrius]] suggests that they also rejected the [[divinity]] of the [[Holy Ghost]]. They seem to have flourished in the latter part of the fourth century, circa 350 AD.<ref>[http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=A&word=ADELOPHAGI ''Christian Cyclopedia'' page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502090354/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=A&word=ADELOPHAGI |date=May 2, 2005 }}</ref>
