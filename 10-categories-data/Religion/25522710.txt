{{short description|Ethnic identification of the traditional Christian community of Egypt.}}
{{Copts}}

[[Copts]] have a long history as a significant [[Christianity|Christian]] minority in [[Egypt]], in which Muslim adherents form the majority. Coptic Christians lost their majority status in Egypt after the 14th century and the spread of Islam in the entirety of North Africa.

The question of Coptic identity was never raised before the rise of pan-Arabism under [[Nasser]] in the early 1950s. Copts  viewed themselves as only Coptic Christians without any Arabic identity sentiment that gather 22 Arabic speaking countries.<ref name="Deighton, H. S 1946 p. 519">Deighton, H. S. "The Arab Middle East and the Modern World", International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519.</ref> With the rise of pan-Arabism and wars in the region, many Egyptians accepted an Arab identity, but this shift in identity was less prevalent among Copts than among Muslims. Thus, the emergence of Pan-Arabism served to  exacerbate the ethnic and religious difference between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Egypt.

== Copts as Egyptians ==

In [[Greek and Roman Egypt (disambiguation)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], the term Copt designated the local population of [[Egypt]], as opposed to the [[elite|elite group]] of foreign rulers and settlers (Greeks, Romans, etc.) who came to Egypt from other regions and established [[empire|prominent empires]].

The word ''Copt'' was then adopted in English in the 17th century, from [[New Latin]] ''Coptus, Cophtus'', which is derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] collective ''{{transl|ar|qubṭ, qibṭ}}'' {{lang|ar| قبط }} "the Copts" with ''[[Arabic grammar#Nisba|nisba]]'' adjective {{transl|ar|''qubṭī, qibṭī''}} {{lang|ar| قبطي}}, plural {{transl|ar|''aqbāṭ''}} {{lang|ar| أقباط}}; Also ''quftī, qiftī'', Arabic /f/ representing historical Coptic /p/. an Arabisation of the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word ''kubti'' ([[Coptic language#Bohairic|Bohairic]]) and/or ''kuptaion'' ([[Coptic language#Sahidic|Sahidic]]). The Coptic word is in turn an adaptation of the Greek {{lang|grc|Αἰγύπτιος}} "Egyptian".

After the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the term ''Copt'' became restricted to those Egyptians who remained adhering to the Christian religion.<ref>"The people of Egypt before the Arab conquest in the 7th century identified themselves and their language in Greek as Aigyptios (Arabic qibt, Westernized as Copt); when Egyptian Muslims later ceased to call themselves Aigyptioi, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian minority." [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026216 Coptic Orthodox Church]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. 2007</ref>

In their own [[Coptic language]], which represents the final stage of the [[Egyptian language]], the Copts referred to themselves as ''rem en kēme'' (Sahidic) <span style="font-size:140%;"><span lang="cop-Copt" style="font-size:100%;font-family:'Arial Coptic', 'New Athena Unicode', 'MPH 2B Damase', 'Quivira', 'Analecta';">ⲣⲙⲛⲕⲏⲙⲉ</span></span>, ''lem en kēmi'' ([[Coptic language#Fayyumic|Fayyumic]]), ''rem en khēmi'' (Bohairic) <span style="font-size:140%;"><span lang="cop-Copt" style="font-size:100%;font-family:'Arial Coptic', 'New Athena Unicode', 'MPH 2B Damase', 'Quivira', 'Analecta';">ⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ</span></span>, which literally means "people of Egypt" or "Egyptians"; cf. [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|rmṯ n [[Km (hieroglyph)|kmt]]}}'', [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''{{lang|egy-Latn|rmt n kmỉ}}''.

Copts take particular pride in their Egyptian identity. Over the centuries, they have always rejected and fought against other identities that foreign rulers attempted to force upon them, stressing their own Egyptian identity.<ref name="Werthmuller, Kurt J 1250">Werthmuller, Kurt J. Coptic Identity and Ayyubid Politics in Egypt 1218–1250. American University in Cairo Press. 2009</ref> While an integral part of their society, Copts remained culturally and religiously distinct from their surroundings.

== Egyptian Liberal Age ==
{{Main|Egypt's Liberal Experiment|Liberalism in Egypt}}
Egypt's struggle for independence from both the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was marked by secular [[Egyptian nationalism]], also referred to as [[Pharaonism]]. When the Egyptian nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]] met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, stressing that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.<ref>Makropoulou, Ifigenia. [http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html Pan – Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism? Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002224756/http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html |date=October 2, 2018 }}</ref> Egyptian nationalism rose to prominence in the 1920s and 1930s. It looked to Egypt's pre-[[Islamic]] past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger [[Mediterranean]] civilization. This ideology stressed the role of the [[Nile River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre- and inter-war periods. There was no place for an Arab component in the Egyptian personality at that time, and Egyptians had no Arab orientation as they saw themselves as Egyptians first and foremost, regardless of religion.<ref>Jankowski, James. "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism" in Rashid Khalidi, ed. ''The Origins of Arab Nationalism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, pp. 244–45</ref> Foreigners visiting Egypt noted that Egyptians did not possess any Arab sentiment in the first half of the 20th century. As one Arab nationalist of the time put it "Egyptians did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation." <ref>Syrian Arab nationalist [[Sati' al-Husri]] qtd in Dawisha, Adeed. ''Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century''. Princeton University Press. 2003, p. 99</ref>

== Rise of Arab nationalism ==

Arab nationalism began to gain grounds in Egypt in the 1940s following efforts by Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese intellectuals.<ref>Jankowski, "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism," p. 246</ref> Nevertheless, by the end of the 1940s and even after the establishment of the [[Arab League]], historian H. S. Deighton was still writing that "Egyptians are not Arabs, and both they and the Arabs are aware of this fact".<ref name="Deighton, H. S 1946 p. 519" />

It was not until the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] era starting in the 1950s – more than a decade later – that Arab nationalism, and by extension [[Arab socialism]], became a state policy imposed on the Egyptians by the new dictatorship. Under Nasser, Egypt united with [[Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]] in 1958, then became known as the ''Arab'' Republic of Egypt in 1961. The Egyptians' attachment to Arabism, however, was particularly questioned after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.<ref>Dawisha, p. 237</ref> Nasser's successor [[Anwar Al Sadat|Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with [[Israel]], revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. The terms "Arab", "Arabism" and "Arab unity", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.<ref>Dawisha, pp. 264–65, 267</ref> (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Egyptian Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Egyptian Republic]].)

== Copts and Arab identity ==

While some non-Coptic authors claim that Copts in Egypt have an Arab identity while Copts in the West tend to identify as "non-Arab",<ref name=Abrahamp231>{{cite book|title=Arab Detroit: from margin to mainstream|first1=Nabeel|last1=Abraham|first2=Andrew|last2=Shryock|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8143-2812-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5cw3WKvVt4MC&pg=PA9&dq=coptic+%22arab+identity%22&lr=&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=8#v=onepage&q=coptic&f=false 9]|title-link=Arab Detroit: from margin to mainstream}}</ref><ref name=Henderson>{{cite journal|title=The Egyptian Coptic Christians: the conflict between identity and equality|author=Randall P.

Rather, they are the people who lived in Egypt before the Arabs arrived. The [[pharaoh]]s were Copts, as were [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius]] and [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]]."</ref><ref>Washington Post: Copts are not Arabs. January 4, 1994</ref>

Additionally, almost all statements issued by Copts decry Arab nationalism. With their strong attachment to their own country, Copts have been always suspicious of Arabism, Arab socialism and pan-Arabism. They viewed Arabs as invaders and foreigners, and glorified the struggles of their ancestors against the Arab invaders between the 7th and the 9th centuries AD. Indubitably, the struggle against these foreign ideologies centered around the [[Coptic language]]:

{{cquote|The [[Coptic language]] provides a Copt with an identity that spells out an impressive commentary upon the character of such person. It exemplifies in him an unyielding spirit that was tried and came out victorious. A spirit that had to endure endless attempts by those that ruled Egypt for the past 2300 years to replace such language with that of their own. If such was achieved then they can subject the Copts to cultural and religious slavery that would forever made them subservient to such foreign rulers. It was attempted first by the [[Greeks]], through their Hellenizing approach. Then it was continued along the same principles by the successive Arab and Muslim dynasties that ruled Egypt since the 7th century AD. The significance of such character can also inspire the Coptic youth to fight off the many harmful pressures, whether in spirit or in body, that are facing them in this turbulent Society of ours.<ref name="stshenouda.com" />}}

In addition, some Copts resisted Arab nationalism by stressing their pre-Arab identity. They saw themselves as the direct descendants of the [[Ancient Egyptians]], and their [[Coptic language|language]] as a bridge linking the Copts to their Ancient Egyptian roots and their civilization that span over 6000 years.<ref name="stshenouda.com">[http://www.stshenouda.com/coptlang/coptval.htm Takla, Hany. The Value of Coptic, The Ecclesiastical and Coptic Principles. Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite Society for Coptic Studies. 02/10/1996]</ref>

The strongest statement regarding Coptic identity came in 2008 from a prominent Coptic bishop, namely Bishop Thomas of [[Cusae]] and [[Meir, Egypt|Meir]], who gave the following speech at the [[Hudson Institute]]:

{{cquote|What makes a person change the identity of his own nation and shift the focus of his identity from Egypt to become "the Arabs", even though ethnically he/she is the same person? The Copts have been always focused on Egypt; it's our identity, it's our nation, it's our land, it's our language, it's our culture. But when some of the Egyptians converted to [[Islam]], their focus changed away from looking to their own [language and culture]. They started to look to the [[Arabian]]s, and [[Arabia]] became their main focus. So the focus here has changed and they would no longer be called "Copts". ''If you come to a Coptic person and tell him that he's an Arab, that's offensive''. ''We are not Arabs, we are Egyptians''. I am very happy to be an Egyptian and I would not accept being "Arab" because ethnically I am not. I speak Arabic. Politically now, I am part of a country that was Arabized and politically I belong to an Arabic country but that doesn't make a person Arab. If a person believes he is an Arab, his main focus is the pan-Arab area, and he no longer belongs to the Egyptian nation. You are either in or out; either you belong or you don't. And this is a big dilemma that is happening for the Copts who kept their [[Christianity]], or rather their identity as Egyptians with their own culture, and who are trying to keep the language, the music, and the calendar of the Copts. That means that the culture of Ancient Egypt is still carried on. A process of [[Arabization]] has been ongoing in this country for many centuries, since the 7th century. At the same time [[Islamization]] as well is a dilemma that started and is still carrying a lot of the problems. [...] So when we hear the word "Copt", that doesn't only mean "Christian", it means "Egyptian".}}

{{cquote|What makes an Egyptian become a Copt, and an Egyptian not become a Copt? Simply, this is the shift that has happened in Egypt since the [[Arab invasion of Egypt]]. Today when you look at a Copt, you don't see only a Christian, but you see an Egyptian who is trying to keep his identity versus another imported identity that is working on him. And that means if these two processes are still actively working till now, it has never stopped because Egypt has not yet in its own mind become completely Islamized or Arabized. That means the process [of Arabization] is still ongoing... You can't study the [[Coptic language]], the native language of the land, in any public school in Egypt. That's not allowed, although we can teach in our public schools any other language. You have a lot of schools that teach English, French, German, Spanish and Greek, but never Coptic. Why? Because that clashes with the process of Arabization. And this is a very dangerous attitude. The cultural heritage of Egypt has been taken away. [Thus], the Copts suddenly felt that they have a responsibility to carry on their own culture and continue it and to fight for it. Yes, we are still fighting very much for our strong heritage of Egypt because we love our heritage and we want to keep it. And that means that if you try to teach your language in a public school, that would not be the right way to do it, so that means that the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church]] will carry the responsibility to take in this heritage and work with it, keeping it in a very good nursery till the time would come when openness and good thinking would occur, when this country will come back to its own roots and lift it up. But, until then we have to keep it in a nursery, in a church. We don't want to keep it in, we don't want to isolate it, but we cannot throw it away so nobody will take care of it. That's why we keep it. This is not withdrawal. We could say that this is keeping the heritage in a nursery till the time comes when it will be open and serve the entire Egyptian community. So the word "Copt" here is not only religious, but it has cultural import.<ref>Bishop Thomas of [[Cusae]] and [[Meir, Egypt|Meir]]. Egypt's Coptic Christians: The Experience of the Middle East's largest Christian community during a time of rising Islamization. July 18, 2008</ref>}}

Bishop Thomas' words gained widespread approval within the Coptic community. One other Coptic bishop, namely Bishop Picenti of [[Helwan]] and [[Massarah]] commented on the issue saying:
{{cquote|If one reconsiders Bishop Thomas' words, they can discover that he was not wrong. He said that ''Copts of Egypt are not of Arab origin but rather of Pharaonic origin'', and this is correct because it is the truth and history. We are Coptic Egyptians. We are Pharaonic Copts. Coptic meaning ancient Egyptian who then [[religious conversion|converted]] to [[christianity]]. Copt, is essentially another term for Coptic christians.<ref>Ranya Badawi. An interview with Bishop Pecenti of Helwan and Massarah. El-Masry El-Yom Newspaper. November 11, 2009</ref>}}

Other prominent Coptic figures who supported Bishop Thomas' statement included the Coptic writer [[Magdi Khalil|Magdy Khalil]] who wrote in [[Al-Dustour (Egypt)|el-Dostoor]] newspaper:
{{cquote|''We [the Copts] are Egyptians, and we are not Arabs'', with all due respect to the Arabs. We may live in some sort of cultural Arabism and we may speak Arabic, but we are not Arabs. This is a historical fact, whether some people like it or not. Copts both within Egypt and in the diaspora are insulted and accused because they insist on holding strongly to and taking pride in their national Egyptian identity, rather than having another identity that crosses the borders [of Egypt]. The Copts focus their identity on Egypt's geographical borders, which are deeply rooted in history.
