The '''Ahdname of Milodraž''' ({{lang-sh|Milodraška ahdnama}}/Милодрашка ахднама), also called the '''Ahdname of Fojnica''' (Фојничка ахднама/''Fojnička ahdnama''), was the ''[[ahdname]]'' issued on 28 May 1463 (or 1464) by the Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] to [[Bosnian Franciscans]], represented by [[Anđeo Zvizdović]].

== Tradition and history ==
According to Bosnian Franciscan tradition, Mehmed was preparing to depart following the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia]] when Anđeo Zvizdović came to meet him in the Ottoman military camp in [[Milodraž]].<ref name="Andrić"/> Led in by Mehmed's soldiers,<ref name="Andrić"/> Zvizdović drew the Sultan's attention to the exodus of Catholics from the newly conquered country.<ref name="Džaja"/> The friar specifically pointed to the necessity of maintaining the merchants, craftsmen and miners, and so succeeded in receiving Mehmed's solemn promise of [[religious tolerance]].<ref name="Džaja">{{Cite book|last=Džaja|first=Srećko|title=Katoličanstvo u Bosni i Hercegovini od Kulina bana do austro-ugarske okupacije|work=Croatica Christiana Periodica|volume=16|date=30 November 1992|pages=167–168|isbn=|ref=harv|language=Serbo-Croatian}}</ref> The Franciscans of [[Bosna Argentina]] recognized Mehmed as their sovereign, and in return he promised that "the Bosnian priests shall have freedom and protection, and may return to and settle the lands in the Empire in their monasteries without consternation. No-one is to attack them, nor threaten their lives, property or churches."<ref name=Velikonja>{{Cite book|last=Velikonja|first=Mitija|title=Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2003|pages=79|isbn=1603447245|ref=harv|language=}}</ref> Its form and content, as well as Mehmed's personal oath, resemble that of an [[international treaty]].<ref name="Krleža"/>

The rights expressed in the Ahdname of Milodraž were reiterated by all subsequent [[Ottoman sultans]], but the Franciscans were nevertheless in a difficult position with the local authorities. Although they were loyal to the Ottoman regime, the local government often suspected them of aiding the Catholic [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], the Ottoman Empire's greatest enemy.<ref name=Velikonja/> Bosnian Franciscans used the Ahdname of Milodraž not only in relations with the Muslim authorities, but also to protect themselves from the ambitions of [[Eastern Orthodox]] clergy when the latter claimed the right to collect tax from them too on the basis of an earlier ''[[firman]]''.<ref name="Andrić">{{Cite book|last=Andrić|first=Ivo|author-link=Ivo Andrić|title=The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia under the Influence of Turkish Rule|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1990|pages=42|isbn=0822382555|ref=harv|language=}}</ref> The Ahdname of Milodraž is often said to have enabled the survival of [[Roman Catholicism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="Krleža"/>

== Historicity ==
The Ahdname of Milodraž has been preserved in transcripts; an ''ahdname'' was likely also issued to the Franciscans of [[Srebrenica]] in 1462, but it has been entirely lost.<ref name="Džaja"/><ref name="Krleža">{{Cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=924|title=Ahdnama|work=Croatian Encyclopaedia|publisher=Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|year=|isbn=|ref=harv|language=Serbo-Croatian}}</ref> The absence of the original document led some historians to describe the Ahdname of Milodraž as a forgery. Its historicity was only confirmed in the mid-20th century.<ref name="Džaja"/>
