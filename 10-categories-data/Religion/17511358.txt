The Agasha Temple of Wisdom is a spiritualist group founded in 1943 by Richard Zenor.[1] After the publication of James Crenshaw's book Telephone Between Two Worlds in 1950, in which both Zenor and the temple were prominently featured, the temple became more popular. Upon Zenor's death in 1978, Geary Salvat was chosen to lead the group. 
According to the Agasha Temple of Wisdom official website, the spiritualist group has a distinctive set of teachings and values as follows.
They believe reincarnation is a necessity instead of a luxury and karma is very much in effect throughout one’s life. 
 The goal is to “do unto others as you would have them done unto you.”  The intelligence of each individual is infinite, and no individual is singular meaning we are part of all there is.  
 In order to be cleansed in this spiritual group, you must know the laws of energy, the aurathic fields of power, the soul aura and the manifestation of life.
 Life is ever present and should be looked on in front of yourself. 
Above all things, The Agasha Temple of Wisdom encourages the acceptance and love for one’s self void of ego no matter what stage one is in. 
Like other spiritualist groups, the Agasha Temple of Wisdom has rules that each disciple follows according to their official website as follows.
Followers shall strive to learn to be that which they are. They will endeavor to understand all experiences they have yet to experience.  
“They are, so that all will be.” 
 They shall learn that there is no peace that lies in tomorrow that is not here today. They vow to be the pure color of all my collective experience and they shall call that their light, and that light of purest white shall shine as a beacon for all to see.
 
This spiritualist group has a complex history. According to the beliefs of members, The Agasha Temple of Wisdom is an organization that teaches the philosophy of their self proclaimed age-old study of truth called the Universal Understanding of the God Consciousness. It was officially founded in 1943 in Los Angeles, California.  As told by the religion’s advocates however, the Agasha Temple of Wisdom claims to date back its origin to seven thousand years ago in a land called Austa (Egypt today) where individuals from 37 different sects or tribes all came together to study and practice this philosophy of the Universal God Consciousness. 
These individuals claim to have “understood the laws of the universe and were aware that the world was about to transition from an enlightened period to a darkened age.”  It is believed that the accomplishments and wisdom that the human consciousness had reached on the physical plane would be lost for several thousand years. The leaders of these 37 sects, some of them great masters on the physical plane, are told to have held what is known as the Grand Convention. Members say that they discussed the preservation of the knowledge they had obtained and a method to protect this wisdom for future generations. They are believed to have conceived the idea of an organization that would bring this Universal God Consciousness back to the physical plane and awaken those who were seeking the truth. 
They say to have known it would be about 7,000 years before the physical plane would again reach a state of enlightenment when this information could be disseminated. 

These leaders claimed to be faced with the difficulty of knowing that their language would be lost and their alphabet of symbols, referred to today as hieroglyphics, would not be discernible. As a result, they would need to devise a more direct method of communication. Different masters volunteered to be stationed at different times in upcoming history to bring forth wisdom and foretell of prophecies. Master Agasha was the first leader to step forward and suggest that he be the one to lay a foundation from which all other teachers would build. And, it is in his honor that the Agasha Temple of Wisdom was named.
Like Christianity has the Bible, The Agasha Temple of Wisdom has a book that they follow called the ''Telephone Between Two Worlds'' written by James Crenshaw. In this book, these spiritualists claim that they have direct evidence of such communications in the spirit messages they have received through mediums.  In summary, Crenshaw addresses the issue of "life beyond physical existence" that is still pertinent today.  He speaks to skeptics and believers alike of the progress made to the scientific and philosophical level in the world beyond that of physical sight. The nature of that world and its meaning in terms of our everyday existence are explained by the Master Teachers of the Agasha Temple of Wisdom through the instrumentality of Rev. Richard Zenor.
