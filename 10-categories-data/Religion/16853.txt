The '''''Kitáb-i-Aqdas''''' is the central book of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] written by [[Baháʼu'lláh]], the founder of the religion, in 1873.<ref>Saiedi, 2000, pp. 224-235.</ref> Though it is the main source of Baháʼí laws and practices, much of the content deals with other matters, like foundational principles of the religion, the establishment of Baháʼí institutions, mysticism, ethics, social principles, and prophecies. In Baha'i literature it is described as "the Mother-Book" of the Baháʼí teachings, and the "Charter of the future world civilization".<ref>{{Harvnb|Effendi|1944|pp=213}}</ref> 

Baháʼu'lláh had manuscript copies sent to Baháʼís in Iran some years after its writing in 1873, and in 1890–91 (1308 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], 47 [[Baha'i calendar|BE]]) he arranged for its first publication in Bombay, India. Parts of the text were translated to English by Shoghi Effendi, which, along with a ''Synopsis and Codification'' were published in 1973 by the [[Universal House of Justice]] at the centennial anniversary of its writing. The full authoritative English translation, along with clarifying texts from Baháʼu'lláh and detailed explanatory notes from the Universal House of Justice, was first published in 1992. 

The work was written in Arabic under the Arabic title '''''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Kitāb al-Aqdas}}''''' ({{lang-ar|الكتاب الأقدس}}), but in English it is commonly known by its Persian pronunciation ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'', and is subtitled with the translation of "the Most Holy Book". The word ''Aqdas'' is a superlative form derived from the [[Semitic root|triconsonantal root]] [[Q-D-Š]], denoting holiness or sanctity in [[Semitic languages]].

== Overview ==

Rather than a narrative, the book is written as a series of short teachings or principles. A summary lends itself to a bullet-point list of the various ideas shared throughout the text. Main themes cover the appointment of Baháʼu'lláh's successor, who remains unnamed in the text; the layout of the future Baháʼí administration, including the mention of the [[Universal House of Justice]] and allusions to what would later be known as the [[Shoghi Effendi|Guardian]]; certain laws, particularly around prayer, fasting, marriage, divorce, and inheritance; admonitions toward certain individuals; and a variety of specific laws, ordinances, and prohibitions, ranging from tithes, to the Baháʼí calendar, to prohibitions on opium, slave trading, and gossip. 

Besides the main themes above, the ''Synopsis and Codification'' lists the last of six themes as "Miscellaneous Subjects" and lists 33 topics:
#The transcendent character of the Bahá'í Revelation
#The exalted station of the Author of the Faith
#The supreme importance of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, "The Most Holy Book"
#The doctrine of the "Most Great Infallibility"
#The twin duties of recognition of the Manifestation and observance of His Laws, and their inseparability
#The end of all learning is the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge
#The blessedness of those who have recognized the fundamental verity "He shall not be asked of His doings"
#The revolutionizing effect of the "Most Great Order"
#The selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use: one of two signs of the maturity of the human race
#Prophecies of the Báb regarding "He Whom God will make manifest"
#Prediction relating to opposition to the Faith
#Eulogy of the king who will profess the Faith and arise to serve it

== Form and style ==

The text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas consists of several hundred verses, which have been grouped in 189 numbered paragraphs in the English translation most of which are just a few sentences.<ref name="JLR19-2">{{cite journal |last=Danesh |first=Roshan |title=Internationalism and Divine Law: A Baháʼí Perspective |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=209–242 |year=2003–2004 |jstor=3649175 |doi=10.2307/3649175}}</ref> The style combines elements of both [[Arabic poetry|poetry]] (''shi'r'') and [[rhymed prose]] (''saj{{'}}'') and the text contains instances of [[literary devices]] like [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtaposition]] and [[antithesis]], [[metaphor]]s, [[Narration#Narrative point of view#Alternating person|alternation of person]] and [[personification]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bushrui|1994|pp=39–53}}</ref>

It is written to the individual reader, as there are no [[clergy]] in the religion. The text also moves between statements said to be plain and statements suggesting the key to understanding the book is to look at the text for clues to itself.<ref name="JLR19-2"/>

== Content ==

The ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' is supplemented by the 
*"Questions and Answers"', which consists of 107 questions submitted to Baháʼu'lláh by [[Zaynu'l-Muqarrabin]] concerning the application of the laws and Baháʼu'lláh's replies to those questions
*"Some Texts Revealed by Baháʼu'lláh"
*''Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances'', prepared by [[Shoghi Effendi]]
*explanatory notes prepared by the [[Universal House of Justice]]

The book was divided into six main themes in the ''Synopsis and Codification'' by Shoghi Effendi:
#The appointment of [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] as the successor of Baháʼu'lláh
#Anticipation of the Institution of the [[Guardian (Baháʼí Faith)|Guardianship]]
#The Institution of the Universal House of Justice
#Laws, Ordinances and exhortations
#Specific admonitions, reproofs and warnings
#Miscellaneous subjects

Further, the laws were divided into four categories:
:A. Prayer
:B. Fasting
:C. Laws of personal status
:D. Miscellaneous laws, ordinances and exhortations

===Themes===
Scholarly review finds the Aqdas has themes of laws of worship, societal relations and administrative organization, or governance, of the religion.<ref name="JLR19-2"/> Through the authority vested in [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] in the Aqdas there is an expanse of [[Cosmopolitanism|internationalism]] related to the law in works like ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' and through his extended authority to [[Shoghi Effendi]] works like his ''[[World Order of Baháʼu'lláh]]'' further elaborates on the internationalism theme. This stands in some distinction from other scriptures by not using triumphal tones as the voice of God is given to be viewed but rather one of progressive development, social context, and outright delay in application until another day. Indeed, it insists that divine law is applicable only in situations with requisite conditions, where it is likely to have certain social effects. The goal of application of the law and its methods are not to cause disturbance and dissension and requires an appreciation for context and intention. Additionally one is to eschew emphasis in the development of [[textualist]] and [[intentionalist]] arguments about the law though some of this is visible in scholarship on the Aqdas. Such methods of application of law in a religious context are, in the opinion of Roshan Danish, common in Islam and Judaism.<ref name="JLR19-2"/>

The Aqdas is understood by Baháʼís to be a factor in the process of ongoing developments in world order. This can be seen comparing the Baháʼí approach to history and the future to that of the theory of the [[Clash of Civilizations]] on the one hand and the development of a [[posthegemony]] system on the other (compared with work of Robert Cox, for example, in ''Approaches to World Order'', (Robert Cox & Timonthy Sinclair eds, Cambridge University Press, 1996).)<ref name="JLR19-2"/>

Certain possible sources of law are specifically abrogated: laws of the Bábí religion, notably in the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', oral traditions (linked with [[Baháʼí literature#Authenticity and authority|pilgrim notes]], and natural law, (that is to say God's sovereign will through revelation is the independent authority.)<ref name="JLR18-3"/> Divine revelation's law-making is both unconditioned in terms of the divine right to choose, and conditioned in the sense of the progress of history from one revelation to the next.<ref name="JLR19-2"/><ref name="JLR18-3"/>

====Laws of personal status====

=====Marriage and divorce=====
{{main|Baháʼí marriage}}
Baha'u'llah's statements about marriage in the ''Kitáb-i-Aqdas'' are brief. Marriage is highly recommended but is stated to not be obligatory.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith |title=marriage |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/232 232–234] |url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/232}}</ref> Baháʼu'lláh states that the maximum number of wives is two, but also states that having only one wife would add more tranquility to both partners.<ref name="polygamy">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith |title=Polygamy |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/273 273] |url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/273}}</ref> These statements were later interpreted by [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] that having a second wife is conditional upon treating both wives with justice and equality and was not possible in practice, thus establishing monogamy.<ref name="polygamy"/><ref name="Cambridge205">{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Smith (historian) |year=2008 |title=An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86251-6 |location=Cambridge |page=205}}</ref><ref name="JLR18-m">{{cite journal |last=Schaefer |first=Udo |title=An Introduction to Baha'i Law: Doctrinal Foundations, Principles and Structures |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321, 333 |year=2002–2003 |jstor=1602268 |doi=10.2307/1602268}}</ref>

That [[Baháʼu'lláh]] had three wives,<ref name="polygamy"/><ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=16}}</ref> while his religion teaches monogamy, which has been the subject of criticism. The writing of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and Baháʼí teachings on gender equality and monogamy post-date Baháʼu'lláh's marriages and are understood to be evolutionary in nature, slowly leading Baháʼís away from what had been a deeply rooted cultural practice.<ref name="polygamy"/><ref name="JLR18-m"/>

====Administration====
{{main|Baháʼí administration}}
The institutional status of the authority of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and a House of Justice are specifically delineated.<ref name="JLR19-2"/><ref name="JLR18-3"/> On the basis of the authority granted ʻAbdu'l-Bahá he extended forms of the authority vested in him to the Guardianship, whose sole member was Shoghi Effendi, and the Universal, or International, House of Justice through his [[Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]]. This was confirmed and amplified in other texts, notably the [[Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh#Kit.C3.A1b-i-.60Ahd|Kitáb-i-'Ahd]]. The Universal House of Justice is specifically empowered to write and rescind any laws it is felt necessary aside from those of the text of scripture and actual application of the laws of the Aqdas among Baháʼís are dependent on the choice of the Universal House of Justice.<ref name="JLR18-3"/>
