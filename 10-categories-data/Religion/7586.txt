The '''Christadelphians''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|r|ɪ|s|t|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|f|i|ən|z}}; or '''Christadelphianism''') are a [[Restorationism|restorationistic]] and [[millenarian]] [[Christianity|Christian]] group who hold a view of [[Biblical Unitarianism]]. There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/christadelphians_1.shtml|title=BBC – Religions – Christianity: Christadelphians|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> The movement developed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[North America]] in the 19th century around the teachings of [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]], who coined the name ''Christadelphian''<ref name="BRWname">"The Christadelphians, or brethren in Christ ...

Claiming to base their beliefs solely on the [[Bible]], Christadelphians differ from mainstream [[Christianity]] in a number of doctrinal areas. For example, they reject the [[Trinity]] and the [[immortality of the soul]], believing these to be corruptions of original Christian teaching. They were initially found predominantly in the developed English-speaking world, but expanded in developing countries after the Second World War. Congregations are traditionally referred to as "ecclesias".

== History ==

=== 19th century ===

Christadelphianism traces its origins to [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]] (1805–1871), who emigrated to North America from England in 1832.<ref name="ch3">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html |title=Dr Thomas: His Life and Work. Chapter 3: Emigration to America |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  Following a near shipwreck he vowed to find out the truth about [[human existence|life]] and God through personal [[Bible study (Christian)|Biblical study]].<ref name="ch3"/> Initially he sought to avoid the kind of [[sectarianism]] he had seen in England. In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging [[Restoration Movement]] in the United States at the time. This movement sought a reform based upon the [[Sola scriptura|Bible alone]] as a sufficient guide and rejected all [[creed]]s. However, this liberality eventually led to dissent as John Thomas developed his personal beliefs and began to question mainstream orthodox Christian beliefs.  While the Restoration Movement accepted Thomas's right to have his own beliefs, when he started preaching that they were essential to [[salvation]], it led to a fierce series of debates with a notable [[leadership|leader]] of the movement, [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]].  John Thomas believed that scripture, as God's word, did not support a multiplicity of differing beliefs, and challenged the leaders to continue with the process of restoring 1st-century Christian beliefs and correct interpretation through a process of debate.  The history of this process appears in the book ''Dr. Thomas, His Life and Work'' (1873) by a Christadelphian, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]].<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/Bereans/Cornerstones/Pioneers/Life/toc.html |title=Dr Thomas: His Life and Work |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>

During this period of formulating his ideas John Thomas was [[baptism|baptised]] twice, the second time after renouncing the beliefs he previously held. He based his new position on a new appreciation for the reign of Christ on [[David]]'s throne.<ref>
{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/faith_in_last_days/fld_014.html |title=Faith In The Last Days |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> The abjuration of his former beliefs eventually led to the Restoration Movement disfellowshipping him when he toured England and they became aware of his abjuration in the United States of America.
{{wikisource|Elpis Israel}}
The Christadelphian community in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] effectively dates from Thomas's first lecturing tour (May 1848 – October 1850). His message was particularly welcomed in [[Scotland]], and [[Campbellite]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] friends separated to form groups of "Baptised Believers". Two thirds of ecclesias, and members, in Britain before 1864 were in Scotland.<ref>Wilson, AB op cit</ref><ref>Evans, Christmas. The Christadelphian 1956–63
</ref><ref>Norrie, William "Early History of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God in Britain" Earlston 1904. Available [http://www.christadelphianresearch.com/theearlyhistorynorrie.htm online]
</ref> In 1849, during his tour of Britain, he completed (a decade and a half before the name ''Christadelphian'' was conceived) ''[[Elpis Israel]]''<ref>
John Thomas, ''Elpis Israel: an exposition of the Kingdom of God with reference to the time of the end and the age to come'' (London: 1849). Available [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Elpis_Israel online]</ref> in which he laid out his understanding of the main doctrines of the Bible. Since his medium for bringing change was print and debate, it was natural for the origins of the Christadelphian body to be associated with books and journals, such as Thomas's ''Herald of the Kingdom''.
[[Image:John_Thomas.png|left|thumb|150px|John Thomas]]

In his desire to seek to establish Biblical truth and test orthodox Christian beliefs through independent scriptural study he was not alone. Among other churches, he had links with the [[Adventism|Adventist]] movement and with [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] (who later set up the [[Church of the Blessed Hope|Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith]] in the 1860s). In terms of his rejection of the trinity, Thomas's views had certain similarities with [[Unitarianism]] which had developed in a formal way in Europe in the 16th century (although he formally described both Unitarianism and [[Socinianism]] as "works of the devil" for their failure to develop his doctrine of God-manifestation).<ref>Thomas, J. (1869). Phanerosis: An Exposition of the Doctrine of the Old and New Testaments, concerning the Manifestation of the Invisible Eternal God in Human Nature. Birmingham: published by Robert Roberts, p. 11.</ref><ref>See [[History of Unitarianism]]</ref>

Although the Christadelphian movement originated through the activities of John Thomas, he never saw himself as making his own disciples. He believed rather that he had rediscovered 1st century beliefs from the Bible alone,<ref>
'The Lecturer [John Thomas] commenced by denying a statement which had appeared in many of the London and country newspapers, and amongst them, one made by a religious Editor in this town, to the effect that he assumed to himself the true, infallible, prophetic character, as one sent from God, ''verbatim''. He would appeal to his writings – and he had written a great deal in twelve years – and to his speeches, whether he had ever claimed to be such, in the remotest degree whatever. He believed truth as it was taught in the scriptures of truth...' {{cite news

</ref> and sought to prove that through a process of challenge and debate and writing journals. Through that process a number of people became convinced and set up various fellowships that had sympathy with that position. Groups associated with John Thomas met under various names, including Believers, Baptised Believers, the Royal Association of Believers, Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God, Nazarines (or Nazarenes), and The Antipas<ref name = "anrvrv"/> until the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). At that time, church affiliation was required in the United States and in the [[Confederate States of America]] in order to register for [[conscientious objector]] status, and in 1864 Thomas chose for registration purposes the name ''Christadelphian''.<ref name="BRWname"/><ref name="StrongName"/><ref name="ourname"/><ref name="LippyName"/>

Through the teaching of John Thomas and the need in the American Civil War for a name, the Christadelphians emerged as a denomination, but they were formed into a lasting structure through a passionate follower of Thomas's interpretation of the Bible, [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]]. In 1864, he began to publish ''The Ambassador of the Coming Age'' magazine. John Thomas, out of concern that someone else might start a publication and call it ''The Christadelphian'', urged Robert Roberts to change the name of his magazine to ''[[The Christadelphian]]'',<ref>Bryan R. Wilson, ''Sects and Society'' (London: William Heinemann, 1961), p. 241</ref><ref>
''The Christadelphian'' is published by The Christadelphian Magazine & Publishing Association Ltd (Birmingham, UK)
</ref> which he did in 1869. His editorship of the magazine continued with some assistance until his death in 1898. In church matters, Roberts was prominent in the period following the death of John Thomas in 1871, and helped craft the structures of the Christadelphian body.<ref>. Andrew Wilson writes of Roberts that "The organising ability of Robert Roberts was very important: he gave the movement its rules, institutions and much of its literature". Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p.399.</ref>

Initially, the denomination grew in the English-speaking world, particularly in the [[English Midlands]] and in parts of North America.{{which|date=October 2013}} In the early days after the death of John Thomas, the group could have moved in a number of directions. Doctrinal issues arose, debates took place, and statements of faith were created and amended as other issues arose. These attempts were felt necessary by many{{according to whom|date=October 2013}} to both settle and define a doctrinal stance for the newly emerging denomination and to keep out error. As a result of these debates, several groups separated from the main body of Christadelphians, most notably the Suffolk Street fellowship (with members believing that the whole of the Bible wasn’t inspired) and the Unamended fellowship.

=== 20th century ===
The Christadelphian position on conscientious objection came to the fore with the introduction of conscription during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Varying degrees of exemption from military service were granted to Christadelphians in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. In the Second World War, this frequently required the person seeking exemption to undertake civilian work under the direction of the authorities.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Christadelphians in Britain assisted in the [[Kindertransport]], helping to relocate several hundred Jewish children away from Nazi persecution by founding a hostel, [[Elpis Lodge]], for that purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kinderball piano score |publisher=Imperial War Museum |url=http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127013116/http://london.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.1463 |archive-date=27 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Morrell | first=Leslie | title=The Christadelphian Response to the Holocaust | url=http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-02-08 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227081848/http://lesliemorrell.com/papers/Response.pdf | archive-date=2008-02-27 }}</ref> In Germany, the small Christadelphian community founded by [[Albert Maier]] went underground from 1940–1945, and a leading brother, [[Albert Merz]], was imprisoned as a conscientious objector and later executed.<ref>April 1941 in Berlin.Bogner, Gustav. Geschichte der Christadelphians in Deutschland (2) http://www.projekt-glauben.de/?p=205{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

After the Second World War, moves were taken to try to reunite various of the earlier divisions. By the end of the 1950s, most Christadelphians had united into one community, but there are still a number of small groups of Christadelphians who remain separate.

=== Today ===
The post-war and post-reunions periods saw an increase in co-operation and interaction between ecclesias, resulting in the establishment of a number of week-long Bible schools and the formation of national and international organisations such as the Christadelphian Bible Mission<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbm.org.uk/history/ |title=History |publisher=Christadelphian Bible Mission UK |accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref> (for preaching and pastoral support overseas), the Christadelphian Support Network<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chsn.org.uk/about|title=About |publisher=Christadelphian Support Network|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref> (for counselling), and the [[Meal-a-Day Fund|Christadelphian Meal-A-Day Fund]] (for charity and humanitarian work).

The period following the reunions was accompanied by expansion in the developing world, which now accounts for around 40% of Christadelphians.<ref>Based on figures from ''CBM Worldwide Guide 2006'', Christadelphian Bible Mission (UK), 2006</ref>

== Beliefs ==
Due to the way the Christadelphian body is organised there is no central authority to establish and maintain a standardised set of beliefs and it depends upon what statement of faith is adhered to and how liberal the ecclesia is, but there are core doctrines most Christadelphians would accept. In the formal statements of faith a more complete list is found; for instance the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith has 30 doctrines to be accepted and 35 to be rejected.

=== The Bible ===
Christadelphians state that their beliefs<ref>See, e.g., the ''[http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith]''</ref> are based wholly on the [[Bible]],<ref>[http://www.thechristadelphians.org.uk/about-us/ About us]</ref> and they do not see other works as inspired by [[God]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Bull  | first =Mike| title =The Bible—The Word of God | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_bible.htm | isbn =81-87409-52-5 }}</ref> They regard the Bible as inspired by God and, therefore, believe that in its original form, it is error-free apart from errors in later copies due to errors of transcription or translation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphia.org/basf.htm |title=The Christadelphian Statement of Faith |publisher=Christadelphia.org |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> Based on this, Christadelphians teach what they believe as true Bible teaching.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz |title=True Bible Teaching Home |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711165259/http://www.truebibleteaching.co.nz/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truebibleteaching.com/teaching/12-the-bible-our-guide.html |title=True Bible Teaching Teaching |publisher=Truebibleteaching.com |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref>

=== God ===
Christadelphians believe that God is the creator of all things and the father of true believers,<ref>{{cite book | last =Drabbenstott | first =Mark| title =God Our Father | publisher =Printland Publishers | year=2000 | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_father.htm | isbn =81-87409-64-9}}</ref> that he is a separate being from his son, [[Jesus]] Christ,<ref name="trinity1">{{cite book | last =Flint | first =James |author2=Deb Flint | title =One God or a Trinity? | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_onegod.htm | isbn =81-87409-61-4}}</ref><ref name="jesus">{{cite book|title=Jesus: God the Son or Son of God? |publisher=CMPA |location=Birmingham, UK |url=https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/jesus-god-the-son-or-son-of-god/}}</ref> and that the [[Holy Spirit#Christadelphians|Holy Spirit]] is the power of God used in creation and for [[Salvation#Salvation|salvation]].<ref name="spirit">{{cite book | last =Tennant| first =Harry | title =The Holy Spirit—Bible Understanding of God's Power | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/holysprt.htm }}</ref> They also believe that the phrase ''Holy Spirit'' sometimes refers to God's character/mind, depending on the context in which the phrase appears,<ref name="trinity2">{{cite book|last=Broughton |first=James H. |author2=Peter J Southgate |title=The Trinity: True or False? |publisher=The Dawn Book Supply |location=UK |url=http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118003323/http://www.biblelight.org/trin/trinind.htm |archive-date=18 November 2011 }}</ref> but reject the view that people need strength, guidance and power from the Holy Spirit to live the Christian life,<ref>{{cite book | last =Whittaker | first =Edward | last2 =Carr| first2 =Reg | title ='Spirit' in the New Testament| publisher =The Testimony }}, p. 117,132,145</ref> believing instead that the spirit a believer needs within themselves is the mind/character of God, which is developed in a believer by their reading of the Bible (which, they believe, contains words God gave by his Spirit) and trying to live by what it says during the events of their lives which God uses to help shape their character.<ref>{{cite book | last =Pearce| first =Graham | title =The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit Gifts| publisher =Logos | url =http://www.antipas.org/books/holy_spirit_pearce/hsp_toc.html }}, p. 27-29.

Now Paul says that the ''sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation, by the faith'' (or gospel) ''which is through Jesus Christ''. What more do we want than wisdom in relation to this matter? If the sacred Scriptures are able to make us wise, we need no other instrumentality. The Holy Spirit by the word, without infusing a single idea into it more than it actually and ordinarily contains, and without any collateral influence, teaches us all wisdom and knowledge that is necessary ...'

=== Jesus ===
Christadelphians believe that Jesus is the promised Jewish [[Messiah]], in whom the prophecies and promises of the [[Old Testament]] find their fulfilment.<ref name="jesus"/><ref name="zilmer">{{cite book | last =Zilmer| first =Paul | title =Who is Jesus? | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_jesus.htm | isbn =81-87409-68-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Tennant| first =Harry| title =Christ in the Old Testament: Israel's True Messiah | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/christ-in-the-old-testament/ }}</ref> They believe he is the [[Son of Man]], in that he inherited human nature (with its inclination to sin) from his mother, and the [[Son of God]] by virtue of his miraculous conception by the power of God.

=== Devil ===
Christadelphians believe that the [[Satan]] or Devil is not an independent spiritual being or [[fallen angel]]. ''Devil'' is viewed as the general principle of evil and inclination to sin which resides in humankind. They believe that, dependent on the context, the term ''HaSatan'' in Hebrew merely means "opponent"  or "adversary" and is frequently applied to human beings. Accordingly, they do not define [[Hell]] as a place of eternal torment for sinners, but as a State of Eternal Death; respectively, non-existence due to [[Annihilationism|annihilation]] of body and mind.<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_delp.htm ''About the Christadelphians: 1848 to now.'']</ref>

=== Salvation ===
Christadelphians believe that people are separated from God because of their sins but that humankind can be reconciled to him by becoming disciples of Jesus Christ.<ref>{{cite book| last=Watkins| first=Peter | title =The Cross of Christ| publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/cross.htm }}</ref><ref name="salvation">{{cite book | last =Flint| first=James|author2=Deb Flint | title =Salvation | publisher =Printland Publishers | location =Hyderabad | url =http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/p_salvation.htm}}</ref> This is by belief in the gospel, through [[repentance]], and through [[baptism]] by total immersion in water.<ref name="salvation"/><ref name="baptism">{{cite book|title=Why Baptism Really Matters: What must we do to be saved? |publisher=CMPA |location=Birmingham, UK |url=https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/why-baptism-really-matters/ }}</ref> They reject [[assurance of salvation]], believing instead that salvation comes as a result of remaining "in Christ". After death, believers are in a state of [[Psychopannychism|non-existence]], knowing nothing until the [[Resurrection]] at the return of Christ.<ref>{{cite book|title=After Death – What? |publisher=CMPA |location=Birmingham, UK |url=https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/after-death-what }}</ref> Following the judgement at that time, the accepted receive the gift of [[immortality]], and live with Christ on a restored Earth, assisting him to establish the [[Kingdom of God]] and to rule over the mortal population for a thousand years (the [[Millennialism|Millennium]]).<ref>{{cite book| title =Resurrection & Judgement | publisher =CMPA | location =Birmingham, UK | url =https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/resurrection-judgement/}}</ref> Christadelphians believe that the Kingdom will be centred upon Israel, but Jesus Christ will also reign over all the other nations on the earth.<ref>{{cite book|last=M. |title=Israel: God's People, God's Land |publisher=CMPA |location=Birmingham, UK |url=https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/israel/ }}</ref> Some unorthodox Christadelphians believe that the Kingdom itself is not worldwide but limited to the land of Israel promised to Abraham and ruled over in the past by David, with a worldwide empire.<ref>See ''What is the true Gospel?'', available [http://www.gospeltruth.info/gospel.htm online]</ref>

=== Life in Christ ===
{{wikisource|The Commandments of Christ}}The historic ''[[wikisource:the Commandments of Christ|Commandments of Christ]]'' demonstrates the community's recognition of the importance of Biblical teaching on morality. Marriage and family life are important. Christadelphians believe that sexual relationships should be limited to heterosexual marriage, ideally between baptised believers.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Christian Life: Marriage—"Only in the Lord" |url=http://www.bibleed.com/bibleteachings/christianlife/marriage.asp |accessdate=2008-04-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427021425/http://www.bibleed.com/bibleteachings/christianlife/marriage.asp |archive-date=2008-04-27 }}</ref><ref>''Homosexuality and the Church: Bible Answers to Moral Questions'' (Birmingham: Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association).

== Organisation ==

=== General organisation ===
In the absence of centralised organisation, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice. This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organised [[wiktionary:autonomous|autonomously]], typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Many avoid the word "church" due to its association with mainstream Christianity, and its focus on the building as opposed to the congregation. Most ecclesias have a constitution,<ref>Example: [http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/constitution.htm Constitution of the Birmingham Christadelphian Ecclesia, Midland Institute] c.1932-onwards</ref> which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalised list of 'The Commandments of Christ'.<ref>This list as published by [[The Christadelphian Magazine]] contains 53 paraphrases of Bible verses which were originally read weekly as part of the service at Temperance Hall ecclesia. Other versions, of unconfirmed origin, exist with the list expanded to 100 including some verses justifying division.</ref> With no central authority, individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is seen by many as useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of consultation, mediation, and discussion, with disfellowship (similar to [[excommunication]]) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 32, 35–36</ref>

The relative uniformity of organisation and practice is undoubtedly due to the influence of a booklet, written early in Christadelphian history by Robert Roberts, called ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias''.<ref name="online">Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883). Available [http://www.antipas.org/books/ecclesial_guide/1883guide_toc.html online]</ref> It recommends a basically democratic arrangement by which congregational members elect 'brothers' to arranging and serving duties,<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 17–27</ref> and includes guidelines for the organisation of committees, as well as conflict resolution between congregational members and between congregations.<ref>Robert Roberts, ''A Guide to the Formation and Conduct of Christadelphian Ecclesias'' (Birmingham: 1883), Sections 35–38, 41–42</ref> Christadelphians do not have paid [[minister of religion|ministers]]. Male members (and increasingly female in some places) are assessed by the congregation for their eligibility to teach and perform other duties, which are usually assigned on a rotation basis, as opposed to having a permanently appointed preacher. Congregational governance typically follows a [[democracy|democratic]] model, with an elected arranging committee for each individual ecclesia. This unpaid committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the ecclesia and is answerable to the rest of the ecclesia's members.

Inter-ecclesial organisations co-ordinate the running of, among other things, Christadelphian schools<ref>For example: Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Cooranbong)|Heritage College, Cooranbong]] and Christadelphian [[Heritage College (Sydney)|Heritage College Sydney]], Kemps Creek.</ref> and elderly care homes, the [[Christadelphian Isolation League]] (which cares for those prevented by distance or infirmity from attending an ecclesia regularly) and the publication of [[:Category:Christadelphian magazines|Christadelphian magazines]].

=== Fellowships ===
The Christadelphian body consists of a number of ''fellowships'' – groups of ecclesias which associate with one another, often to the exclusion of ecclesias outside their group. They are to some degree localised. The Unamended Fellowship, for example, exists only in North America. Christadelphian fellowships have often been named after ecclesias or magazines who took a lead in developing a particular stance.

The majority of Christadelphians today belong to what is commonly known as the ''Central Fellowship''.<ref name="Birmingham 1933, p. 376">The first use of the term "Birmingham (Central) fellowship" in ''The Christadelphian'' magazine was in volume 70, 1933, p. 376.</ref> The term "Central" came into use around 1933 to identify ecclesias worldwide who were in fellowship with the Birmingham (Central) Ecclesia. These were previously known as the "Temperance Hall Fellowship". The "Suffolk Street Fellowship" arose in 1885 over disagreements surrounding the inspiration of the Bible. Meanwhile in Australia, division concerning the nature of Jesus Christ resulted in the formation of the "Shield Fellowship". Discussions in 1957-1958 resulted in a worldwide reunion between the majority Christadelphians of the "Temperance Hall Fellowship" and the minority "Suffolk Street Fellowship", closely followed in Australia by the minority "Shield Fellowship".

The ''[[Unamended Christadelphians|Unamended Fellowship]]'', consisting of around 1,850 members, is found in the East Coast and Midwest USA and Ontario, Canada.<ref>Verified figure, Ecclesial Directory 2006. Parts of grouping currently involved in unity talks with Central.</ref> This group separated in 1898 as a result of differing views on who would be raised to judgement at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgement will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptised believers.<ref>The Sydney Ecclesia, Australia had already "disfellowshipped" 10 members for denying this in 1883. The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, ecclesial news p.90 and editorial comment p.382</ref> The majority in England, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly. Those who opposed the amendment became known as the "Unamended Fellowship" and allowed the teaching that God either could not or would not raise those who had no covenant relationship with him. Opinions vary as to what the established position was on this subject prior to the controversy.<ref>For example: [https://archive.today/20130102170350/http://www.genusa.com/Truth/UnamendedErrors.html Website] claiming views held by Amended community were original Christadelphian beliefs Versus [http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515083019/http://www.republic-christadelphians.org/Unamended.html |date=2008-05-15 }} claiming views held by Unamended community were original Christadelphian beliefs.</ref> Prominent in the formation of the Unamended Fellowship was [[Thomas Williams (Christadelphian)|Thomas Williams]], editor of the Christadelphian Advocate magazine. The majority of the Unamended Fellowship outside North America joined the Suffolk Street fellowship before its eventual incorporation into Central fellowship. There is also some co-operation between the Central (Amended) and Unamended Fellowships in North America – most recently in the Great Lakes region, where numerous Amended and Unamended ecclesias are working together to unify their ecclesias. The "Central Fellowship" in North America is still often referred to today as the ''[[Amended Christadelphians|Amended Fellowship]]''.

The ''[[Berean Christadelphians|Berean Fellowship]]'' was formed in 1923 as a result of varying views on military service in England, and on the atonement in North America. The majority of the North American Bereans re-joined the main body of Christadelphians in 1952. A number continue as a separate community, numbering around 200 in Texas, 100 in Kenya and 30 in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bereanecclesialnews.com/|title=The Berean Ecclesial News|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> Most of the divisions still in existence within the Christadelphian community today stem from further divisions of the ''Berean'' ''Fellowship''.<ref>Phillips, Jim, ''The Berean Christadelphians: Why the Bereans?''

The stricter party formed the Dawn Fellowship who, following re-union on the basis of unity of belief with the Lightstand Fellowship in Australia in 2007 increased in number.<ref>The Dawn Christadelphian Magazine, January 2008</ref> There are now thought to be around 800 members in England, Australia, Canada, India, Jamaica, Poland, the Philippines, Russia and Kenya.<ref>Estimate undergoing review.

The ''Old Paths Fellowship''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospeltruth.info |title=Old Paths Fellowship (Australia) |publisher=Gospeltruth.info |accessdate=2010-03-15}}<br />{{*}}{{cite web|url=http://www.christadelphians.co.uk |title=Old Paths Fellowship (UK) |publisher=Christadelphians.co.uk |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> was formed in 1957 in response to the reunion of the Temperance Hall (Central) and Suffolk Street fellowships. A minority from the Temperance Hall (Central) fellowship held that the reasons for separation remained and that full unity of belief on all fundamental principles of Bible teaching was necessary; thus reunion was only possible with the full agreement and understanding of all members rather than a decision by majority vote. Ecclesias forming the Old Paths Fellowship arose in England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada numbering around 500 members in total. They now number around 250 members in total. They maintain that they hold to the original Central Fellowship position held prior to the 1957 Reunion.

Other fellowships (ranging in numbers from as few as 10 to over 200 members) include the ''Watchman Fellowship'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphian-watchman-fellowship.org |title=Christadelphian Watchman Fellowship |publisher=Christadelphian-watchman-fellowship.org}}</ref> the ''Companion Fellowship''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://companionchristadelphians.com/ |title=Companion Christadelphians |publisher=Companion Christadelphians |accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref> and the ''Pioneer Fellowship''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pioneerchristadelphians.org |title=Pioneer Christadelphians | publisher=Pioneer Christadelphians |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>

According to [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]], functionally the definition of a "fellowship" within Christadelphian history has been mutual or unilateral exclusion of groupings of ecclesias from the breaking of bread.<ref>See Wilson op.cit.</ref> This functional definition still holds true in North America, where the Unamended Fellowship and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith are not received by most North American [[Amended Christadelphians|Amended]] ecclesias. But outside North America this functional definition no longer holds. Many articles and books on the doctrine and practice of fellowship now reject the notion itself of separate "fellowships" among those who recognise the same baptism, viewing such separations as schismatic.<ref>[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/oates-pearce-1957-booklet-fellowship-and-withdrawal.doc Oates & Pearce ''Fellowship and Withdrawal'' (doc)] 1957<br />{{*}}[http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/whittaker_fellowship_1973.doc H.A.

Within the Central fellowship individual ecclesias also may have their own statement of faith, whilst still accepting the statement of faith of the larger community. Some ecclesias have statements around their positions, especially on divorce and re-marriage, making clear that offence would be caused by anyone in that position seeking to join them at the 'Breaking of Bread' service. Others tolerate a degree of divergence from commonly held Christadelphian views. While some communities of Christadelphian origin have viewed previous statements of faith as set in stone, others have felt it necessary to revise them in order to meet contemporary issues, update language or add supporting Biblical quotations.

For each fellowship, anyone who publicly assents to the doctrines described in the statement and is in good standing in their "home ecclesia" is generally welcome to participate in the activities of any other ecclesia.

===Related groups===
There are a number of groups who, while sharing a common heritage and many Christadelphian teachings, have adopted alternative names in order to dissociate themselves from what they believe to be false teachings and/or practice within the main Christadelphian body. Ranging in size from two or three members in size to around 50, each group restricts fellowship to its own members. These include the Nazarene Fellowship,<ref>[http://www.nazarenefellowship.co.uk/ The Nazarene Fellowship]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> the Ecclesia of Christ, the Remnant of Christ's Ecclesia,<ref>[http://www.remnantofchristsecclesia.com The Remnant of Christ's Ecclesia]</ref> the Apostolic Fellowship of Christ <ref>[https://theapostolicfellowshipofchrist.com/ The Apostolic Fellowship of Christ]</ref> and the Apostolic Ecclesia.<ref>[http://www.bible-truth.co.uk/ The Apostolic Ecclesia]</ref>

===Other historical groups and individuals with some shared doctrines===
{{See also|Baptist successionism}}
One criticism of the Christadelphian movement has been over the claim of John Thomas and Robert Roberts to have "re-discovered" scriptural truth.<ref>Christendom Astray, Robert Roberts, written 1862, Lecture 1: 'Do you mean to say, asks the incredulous enquirer, that the Bible has been studied by men of learning for eighteen centuries without being understood?  and that the thousands of ministers set apart for the very purpose of ministering in its holy pages are all mistaken?'  (He then goes on to suggest that social conditioning, self interest by the clergy and an incomplete reformation prevented its rediscovery.)</ref><ref>In an article 'A Glance at The History and Mystery of Christadelphianism', a contemporary of John Thomas, David King, from the Restoration Movement 1881, argues that a complete losing of truth would have been unlikely.  Available [http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~pdover/histmyst.htm online]</ref> However one might argue that ''all'' [[Protestant]] groups make the same claims to some extent. Although both men believed that they had "recovered" the true doctrines for themselves and contemporaries, they also believed there had always existed a group of true believers throughout the ages, albeit marred by the apostasy.<ref>'An arrangement of this sort was absolutely necessary for '''the preservation and protection of the One Body, witnessing for the truth''' against "the worshipping of the daemonials and idols", in the midst of the nations, and "before the God of the earth;" the weapons of whose warfare were civil disabilities, and the infernal tortures of anti-heretical crusaders and inquisitions.', John Thomas, 'Eureka' (1915 edition), volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.1</ref><ref>''''Thus, the history of the ages and the generations of the unmeasured Court is in strict harmony with this prophecy of the witnesses'''. For a period considerably over a thousand years after Rome renounced its old gods for the ghosts, dry bones, and fables of the catholic superstition, '''the Spirit had provided himself with Two Witnessing Classes, to whose custody he providentially committed the truth''', and its judicial vindication by fire and sword.', John Thomas, 'Eureka', volume 2, chapter 11, section 2.2</ref><ref>'Though the apostles died, their work continued, '''and the generation of believers that went to the grave with them were succeeded by other believers who maintained the integral structure of the temple of God, founded in Europe'''. True, the work was marred and corrupted by the apostasy of the mass: '''still, a real work—a real temple, existed, consisting of the remnant of true believers preserved by God as His witnesses in the midst of the prevailing corruption'''.', Robert Roberts, 'Thirteen Lectures On The Apocalypse' (4th edition 1921), page 98</ref>

The most notable Christadelphian attempts to find a continuity of those with doctrinal similarities since that point have been geographer [[Alan Eyre]]'s two books ''The Protesters''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/protesters/prot_toc.html|title=The Protesters Contents|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> (1975) and ''Brethren in Christ''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antipas.org/books/brethren_in_christ/binc_toc.html |title=Brethren In Christ Contents Contents |publisher=Antipas.org |date=2012-10-07 |accessdate=2013-06-26}}</ref> (1982) in which he shows that many individual Christadelphian doctrines had been previously believed.  Eyre focused in particular on the [[Radical Reformation]], and also among the [[Socinians]] and other early [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and the [[English Dissenters]]. In this way, Eyre was able to demonstrate substantial historical precedents for individual Christadelphian teachings and practices, and believed that the Christadelphian community was the 'inheritor of a noble tradition, by which elements of the Truth were from century to century hammered out on the anvil of controversy, affliction and even anguish'.<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8">Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 8 (1975)</ref>  Although noting in the introduction to 'The Protestors' that 'Some recorded herein perhaps did not have "all the truth" — so the writer has been reminded',<ref name="Alan Eyre page 8"/> Eyre nevertheless claimed that the purpose of the work was to 'tell how a number of little-known individuals, groups and religious communities strove to preserve or revive the original Christianity of apostolic times',<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', page 11 (1975)</ref> and that 'In faith and outlook they were far closer to the early springing shoots of first-century Christianity and the penetrating spiritual challenge of Jesus himself than much that has passed for the religion of the Nazarene in the last nineteen centuries'.<ref>Alan Eyre, 'The Protestors', pages 11–12 (1975)</ref>

Eyre's research has been criticized by some of his Christadelphian peers,<ref>E.g., both of Eyre's works were criticized by Ruth McHaffie 'Finding Founders and Facing Facts' (2001), in which evidence was presented suggesting that Eyre had misread a number of his sources, and that some his claims could not be supported from (and were often contradicted by) the available historical evidence. Also see James Andrews, ''Ferenc Dávid and the search for Bible truth in Transylvania''</ref> and as a result Christadelphian commentary on the subject has subsequently been more cautious and circumspect, with caveats being issued concerning Eyre's claims,<ref>'But some, though having neither time nor opportunity to search archives, knew enough to realise that the claims were exaggerated, however praiseworthy the intention. Moreover, misgivings increased as the years passed and when members examined the subject more closely for themselves. As explained in the November 1993 issue of The Endeavour Magazine, Brother Ron Coleman in 1986, when preparing an address for the Oxford ecclesia to commemorate the 450th anniversary of William Tyndale's death, not only sought information from ''The Protesters'' but also from Tyndale's own writings. He was surprised to find serious misrepresentations in our community's publication.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts' (2001), page 8</ref><ref>'In 1989 when an article by Brother Alan appeared in The Christadelphian containing a number of inaccuracies on the hymn writer Isaac Watts, editor of The Christadelphian, and subsequently corresponded with Alan in the manner which becomes Brethren.  Scholarly evidence to disprove Ron's criticisms was not forthcoming with regard to either Tyndale or Watts, and the editor was requested to publish a short note of amendment on both writers, but there appears to have been no response.', Ruth McHaffie, 'Finding Founders And Facing Facts', (2001), page 8</ref> and the two books less used and publicised than in previous years.

Organised worship in England for those whose beliefs anticipated those of Christadelphians only truly became possible in 1779 when the [[Act of Toleration 1689]] was amended to permit denial of the Trinity, and only fully when property penalties were removed in the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]]. This is only 35 years before John Thomas' 1849 lecture tour in Britain which attracted significant support from an existing [[non-Trinitarian]] [[Adventism|Adventist]] base, particularly, initially, in Scotland where [[Arian]], [[Socinian]], and unitarian (with a small 'u' as distinct from the Unitarian Church of [[Theophilus Lindsey]]) views were prevalent.

== Practices and worship ==

Christadelphians are organised into local congregations, that commonly call themselves ''ecclesias'',<ref>[https://www.thechristadelphian.com/resources/read-booklets-online/who-are-the-christadelphians/ Who are the Christadelphians?]</ref> which is taken from usage in the New Testament<ref>e.g. see Greek of Acts 5:11; 7:38</ref> and is Greek for ''gathering of those summoned''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ecclesia |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=3 February 2009 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/177746/Ecclesia }}</ref> Congregational worship, which usually takes place on Sunday, centres on the remembrance of the death and celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by the taking part in the "memorial service". Additional meetings are often organised for worship, prayer, preaching and Bible study.

Ecclesias are typically involved in preaching the gospel ([[evangelism]]) in the form of public lectures on Bible teaching,<ref>Examples of lecture titles on [http://www.handsworth-cdelph.co.uk/ Handsworth Christadelphians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515213738/http://www.handsworth-cdelph.co.uk/ |date=2008-05-15 }} website</ref> college-style seminars on reading the Bible,<ref>For example: [http://www.biblecourse.f9.co.uk/ Learn to Read the Bible Effectively]</ref> and Bible Reading Groups. Correspondence courses<ref>For example: [https://www.thisisyourbible.com/courses This is Your Bible]</ref> are also used widely, particularly in areas where there is no established Christadelphian presence. Some ecclesias, organisations or individuals also preach through other media like video,<ref>For example: Williamsburgh Christadelphian Foundation (WCF) [https://wcfoundation.org/videos videos], and the Christadelphians of Southern California's [http://thisisyourbible.org/video.asp videos].</ref> podcasts<ref>For example: [http://www.searchforhope.org/podcasts Search for Hope] podcasts.</ref> and internet forums.<ref>For example: [http://www.btdf.org/forums/ Bible Truth Discussion Forum]</ref> There are also a number of Bible Education/Learning Centres around the world.<ref>For example, the [[Solihull]] [http://www.biblelearningcentre.org Bible Learning Centre]  (UK); [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] [http://www.castlehillbec.org.au/ Bible Education Centre], [[Sydney]] (Aus.); [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] [http://bibleeducationcenter.org/ Bible Education Center], [[Champaign County, Illinois]] (USA); [[Durban]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1NXKf0yrM Bible Education Centre] (SA).

Only baptised (by complete immersion in water) believers are considered members of the ecclesia. Ordinarily, baptism follows someone making a "good confession" (cf. 1 Tim. 6:12) of their faith before two or three nominated elders of the ecclesia they are seeking to join. The good confession has to demonstrate a basic understanding of the main elements – "first principles" – of the faith of the community. The children of members are encouraged to attend Christadelphian [[Sunday school]]s and youth groups. Interaction between youth from different ecclesias is encouraged through regional and national youth gatherings, conferences and camping holidays.

Christadelphians understand the Bible to teach that male and female believers are equal in God's sight, and also that there is a distinction between the roles of male and female members.<ref>{{Citation

They do, however: participate in other ecclesial and inter-ecclesial committees; participate in discussions; teach children in Sunday schools as well as at home, teach other women and non-members; perform music; discuss and vote on business matters; and engage in the majority of other activities. Generally, at formal ecclesial and inter-ecclesial meetings the women wear head coverings when there are acts of worship and prayer.

There are ecclesially-accountable committees for co-ordinated [[evangelism|preaching]], youth and Sunday school work, [[conscientious objection]] issues, care of the elderly, and humanitarian work. These do not have any legislative authority, and are wholly dependent upon ecclesial support. Ecclesias in an area may regularly hold joint activities combining youth groups, fellowship, preaching, and Bible study.

Christadelphians refuse to participate in any military (and police forces) because they are conscientious objectors<ref name="gospelandstrife">{{cite book | last =Norris | first =Alfred | title =The Gospel and Strife | publisher =Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/norris_gospelandstrife.doc}}</ref><ref name="warandpolitics">{{cite book | last =Watkins | first =Peter | title =War and Politics: The Christian's Duty | publisher =Christadelphian Auxiliary Lecturing Society | location =Birmingham, UK | url =http://www.god-so-loved-the-world.org/english/watkins_warandpoliticsthechristiansduty.doc }}</ref> (not to be confused with [[Pacifism|pacifists]]).

Most Christadelphians do not vote in political elections, as they take direction from Romans 13:1–4, which they interpret as meaning that God puts into power those leaders He deems worthy. To vote for a candidate that does not win an election would be considered to vote against God's will. To avoid risk of such conflict, most Christadelphians abstain from voting.

There is a strong emphasis on personal Bible reading and study<ref>'They are characterized by holding a firm belief in the inspired status of the Bible and place enormous emphasis upon biblical study', Evans, John S, 'The Prophecies of Daniel 2', page 251, USA:Xulon Press (2008)<br />{{*}}'Christadelphian devotion centers on daily Bible study and weekly meetings', page 421, Fahlbusch, Erwin and Bromiley, Geoffrey W, 'The Encyclopedia of Christianity', USA:Wm.

=== Hymnody and music ===
{{Main|Christadelphian hymnals}}
Christadelphians are a [[liturgy|highly liturgical]] denomination. Christadelphian ecclesias are autonomous and free to adopt whatever pattern of worship they choose. However, in the English-speaking world, there tends to be a great deal of uniformity in order of service and [[hymn]]ody.
[[File:2002_Christadelphian_hymnbook.jpg|left|thumb|130px|The 2002 English language hymn book]]
Christadelphian hymnody makes considerable use of the hymns of the Anglican and English Protestant traditions (even in US ecclesias the hymnody is typically more English than American). In many Christadelphian hymn books a sizeable proportion of hymns are drawn from the [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland|Scottish Psalter]] and non-Christadelphian hymn-writers including [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[John Newton]].  Despite incorporating non-Christadelphian hymns however, Christadelphian hymnody preserves the essential teachings of the community.<ref>'Hymnody was an important part of Christadelphianism from its beginning, and, along with the journal, The Christadelphian, gave independent ecclesias a broader fellowship. Hymns reflected the essential doctrines and principles of their faith. These principles were anti-Trinitarianism. They also believed that God would establish his kingdom on earth through the return of Jesus to reign a thousand years in Jerusalem', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>

The earliest hymn book published was the "Sacred Melodist" which was published by [[Benjamin Wilson (Biblical scholar)|Benjamin Wilson]] in Geneva, Illinois in 1860.<ref>{{cite thesis |first=Rachel |last=Hocking |title=A Study of Christadelphian Hymnody: singing with the spirit and with the understanding |date=2000 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |publisher=The University ofNew South Wales, Sydney |accessdate=2011-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121060117/http://sites.google.com/site/rachelhockingsite/articles/christadelphian-hymnody |archive-date=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The next was the hymn book published for the use of ''Baptised Believers in the Kingdom of God'' (an early name for Christadelphians)<ref name = "anrvrv">Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 235</ref> by George Dowie in Edinburgh in 1864.<ref>Andrew Wilson, ''History of the Christadelphians 1864–1885: the emergence of a denomination'' 1997 p. 326</ref> In 1865 [[Robert Roberts (Christadelphian)|Robert Roberts]] published a collection of Scottish psalms and hymns called ''The Golden Harp'' (which was subtitled "Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, compiled for the use of Immersed Believers in 'The Things concerning the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus Christ'").<ref>Peter Hemingray, ''John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith'' 2003 p. 195</ref> This was replaced only five years later by the first "Christadelphian Hymn Book" (1869), compiled by J. J. and A. Andrew,<ref>Ambassador of the Coming Age Vol. 6, P. 148</ref> and this was revised and expanded in 1874, 1932 and 1964. A thorough revision by the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association resulted in the latest (2002) edition<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thechristadelphian.com/product-category/books/hymn-books/ |title=Hymn Books |publisher=Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association |accessdate=2020-01-22 }}</ref> which is almost universally used by English-speaking Christadelphian ecclesias. In addition some Christadelphian fellowships have published their own hymn books.

Some ecclesias use the ''Praise the Lord'' songbook.<ref>''Praise the Lord'' (Hoddesdon Christadelphian Service, 1993, 2000)</ref> It was produced with the aim of making contemporary songs which are consistent with Christadelphian theology more widely available. Another publication, the "Worship" book<ref>{{cite web |title=Worship |work=Worship Book Committee, NCC, 2008, 2010 |url=http://www.theworshipbook.com |publisher=Theworshipbook.com }}</ref> is a compilation of songs and hymns that have been composed only by members of the Christadelphian community. This book was produced with the aim of providing extra music for non-congregational music items within services (e.g. voluntaries, meditations, et cetera) but has been adopted by congregations worldwide and is now used to supplement congregational repertoire.

In the English-speaking world, worship is typically accompanied by organ or piano, though in recent years a few ecclesias have promoted the use of other instruments (e.g. strings, wind and brass as mentioned in the Psalms). This trend has also seen the emergence of some Christadelphian bands<ref>An example is the Christadelphian folk rock band [[Fisher's Tale]] (albeit this is a witness project as opposed to being for the purpose of church worship)</ref> and the establishment of the Christadelphian Art Trust to support performing, visual and dramatic arts within the Christadelphian community.

In other countries, hymn books have been produced in local languages,<ref>e.g. ''Liedboek van de Broeders in Christus'' (Netherlands, circa 1980)</ref> sometimes resulting in styles of worship which reflect the local culture. It has been noted that Christadelphian hymnody has historically been a consistent witness to Christadelphian beliefs, and that hymnody occupies a significant role in the community.<ref>'Considering the scope of hymnic literature by Christadelphians, we might conclude that few branches of Christianity can claim such a close relationship between hymn writing and their own religious development, and such a high percentage of hymnists in their membership.  As their hymns become better known, this close relationship will reveal that the heritage and faith of Christadelphians has been enhanced through a strong emphasis on hymnody, from their beginnings to the present day', Wesley Roberts, Professor of Music, Campbellsville University, Kentucky, in the magazine 'Hymn', July 1997</ref>
