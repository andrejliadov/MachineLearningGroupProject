A '''new religious movement''' ('''NRM'''), also known as a '''new religion''' or an '''alternative spirituality''', is a [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] group that has modern origins but is peripheral to its society's dominant religious culture. NRMs can be novel in origin or they can be part of a wider [[religion]], in which case they are distinct from pre-existing [[Religious denomination|denominations]]. Some NRMs deal with the challenges which the modernizing world poses to them by embracing [[individualism]], while other NRMs deal with them by embracing tightly knit collective means.<ref name="Clarke, Peter B 2006">Clarke, Peter B. 2006. New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World. New York: Routledge.</ref>  Scholars have estimated that NRMs now number in the tens of thousands worldwide, with most of their members living in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. Most NRMs only have a few members, some of them have thousands of members, and a few of them have more than a million members.<ref name = barker1999>[[Eileen Barker]], 1999, "New Religious Movements: their incidence and significance", ''New Religious Movements: challenge and response'', Bryan Wilson and Jamie Cresswell editors, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-20050-4}}</ref>

There is no single, agreed-upon criterion for defining a "new religious movement".{{sfn|Oliver|2012|pp=5–6}} There is debate as to how the term "new" should be interpreted in this context.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} One perspective is that it should designate a religion that is more recent in its origins than large, well-established religions like [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} An alternate perspective is that "new" should mean that a religion is more recent in its formation.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}} Some scholars view the 1950s or the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945 as the defining time, while others look as far back as the founding of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in 1830.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=14}}<ref name = siegler2007/>

New religions have often faced a hostile reception from established religious organisations and various secular institutions. In Western nations, a secular [[anti-cult movement]] and a [[Christian countercult movement]] emerged during the 1970s and 1980s to oppose emergent groups.  In the 1970s, the distinct field of new religions studies developed within the academic study of religion. There are now several scholarly organisations and peer-reviewed journals devoted to the subject. Religious studies scholars contextualize the rise of NRMs in modernity, relating it as a product of and answer to modern processes of [[secularization]], [[globalization]], [[detraditionalization]], fragmentation, reflexivity, and [[individualism|individualization]].<ref name="Clarke, Peter B 2006"/>

==History==
[[File:Swami Vivekananda at Parliament of Religions.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1893 [[Parliament of the World's Religions]].]]
In 1830 the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was founded by [[Joseph Smith]].  It is now one of the largest new religious movements in terms of membership. In Japan, 1838 marks the beginning of [[Tenrikyo]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|title=The Doctrine of Tenrikyo|date=1954|publisher=Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|location=Tenri, Nara, Japan|page=3|edition=2006}}</ref> In 1844 [[Bábism]] was established in [[Iran]] from which the [[Baháʼí Faith]] was founded by [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in 1863. In 1860 [[Donghak]], later [[Cheondoism]], was founded by Choi Jae-Woo in [[Korea]]. It later ignited the [[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] in 1894.<ref name="Yao">{{cite book | last = Yao | first = Xinzhong | title = An Introduction to Confucianism | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-521-64430-3 | pages=121–122}}</ref> In 1889, [[Ahmadiyya]] an [[Islam]]ic [[Islamic schools and branches|sect]] was founded by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].  In 1891, the [[Unity Church]], the first [[New Thought]] denomination, was founded in the [[United States]].<ref name = siegler2007>[[Elijah Siegler]], 2007, ''New Religious Movements'', [[Prentice Hall]], {{ISBN|0-13-183478-9}}</ref><ref name=EBOnline>{{cite encyclopedia| title = Unity School of Christianity| encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/617994/Unity-School-of-Christianity| access-date = 2009-06-26}}</ref>

The 1930s saw the rise of the [[Nation of Islam]] and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in the [[United States]]; the rise of the [[Rastafari movement]] in [[Jamaica]]; the rise of [[Cao Đài]] and [[Hòa Hảo]] in [[Vietnam]]; the rise of [[Soka Gakkai]] in [[Japan]]; and the rise [[Zailiism]] and [[Yiguandao]] in [[China]]. In the 1940s, [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] began to outline the [[modern pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]].

New religious movements expanded in many nations in the 1950s and 1960s. Japanese new religions became very popular after the [[Shinto Directive]] (1945) forced the Japanese government to separate itself from [[Shinto]], which had been the [[state religion]] of Japan, bringing about greater [[freedom of religion]]. In 1954 [[Scientology]] was founded in the United States and the [[Unification Church]] was founded in [[South Korea]].<ref name = siegler2007/> In 1955 the [[Aetherius Society]] was founded in [[England]]. It and some other NRMs, have been called [[UFO religion]]s because they combine the belief in [[extraterrestrial life]] with traditional religious principles.<ref>Partridge, Christopher Hugh (ed.)

[[File:Origins-GuangzhouPractice.jpg|right|thumb|Practitioners of Falun Dafa perform spiritual exercises in [[Guangzhou]], China.]]
In the late 1980s and 1990s, the decline of [[communism]] and the [[revolutions of 1989]] opened up new opportunities for NRMs. [[Falun Gong]] was first taught publicly in [[Northeast China]] in 1992 by [[Li Hongzhi]]. At first it was accepted by the Chinese government and by 1999 there were 70 million practitioners in China,<ref>Seth Faison (27 April 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest.html In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protestors], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|title=In July 1999, the CCP Created Exactly What It Had Feared|url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/in-july-1999-the-ccp-created-exactly-what-it-had-feared/|access-date=2020-06-06|website=thediplomat.com|language=en-US}}</ref>but in July 1999 the government started to view the movement as a threat and [[Persecution of Falun Gong|began attempts to eradicate it]].

In the 21st century, many NRMs are using the [[Internet]] to give out information, to recruit members, and sometimes to hold online meetings and rituals.<ref name = siegler2007/> That is sometimes referred to as [[cybersectarianism]].<ref>Paul Virilio,''The Information Bomb'' (Verso, 2005), p. 41.</ref><ref>Rita M.

In 2006 [[J. Gordon Melton]], executive director of the Institute for the Study of American Religions at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that 40 to 45 new religious movements emerge each year in the United States.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/nyregion/28religion.html?pagewanted=print Seeking Entry-Level Prophet: Burning Bush and Tablets Not Required], ''[[New York Times]]'', August 28, 2006</ref> In 2007, religious scholar [[Elijah Siegler]] said that, though no NRM had become the dominant faith in any country, many of the concepts they first introduced (often referred to as "[[New Age]]" ideas) have become part of worldwide mainstream culture.<ref name = siegler2007/>

==Beliefs and practices==
[[File:Rasta Man Barbados.jpg|left|thumb|A Rasta man wearing symbols of his religious identity in [[Barbados]]]]

As noted by Barker, NRMs cannot all be "lumped together" and differ from one another on many issues.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=1}}
Virtually no generalisation can be made about NRMs that applies to every single group,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=10}} with Barrett noting that "generalizations tend not to be very helpful" when studying NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=9}} Melton expressed the view that there is "no single characteristic or set of
characteristics" that all new religions share, "not even their newness."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=76}} [[Bryan R. Wilson|Bryan Wilson]] wrote, "Chief among the miss-directed assertions has been the tendency to speak of new religious movements as if they differed very little, if at all, one from another. The tendency has been to lump them altogether and indiscriminately to attribute to all of them characteristics which are, in fact, valid for only one or two."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/115621228/Why-the-Bruderhof-is-not-a-cult-by-Bryan-Wilson|title=Why the Bruderhof is not a cult |author= Bryan Wilson |work=Cult And Sect {{!}} Religion And Belief|publisher=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}</ref> NRMs themselves often claim that they exist at a crucial place in time and space.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=6}}

===Scriptures===
Some NRMs have their own unique [[Religious text|scriptures]], while others reinterpret existing texts,<ref>[[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]], 2011, ''The Message and the Book'', UK, [[Atlantic Books]], pp. 13–14</ref> utilizing a range of older elements.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=7}} They frequently claim that these are not new, but rather had been forgotten truths that are only now being revived.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=8}}  NRM scriptures often incorporate modern [[scientific]] knowledge, sometimes with the claim that they are bringing unity to science and religion.<ref>{{cite book | last=Zeller | first=Benjamin | title=Prophets and Protons: New Religious Movements and Science in Late Twentieth-Century America | publisher=New York University Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-8147-9721-1 | pages=10–15}}</ref>  Some NRMs believe that their scriptures are received through the process of [[mediumship]].<ref>''The Bloomsbury Companion to New Religious Movements'', George D. Chryssides, Benjamin E. Zeller, A&C Black, 2014, p. 214</ref> ''[[The Urantia Book]]'', the core scripture of the Urantia Movement, was published in 1955 and is said to be the product of a continuous process of [[revelation]] from "celestial beings" which began in 1911.{{sfn|Gardner|1995|p=11}}  Some NRMs, particularly those that are forms of [[occultism]], have a prescribed system of courses and grades through which members can progress.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=57}}

===Celibacy===
Some NRMs promote [[celibacy]], the state of voluntarily being unmarried, sexually abstinent, or both.  Some, including the [[Shakers]] and more recent NRMs inspired by [[Hindu]] traditions, see it as a lifelong commitment. Others, including the [[Unification Church]], as a stage in spiritual development.<ref>Teaching New Religious Movements, [[David G. Bromley]], Oxford University Press, May 25, 2007</ref>  In some [[Buddhist]]  NRMs celibacy is practiced mostly by older women who become [[nuns]].<ref>''New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response'', Jamie Cresswell, Bryan Wilson, Routledge, 2012, p. 153</ref> Some people join NRMs and practice celibacy as a [[rite of passage]] in order to move beyond previous sexual problems or bad experiences.<ref>The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, Volume 1, James R Lewis, OUP US, 2008, p. 385</ref>  Groups that promote [[celibacy]] require a strong recruitment drive to survive; the Shakers established orphanages to bring new individuals into their community.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=67}}

===Violence===
Violent incidents involving NRMs are extremely rare and unusual.{{quantify|date=July 2019}} In those cases where a large number of casualties resulted, the new religion in question was led by a charismatic leader.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=83}}  Beginning in 1978 with the deaths of 913 members of the [[Peoples Temple]] in [[Jonestown]], Guyana by both murder and suicide an image of "killer cults" came to public attention. A number of subsequent events contributed to this.  In 1994, members of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] committed suicide in Canada and Switzerland. In 1995 members of the Japanese new religion [[Aum Shinrikyo]] murdered a number of people, including through a [[Tokyo subway sarin attack|sarin attack on the Tokyo subway]]. In 1997, 39 members of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate]] group committed suicide in the belief that their spirits would leave the Earth and join a passing comet.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=82}}   There have also been cases in which members of NRMs have been killed after they engaged in dangerous actions due to their mistaken belief in their own invincibility; in Uganda several hundred members of the [[Holy Spirit Movement]] were killed as they approached gunfire because its leader, [[Alice Lakwena]], told them that they would be protected from bullets by the oil of the [[shea tree]].{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=55}}

===Leadership and succession===
[[File:Mary Baker Eddy cph.3b20582.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mary Baker Eddy]]]]
Many NRMs are founded and led by a charismatic leader.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} The death of any religion's founder represents a significant moment in its history.   Over the months and years following its leader's death, the movement can die out, fragment into multiple groups, consolidate its position, or change its nature to become something quite different that what its founder intended. In some cases a NRM moves closer to the religious mainstream after the death of its founder.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=58–60}}

A number of founders of new religions established plans for succession to prevent confusion after their deaths.   [[Mary Baker Eddy]], the American founder of [[Christian Science]], spent fifteen years working on her book ''The [[Manual of the Mother Church]]'', which laid out how the group should be run by her successors.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=66}} 
The leadership of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] passed through a succession of individuals until 1963 when it was assumed by the [[Universal House of Justice]], members of which are elected by the worldwide congregation.<ref>[http://home.wanadoo.nl/arjen.nandita2/bahai-world-statistics-2001.htm Baha'i World Statistics 2001] by Baha'i World Center Department of Statistics, 2001–08</ref><ref>[http://bahai-library.com/danesh_life_shoghi_effendi The Life of Shoghi Effendi] by Helen Danesh, John Danesh and Amelia Danesh, Studying the Writings of Shoghi Effendi, edited by M.

==Membership==
===Demographics===
NRMs typically consist largely of first-generation believers,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=11}} and thus often have a younger average membership than mainstream religious congregations.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=11–12}}  Some NRMS have been formed by groups who have split from a pre-existing religious group.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} As these members grow older, many have children who are then brought up within the NRM.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=12}}

In the [[Third World]], NRMs most often appeal to the poor and oppressed sectors of society.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}}  Within Western countries, they are more likely to appeal to members of the middle and upper-middle classes,{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}} with Barrett stating that new religions in the UK and US largely attract "white, middle-class late teens and twenties."{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=98}}  There are exceptions, such as the [[Rastafari]] movement and the [[Nation of Islam]],  which have primarily attracted disadvantaged black youth in Western countries.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=14}}

A popular conception, unsupported by evidence, holds that those who convert to new religions are either mentally ill or become so through their involvement with them.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=55–56}}  [[Dick Anthony]], a [[forensics|forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] noted for his writings on the [[brainwashing]] controversy,<ref>[[Lorne L. Dawson|Dawson, Lorne L.]]. ''Cults in context: readings in the study of new religious movements'', Transaction Publishers 1998, p. 340, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0478-5}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Robbins, Thomas]]. ''In Gods we trust: new patterns of religious pluralism in America'', Transaction Publishers 1996, p. 537, {{ISBN|978-0-88738-800-2}}</ref> has defended NRMs, and in 1988 argued that involvement in such movements may often be beneficial: "There's a large research literature published in mainstream journals on the mental health effects of new religions. For the most part the effects seem to be positive in any way that's measurable."<ref name="Sipchen">Sipchen, Bob (1988-11-17). [http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/vw-257_1_cult-battle/3 "Ten Years After Jonestown, the Battle Intensifies Over the Influence of 'Alternative' Religions"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

===Joining===
[[File:Casaemcasa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Evangelism|Jehovah's Witnesses evangelising]] from house to house]]
Those who convert to a NRM typically believe that in doing so they are gaining some benefit in their life. This can come in many forms, from an increasing sense of freedom, to a release from drug dependency, and a feeling of self-respect and direction. Many of those who have left NRMs report that they have gained from their experience. There are various reasons as to why an individual would join and then remain part of an NRM, including both push and pull factors.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=25–26}}  According to [[Marc Galanter (psychiatrist)|Marc Galanter]], Professor of Psychiatry at [[NYU]],<ref>Galanter, Marc (Editor), (1989), ''Cults and new religious movements: a report of the committee on psychiatry and religion of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'', {{ISBN|0-89042-212-5}}</ref> typical reasons why people join NRMs include a search for community and a spiritual quest. Sociologists [[Rodney Stark|Stark]] and [[William Sims Bainbridge|Bainbridge]], in discussing the process by which people join new religious groups, have questioned the utility of the concept of ''conversion'', suggesting that ''affiliation'' is a more useful concept.<ref>Bader, Chris & A. Demarish (1996). "A test of the Stark-Bainbridge theory of affiliation with religious cults and sects." ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'', 35, 285–303.</ref>

A popular explanation for why people join new religious movements is that they have been "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]" or subject to "mind control" by the NRM itself.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=17}} This explanation provides a rationale for "deprogramming", a process in which members of NRMs are illegally kidnapped by individuals who then attempt to convince them to reject their beliefs.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=17}} Professional deprogrammers therefore have a financial interest in promoting the "brainwashing" explanation.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=19}} Academic research however has demonstrated that these brainwashing techniques "simply do not exist".{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=3}}

===Leaving===
Many members of NRMs leave these groups of their own free will.{{sfn|Barker|1989|pp=18–19}} Some of those who do so retain friends within the movement.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=47}}  Some of those who leave a religious community are unhappy with the time that they spent as part of it.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=47}}  Leaving a NRM can pose a number of difficulties.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=54}} It may result in their having to abandon a daily framework that they had previously adhered to.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=55}} It may also generate mixed emotions as ex-members lose the feelings of absolute certainty that they had held while in the group.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=54}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Three basic questions have been paramount in orienting theory and research on NRMs: what are the identifying markers of NRMs that distinguish them from other types of religious groups?; what are the different types of NRMs and how do these different types relate to the established institutional order of the host society?; and what are the most important ways that NRMs respond to the sociocultural dislocation that leads to their formation?"|source=— Sociologist of religion [[David G. Bromley]]{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=14}} }}

The academic study of new religious movements is known as 'new religions studies' (NRS).{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2004|1p=83|2a1=Bromley|2y=2012|2p=13}}
The study draws from the disciplines of [[anthropology]], [[psychiatry]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]].<ref name="Teaching bromley">{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Disciplinary Perspectives on New Religious Movements: Views of from the Humanities and Social Sciences|encyclopedia=Teaching New Religious Movements|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001/acprof-9780195177299-chapter-3|access-date=2014-03-17|author=Sablia, John A.|pages=41–63|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195177299.001.0001|editor=David G.

The study of new religions is unified by its topic of interest, rather than by its [[methodology]], and is therefore [[interdisciplinary]] in nature.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=16}} A sizeable body of scholarly literature on new religions has been published, most of it produced by [[social science|social scientists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bromley|1y=2012|1p=13|2a1=Hammer|2a2=Rothstein|2y=2012|2p=2}} Among the disciplines that NRS utilises are anthropology, history, psychology, religious studies, and sociology.{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} Of these approaches, sociology played a particularly prominent role in the development of the field,{{sfn|Bromley|2012|p=13}} resulting in it being initially confined largely to a narrow array of sociological questions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}} This came to change in later scholarship, which began to apply theories and methods initially developed for examining more mainstream religions to the study of new ones.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=5}}

Most research has been directed toward those new religions that attract public controversy. Less controversial NRMs tend to be the subject of less scholarly research.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=20}} It has also been noted that scholars of new religions often avoid researching certain movements that scholars from other backgrounds study. The [[feminist spirituality]] movement is usually examined by scholars of [[women's studies]], African-American new religions by scholars of [[Africana studies]], and Native American new religions by scholars of [[Native American studies]].{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p=8}}

===Definitions  and terminology===
[[File:Rainbow Gathering Bosnia 2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Rainbow Gathering]] in Bosnia, 2007]]
[[J. Gordon Melton]] argued that, "new religious movements" should be defined by the way dominant religious and secular forces within a given society treat them. According to him, NRMs constituted "those religious groups that have been found, from the perspective of the dominant religious community (and in the West that is almost always a form of Christianity), to be not just different, but unacceptably different."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=79}} Barker cautioned against Melton's approach, arguing that negating the "newness" of "new religious movements" raises problems, for it is "the very fact that NRMs are new that explains many of the key characteristics they display".{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=89}}

Scholars of religion [[Olav Hammer]] and [[Mikael Rothstein]] argued that "new religions are just young religions" and as a result, they are "not inherently different" from mainstream and established religious movements, with the differences between the two having been greatly exaggerated by the media and popular perceptions.{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=3}} Melton has stated that those NRMs that "were offshoots of older religious groups... tended to resemble their parent groups far more than they resembled each other."{{sfn|Melton|2004|p=76}}  One question that faces scholars of religion is when a new religious movement ceases to be "new."{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=99}}   As noted by Barker, "In the first century, Christianity was new, in the seventh century Islam was new, in the eighteenth century Methodism was new, in the nineteenth century the Seventh-day Adventists, Christadelphians and Jehovah's Witnesses were new; in the twenty-first century the Unification Church, ISKCON and Scientology are beginning to look old."{{sfn|Barker|2004|p=99}}

Some NRMs are strongly [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] and 'alternative' in the society where they appear, while others are far more similar to a society's established traditional religions.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=5}} Generally, Christian denominations are not seen as new religious movements; nevertheless, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christian Science]], and the [[Shakers]] have been studied as NRMs.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition, ''New Religious Movements''</ref><ref>Paul J. Olson, "Public Perception of 'Cults. and .New Religious Movements'", ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'', 2006, 45 (1): 97–106</ref>

There are also problems in the use of "religion" within the term "new religious movements".{{sfn|Oliver|2012|pp=14–15}} This is because various groups, particularly active within the [[New Age]] milieu, have many traits in common with different NRMs but emphasise [[personal development]] and [[humanistic psychology]], and are not clearly  "religious" in nature.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=15}}

Since at least the early 2000s, most sociologists of religion have used the term "new religious movement" in order to avoid the pejorative undertones of terms like "[[cult]]" and "[[sect]]".{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=24}} These are words that have been used in different ways by different groups.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=19}} For instance, from the nineteenth century onward a number of sociologists used the terms "cult" and "sect" in very specific ways.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=23}} The sociologist [[Ernst Troeltsch]] for instance differentiated "churches" from "sect" by claiming that the former term should apply to groups that stretch across social strata while "sects" typically contain converts from socially disadvantaged sectors of society.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=23}}

The term "cult" is used in reference to devotion or dedication to a particular person or place.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=21}} For instance, within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] devotion to [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] is usually termed the "[[Cult of Mary]]".{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=21–22}} It is also used in non-religious contexts to refer to [[fandom]]s devoted to television shows like ''[[The Prisoner]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=22}} In the United States, people began to use "cult" in a pejorative manner, to refer to [[Spiritualism]] and [[Christian Science]] during the 1890s.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=17}} As commonly used, for instance in sensationalist tabloid articles, the term "cult" continues to have pejorative associations.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=20}}

The term "new religions" is a [[calque]] of {{nihongo||新宗教|shinshūkyō}}, a Japanese term developed to describe the proliferation of [[Japanese new religions]] in the years following the [[Second World War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Melton|2y=2004b|2p=19}} From Japan this term was translated and used by several American authors, including [[Jacob Needleman]], to describe the range of groups that appeared in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] during the 1960s.{{sfn|Melton|2004b|p=19}} This term, amongst others, was adopted by Western scholars as an alternative to "[[cult]]".<ref name="Gallagher, Eugene V 2007">Gallagher, Eugene V. 2007. "Compared to What? 'Cults' and 'New Religious Movements.'" History of Religions 47(2/3): 212.</ref> However, "new religious movements" has failed to gain widespread public usage in the manner that "cult" has.{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=6}} Other terms that have been employed for many NRMs are "alternative religion" and "alternative spirituality", something used to convey the difference between these groups and established or mainstream religious movements while at the same time evading the problem posed by groups that are not particularly new.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=2001|1p=24|2a1=Oliver|2y=2012|2p=13}}

The 1970s was the era of the so-called "cult wars," led by "cult-watching groups."<ref>Barker, Eileen. 2010. "Stepping out of the Ivory Tower: A Sociological Engagement in ‘The Cult Wars.’" Methodological Innovations Online 6(1): 20. http://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology/pdf/Barker-Stepping-Out.pdf</ref> The efforts of the anti-cult movement condensed a [[moral panic]] around the concept of cults. Public fears around Satanism, in particular, came to be known as a distinct phenomenon, the "[[Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic Panic]]."<ref>Petersen, Jesper Aagaard. 2004. "Modern Satanism: Dark Doctrines and Black Flames." In Controversial New Religions, edited by James R. Lewis, and Jesper Aagaard Petersen. New York: Oxford University Press. {{doi|10.1093/019515682X.003.0019}}</ref> Consequently, scholars such as [[Eileen Barker]], [[James T. Richardson]], [[Timothy Miller]] and [[Catherine Wessinger]] argued that the term "cult" had become too laden with negative connotations, and "advocated dropping its use in academia." A number of alternatives to the term "new religious movement" are used by some scholars. These include "alternative religious movements" (Miller), "emergent religions" (Ellwood) and "marginal religious movements" (Harper and Le Beau).<ref name="ReferenceA">Paul J.

====Christian countercult movement====
In the 1930s, Christian critics of NRMs began referring to them as "cults".  The 1938 book ''The Chaos of Cults'' by Jan Karel van Baalen (1890–1968), an ordained minister in the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]], was especially influential.<ref name = siegler2007/><ref>J.K. van Baalen, ''The Chaos of Cults'', 4th rev.ed.Grand Rapids: William Eerdmans Publishing, 1962.</ref> In the US, the [[Christian Research Institute]] was founded in 1960 by [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] to counter opposition to evangelical Christianity and has come to focus on criticisms of NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=104–105}} Presently the [[Christian countercult movement]] opposes most NRMs because of [[Theology|theological]] differences.  It is closely associated with [[evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=97}} The UK-based [[Reachout Trust]] was initially established to oppose the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and what it regarded as "counterfeit Christian groups",{{cite quote|date=May 2018}} but it came to wider attention in the late 1980s and 1990s for its role in promoting claims about [[Satanic ritual abuse]].

====Anti-cult movement====
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a number of highly visible new religious movements... [These] seemed so outlandish that many people saw them as evil cults, fraudulent organizations or scams that recruited unaware people by means of mind-control techniques. Real or serious religions, it was felt, should appear in recognizable institutionalized forms, be suitably ancient, and – above all – advocate relatively familiar theological notions and modes of conduct. Most new religions failed to comply with such standards."|source=— Religious studies scholars Olav Hammer and Mikael Rothstein{{sfn|Hammer|Rothstein|2012|p=2}} }}
In the 1970s and 1980s some NRMs,  as well as some non-religious groups, came under opposition by the newly organized [[anti-cult movement]], which mainly charged them with [[psychological abuse]] of their own members.<ref name="siegler2007"/> It actively seeks to discourage people from joining new religions (which it refers to as "[[cults]]"). It also encourages members of these groups to leave them, and at times seeking to restrict their freedom of movement.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=97}}

Family members are often distressed when a relative of theirs joins a new religion.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=41}}  Although children break away from their parents for all manner of reasons, in cases where NRMS are involved it is often the latter that are blamed for the break.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|pp=45–46}} Some anti-cultist groups emphasise the idea that "cults" always use deceit and trickery to recruit members.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=29}} The anti-cult movement adopted the term ''brainwashing'', which had been developed by the journalist [[Edward Hunter (U.S. journalist)|Edward Hunter]] and then used by [[Robert J. Lifton]] to apply to the methods employed by Chinese to convert captured U.S. soldiers to their cause in the [[Korean War]]. Lifton himself had doubts about the applicability of his 'brainwashing' hypothesis to the techniques used by NRMs to convert recruits.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=30}} A number of ex-members of various new religions have made false allegations about their experiences in such groups. For instance, in the late 1980s a man in [[Dublin]], Ireland was given a three-year [[suspended sentence]] for falsely claiming that he had been drugged, kidnapped, and held captive by members of ISKCON.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=39}}

Scholars of religion have often critiqued anti-cult groups of un-critically believing anecdotal stories provided by the ex-members of new religions, of encouraging ex-members to think that they are the victims of manipulation and abuse, and of irresponsibly scare-mongering about NRMs.{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=108}} Of the "well over a thousand groups that have been or might be called cults" listed in the files of [[INFORM]], says Eileen Barker, the "vast majority" have not engaged in criminal activities.<ref>Barker, Eileen (2009).

===Popular culture and news media===
{{Main|New religious movements and cults in popular culture}}
New religious movements and cults have appeared as themes or subjects in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]], while notable representatives of such groups have produced a large body of literary works.  Beginning in the 1700s authors in the English-speaking world began introducing members of "cults" as [[antagonists]]. In the Twentieth century concern for the rights and feelings of religious minorities led authors to most often invent fictional cults for their villains to be members of.<ref>Ed Brubaker, Fatale #21, 2014, Image, pp. 20–21</ref> Fictional cults continue to be popular in film, television, and gaming in the same way; while some popular works treat new religious movements in a serious manner.

An article on the categorization of new religious movements in U.S. print media published by ''The Association for the Sociology of Religion'' (formerly the American ''Catholic Sociological Society''), criticizes the print media for failing to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of new religious movements, and its tendency to use popular or anti-cultist definitions rather than social-scientific insight, and asserts that "The failure of the print media to recognize social-scientific efforts in the area of religious movement organizations impels us to add yet another failing mark to the media report card Weiss (1985) has constructed to assess the media's reporting of the social sciences."<ref>van Driel, Barend and James T. Richardson. "Research Note Categorization of New Religious Movements in American Print Media". ''Sociological Analysis'' 1988, 49, 2:171–183</ref>
