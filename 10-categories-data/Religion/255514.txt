'''Religious art''' or '''sacred art''' is artistic imagery using religious inspiration and motifs and is often intended to uplift the mind to the spiritual. Sacred art involves the ritual and cultic practices and practical and operative aspects of the path of the spiritual realization within the artist's religious tradition.

==Christian art==
{{main|Christian Art|Catholic art|Byzantine art}}
{{see also|Religious image#Christianity|Madonna (art)|Icon|Images of Jesus}}

Christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of [[Christianity]], though other definitions are possible. It is to make imagery of the different beliefs in the world and what it looks like. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Most Christian art is allusive, or built around [[theme (literary)|theme]]s familiar to the intended observer. Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] are the most common subjects, especially the images of [[Christ]] on the [[Cross]].

Scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most Christian denominations. Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], holding the [[Child Jesus|infant Jesus]], and images of saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

For the benefit of the illiterate, an elaborate [[iconographic]] system developed to conclusively identify scenes. For example, [[Saint Agnes]] depicted with a lamb, [[Saint Peter]] with keys, [[Saint Patrick]] with a shamrock. Each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art.

===History===
[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, 4th century.]]
[[Early Christian art]] survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest surviving Christian paintings are from the site at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], dated to around the year 70, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Until the [[Constantine I and Christianity|adoption of Christianity by Constantine]] Christian art derived its style and much of its [[iconography]] from popular [[Roman art]], but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which [[mosaic]]s in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples.

During the development of early Christian art in the [[Byzantine empire]] (see [[Byzantine art]]), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of ''graven images'', the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] led to a standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

[[File:Botticelli - Madone de l'Eucharistie.jpg|thumb|An example of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with an Angel, painted by [[Sandro Botticelli]] (1470) and commissioned by the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Renaissance]] in [[Florence]] (Boston, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum)]]

The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the [[Protestant Reformation]] Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] painted the [[Sistine Chapel]] and carved the famous ''[[Pietà]]'', [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] created the massive columns in [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] painted the ''[[Last Supper]]''. The Reformation had a [[The Reformation and art|huge effect on Christian art]], rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, secular artists occasionally treated Christian themes ([[Bouguereau]], [[Manet]]). Only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]] or [[Stanley Spencer]]). However many modern artists such as [[Eric Gill]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jacob Epstein]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Graham Sutherland]] have produced well-known works of art for churches.<ref>Beth Williamson, ''Christian Art: A Very Short Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2004), page 110.</ref> Through a social interpretation of Christianity, [[Fritz von Uhde]] also revived the interest in sacred art, through the depiction of Jesus in ordinary places in life.

Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as [[Mihály Munkácsy]]. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of [[holy card]]s. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as [[Thomas Blackshear]] and [[Thomas Kinkade]], although widely regarded in the fine art world as [[kitsch]],<ref>Cynthia A. Freeland, ''But Is It Art?: An Introduction to Art Theory'', Oxford University Press (2001), page 95</ref> have been very successful.

The last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in Christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith, Christ, God, the Church, the Bible and other classic Christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world. Artists such as [[Makoto Fujimura]] have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include [[Larry D. Alexander]], Gary P. Bergel, Carlos Cazares, Bruce Herman, Deborah Sokolove, and [[John August Swanson]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | title=Contemporary Religious Art | publisher=Mozaico | date=21 May 2015 | access-date=2 June 2015 | author=Buenconsejo, Clara | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929011640/http://blog.mozaico.net/contemporary-religious-art/ | archive-date=29 September 2015 }}</ref>

==Buddhist art==
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2015}}

{{main|Buddhist art}}
Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art.

Buddhist art followed to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art.

In India, the Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of [[Hindu art]], until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of [[Islam]] alongside [[Hinduism]].

[[File:Thangka Depicting Vajrabhairava, ca. 1740, Sotheby's.jpg|thumb|An example of Tibetan Buddhist art: Thangka Depicting [[Vajrabhairava]], c. 1740]]

===Tibetan Buddhist art===
Most Tibetan Buddhist artforms are related to the practice of [[Vajrayana]] or Buddhist tantra.
[[Tibetan art]] includes [[thangka]]s and [[mandala]]s, often including depictions of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s. Creation of Buddhist art is usually done as a [[meditation]] as well as creating an object as aid to meditation. An example of this is the creation of a [[sand mandala]] by monks; before and after the construction prayers are recited, and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings (palace) of a Buddha on which is meditated to train the mind. The work is rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects, such as the [[vajra]] and the [[phurba]].

===Indian Buddhist art===
Two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of Buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century AD. One is Ajanta, a site in India long forgotten until discovered in 1817. The other is Dunhuang, one of the great oasis staging posts on the Silk Road...The paintings range from calm devotional images of the Buddha to lively and crowded scenes, often featuring the seductively full-breasted and narrow-waisted women more familiar in Indian sculpture than in painting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?gtrack=pthc&ParagraphID=bdc#bdc |title=History Of Buddhism |publisher=Historyworld.net |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>

==Islamic  art==
{{main|Islamic art}}
[[File:Mihrab, Great Mosque of Kairouan.jpg|thumb|right|A specimen of Islamic sacred art: in the '''[[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]]''' also called the Mosque of Uqba (in [[Tunisia]]), the upper part of the mihrab (prayer niche) is decorated with 9th-century lusterware tiles and painted intertwined vegetal motifs.]]

A prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art, as well as the naturally decorative nature of Arabic script, led to the use of calligraphic decorations, which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns and vegetal forms ([[arabesque]]s) that expressed ideals of order and nature. These were used on religious architecture, carpets, and handwritten documents.<ref name="huntfor">{{cite web |url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040218232141/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/medieval/islamic.htm |archive-date=2004-02-18 |url-status=dead |title=Islamic Art - Islamic Art of Calligraphy and Arabesque |access-date=2014-02-11 }}</ref> Islamic art has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view. It focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form.

While there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through Islamic history, this is a distinctly modern [[Sunni]] view. [[Persian miniature]]s, along with medieval [[depictions of Muhammad]] and [[angels in Islam]], stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern Sunni tradition. Also, [[Shi'a]] Muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures, including the Prophet's as long as the depiction is respectful.

===Figure representation===
The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God. It is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial.

The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the [[Hadith]] (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to "breathe life" into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. 
[[File:Ardabil Carpet.jpg|thumb|[[The Ardabil Carpet]], probably the finest surviving [[Persian carpet]], [[Tabriz]], mid-16th century]]
The Qur'an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir ("maker of forms", or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. [[Iconoclasm]] was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm |title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>
As with other forms of Islamic ornamentation, artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms, giving rise to a great variety of figural-based designs.

===Arabesque===
{{main|Arabesque}}

===Calligraphy===
{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphy is a highly regarded element of Islamic art. The [[Qur'an]] was transmitted in Arabic, and inherent within the Arabic script is the potential for ornamental forms. The employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying [[talisman]]ic component. While most works of art had legible inscriptions, not all Muslims would have been able to read them. One should always keep in mind, however, that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text, albeit in a decorative form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cali/hd_cali.htm |title=Calligraphy in Islamic Art &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>
From its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century AD, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of Islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art. The main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles, called generally the [[Kufic]], and the soft cursive styles, which include [[Naskh (script)|Naskhi]], [[Thuluth]], [[Nastaliq]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|many others]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sakkal.com/ArtArabicCalligraphy.html |title=Art of Arabic Calligraphy |publisher=Sakkal |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>

===Geometry===
{{main|Islamic geometric patterns}}
Geometric patterns make up one of the three nonfigural types of decoration in Islamic art. Whether isolated or used in combination with nonfigural ornamentation or figural representation, geometric patterns are popularly associated with Islamic art, largely due to their aniconic quality. These abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental Islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/geom/hd_geom.htm |title=Geometric Patterns in Islamic Art &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>

==Hindu art==
{{main|Hindu art}}

[[Hinduism]], with its [[Hinduism by country|1 billion followers]], it makes up about 15% of the world's population and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art.  There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewellery.  Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

==Taoist art==
{{main|Taoist art}}
Daoist Art (also spelled as Taoist art) relates to the Taoist philosophy and narratives of Lao-tzu (also spelled as Laozi) that promote "living simply and honestly and in harmony with nature."<ref>Augustin, Birgitta. “Daoism and Daoist Art.” In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. <nowiki>http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/daoi/hd_daoi.htm</nowiki> (December 2011)</ref>
