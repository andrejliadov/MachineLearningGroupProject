In the field of [[comparative religion]], many scholars, academics, religious figures have looked at the relationships between '''[[Hinduism]] and [[major religions|other religions]]'''.

==Indian religions==

===Ayyavazhi===
{{Main|Ayyavazhi and Hinduism}}

[[Ayyavazhi]] and [[Hinduism]] are two belief systems in [[India]]. Though Ayyavazhi continues to officially exist within Hinduism and is considered by some observers to be a [[Hindu denomination]], members of the religion claim that it is independent. The most notable distinction from Hindu are the Ayyavazhi religion's concepts of good, evil and [[dharma]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ayyavazhi Religion|url=http://www.religious-information.com/ayyavazhi-religion.html|work=religious-information.com|publisher=SBI|access-date=29 March 2012|format=Web page}}</ref>

Hindus view [[Vedas]], [[Gita]], and other texts from the [[Shastra]] as canonical scriptures, instead of the [[Akilam]]. The Ayyavazhi believe that the Hindu scriptures were once canonical, but now have lost their Substance because of the advent of Akilam. [[Kaliyan]] bought the Vedas as a Boon and so all the previous religious books including [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]] and [[Puranas]] lost their Substances, leaving Akilattirattu Ammanai as the only book of perfection. Several dubious claims state that the present day Vedas are not accepted by Ayyavazhi as books of Perfection, because there is a quote in Akilam about [[Venneesan]] ''"Avan pilathaal  vedamondruntakki"'' (He created a Veda of his own intention). All previous religious texts have lost their Substance in the vision of Ayyavazhi at the very moment Kaliyan came to the world.

Though Ayyavazhi has many differences from popular Hinduism, it has many beliefs and practices in common. As Hinduism is really a tree of many branches, Ayyavazhi is closest to [[Smartism]] and its [[Advaita]] beliefs in thought

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and Hinduism}}

===Jainism===
{{main|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Hinduism and Jainism have a rather similar view on the topic of asceticism, or, in simpler terms, abstinence. It is thought that their beliefs on the topic come from the early belief that some meditative and monastic practices cleanse the body of impurity. The Hindu theory of Karma gave Jainism a great deal of support to start promoting asceticism. Both of these traditions attribute human greed, hatred, and delusion to the presence of impure residues (samskaras or vasanas) that must be cleansed as the individual person moves towards "freedom" (death). Both of these religions believe that practicing asceticism is not only to the benefit of the individual but also to the benefit of the society as a whole. Nonviolence plays a large role in both of these religions so the concept of asceticism relies greatly on both of their beliefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chapple|first1=Christopher|title=Asceticism and the environment|journal=Cross Currents|date=2008|volume=57|issue=4|pages=514–525}}</ref>{{ course assignment | course = Education Program:Duquesne University/UCOR 143 Global and Cultural Perspectives (Fall 2014) | term = 2014 Q3 }}

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Hinduism and Sikhism}}

The historical interaction between [[Sikhism]] and Hinduism occurred because both were founded on the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and have the majority of their followers there.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Christianity{{anchor|Hinduism and Christianity}}===
[[Ram Mohan Roy]] criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how "unreasonable" and "self-contradictory" they are.<ref>"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness. Page 166, by Abidullah Al-Ansari Ghazi, year = 2010</ref> He further adds that people, even from India, were embracing Christianity due to the economic hardship and weakness, just like European Jews were pressured to embrace Christianity, by both encouragement and force.<ref>"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness. Page 169, by Abidullah Al-Ansari Ghazi, year = 2010</ref>

The Hindu monk [[Vivekananda]] regarded Christianity as "collection of little bits of Indian thought. Ours is the religion of which Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is a very patchy imitation."<ref>"Neo-Hindu Views of Christianity", p. 96, by Arvind Sharma, year = 1988</ref>

Philosopher [[Dayanand Saraswati]], regarded Christianity as "barbarous religion, and a 'false religion' religion believed only by fools and by the people in a state of barbarism,"<ref>"Gandhi on Pluralism and Communalism", by P.

T. F. Jordens</ref>

In 1956 the [[Niyogi Committee Report On Christian Missionary Activities]] was published by the Government of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This influential report on controversial missionary activities in India recommended that suitable controls on conversions brought about through illegal means should be implemented.<ref>CHAPTER 6 HINDUTVA, SECULAR INDIA AND THE REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H.

Panikkar]]'s work "Asia and Western Dominance" was published and was one of the first post-Independence Indian critiques of Christian missions. It argued that the attempt to convert Asia has definitely failed, and that this failure was due to the missionaries' claim of a monopoly of truth which was alien to the Asian mind; their association with imperialism and the attitude of moral and [[racial superiority]] of the [[Christian West]].<ref>CHAPTER 6 HINDUTVA, SECULAR INDIA AND THE REPORT OF THE CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY ACTIVITIES ENQUIRY COMMITTEE: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H.

Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], wrote: {{quotation|Unfortunately Christian religion inherited the Semitic creed of the ‘jealous God’ in the view of Christ as ‘the only begotten son of God’ so could not brook any rival near the throne.

====History====
There has been some debate on historical connections between Christianity and Indian religion, it has focused on both [[Buddhism and Christianity|Buddhism]] (via [[Greco-Buddhism]]) as well as Hinduism. While it is evident that a number of Indian sages visited [[Constantinople]] in Classical Antiquity, claims of significant influence in either direction have failed to gain wide acceptance. Christianity revolves heavily around the life of [[Jesus Christ]] as detailed in the Bible, whereas Hinduism is not based on any one personality or one book, but rather on the philosophy that there is a god, or no god and just self, etc. Nevertheless, some scholars have studied whether there are links between the story of Jesus and that of Krishna; "Krishnology" is a term coined to express these claimed theological parallels between [[Krishnaism]] and the [[Christology|Christological]] dogmas of Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Krishnology {{!}} Project Gutenberg Self-Publishing - eBooks {{!}} Read eBooks online|website=www.gutenberg.us}}</ref>

Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church, [[Bardesanes|Bar-Daisan]] (AD 154–223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it.<ref name="AFM">A. E. Medlycott, ''India and The Apostle Thomas'', pp.18–71;

Contemporary Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. Hinduism's historical tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners; this continues today. The declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' by the [[Second Vatican Council]] officially established inter-religious dialogue between Catholics and Hindus, promoting common values between the two religions (among others). There are over 17.3 million Catholics in India, which represents less than 2% of the total population, still making it the largest Christian church in India. 
(See also: [[Dalit theology]]).

====Doctrine====
Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on heaven, hell and reincarnation, to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven (Sanskrit: ''swarga'') and hell (''naraka'') are temporary places, where every soul has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their sins committed. After a soul suffers its due punishment in hell, or after a soul has enjoyed enough in heaven, it again enters the life-death cycle. There is no concept in Hinduism of a permanent hell like that in Christianity; rather, the cycle of "karma" takes over. Permanent heaven or bliss is "moksha".

The Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members—[[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]—are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead. The specific formulation of this trinitarian relationship is not identical between the two religions; for example, in Hinduism there is a Parabrahma, or an ultimate creator who created the Trimurti, for which there exists no parallel in Christianity. Some consider Brahma to be more similar to the demiurge of Christian gnosticism, in that he (at least initially) wrongly thought himself as the "Creator" and also as the highest or even the only god. In this case, the Hindu version of the Trinity could be seen as Brahma (Father), Sankarshan or Vishnu (Holy spirit), and Mahesh or Shiva (Son; analogous to Christ).

There have been Christian writers such as the 17th century mystic Jane Leade and the 19th-20th century theologian Sergei Bulgakov, who have described the feminine Sophia (wisdom) as an aspect of the Godhead. This may serve as a rough analogue to Hinduism's description of Sita in the Ramayana, who is saved by Hanuman (an incarnation of Shiva) from the demon king Ravana to be reunited with her husband Rama, representing God. Nevertheless, although the concept that we can come to know God through ''sophia'' has played a role in Christian thought, no major Christian denominations profess Sophia as an independent aspect of God.

In Hinduism (also in [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]), the concept of [[moksha]] is akin to that of Buddhism's [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvana]], but some scholars further claim that it is akin as well to Christianity's doctrine of [[salvation]]. Hindu sannyasi [[Swami Tripurari]] states:<blockquote>... in theory the sinners of the world are the beneficiaries of Christ’s sacrifice, but it is God the father for whose pleasure Christ underwent the crucifixion, even when the father’s joy in this scenario lies in the salvation of sinners. Christ represents the intermediary between God and humanity, and his life aptly illustrates the fact that it is sacrifice by which we come to meet our maker. Thus in Christ the Divine teaches us “the way” more than he does the goal. The Christ conception represents “the way” in the sense that the way is sacrifice, out of which love arises. The [[Krishna]] conception represents that for which we not only should, but must sacrifice, compelled by the Godhead’s irresistible attributes, etc. depicted therein.<ref>[[Swami Tripurari|Tripurari, Swami]], ''[http://harmonist.us/2009/05/christ-krishna-caitanya/ Christ, Krishna, Caitanya]'', [http://harmonist.us/ The Harmonist], May 31, 2009.{{better source|date=June 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2015}}</blockquote>

The [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model, and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition. In Western countries, Vedanta has influenced some Christian thinkers (see also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]]), while others in the anti-cult movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant gurus and their followers.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Islam===
{{main|Hindu–Islamic relations}}

Hindu–Islamic relations began when Islamic influence first came to be found in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early 7th century. [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]] are two of the world’s four largest religions. Hinduism is the socio-religious way of life of the Hindu people of the [[Indian subcontinent]], their diaspora, and some other regions which had Hindu influence in the ancient and medieval times. Islam is a [[tawhid|strictly]] [[monotheistic]] religion in which the supreme deity is [[Allah]] ({{lang-ar|الله}} {{transl|ar|"the God"}}: see [[God in Islam]]), the [[Islamic prophets|last Islamic prophet]] being [[Muhammad|Muhammad ibn Abdullah]], whom Muslims believe delivered the Islamic scripture, the [[Qur'an]]. Hinduism mostly shares common terms with the other [[Indian religions]], including [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Islam shares common characteristics with [[Abrahamic religions]]–those religions claiming descent from the [[prophet]] [[Abraham]]–being, from oldest to youngest, [[Judaism]], Christianity, Islam.

The [[Quran|Qur'an]] is the primary Islamic scripture. Muslims believe it to be the verbatim, uncreated word of Allah. Second to this in religious authority, and whence many practices of Islam derive, especially for [[Sunni]]s, are the [[Sunni]] [[Six major hadith collections|six major collections]] of [[Hadith|hadīth]], which are traditional records of the [[Sunnah|sayings and acts]] of [[Muhammad]]. The scriptures of Hinduism are the ''Shrutis'' (the four ''[[Veda]]s'', which comprise the original Vedic Hymns, or Samhitas, and three tiers of commentaries upon the Samhitas, namely the Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads<ref>{{cite book|last=Klostermaier|first=Klaus K.|author-link=Klaus Klostermaier|title=A Survey of Hinduism.|year=2007|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-7914-7082-4|pages=46–49|edition=3.}}</ref>); Furthermore, Hinduism is also based on the ''[[Smritis]]'' (including the ''[[Ramayana|Rāmāyana]]'', the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad Gītā]]'' [part of the [[Mahabharata]] cycle], and the ''[[Puranas|Purānas]]''), which are considered to be of secondary authority and of human creation of sages but the 18 Puranas.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Hinduism and Judaism}}

Hinduism and Judaism are amongst the oldest existing religions in the world. They have shared a notable relationship throughout historical and modern times.

==Other religions==

===Baháʼí Faith===
{{Main|Baháʼí Faith and Hinduism}}
Hinduism is recognized in the [[Baháʼí Faith]] as one of four known religions and its scriptures are regarded as predicting the coming of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] ([[Kalki avatar]]). [[Krishna]] is included in the succession of [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestations of God]]. The authenticity of the [[Hindu texts|Hindu scriptures]] is seen as uncertain.<ref name="smith-indian-religions">{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith |title= Indian religions |year= 2000 |publisher= Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/195 195] |url= https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/195 }}</ref>

===Zoroastrianism===
{{See also|Zoroastrianism in India}}

Hinduism and Zoroastrianism share a common root in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]]. Zoroastrianism in India shares more than a thousand year of history with the culture and people of India. The Zoroastrians of India are called there [[Parsi]]s.

=== Yezidism ===
Recently, some people have found similarities between the customs of Hindus and [[Yazidis|Yezidis]], suggesting that in ancient times they may have even been one people.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yezidis and Hindus: Re-Uniting as One People|url=http://www.yeziditruth.org/yezidis-and-hindus-re-uniting-as-one-people|website=www.yeziditruth.org}}
