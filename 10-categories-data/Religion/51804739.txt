{{short description|Scholarly study of the Baháʼí Faith}}
The scholarly study of the [[Baháʼí Faith]], its [[Baháʼí teachings|teachings]], [[History of the Baháʼí Faith|history]] and [[Baháʼí literature|literature]] is currently conducted in a variety of venues, including institutes of the [[Baháʼí administration]] as well as non-affiliated universities.  Some scholars study some aspect of the Baháʼí Faith as part of research on related matters while others engage in Baháʼí studies as a primary focus of their research. Scholars' comments on the religion and its predecessor [[Bábism]] date back to the at least 1845, the year after its founding. Initially, they were often [[Orientalism|Orientalist]]s or [[Christian missionaries]] but through time both Baháʼís and non-Baháʼí researchers have addressed the religion especially in tune with the [[Growth of religion#Baháʼí Faith|growth of the religion]], which has been called significant.

==Baháʼí review==
{{main|Baháʼí review}}
Baháʼí scholars who are also members of the faith must submit their work for [[Baháʼí review|review]] by the [[Baháʼí administration]] and obtain prior approval. According to the administration of the religion, the purpose of the review is threefold:<ref>{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby}}</ref>

* To ensure the accuracy of the presentation of the teachings of the religion
* To protect the religion from misrepresentation by its own followers
* To ensure dignity of the form
