'''Animatism''' is a term coined by British [[anthropologist]] Robert Marett in the context of his teleological theory of the evolution of religion. It refers to "a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control".<ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340">Ferraro, Gary. 2008. ''Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective, 7th ed.'' Belmont, CA: Thompson Wadsworth. p. 340</ref> Marett argues that certain cultures believe "people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural."<ref name="Ferraro, Gary 2008. p. 340" /> ''[[Mana]]'', Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.<ref>Ferraro, Gary. 2008.

Animatism is a belief that inanimate, miraculous qualities exists in the natural world. It also talks about the belief that everything is infused with a life force giving each lifeless object personality or perception, but not a soul as in animism. It is a widespread belief among small-scale societies. In South Pacific regions, such as Melanesia and Polynesia, this belief comes in form of manaism, which is derived from mana<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mana {{!}} Polynesian and Melanesian religion|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mana-Polynesian-and-Melanesian-religion|access-date=2020-11-02|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Many indigenous cultures believe in animatism. They believe that worshipping inanimate objects will drive them away from the evil forces around.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Eswarappa|first=Kasi|title=Animatism|date=2019|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-27771-9_200238-1|work=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion|pages=1â€“4|editor-last=Leeming|editor-first=David A.|place=Berlin, Heidelberg|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27771-9_200238-1|isbn=978-3-642-27771-9|access-date=2020-10-05|last2=Mathew|first2=Gladis S.}}</ref> These groups also believe that the inanimate objects they worship have mystical powers that are sent by God to help them on Earth.<ref name=":0" />

== Manaism and Animatism ==
Manaism is derived from the Melanesian term "mana", which refers to the supernatural force or power that can be ascribed to either inanimate objects or humans . Although Manaism focuses on the mana, or power, the people who practiced this religion believes that once the mana appears as a supernatural attribute of people and objects. This idea can be compared to animatism because both believes on the supernatural forces that are endowed on inanimate objects, which is common among the primitive forms of religions. Like animatism, manaism is a widespread belief among small societies.
