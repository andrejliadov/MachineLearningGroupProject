'''Benzaiten''' ([[wiktionary:弁|弁]][[wiktionary:才|才]][[wiktionary:天|天]], [[wiktionary:弁|弁]][[wiktionary:財|財]][[wiktionary:天|天]]) (also known as '''Benten''')<ref name="Uga-Benzaiten">Ludvik, Catherine. “Uga-Benzaiten: The Goddess and the Snake.” Impressions, no. 33, 2012, pp. 94–109. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/42597966.</ref> is
a [[Japanese Buddhism|Japanese Buddhist]] goddess who originated from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Saraswati]].<ref>Catherine Ludvik (2001), From Sarasvati to Benzaiten, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Toronto, National Library of Canada; [https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/15465/1/NQ58639.pdf PDF Download]</ref> Worship of Benzaiten arrived in Japan during the 6th through 8th centuries, mainly via the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translations of the ''[[Sutra of Golden Light]]'', which has a section devoted to her. She is also mentioned in the [[Lotus Sutra]] and often depicted holding a ''[[biwa]]'', a traditional Japanese lute, just as Saraswati holds a [[veena]]. Benzaiten is a [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|syncretic]] entity with both a Buddhist and a [[Shinto]] aspect. Benzaiten was worshiped as the personification of wisdom in the Tokugawa period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacWilliams|first=Mark W.|date=1997|title=Temple Myths and the Popularization of Kannon Pilgrimage in Japan: A Case Study of Ōya-ji on the Bandō Route|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2639|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|volume=24-25|pages=397}}</ref>

==Transfer from India to Japan==
[[File:INOKASHIRA1.jpg|thumb|left|Benzaiten shrine, [[Inokashira Park]], Tokyo]]
Referred to as  ''Sarasvatî Devî'' in [[Sanskrit]] (meaning "Goddess Saraswati"),<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/shailaja-tripathi-on-a-photo-exhibition-on-hindu-deities-and-indian-culture-in-japan/article8374655.ece  Saraswati meets Buddha, SHAILAJA TRIPATHI, The Hindu, March 21, 2016 ]</ref> Benzaiten is the goddess of everything that flows: water, time, words, speech, eloquence, music and by extension, knowledge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.artstor.org/#/asset/SS36617_36617_32702787;prevRouteTS=1543257931615|title=Artstor|last=Artstor|website=library.artstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> The original characters used to write her name read "Biancaitian" in Chinese and "Bensaiten" in Japanese (辯才天) and reflect her role as the goddess of eloquence. Because the [[Sutra of Golden Light]] promised protection of the state, in Japan she became a protector-deity, at first of the state and then of people. Lastly, she became one of the [[Seven Gods of Fortune]] (''fukujin'') when the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese characters]] used to write her name changed to 弁財天 (Benzaiten), emphasizing her role in bestowing monetary fortune. Sometimes she is called '''Benten''', or ''Benzaitennyo'' (弁才天女), where the final ''tennyo'' (天女) translates as "goddess".

When [[Kisshōten|Kisshoutennyo]] is counted among the [[Seven Lucky Gods|seven fukujin]] and fellow fukujin [[Daikokuten#Goddess Daikokutennyo|Daikoku]] is regarded in feminine form, together with Benzaitennyo all three of the Hindu [[Tridevi]] are represented in the fukujin.

[[File:Benzaiten.jpg|thumb|Benzaiten in Japan (above) is often shown holding a [[biwa]], just as the Hindu goddess Saraswati (from whom she is derived) is often portrayed with a [[veena]] in India and Bali (Indonesia). Her temples are more common on islands and coastal regions of Japan.<ref>T. Suzuki (1907), [http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2130&context=ocj The seven gods of bliss], The Open Court, 1907 (7), 2</ref>]]
In the [[Rig-Veda]] (6.61.7) Sarasvati is credited with killing the three-headed [[Vritra]] also known as Ahi ("snake"). Vritra is also strongly associated with rivers, as is Sarasvati. This is probably one of the sources of Sarasvati/Benzaiten's close association with snakes and dragons in [[Japan]].  She is enshrined on numerous locations throughout Japan; for example, the [[Enoshima]] Island in [[Sagami Bay]], the [[Chikubu Island]] in [[Lake Biwa]] and the [[Itsukushima]] Island in [[Seto Inland Sea]] (Japan's Three Great Benzaiten Shrines); and she and a five-headed [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] are the central figures of the [[Enoshima Engi]], a history of the shrines on Enoshima written by the Japanese Buddhist monk [[Kōkei (monk)|Kōkei]] (皇慶) in AD 1047. According to Kōkei, Benzaiten is the third daughter of the dragon-king of Munetsuchi (無熱池; literally "lake without heat"), known in Sanskrit as [[Anavatapta]], the lake lying at the center of the world according to an ancient Buddhist cosmological view.

Earlier documents such as those recorded by Buddhist monks link the periodic appearance of comets with the goddess Benzaiten. For example, the comet that appeared in 552 AD, and again in late 593 AD were associated with deity Benzaiten.<ref>Juhl et al, [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/1184.pdf DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE FOR THE APPARITION OF A COMET IN LATE 593 AND EARLY 594 AD], Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII (2007), Antarctic Institute of Canada</ref> These records suggest that the exchange of cultural and spiritual ideas from Buddhism and Hinduism in India to Japan, through deities such as Benzaiten, occurred well before the 5th century.

Two qualities of Saraswati that were transposed to the Buddhist version of Benzaiten are music and wisdom. She is sometimes referred to as Myoonten "goddess of wonderful sounds."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ywz2XOlqEcC&pg=PA279|title=Strategies in the study of religions.

==Benzaiten as a ''kami'' (God)==
Benzaiten is a female ''[[kami]]'' to Shinto with the name {{nihongo|Ichikishima-hime-no-mikoto|市杵島姫命}}.<ref name=bocking>{{cite book|last=Bocking|first=Brian|title=A Popular Dictionary of Shinto - 'Benzaiten' |year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7007-1051-5}}</ref> She is also believed by [[Tendai]] Buddhists to be the essence of the ''kami'' [[Ugajin]], whose effigy she sometimes carries on her head together with a ''[[torii]]'' (see photo above).<ref>{{EOS|Ugajin|200|Itō, Satoshi|August 15, 2011}}</ref> As a consequence, she is sometimes also known as {{nihongo|Uga|宇賀}} Benzaiten or Uga Benten.<ref name="Uga-Benzaiten"/> Shrine pavilions called either [[Bentendo|Benten-dō]] or {{nihongo|Benten-sha|弁天社}}, or even entire [[Shinto shrine]]s can be dedicated to her, as in the case of Kamakura's [[Zeniarai Benzaiten Ugafuku Shrine]] or Nagoya's [[Kawahara Shrine]]. Benzaiten, in Japanese mythology, is also one of the [[Seven Lucky Gods]].
