'''Growth of religion''' is the spread of [[religion]]s and the increase of religious adherents around the world. Statistics commonly measure the absolute number of adherents, the percentage of the absolute growth per year, and the growth of the number of [[Religious conversion|converts]] in the world. Such forecasts cannot be validated empirically and remain contentious, but are useful for comparisons.

Studies in the [[21st century]] suggest that, in terms of percentage and worldwide spread,<ref name="Wiley-Blackwell"/><ref name="mjohnson"/> [[Islam]] is the fastest-growing major religion in the world.

A few cross-national surveys do contain questions about religious switching, but even in those surveys, it is difficult to assess whether more people leave Islam than enter the faith. In some countries, legal and social consequences make conversion difficult, and survey respondents may be reluctant to speak honestly about the topic. Additionally, for many Muslims, Islam is not just a religion but an ethnic or cultural identity that does not depend on whether a person actively practices the faith. This means that even nonpracticing or secular Muslims may still consider themselves, and be viewed by their neighbors, as Muslims.}}</ref><ref name=locapo>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/apostasy.pdf Laws Criminalizing Apostasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011180050/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/apostasy.pdf |date=11 October 2017 }} Library of Congress (2014)</ref><ref>[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e174 Apostasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904042337/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e174 |date=4 September 2014 }} Oxford Islamic Studies Online, Oxford University Press (2012)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indy100.com/article/the-countries-where-apostasy-is-punishable-by-death--Z110j2Uwxb|title=The countries where apostasy is punishable by death|date=7 May 2017|website=indy100|language=en|access-date=23 April 2020}}</ref> Statistical data on conversion to and from [[Islam]] are scarce.<ref name=":1" /> According to [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research]], what little information is available suggests that [[religious conversion]] has no net impact on the Muslim population as the number of people who [[convert to Islam]] is roughly similar to those [[Apostasy in Islam|who leave Islam]].<ref name="Pew2011Muslim">{{cite report |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/ |title=The Future of the Global Muslim Population |date=27 January 2011|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="FastestGrowing">{{cite web |title=Why Muslims are the world's fastest-growing religious group |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/23/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-growing-religious-group/ |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|url= https://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/future-of-the-global-muslim-population-related-factors/#conversion |title= The Future of the Global Muslim Population|quote= there is no substantial net gain or loss in the number of Muslims through conversion globally; the number of people who become Muslims through conversion seems to be roughly equal to the number of Muslims who leave the faith}}</ref> 

Some religions [[proselytism|proselytise]] vigorously ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], for example), others (such as [[Judaism]]) do not generally encourage [[religious conversion|conversion]]s into their ranks. Some faiths grow exponentially at first, only for their zeal to wane (note the case of [[Zoroastrianism]]). The growth of a religion can clash with factors such as [[religious persecution|persecution]], entrenched rival religions (such as [[established religion]]s), and religious [[market saturation]].<ref>

According to a survey of [[religion in China]] in the year 2010, the number of people practicing some form of [[Chinese folk religion]] is near to 950 million (70% of the Chinese),<ref name="CSLS2010">2010 Chinese Jesus Life Survey conducted by Dr. Yang Fenggang, Purdue University's Center on Religion and Chinese Society.

This growth reverses the rapid decline that Chinese traditional religion faced in the 20th century.<ref name="Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31">Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31</ref> Moreover, Chinese religion has also spread throughout the world following the [[Chinese emigration|emigration of Chinese populations]], with 672,000 adherents in Canada as of 2010.<ref name="Johnson, Grim. 2013. p. 31"/>

According to scholars, the rebirth of Chinese traditional religion in China is faster and larger than the spread of other religions in the country, such as [[Buddhism]] and Christianity:<ref>Ruokanen, Huang. 2011. p. 171</ref>
{{blockquote|Since the 1980s, with the gradual opening of society, folk religion has begun to recover. Especially in the rural areas, the speed and scale of its development are much faster and larger than is the case with Buddhism and Christianity [...] in Zhejiang province, where Christianity is better established than elsewhere, temples of folk religion are usually twenty or even a hundred times as numerous as Christian church buildings.}}

The number of adherents of the Chinese traditional religion is difficult to count, because of :<ref name="Chen, Jeung. 2012. p. 200">Chen, Jeung. 2012. p. 200</ref>
{{blockquote|Chinese rarely use the term "religion" for their popular religious practices, and they also do not utilize a vocabulary that they "believe in" gods or truths. Instead, they engage in religious acts that assume a vast array of gods and spirits and that also assume the efficacy of these beings in intervening in this world.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yf2lb2YSgSwC&pg=PA200|title=Sustaining Faith Traditions: Race, Ethnicity, and Religion among the Latino|isbn=9780814717370|page=200|last1=Chen|first1=Carolyn|last2=Jeung|first2=Russell|date=2012}}</ref>}}

The [[Chinese folk religion]] is a "diffused religion" rather than "institutional".<ref name="Chen, Jeung. 2012. p. 200"/> It is a meaning system of social solidarity and identity, ranging from the [[Chinese lineage associations|kinship systems]] to the community, the state, and the economy, that serves to integrate [[Chinese culture]].<ref name="Chen, Jeung. 2012. p. 200"/>

Like other religious traditions present during the time period of the classical era, Hinduism flourished under various empires which supported the religion. Rulers sponsored [[Hindu temples]] and art, while also supporting other religious communities. Of note is the [[Khmer Empire]], which extended over large parts of Southeast Asia. During the reign of Suryavarman II, Vaishnavism spread throughout the empire. The famous [[Angkor Wat]] temple in Cambodia was commissioned during this time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Suryavarman-II|title=Suryavarman II {{!}} Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref>

In India, Islam was brought by various traders and rulers from Afghanistan and other places.
According to other scholars, many converted for a whole host of reasons, the main statement of which was evangelization by Muslims, though there were several instances where some were pressured to convert owing to internal violence and friction between the Christian and Muslim communities, according to historian [[Philip Jenkins]].<ref>Jenkins, Philip.

== Overall statistics ==
=== Data collection ===
Statistics on religious adherence are difficult to gather and often contradictory; statistics for the change of religious adherence are even more so, requiring multiple surveys separated by many years using the same data gathering rules. This has only been achieved in rare cases, and then only for particular countries, such as the [[American Religious Identification Survey]]<ref name="cuny1">{{cite web |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/GC-Faculty-Activities/ARIS--American-Religious-Identification-Survey/Key-findings |title=American Religious Identification Survey, Key Findings |website=The Graduate Center of the City University of New York |date=October 2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414233611/http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Faculty/GC-Faculty-Activities/ARIS--American-Religious-Identification-Survey/Key-findings |archive-date=14 April 2012}}</ref> in the United States, or census data from Australia (which has included a voluntary religious question since 1911).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/cowsredirect|title=Redirect to Census data page|first=c=AU; o=Commonwealth of Australia; ou=Australian Bureau of|last=Statistics|website=abs.gov.au}}</ref>

Professor [[Eric Kaufmann]], whose academic specialization is how [[demography]] affects irreligion/religion/politics, wrote in 2012:
{{Cquote|In my book, ''Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century'', I argue that 97% of the world's population growth is taking place in the [[developing world]], where 95% of people are religious.

On the other hand, the secular [[Western World|West]] and [[East Asia]] has very low fertility and a rapidly aging population. The demographic disparity between the religious, growing [[global South]] and the aging, secular global North will peak around 2050. In the coming decades, the developed world's demand for workers to pay its pensions and work in its service sector will soar alongside the booming supply of young people in the third world. Ergo, we can expect significant immigration to the secular West which will import religious revival on the back of ethnic change. In addition, those with religious beliefs tend to have higher birth rates than the secular population, with fundamentalists having far larger families. The epicentre of these trends will be in immigration gateway cities like [[New York City|New York]] (a third white), [[Amsterdam]] (half Dutch), [[Los Angeles]] (28% white), and [[London]], 45% [[white British]].<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/eric-kaufmann/london-a-rising-island-of-religion_b_2336699.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uc2VydmFwZWRpYS5jb20vRGVzZWN1bGFyaXphdGlvbg&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFTV1AssJyEd3A8dcFq_WvFF4QxVT23-m6-beSE1YDL9F_0ff4V-yD0PO2ecnPsCF9soi1pCyjqUteuPOq1e1iLWwCZLceYmo4pM2K_aJ2SlfEPxnpd0xitAZDbm4hh2afzblouhRoYVsgYGPAQVyetqyP8yQYwVMdV5VeRtryqV London: A Rising Island of Religion in a Secular Sea] by Eric Kaufmann, ''HuffPost'', 21 December 2012</ref>}}
