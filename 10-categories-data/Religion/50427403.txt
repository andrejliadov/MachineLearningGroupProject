{{main article|International Date Line}}
The '''international date line<ref group="note">In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.</ref>  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sunset to sunset rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sunset ending and starting one day and starts being the sunset ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.<ref>See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.</ref> In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.<ref name=kashrus/><ref name=chabad/><ref name="taarich">{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=map>[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB</ref>

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,<ref name=kashrus>{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |date=15 August 2013|publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=chabad/><ref>Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b</ref> which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.<ref>To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]</ref> If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin<ref name="taarich" /> at footnote 16 of the web page.}}<ref name="RJJ">This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.</ref> that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.<ref name=kashrus/><ref name=chabad/>

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.<ref name=kashrus/><ref name=chabad/>

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.<ref name=kashrus/><ref name=chabad>{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref>}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.<ref name=map/>

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.<ref name=chabad/><ref name=gewirtz>{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}</ref>{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.<ref name=chabad/>{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin<ref name=chabad/>{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz<ref name=gewirtz/>{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,<ref>[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]</ref> New Zealand,<ref>[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]</ref> Hawaii,<ref>[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]</ref> and [[French Polynesia]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}</ref> all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.<ref name=jta>The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located a single relatively observant Jew living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.</ref> However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday<ref name=jta/>—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.<ref name=worker>See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|date=5 September 2005|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".<!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--></ref>{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,<ref name=kashrus/> which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.<ref name=kashrus/> 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,<ref name=map/> including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,<ref name=kashrus/> so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.<ref name="heber2">{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa?

The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.<ref name=worker/><ref>{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref> Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.<ref name=heber2/>

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:<ref name=kashrus/>
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin,<ref name="taarich" /> which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.<ref>{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}</ref><ref name=standard /> [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C.
