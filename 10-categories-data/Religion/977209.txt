'''Religious cosmology''' is an explanation of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe, from a religious perspective. This may include beliefs on origin in the form of a [[creation myth]], subsequent evolution, current organizational form and nature, and eventual fate or destiny. There are various traditions in religion or [[Religion and mythology|religious mythology]] asserting how and why everything is the way it is and the significance of it all. Religious cosmologies describe the spatial lay-out of the universe in terms of the world in which people typically dwell as well as other dimensions, such as the seven dimensions of religion; these are ritual, experience and emotional, narrative and mythical, doctrinal, ethical, social, and material. Religious mythologies may include descriptions of an act or process of [[Creation myth|creation]] by a [[creator deity]] or a larger [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of deities, explanations of the transformation of chaos into order, or the assertion that existence is a matter of endless cyclical transformations. Religious cosmology differs from a strictly scientific [[cosmology]] informed by the results of the study of [[astronomy]] and similar fields, and may differ in conceptualizations of the world's physical structure and place in the universe, its creation, and forecasts or predictions on its future. The scope of religious cosmology is more inclusive than a strictly [[Scientific method|scientific]] cosmology ([[physical cosmology]]) in that religious cosmology is not limited to experiential observation, testing of hypotheses, and proposals of theories; for example, religious cosmology may explain why everything is the way it is or seems to be the way it is and prescribing what humans should do in context. Variations in religious cosmology include those of Indian origin, such as [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Hindu]], and [[Jain]]; the religious beliefs of China; and, the beliefs of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]], such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Religious cosmologies have often developed into the formal logics of [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]], such as [[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Daoism]], [[Kabbalah]], or the [[great chain of being]].

====Biblical cosmology====
{{Main|Genesis creation narrative}}
The universe of the ancient Israelites was made up of a [[Flat Earth|flat disc-shaped earth]] floating on water, [[heaven]] above, [[underworld]] below.<ref name="Aune2003p119">{{harvnb|Aune|2003|p=119}}</ref> Humans inhabited earth during life and the underworld after death, and the underworld was morally neutral;<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2002|pp=117, 124–125}}</ref> only in [[Hellenistic]] times (after c.330 BC) did Jews begin to adopt the [[Hades|Greek idea]] that it would be a place of punishment for misdeeds, and that the righteous would enjoy an [[afterlife]] in heaven.<ref name="Lee 2010 77–78">{{harvnb|Lee|2010|pp=77–78}}</ref> In this period too the older three-level cosmology was widely replaced by the Greek concept of a [[spherical earth]] suspended in [[space]] at the [[geocentric|centre]] of a number of [[Celestial spheres|concentric heavens]].<ref name="Aune2003p119"/>

====Ex nihilo====
{{see also|Ex nihilo|Creationism}}
The belief that God created matter is called ''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''.  It is the accepted orthodoxy of most denominations of Judaism and Christianity. Most denominations of Christianity and Judaism believe that a single, uncreated God was responsible for the creation of the cosmos.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic cosmology|Sufi cosmology}}
[[File:Islamic cosmology.jpg|thumb|Cosmology according to [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]]. The Earth is considered flat and surrounded by a series of mountains—including [[Mount Qaf]]. Earth is supported by an ox that stands on Bahamut dwelling in a cosmic ocean; the ocean is inside a bowl that sits on top of an angel or [[jinn]].<ref>Zakariya al-Qazwini. ''ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt'' (The Wonders of Creation). Original published in 1553 AD</ref>]]

Islam teaches that God created the universe, including Earth's physical environment and human beings. The highest goal is to visualize the cosmos as a book of symbols for meditation and contemplation for spiritual upliftment or as a prison from which the human soul must escape to attain true freedom in the spiritual journey to God.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e459?_hi=10&_pos=2 |title = Cosmology |publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online}}</ref>

Below here there are some other citations from the Quran on cosmology.

"And the heavens We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander." 51:47 Sahih International

"Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined
together (as one unit of creation), before We clove them asunder? We made
from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?"
21:30 Yusuf Ali translation

"The day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll rolled up for books
(completed),- even as We produced the first creation, so shall We produce a
new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it."
21:104 Yusuf Ali translation

Expanding on the belief that creation occurred over a period of six days, the Muslim thinker [[Nasir Khusraw]] writes that creation occurs in six cycles, demarcated by the arrival of God’s messengers (''ṣāḥibān-i adwār''). This culminates in the arrival of the [[Al-Qa'im Al Muhammad|Lord of the Resurrection]] (''Qāʾim al-Qiyāma''), representing the seventh day, when the world will come out of darkness and ignorance and “into the light of her Lord” (Quran 39:69). His era, unlike that of the enunciators of divine revelation (''nāṭiqs''), before him, is not one where God prescribes the people to work, rather his is an era of reward for those “who laboured in fulfilment of (the Prophets') command and with knowledge”.<ref>Virani, Shafique N. “The Days of Creation in the Thought of Nasir Khusraw.” In Nasir Khusraw: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow.

In [[Buddhism]], like other Indian religions, there is no ultimate beginning nor final end to the universe.

<poem>
''Neither being (sat) nor non-being was as yet. What was concealed?
And where? And in whose protection?…Who really knows?
Who can declare it? Whence was it born, and whence came this creation?
The devas (gods) were born later than this world's creation,
so who knows from where it came into existence? None can know from where
creation has arisen, and whether he has or has not produced it.
He who surveys it in the highest heavens,
He alone knows or perhaps He does not know."

===Jain===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}
Jain cosmology considers the ''[[loka]]'', or universe, as an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, having no beginning or an end.<ref>“This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone; It is self sustaining, without any base or support” “Nishpaadito Na Kenaapi Na Dhritah Kenachichch Sah Swayamsiddho Niradhaaro Gagane Kimtvavasthitah” [Yogaśāstra of Ācārya Hemacandra 4.106] Tr by Dr. A. S. Gopani</ref> [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]] describe the shape of the universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. This Universe, according to Jainism, is narrow at the top, broad at the middle and once again becomes broad at the bottom.<ref>See Hemacandras description of universe in Yogaśāstra “…Think of this loka as similar to man standing akimbo…”4.103-6</ref>

[[Mahapurana (Jainism)|{{IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}]] of Ācārya [[Jinasena]] is famous for this quote:
{{Quote|Some foolish men declare that a creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.}}

==Gnosticism==
[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] teachings were contemporary with those of Neoplatonism. Gnosticism is an imprecise label, covering monistic as well as dualistic conceptions. Usually the higher worlds of Light, called the [[Pleroma]] or "fullness", are radically distinct from the lower world of Matter.  The emanation of the Pleroma and its godheads (called ''Aeons'') is described in detail in the various Gnostic tracts, as is the pre-creation crisis (a cosmic equivalent to the "fall" in [[Christianity|Christian]] thought) from which the material world comes about, and the way that the divine spark can attain salvation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guiley|first1=Rosemary Ellen|title=The Encyclopedia of Saints|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofsa00guil|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York, NY|isbn=1438130260|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofsa00guil/page/396 396]}}</ref>
