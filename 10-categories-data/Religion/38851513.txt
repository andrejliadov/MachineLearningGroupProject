The '''Xiaodao Lun''' is an anti-[[Daoism|Daoist]] polemic written in 570 for the [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] (543–578) by the Buddhist courtier [[Zhen Luan]]. After holding several inconclusive debates in the court, Emperor Wu commissioned the ''Xiaodao Lun'' as one of two reports examining the suitability of sponsoring either Buddhism or Daoism as a [[state religion]] for the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty, with a view towards unifying China. The ''Xiaodao Lun'' mocked Daoist practices, accused Daoists of plagiarizing Buddhist texts, and portrayed the religion as dangerous to social stability. Its advice was disregarded by the Emperor, who supported the preservation of Daoism, but his dynasty was ultimately short-lived. Zhen Luan's ''Xiaodao Lun'' is preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] and is consulted for its quotations of Daoist texts that have not been preserved until today.

==Background==
The Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' in China held Buddhism to be superior to Daoism, whose canon it regarded as "heretical" (''xié'' {{lang|zh|邪}}) and "false sutra" (''wěijīng'' {{lang|zh|伪经}}).<ref name="Mollier">{{cite book|title=Buddhism and Taoism Face to Face: Scripture, Ritual, and Iconographic Exchange in Medieval China|first=Christine|last=Mollier|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|page=12}}</ref> [[Daoism|Daoists]], for their part, published the ''[[Huahujing]]'' in the 4th century, which argued that [[Chinese Buddhism]] was a simplified form of Daoism, developed during the travels of the Daoist philosopher [[Laozi]] while he was in India.<ref name="Hussein">{{cite journal|title=Laughing at the Tao: Debates among Buddhists and Taoists in Medieval China by [[Livia Kohn]] (review)|first=Farzeen|last=Farzeen Baldrian-Hussein|pages=361–363|volume=55|number=2|date=October 1996|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|doi=10.2307/1178836}}</ref> One organized Daoist-Buddhist debate was organized in 520 by the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty (386–535), and a second was organized in 570 by the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty (557-581), prompted by the proposal by the Buddhist [[Wei Yuansong]] ({{lang|zh|卫元嵩}}) to make the Emperor a divine Buddhist ruler and to weaken the Buddhist ''sangha'''s independence from the state.<ref name="Komjathy">{{cite book|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions|editor1-first=Randall L|editor1-last=Nadeau|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2012|chapter=The Daoist Tradition in China|first=Louis|last=Komjathy|pages=179–180}}</ref>

The debate was inconclusive, so the [[Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou]] (543–578) commissioned comparative reports on the suitability of Buddhism and Daoism as [[state religion]]s, resulting in the ''Xiaodao Lun'' by official Zhen Luan, and ''[[Erjiao Lun]]'' ({{lang|zh|二教论}}) by [[Dao An]].<ref name="Komjathy"/><ref name="Kohn">{{cite book|title=Daoism Handbook|first=Livia|last=Kohn|publisher=Brill|year=2000|editor1-first=Livia|editor1-last=Kohn|chapter=The Northern Celestial Masters|pages=288–289}}</ref> Submitted in 570 as the ''Xiaodao Lun'', Zhen's report denied that Daoism had any value and ridiculed the religion's exorcisms, talismans, and internal inconsistencies.<ref name="Hussein"/><ref name="Kohn"/>

==Author==
The author of the ''Xiaodao Lun'' was [[Zhen Luan]], an [[apostate]] from Daoism who lived during the [[Northern Zhou]] dynasty (557-581).<ref name="Biblio">{{cite book|title=Bibliography on East Asian and Philosophy|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=2001|page=199}}</ref> Zhen Luan was a [[scholar-official]] for Emperor Wu's court who also served as a [[commandant]], [[mathematician]], and [[astronomer]].<ref name="Hussein"/> Zhen trained in a Daoist congregation,<ref name="Wile"/> but converted to Buddhism out of disgust with [[Daoist sexual practices]].<ref name="Hussein"/><ref name="Gulik"/> He wrote the ''Xiaodao Lun'' after attending three of the Buddhist-Daoist debates sponsored by Emperor Wu.<ref name="Bokenkamp"/>

==Contents==
The ''Xiaodan Lun'' is written in 36 sections in an imitation of the [[Daozang|Daoist canon]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Mysticism: Philosophy and Soteriology in the Taoist Tradition|first=Livia|last=Köhn|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1992|page=149}}</ref> and aimed to show that the mythology, rituals, and practices of Daoism were inconsistent and absurd.<ref name="Biblio"/> Zhen's text criticizes not those scripture which were most important to contemporary Daoist practice, but those which were easiest to ridicule, such as "The Size of the Sun and the Moon".<ref name="Kirkland"/>  In addition, the treatise references Daoist texts from the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] and [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Tianshi]] schools of Daoism disproportionately to those from the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] school.<ref name="Kirkland"/>

The polemic accuses Daoists of "stealing" (''qiè'' {{lang|zh|窃}}) the Buddhist [[Lotus Sutra]] for use in Daoist scripture.<ref name="Mollier"/> Zhen further charged the Daoists of not fully understanding the Buddhist texts that they plagiarized.<ref name="Bokenkamp">{{cite book|title=Chinese Buddhist Apocrypha|editor1-first=Robert E|editor1-last=Buswell|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1990|first=Stephen R|last=Bokenkamp|chapter=Stages of Transcendence}}</ref> These criticisms prompted some internal Daoist reform, as the Buddhist encyclopedia ''[[Fayuan Zhulin]]'' (668) noted the replacement of Buddhist terminology in Daoist texts with more native Chinese terms.<ref name="Bokenkamp"/>

The ''Xiaodao Lun'' was the most lurid and complete account of [[Daoist sexual practices]] that anti-Daoist polemicists used to attack the religion,<ref name="Wile">{{cite book|title=Art of the Bedchamber: The Chinese Sexual Yoga Classics Including Women's Solo Meditation Texts|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1992|chapter=Sexual Practices and Taoism|pages=25–26|first=Douglas|last=Wile}}</ref> including [[group sex]] and [[partner swapping]].<ref name="Gulik">{{cite book|title=Sexual Life in Ancient China|first=Robert H Van|last=Gulik|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1974|page=89}}</ref> Another argument of the ''Xiaodao Lun'' implicated Daoism in general for various [[List of peasant revolts|peasant revolts]], including the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] (184–205), whose organizers were associated with secret Daoist societies.<ref name="Lagerwey">{{cite book|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 AD)|volume=1|first=John|last=Lagerwey|first2=Pengzhi|last2=Lü|publisher=Brill|year=2010|pages=198–199}}</ref>

==Aftermath of publication==
The Emperor largely disregarded the conclusions of the ''Xiaodao Lun'', positively interpreting Zhen's examples of alleged Daoist plagiarism of Buddhist texts, as increasing Daoism's appeal as a unifying ideology for the Zhou realm.<ref name="Hussein"/> Emperor Wu went on to found the [[Tongdao Guan]] ({{lang|zh|通道观}}) for Daoist research, which would eventually compile the first Daoist encyclopedia, the [[Wushang Biyao]] ({{lang|zh|无上秘要}}).<ref name="Komjathy"/> However, Emperor Wu would not achieve his goal of [[Chinese reunification]], which was achieved by the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618), who favored Buddhism over Daoism.<ref name="Kohn"/>
