'''''Gravi de pugna''''' is a [[pseudepigrapha|forged]]<!--For the preference of this term over the more conventional ''[[pseudepigrapha]]'', see Bart Ehrman ''Forged''--> letter written in the name of [[Augustine of Hippo]] which asserts that the morally superior side is always superior in battle and therefore that wars are proven to be [[just war]]s by their military success. The letter was widely accepted as authentic, and reassured soldiers that [[Gott mit uns|God was on their side]].

{{quotebox|width=25em|align=right|quote="You are concerned with whether you will prevail in battle: I don't wish you to doubt... when you are fighting God will look down from heaven, and discern which side is just and give that side the victory"|source=''Gravi de pugna'', translated by David A. Lenihan.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=58-59}}}}

''Gravi de pugna'' is best known for its simple assertion that [[God in Christianity|God]] will assure that the morally superior side will win military battles,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and conversely, that victory itself validates that the use of force was appropriate.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}{{efn|This is a form of the [[just-world hypothesis]].}} Udo Heyn claims this was a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] notion,{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}{{efn|See {{section link|Trial by combat#Origins}}, which also ascribes Germanic origins to that practice.}} and Phillip Wynn reports that it had long been believed in pagan antiquity by the time of this letter.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} This understanding was, in fact, utterly rejected by Augustine.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}} Kelly DeVries regards the theology of ''Gravi de pugna'' as shallow and considers it to raise problems of [[theodicy]] and legitimacy as soon as the first Christian army loses.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}

Gravi also urges prayer for victory before battle, which was also rejected by Augustine, who found such prayers inappropriate.{{sfn|Wynn|2013|p=302}}

== History ==
''Gravi de pugna'' was written in the fifth century.{{sfn|Heyn|1997|p=19}}
The letter was widely accepted as authentic from its introduction through the medieval era,{{sfn|Lenihan|1988}}{{sfn|Russell|1977}} and was the most frequently cited text in this period on holy war.{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}} It was invoked to justify numerous wars, including by [[Hincmar of Reims]], [[Rabanus Maurus]], [[Sedulius Scottus]], [[Ivo of Chartres]], and [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=29,37,38}} It was also recited at the [[Siege of Lisbon]] in {{CE|1147}}.{{sfn|DeVries|1999|p=87}}
''Gravi'' imbued the [[Crusaders]] with confidence that God was on their side, squelching all moral concerns and leading to behavior that did not comply with then-accepted [[rules of war]].{{sfn|Chan|2016|p=17}}

The work lost influence with the [[renaissance of the 12th century]], which developed more sophisticated [[jurisprudence]] and moral reasoning,{{sfn|Russell|1977|p=27}} At the same time, Augustine's own opinions on just wars, which had been largely unknown, were studied by the [[decretists]] and through them, [[Aquinas]] as well.{{sfn|Lenihan|1996|p=76-77}}{{sfn|Cowdrey|2014|pp=23-24}} The authenticity of ''Gravi de Pugna'' was not conclusively rejected until [[Erasmus]].{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=37-38}}
Although it is regarded by contemporary scholars as "obviously un-Augustinian",{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=59}}
it is now widely recognized that ''Gravi de pugna'' has inaccurately influenced scholars of Augustine's views on war even up through modern times.{{sfn|Lenihan|1988|p=38}}{{sfn|Cowdrey|2003|p=178}}
