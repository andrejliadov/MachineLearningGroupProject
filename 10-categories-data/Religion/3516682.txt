The '''chaplain general''' is a senior chaplain in non-church organisations, such as the British and Canadian armies, and is responsible for the supervision of chaplains conducting religious services and ceremonies, representing the Christian faith in that organisation, and providing pastoral care and support within the organisation.

==History==
The post of [[Royal Army Chaplains' Department#List of Chaplains General|Chaplain-General]] in the British Army dates from 1796, when the [[Army Chaplains' Department]] was formed.<ref name=Roper1998>{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660–1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey }}</ref>

During the [[First World War]], the chaplain-general [[John Taylor Smith]] was equivalent to a [[major general]] and under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. [[Llewellyn Henry Gwynne]] was from July 1915 deputy chaplain-general of the army in France, with the relative rank of major-general. Both had been colonial bishops prior to appointment.

In the [[Second World War]], the head of chaplaincy in the [[British Army]] was an ([[Anglican]]) chaplain-general, who was formally under the control of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.<ref>C. D. Symons, Chaplain-General to the Forces, 1939-44</ref> An Assistant Chaplain-General was a Chaplain 1st class (full [[Colonel]]) and a senior Chaplain was a Chaplain 2nd class ([[Lieutenant Colonel]]).<ref>Brumwell, P. Middleton (1943) ''The Army Chaplain: the Royal Army Chaplains' Department; the duties of chaplains and morale''. London: Adam & Charles Black</ref>

In 1948 the first [[Bishop to the Forces]] was appointed; the Bishop is a suffragan of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the full title of the Bishop to the Forces is "The Archbishop of Canterbury's Episcopal Representative to the Armed Forces". The Bishop to the Forces is not a [[military chaplain]].<ref name=crockfords100th>''[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]] 2008/2009 (100th ed.)'', London: Church House Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7151-1030-0}}</ref> The current holder of the office is [[Tim Thornton (bishop)|Tim Thornton]], [[Bishop at Lambeth]]. There is sometimes confusion between the (Anglican) "Bishop ''to'' the Forces" and the (Roman Catholic) [[Bishopric of the Forces|"Bishop ''of'' the Forces"]]: for this reason the latter is normally given his title in full, i.e. "The Roman Catholic Bishop of the Forces".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723200543/http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/Catholic-Church/The-Church-in-England-and-Wales/bishopric_of_the_forces |archivedate=23 July 2010 |df=dmy }}.

Each of the three armed services has a chief chaplain (ranking as an archdeacon), for the navy the [[Chaplain of the Fleet]], for the army the Chaplain-General, and for the Royal Air Force the [[Chaplain-in-Chief]].<ref>''Whitaker's Almanack''; 1972; 1988. London: J. Whitaker & Sons; pp. 459; (1988) 464</ref>

The [[Museum of Army Chaplaincy]] holds archive material and information relating to the history of the Chaplains General to the British Army both past and present.

==Outside Anglicanism==
[[Military Chaplain#Annual International Chiefs of Chaplains Conference|''Chaplain General'']] is also used as a term outside the Anglican Church, referring to the senior chaplain in a nation's military (sometimes called the ''Chief of Chaplains'', [[Chiefs of Chaplains of the United States|as in the United States military]]). Some nations, like [[South Africa]], [[Israel]], and [[Canada]], have one Chaplain General or Chief of Chaplains for the military as a whole; others, like the [[United States]], have one for each branch of the armed forces; while others have one for each major religion or faith group represented among its military personnel.
