{{short description|Religious views on the self}}
{{Rewrite|date=June 2019}}
'''Religious views on the self''' vary widely. The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of [[spirituality]]. In Western [[psychology]], the concept of [[self]] comes from [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers]] where the self is the [[inner critic]].

Some [[Eastern philosophies]] reject the self as a [[delusion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Conceptions_of_the_Self_in_Western_and_Eastern_Psychology|title=Conceptions of the Self in Western and Eastern Psychology|publisher=Chinese Buddhist Encyclopedia}}</ref> In [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]], the [[Raga (Buddhism)|attachment]] to [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] is an illusion that serves as the main cause of [[Dukkha|suffering]] and unhappiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerr.com/galin/papers/roots.htm|title=The concept "self" and "person" in buddhism and in western psychology|publisher=NY:Columbia University Press|date=2001|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>

==Discussion==
Human beings have a self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance.<ref>Charon, Joel M. ''Ten Questions: A Sociological Perspective.'' 5th edition. Thomson & Wadsworth. pg. 260</ref>

[[Christianity]] sees the self negatively, distorted through [[sin]]: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' ([[Jeremiah]] 17:9) Alternately, each human self or spirit is a unique creation by God. The "desperately wicked self" is the sinful self that has chosen to be "curved back upon itself", but ever with the potential of changing and (by God's grace) turning toward "'new life', opened out to love of God and neighbor".<ref>See Albert Outler as quoted in "Outler on the Holy Spirit" by George Aikinson, Bristol House, 2004 p.&nbsp;54. and p.&nbsp;87.</ref>

According to psychologist [[James Marcia]], identity comes from both political and religious views. Marcia also identified exploration and commitment as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. [[Erik Erikson]] compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kiesling, Chris; Montgomery, Marylin; Sorell, Gwendolyn; Colwell, Ronald. "Identity and Spirituality: A Psychosocial Exploration of the Sense of Spiritual Self"</ref>

One description of spirituality is the self's search for "ultimate meaning" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined on one's life and experiences. Another definition of spiritual identity is " a persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values." <ref name="ReferenceA"/> Another description of mind, body, soul, and spirit is a holism of one inner self being of one whole. It all combines together as one whole instead of different parts. Individuals one thoughts, one feeling, one breathing is all completed and occurs as one whole.  GT </truth knowledge of one self, and the universe.

==Bandura==
[[Albert Bandura]] believed in "[[self-efficacy]], which refers to a person's learned expectations of success."<ref>Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pg 478</ref> This theory states that people are bound to complete a task more effectively if they think they will succeed. If a person is more negative about their abilities the chances of them completing the task accordingly are less.

==Winnicott==
[[D. W. Winnicott]] was of the opinion that psychopathology was in large part generated by an overvaluation of the [[True self and false self|false self]], at the expense of the true self which was linked to the individual's own [[creativity]].<ref>Jeff Greenberg et al, ''Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychotherapy'' (2004) p. 454</ref>

==Rogers on self and self-concept==
[[Carl Rogers]]' theory is that "people use the term [[self concept]] to refer to all the information and beliefs you have as an individual regarding your own nature, unique qualities, and typical behaviors." <ref>Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. pg. 478</ref> Rogers thought that people develop through relationships with others and also in relation to themselves. An encouraging environment helps people towards this development.

Commenting on his clients' search for a real self, Rogers quoted with approval [[Kierkegaard]]'s statement that "the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest form of despair is to choose 'to be another than himself'. On the other hand, 'to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair'".<ref>Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming A Person'' (1961) p. 110</ref>

==The observing self==
The "Visible" self is mainly dependent on a subjective view, that is, as viewed from the specific self. For example: looking in the mirror, we perceive the reflection to be our true "self"....

==The witnessing self==
[[Ken Wilber]] describes the Witnessing (or Observing) Self in the following terms: 
:"This observing Self is usually called the Self with a capital ''S'', or the Witness, or pure [[Immanence|Presence]], or pure [[Awareness]], or [[Consciousness#Philosophical approaches|Consciousness]] as such, and this Self as transparent Witness is a direct ray of the living [[divinity|Divine]]. The ultimate "I AM" is [[Christ]], is [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], is [[shunyata|Emptiness]] itself: such is the startling testimony of the world's great [[mysticism|mystic]]s and [[wise old man|sage]]s." <ref name="wilber">Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', ch. 12, p.197-199</ref>

He adds that the self is not an [[Emergence|Emergent]], but an aspect present from the start as the basic form of awareness, but which becomes increasingly obvious and self-aware  "as growth and transcendence matures." As Depth increases, consciousness shines forth more noticeably, until:
:"shed[ding] its lesser identification with both the body and the mind ... in each case from matter to body to mind to Spirit... consciousness or the observing Self sheds an exclusive [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] with a lesser and shallower dimension, and opens up to deeper and higher and wider occasions, until it opens up to its own ultimate ground in Spirit itself. And the stages of transpersonal growth and development are basically the stages of following this Observing Self to its ultimate abode, which is pure Spirit or pure Emptiness, the ground, path and fruition of the entire display." <ref name="wilber" />

In a similar vein, [[Evelyn Underhill]]<ref name="Underhill">Evelyn Underhill, "Mysticism:  A Study in Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness, Section III, P. 55.</ref> states:
{{quote|It is clear that under ordinary conditions, and save for sudden gusts of "[[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Feeling" induced by some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the superficial self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent watcher—this "Dweller in the Innermost"—towards the incoming messages of the external world: nor of the activities which they awake in it. Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives from it, she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this subject and the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a deliberate inattention to the messages of the senses, such as that which is induced by contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of the soul, the seat of "Transcendental Feeling," within the area of consciousness: making it amenable to the activity of the will. Thus becoming unaware of his usual and largely fictitious "external world," another and more substantial set of perceptions, which never have their chance under normal conditions, rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal reasoning faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such exchange, such "losing to find," appears to be necessary, if man's transcendental powers are to have their full chance.}}
