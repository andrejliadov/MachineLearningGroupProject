'''Peter Claver''', ({{lang-es|Pedro Claver y Corberó}}, {{lang-ca|Pere Claver i Corberó}}) (26 June 1580 – 8 September 1654) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Jesuit]] [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and [[missionary]] born in [[Verdú]] ([[Catalonia, Spain]]) who, due to his life and work, became the [[patron saint]] of [[slavery|slaves]], the Republic of [[Colombia]], and ministry to [[African Americans]]. During the 40 years of his ministry in the New Kingdom of Granada, it is estimated he personally baptized around 300,000 people (in groups of 10) and heard the [[Confession (religion)|confessions]] of over 5,000 slaves per year. He is also patron saint for [[Merchant shipping|seafarers]]. He is considered a heroic example of what should be the Christian praxis of love and of the exercise of human rights.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=La virtud heroica del "esclavo de los esclavos" en ''Claver'', de Oswaldo Díaz Díaz |title= Más allá del héroe.

==Early life==
Claver was born in 1580 into a devoutly Catholic and prosperous farming family in the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] village of [[Verdú]],<ref name="suau">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11763a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Peter Claver|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027220144/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11763a.htm|archive-date=27 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Urgell]], located in the [[Province of Lleida]], about {{convert|54|mi|km}} from [[Barcelona]]. He was born 70 years after [[King Ferdinand of Spain]] set the colonial slavery culture into motion by authorizing the purchase of 250 African slaves in [[Lisbon]] for his territories in [[New Spain]].

Later, as a student at the [[University of Barcelona]],<ref name=suau/> Claver was noted for his intelligence and piety. After two years of study there, Claver wrote these words in the notebook he kept throughout his life: "I must dedicate myself to the service of God until death, on the understanding that I am like a slave."<ref name="peterclaver1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crisismagazine.com/2014/st-peter-claver-slave-slaves-forever|title=St. Peter Claver: Slave of the Slaves Forever|last=Sladxy|first=Joseph F.X.|date=September 8, 2014|website=Crisis Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423103937/http://www.crisismagazine.com/2014/st-peter-claver-slave-slaves-forever|archive-date=23 April 2016|access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref>

==In the New World==
After he had completed his studies, Claver entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Tarragona]] at the age of 20. When he had completed the [[novitiate]], he was sent to study philosophy at [[Palma, Mallorca]]. While there, he came to know the [[porter (monastery)|porter]] of the college, St. [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]], a [[laybrother]] known for his holiness and gift of [[prophecy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cruxnow.com/pope-in-colombia/2017/09/st-peter-claver-whose-tomb-pope-will-visit-week/|title=Who was St. Peter Claver, whose tomb the Pope will visit this week?|last=Catholic News Agency|date=September 7, 2017|website=Crux|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205204225/https://cruxnow.com/pope-in-colombia/2017/09/st-peter-claver-whose-tomb-pope-will-visit-week/|archive-date=5 February 2020|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Rodriguez felt that he had been told by God that Claver was to spend his life in service in the colonies of [[New Spain]], and he frequently urged the young student to accept that calling.<ref name=suau/>

[[File:Peter Claver.jpg|thumb|Portrait of St. Peter Claver in the museum [[Palace of Inquisition]], [[Cartagena, Colombia]]]]
Claver volunteered for the Spanish colonies and was sent to the [[New Kingdom of Granada]], where he arrived in the port city of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in 1610.<ref name="foley">{{Cite web|url=https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-peter-claver/|title=Saint Peter Claver|date=September 9, 2016|website=Franciscan Media|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122041550/https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-peter-claver/|archive-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> Required to spend six years studying theology before being ordained a priest, he lived in Jesuit houses at [[Tunja]] and [[Bogotá]]. During those preparatory years, he was deeply disturbed by the harsh treatment and living conditions of the black slaves who were brought from Africa.

By this time, the [[slave trade]] had been established in the Americas for about a century. Local natives were considered physically ill-suited to work in the gold and silver mines. Mine owners met their labor requirements by importing blacks from Angola and Congo, whom they purchased in West Africa for four crowns a head or bartered for goods and sold in America for an average two hundred crowns apiece. Others were captured at random, especially able-bodied males and females deemed suitable for labor.<ref name="kopc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kofpc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=54|title=St. Peter Claver|website=Knights of Peter Claver and Ladies Auxiliary|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235352/http://www.kofpc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=57&Itemid=54|archive-date=21 July 2011|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

Cartagena was a slave-trading hub and 10,000 slaves poured into the port yearly, crossing the Atlantic from West Africa under conditions so foul that an estimated one-third died in transit. Although the slave trade was condemned by [[Pope Paul III]] and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] had issued a papal decree prohibiting slavery,<ref name=kopc/> (later called "supreme villainy" by [[Pope Pius IX]]), it was a lucrative business and continued to flourish.<ref name=foley/>

Claver's predecessor in his eventual lifelong mission, [[:fr:Alonso de Sandoval|Father Alonso de Sandoval, S.J.]], was his mentor and inspiration.<ref name=foley/> Sandoval devoted himself to serving the slaves for 40 years before Claver arrived to continue his work. Sandoval attempted to learn about their customs and languages; he was so successful that, when he returned to [[Seville]], he wrote a book in 1627 about the nature, customs, rites and beliefs of the Africans. Sandoval found Claver an apt pupil. When he was solemnly professed in 1622, Claver signed his final [[religious profession|profession]] document in [[Latin language|Latin]] as: ''Petrus Claver, aethiopum semper servus'' (Peter Claver, servant of the Ethiopians [i.e. Africans] forever).

==Ministry to the slaves==
[[File:131 Cathedral San Pedro Claver Dome Cartagena.JPG|thumb|[[Iglesia de San Pedro Claver, Cartagena|Church of St. Peter Claver]] in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], where Claver lived and ministered]]Whereas Sandoval had visited the slaves where they worked, Claver preferred to head for the wharf as soon as a slave ship entered the port. Boarding the ship, he entered the filthy and diseased holds to treat and minister to their badly treated, terrified human cargo, who had survived a voyage of several months under horrible conditions. It was difficult to move around on the ships, because the slave traffickers filled them to capacity. The slaves were often told they were being taken to a land where they would be eaten. Claver wore a cloak, which he would lend to anyone in need. A legend arose that whoever wore the cloak received lifetime health and was cured of all disease. After the slaves were herded from the ship and penned in nearby yards to be scrutinized by crowds of buyers, Claver joined them with medicine, food, bread, lemons. With the help of interpreters and pictures which he carried with him, he gave basic instructions.<ref name="ewtn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/saintsHoly/saints/P/stpeterclaver.asp|title=EWTN's Saints and other Holy People Home|website=EWTN's Saints and Other Holy People|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226151125/http://www.ewtn.com/saintsHoly/saints/P/stpeterclaver.asp|archive-date=26 February 2018|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

Claver saw the slaves as fellow Christians, encouraging others to do so as well. During the season when slavers were not accustomed to arrive, he traversed the country, visiting plantation after plantation, to give spiritual consolation to the slaves.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=June 1854|title=The Saints and Beatified Servants of God Who Have Flourished in America|url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/AMSAINTS.HTM|url-status=dead|journal=The Metropolitan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822145450/https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/AMSAINTS.HTM|archive-date=22 August 2018|via=Eternal World Television Network}}</ref> During his 40 years of ministry it is estimated that he personally catechized and baptized 300,000 slaves.  He would then follow up on them to ensure that as Christians they received their Christian and [[civil rights]]. His mission extended beyond caring for slaves, however. He preached in the city square, to sailors and traders and conducted country missions, returning every spring to visit those he had baptized, ensuring that they were treated humanely. During these missions, whenever possible he avoided the hospitality of planters and overseers; instead, he would lodge in the [[slave quarters]].<ref name="peterclaver1"/>

Claver's work on behalf of slaves did not prevent him from ministering to the souls of well-to-do members of society, traders and visitors to Cartagena (including Muslims and English Protestants) and condemned criminals, many of whom he spiritually prepared for death; he was also a frequent visitor at the city's hospitals. Through years of unremitting toil and the force of his own unique personality, the slaves' situation slowly improved. In time he became a moral force, the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]] of Cartagena.<ref name="peterclaver1"/>

==Illness, and death==
[[File:038 Bones of San Pedro Claver in Cathedral.JPG|thumb|The bones of Claver under an altar at the Church of St. Peter Claver in Cartagena]]

In the last years of his life Peter was too ill to leave his room. He lingered for four years, largely forgotten and neglected, physically abused and starved by an ex-slave who had been hired by the Superior of the house to care for him. He never complained about his treatment, accepting it as a just punishment for his sins.<ref name="ignatian">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/16th-and-17th-century-ignatian-voices/st-peter-claver-sj/|title=St. Peter Claver, SJ (1581-1654)|work=Ignatian Spirituality|access-date=2018-08-22|url-status=live|publisher=LoyolaPress|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813212009/http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-voices/16th-and-17th-century-ignatian-voices/st-peter-claver-sj/|archive-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> He died on 8 September 1654.

When the people of the city heard of his death, many forced their way into his room to pay their last respects. Such was his reputation for holiness that they stripped away anything to serve as a [[relic]].<ref name=ignatian/>

The city magistrates, who had previously considered him a nuisance for his persistent advocacy on behalf of the slaves, ordered a public funeral and he was buried with pomp and ceremony. The extent of Claver's ministry, which was prodigious even before considering the astronomical number of people he baptized, came to be realized only after his death.

He was [[canonization|canonized]] in 1888 by [[Pope Leo XIII]], along with the holy Jesuit [[porter (monastery)|porter]], [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]]. In 1896 Pope Leo also declared Claver the patron of missionary work among all African peoples.<ref name=suau/> His body is preserved and venerated in the church of the Jesuit residence, now renamed in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/caribbean-coast/cartagena/sights/museum/convento-san-pedro|title=Convento & Iglesia de San Pedro Claver|website=Lonely Planet|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210191643/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/colombia/caribbean-coast/cartagena/sights/museum/convento-san-pedro|archive-date=10 December 2012|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>
