'''[[Hinduism]] and [[Sikhism]]''' are [[Indian religions]]. Hinduism has pre-historic origins,<ref>Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition, Suny Press, Klaus K. Klostermaier, pages 1, 544</ref> while Sikhism was founded in the 15th century by [[Guru Nanak]].<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sikhism#ref253152 |title=Sikhism: History and Doctrine |last1=McLeod |first1=William H. |date=2014 |website=britannica.com |publisher=[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |access-date=15 January 2019 |quote=Sikhs claim that their tradition has always been separate from Hinduism. Nevertheless, many [[Indology|Western scholars]] argue that in its earliest stage Sikhism was a movement within the Hindu tradition; Nanak, they point out, was raised a Hindu and eventually belonged to the [[Sant (religion)|Sant tradition]] of [[northern India]], a movement associated with the great [[poet]] and [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[Kabir]] (1440–1518). The Sants, most of whom were poor, dispossessed, and illiterate, composed hymns of great beauty expressing their experience of the divine, which they saw in all things. Their tradition drew heavily on the [[Vaishnava]] [[Bhakti movement|bhakti]] (the devotional movement within the Hindu tradition that worships the god [[Vishnu]]), though there were important differences between the two. Like the followers of bhakti, the Sants believed that devotion to God is essential to liberation from the [[Reincarnation#Sikhism|cycle of rebirth]] in which all human beings are trapped; unlike the followers of bhakti, however, the Sants maintained that [[God in Hinduism#Nirguna and Saguna|God is ''nirgun'' (“without form”) and not ''sagun'' (“with form”)]]. For the Sants, God can be neither incarnated nor represented in concrete terms.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/history/history_1.shtml |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=Sikh world history |date=30 September 2009 |access-date=15 January 2019 |publisher=[[BBC]] |quote=Sikhism was born in the [[Punjab]] area of [[South Asia]], which now falls into the present day states of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

==History of similarities and differences==

The roots of the Sikh tradition are, states Louis Fenech, perhaps in the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]]-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Sikh religion. Fenech states that, "Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors".<ref>Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 36, Quote: "Few Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, despite the fact that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' (Rinehart 2011), and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors."</ref> However, most historians do not see evidence of Sikhism as simply an extension of the [[Bhakti movement]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/sikhsofpunjab0000grew/page/28 | title=The Sikhs of the Punjab | publisher=Cambridge University Press | last=Grewal | first=JS | year=1998 | pages=28 | isbn=9780521637640}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxndvJs3wUkC&pg=PA202 | title=Sikhism and Indian Civilization | publisher=Discovery Publishing House | last=Pruthi | first=Raj | year=2004 | pages=202 | isbn=9788171418794}}</ref>

===Iconography===
{{Main|Ik Onkar}}
''Ik Onkar'', iconically represented as {{lang|pa|ੴ}} in the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Sri Guru Granth Sahib]] (although sometimes spelt out in full as {{lang|pa|ਓਅੰਕਾਰ}}) is the iconographic statement in Sikhism that is 'there is one God'.<ref name=wazirsingh>{{cite book|title=Aspects of Guru Nanak's philosophy | first=Wazir | last=Singh | year=1969 | publisher=Lahore Book Shop | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWM9AAAAIAAJ&q=substitute+ekankar | access-date=2015-09-17 | quote="the 'a,' 'u,' and 'm' of aum have also been explained as signifying the three principles of creation, sustenance and annihilation. ... aumkār in relation to existence implies plurality,  ... but its substitute Ekonkar definitely implies singularity in spite of the seeming multiplicity of existence. ..."}}</ref><ref name = Sikhism>{{cite book |author = Singh, Khushwant| author-link = Khushwant Singh| chapter=The Sikhs| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5LSvkQvvmAMC&pg=PA114 |editor=Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo |title=The religious traditions of Asia: religion, history, and culture |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |location=London |year=2002 |page=114 |isbn=0-7007-1762-5 |editor-link= Joseph Kitagawa}}</ref> The phrase is an expression of monotheistic unity of God.<ref name="M-W Ik Onkar">{{cite book | title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions | last=Doniger | first=Wendy | year=1999 | publisher=Merriam-Webster | page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/500 500] | url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440 | url-access=registration | quote=ik oankar. | access-date=2015-09-23 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0}}</ref>

===Guru Tegh Bahadur===

During the Mughal Empire period, the Sikh and Hindu traditions believe that Sikhs helped protect Hindus from Islamic persecution, and this caused martyrdom of their Guru.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mir | first=Farina | title=The social space of language vernacular culture in British colonial Punjab | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26269-0 | pages=207–237}}</ref> The Sikh historians, for example, record that the Sikh movement was rapidly growing in northwest India, and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] was openly encouraging Sikhs to, "be fearless in their pursuit of just society: he who holds none in fear, nor is afraid of anyone, is acknowledged as a man of true wisdom", a statement recorded in Adi Granth 1427.<ref name=cs2013>{{cite book | last=Seiple | first=Chris | title=The Routledge handbook of religion and security | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-415-66744-9 | page=96}}</ref><ref name=pslf/><ref name=sg2007/> While Guru Tegh Bahadur influence was rising, Aurangzeb had imposed Islamic laws, demolished Hindu schools and temples, and enforced new taxes on non-Muslims.<ref name=pslf/><ref name=bbcgtb>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/people/teghbahadur.shtml Guru Tegh Bahadur] BBC Religions (2009)</ref><ref name=nsxviii>{{cite book | author=Gobind Singh (Translated by Navtej Sarna) | title=Zafarnama | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-670-08556-9 | page=xviii-xix}}</ref>

==Differences==
===Concept of God===
Oneness of God is at the core of [[Hinduism]] although it has some [[pantheistic]] and [[henotheistic]] tendencies.<ref name=abid_god>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYxRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105 | title=Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism: A Comparative Study | publisher=Educreation Publishing | last=Wani | first=Abid Mushtaq | year=2018 | pages=105 | isbn=9781545718186}}</ref>

===Heaven and Hell===

According to [[Hinduism]], soul travels to hell or heaven before it is sent back to a new reincarnation.<ref name=kathleen/> The stay in heaven or hell is generally described as temporary. After the period of punishment is over, the souls are [[reincarnation|reborn]] as lower or higher beings as per their merits.<ref name="anna_naraka">{{cite book | last = Dallapiccola | first = Anna L. | title = [[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]] | publisher = [[Thames & Hudson]] <!-- | location = London --> | year = 2002 | chapter =Naraka| isbn = 978-0-500-51088-9 | chapter-url = http://www.credoreference.com/entry/thhll/naraka}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

===Pilgrimage===

Hinduism considers [[pilgrimage]] as helpful for one's spiritual development.<ref name=gobind>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToSikhism/page/n57 | title=Introduction to Sikhism: 100 Basic Questions and Answers on Sikh Religion and History | publisher=India Book House | last=Mansukhani | first=Gobind Singh | year=1968 | pages=60}}</ref> According to Karel Werner's ''Popular Dictionary of Hinduism'', "most [[Hinduism|Hindu]] places of pilgrimage are associated with legendary events from the lives of various gods. Almost any place can become a focus for pilgrimage, but in most cases they are sacred cities, rivers, lakes, and mountains."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Werner|first1=Karel|title=A popular dictionary of Hinduism|date=1994|publisher=Curzon|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=0700702792|url=https://archive.org/details/populardictionar0000wern|url-access=registration|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref>

Sikhism does not recognize [[pilgrimage]] as a spiritual act i.e. worthy enough to deserve any spiritual reward.<ref name=gobind/><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fU8BAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT178 | title=Sikhs Across Borders: Transnational Practices of European Sikhs | publisher=A&C Black | last=Myrvold | first=Kristina | year=2012 | pages=178 | isbn=9781441103581}}</ref>

===Shrādh===
Hindus offer [[Śrāddha|Shrādhs]] every year in memory of their ancestors. On the corresponding day, the descendants invite the [[Brahmin]] and feed them in memory of their parents and grand-parents, in the belief that this will give some benefit to the soul of their dead ancestors.<ref name=dogra_shradh>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofs0000dogr/page/433 | title=Encyclopaedia of Sikh religion and culture | publisher=Vikas Publishing House | last=Dogra | first=R.C. | year=1995 | pages=433 | isbn=9780706983685}}</ref>

According to [[Sikhism]], such food can provide benefit to the Brahmins, but the benefit can't reach the ancestors. All that can provide benefit to the deceased is his own good actions and service to the humanity. As per [[Sikh]] belief, it is much better to respect one's parents while alive than offering food to Brahmins after their death.<ref name=dogra_shradh />

===Auspicious Days===
In [[Hinduism]], according to shastras, some moments, days and lunar dates are regarded as auspicious. On all these days special rituals are observed.<ref name=jagraj_auspicious>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/ACompleteGuideToSikhism/#page/n120 | title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism | publisher=Unistar Books | last=Singh | first=Jagraj | year=2009 | pages=120 | isbn=9788171427543}}</ref> It is a common practice in [[Hinduism]] to perform or avoid activities like important religious ceremonies on the basis of the quality of a particular [[Muhurta]]. One or more Muhūrtas are recommended by the Vedic scriptures when performing rituals and other ceremonies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Demystifying Brahminism and Re-Inventing Hinduism: Volume 1 - Demystifying Brahminism|last=Shri|first=Satya|publisher=Notion Press|year=2017|isbn=9781946515544|location=Chennai}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://dheivegam.com/tamil-muhurtham-dates/ | title=Tamil Muhurtham dates | publisher=Dheivegam}}</ref>

The Sikh Scripture, [[Guru Granth Sahib]] denounces belief in auspicious days.<ref name=jagraj_auspicious /> [[Sikh Gurus]] rejected the idea that certain days are auspicious while some others are not.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofs0000dogr/page/412 | url-access=registration | title=Encyclopaedia of Sikh Religion and Culture | publisher=Vikas Publishing House | last=Dogra| first=R.C.| year=1995| pages=412| isbn=9780706994995}}</ref>

===Fasting===
[[Fasting]] is an important part of [[Hinduism]] and fasts are observed on many occasions.<ref name=singha_fasting>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C&pg=PA71 | title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism (over 1000 Entries) | publisher=Hemkunt Press | last=Singha | first=H.S. | year=2000 | pages=71 | isbn=9788170103011}}</ref> Fasts are an important aspect of [[Hindu]] ritual life, and there are many different types. In some cases, fasting simply means abstaining from certain types of foods, such as grains. Devotees fast for a variety of reasons. Some fast to honor a particular deity, and others fast to obtain a specific end.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMPYnfS_R90C&pg=PA130 | title=Contemporary Hinduism: Ritual, Culture, and Practice | publisher=ABC-CLIO | last= Rinehart | first=Robin | year=2004 | pages=130 | isbn=9781576079058}}</ref>

[[Sikhism]] does not regard fasting as a spiritual act. Fasting as an austerity or as a mortification of the body by means of wilful hunger is discouraged in Sikhism. Sikhism encourages temperance and moderation in food i.e. neither starve nor over-eat.<ref name=singha_fasting />

===Caste System===
There are four [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]] (castes) within Hindu society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dumont|first1=Louis|title=Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and Its Implications|date=1980|isbn=9780226169637|page=437}}</ref> Within these varnas, there are also many jati (caste groups). The first is the [[Brahmin]] (teacher or priest), the second is the [[Kshatriya]] (ruler or warrior), the third is the [[Vaishya]] (merchant or farmer) and the fourth is the [[Shudra]] (servant or labourer). People who are excluded from the four-fold [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system are thought of as untouchables, and are sometimes called [[Dalit]].<ref name=jon_mayled>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9jKt0dLz1IC&pg=PP56 | title=Sikhism | publisher=Heinemann| last=Mayled | first=Jon | year=2002 | pages=56 | isbn=9780435336271}}</ref>

[[Guru Nanak]] preached against the caste system. Although [[Sikh Gurus]] criticised the hierarchy of the caste system, one does exist in Sikh community. Some Sikh families continue to check the caste of any prospective marriage partner for their children.<ref name=jon_mayled />

===Asceticism===
Hinduism has exalted the life of the recluse and the ascetic because of the belief that such acts devote the pure life of spiritual attainment.<ref name=singha_asceticism>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C&pg=PA22 | title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism (over 1000 Entries) | publisher=Hemkunt Press | last=Singha | first=H.S | year=2000 | pages=22 | isbn=9788170103011}}</ref> [[Sannyasa]] is a form of asceticism, is marked by renunciation of material desires and prejudices, represented by a state of disinterest and detachment from material life, and has the purpose of spending one's life in peaceful, love-inspired, simple spiritual life.<ref>S. Radhakrishnan (1922), The Hindu Dharma, International Journal of Ethics, 33(1): 1-22</ref><ref>DP Bhawuk (2011), The Paths of Bondage and Liberation, in Spirituality and Indian Psychology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-8109-7}}, pages 93-110</ref>

While [[Sikhism]] treats [[Kaam|lust]] as a vice, it has at the same time pointed out that man must share the moral responsibility by leading the life of a householder. What is important is to be God-centred. According to Sikhism, ascetics are not on the right path.<ref name=singha_asceticism />

===Menstruation===
In the Hindu tradition, [[Menstruation]] laws are expressed in the [[Laws of Manu]]. Any touch of the menstruating women is deemed polluted. Food touched by a menstruating women is forbidden and to lie down in the same bed as a menstruating women is also forbidden.<ref name=jane_menstruation>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boI8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 | title=Imagining the Fetus: The Unborn in Myth, Religion, and Culture | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Law | first=Jane Marie | year=2009 | pages=125 | isbn=9780195380040}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_ryDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120 | title=The Palgrave Handbook of Critical Menstruation Studies | publisher=Springer Nature | last=Bobel | first=Chris | year=2020 | pages=120 | isbn=9789811506147}}</ref>

Sikh scripture acknowledges menstrual bleeding as an essential, natural process. [[Guru Nanak]] reprimanded those who stigmatize a blood-stained garment as polluted. He strongly questioned the legitimacy and purpose of devaluing women on the basis of their reproductive energy.<ref name=jane_menstruation />

===Animal Sacrifice===

In the Hindu and Sikh traditions, there is a distinction between religion and culture, and ethical decisions are grounded in both religious beliefs and cultural values. Both Hindu and Sikh ethics are primarily duty based. Traditional teachings deal with the duties of individuals and families to maintain a lifestyle conducive to physical, mental and spiritual health. These traditions share a culture and world view that includes ideas of karma and rebirth, collective versus individual identity, and a strong emphasis on spiritual purity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/163/9/1167 |title=Bioethics for clinicians: 19.

The notion of [[dharma]], [[karma]], [[moksha]] are very important for both Hindus and Sikhs. Unlike the linear view of life, death, heaven or hell taken in [[Abrahamic]] religions, for Hindus and Sikhs believe in the concept of [[Saṃsāra]], that is life, birth and death are repeated, for each soul, in a cycle until one reaches mukti or [[moksha]].<ref name=colesambhi13>{{cite book|author1=W.O.

==Culture and intermarriage==
There is an organic relation of Sikhs to Hindus, states Zaehner, both in religious thought and their communities, and virtually all Sikhs' ancestors were Hindus.<ref name=robertzaehner/> Some Hindu groups, like the BJP and related nationalist organizations, view Sikhism as a tradition within [[Hinduism]] along with other Dharmic faiths (such as some [[Hindus]] referring to [[Sikhs]] as [[Keshdhari Hindus]]),<ref>{{cite news|author1=Mukul Kesavan|title=Their better selves – Vegetarianism and virtue|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1150914/jsp/opinion/story_42418.jsp#.Vp8uN-asif8|access-date=4 July 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=14 September 2015}}</ref> even though the Sikh faith is a distinct religion.<ref name=robertzaehner>Robert Zaehner (1997), Encyclopedia of the World's Religions, Barnes & Noble Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0760707128}}, page 409</ref> Historically, Sikhs were seen as the protectors of Hindus, among others, and were even considered by some right-wing Hindu political organizations like the RSS as the "sword arm" of Hinduism.<ref name="mehta" >{{cite book|author1=Ved Mehta| author-link = Ved Mehta | title=Rajiv Gandhi and Rama's Kingdom|date=1996|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300068580|page=65|edition=illustrated, revised}}</ref><ref>Ratan Sharda: ''RSS 360 °: Demystifying Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh''|date=2018|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|9789386950406|page=290|</ref> This status as protectors of Hindus was strong enough that [[Punjabi Hindus]] would often raise their eldest son as a Sikh.<ref name="mehta" />

Marriages between Sikhs and Hindus, particularly among ''Khatris'',<ref name=robertzaehner/> are frequent.<ref name=robertzaehner/> Dogra states that there has always been inter-marriage between the Hindu and the Sikh communities.<ref>R. C. Dogra & Urmila Dogra: ''Hindu and Sikh wedding ceremonies'' pub. 2000. Star Publications. {{ISBN|9788176500289}}.</ref> Charing and Cole state that "Sikhism originated and developed within Hinduism. Hindus and Sikhs, in initial years of Sikhism, used to have what is termed as ''Roti Beti di Sanjh''; that is they eat together and intermarry".<ref>Douglas Charing and William Owen Cole: ''Six world faiths'' pub. 2004, page 309. Continuum International Publishing Group. {{ISBN|9780826476838}}.</ref> William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi state that for some Sikhs, intermarriage between Hindus and Sikhs of same community was preferable than other communities.<ref>William Owen Cole, Piara Singh Sambhi: Sikhism and Christianity: a comparative study, Volume 1993, Part 2, pub. 1993.

Sikh scriptures are venerated by certain Hindu communities,<ref name="mehta" /> often by syncretic sects.
