Chase was [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Secretary of the Treasury. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted "doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval".</ref>

A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest-bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto "God and our Right".

As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name="history" />

An Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that "shall admit the inscription thereon".<ref name="history" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury "may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto".

After use of the motto on coins began during the 1860s, there have been some coins on which the motto did not appear. The motto disappeared from the new [[Liberty Head nickel]] in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the [[Jefferson nickel]] began in 1938.<ref name="history"/> However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} including the [[Morgan dollar]] and the [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|Seated Liberty half dollar]]. The omission of the motto "In God We Trust" on the [[Indian Head eagle]] coin caused public outrage, and prompted [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill mandating its inclusion.  Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |title=10 Interesting Facts About Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Republicanpresidents.net |date= 2009-03-04|accessdate=2014-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217130709/http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |archive-date=2014-02-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916.

In January 2006, [[Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen]] and his wife Jackie were offered a place on the [[Valentine's Day]] celebrity couples edition of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' They appeared on the show managing to reach the £1&nbsp;million question, before answering it incorrectly and dropping from £500,000 all the way down to just £32,000 (a loss of £468,000). Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife to retry the show after the company claimed that the last question "didn't meet their standards". The allegedly misleading question was "Translated from the [[Latin language|Latin]], what is the motto of the United States?" The answer given by Llewelyn-Bowen was "In God We Trust" which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been "One Out of Many" which is a translation of the Latin phrase ''[[E pluribus unum]]'', which is not actually the current United States motto. ''E pluribus unum'' had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such.<ref name="secondchance">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4608690.stm|title=TV designer's second shot at £1m|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=13 January 2006|accessdate=22 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725015341/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4608690.stm |archive-date=25 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The constitutionality of the phrase "In God We Trust" has been upheld according to the judicial interpretation of [[accommodationism]], whose adherents state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.<ref name="Views" />  In ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' (1952), the Supreme Court also wrote that the nation's "institutions presuppose a Supreme Being" and that government recognition of [[God]] does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.<ref name=ABA>{{cite book|title=ABA Journal Sep 1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&q=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust&pg=PA817|quote=Much more recently, in 1952, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in ''Zorach v. Clauson'', 343 U.S. 306, 313, the Supreme Court repeated the same sentiments, saying: We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. Mr. Justice Brewer in the ''Holy Trinity'' case, ''supra'', mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the ''Zorach'' case referred to&nbsp;... [P]rayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamation making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; "So help me God" in our courtroom oaths – these and&nbsp;... other references to the Almighty&nbsp;... run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies&nbsp;... the supplication with which the Court opens each session: "God save the United States and this Honorable Court" (312–313). To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the "Pray for Peace" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of ''America'' which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words "in God is our trust" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words "under God.|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065015/https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&pg=PA817&dq=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust#v=onepage&q=Zorach%20v.%20Clauson%20%20%20In%20God%20We%20Trust&f=false|archive-date=November 19, 2016|url-status=live|date = September 1962}}</ref>

On the other hand, advocates of [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] have questioned the legality of this motto asserting their opinion that it is a violation of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the government from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion.<ref name=Views>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vonnZcMHs8kC&pg=PA60|title=The Dynamic Constitution: an Introduction to Americans Constitutional Law|author=Richard H.

Religious accommodationists can well explain why certain entrenched social practices (such as the inscription of "In God We Trust" on the currency) were not historically perceived as presenting constitutional difficulties: The relevant practices are not coercive and do not prefer one narrow sect over another.|isbn=978-0-521-60078-1|year=2004|access-date=2016-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118232121/https://books.google.com/books?id=vonnZcMHs8kC&pg=PA60|archive-date=2016-11-18|url-status=live}}</ref> As such "In God We Trust" as a national motto and on U.S. currency has been the subject of numerous unsuccessful lawsuits by these individuals.<ref name="AtheistLawsuit">{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/atheist-lawsuit-currency-god_n_5412890.html |title=Atheists Lose Latest Battle To Remove 'In God We Trust' From U.S. Currency |last1=Markoe |first1=Lauren |date=2014-05-29 |website=huffingtonpost.com |publisher=[[Religion News Service]] |accessdate=2014-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018001553/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/atheist-lawsuit-currency-god_n_5412890.html |archive-date=2014-10-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> The motto was first challenged in ''[[Aronow v.

In June 2006, a federal judge rejected [[Michael Newdow]]'s Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone's beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | title=Federal Judge Nixes 'In God We Trust' Lawsuit | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2006-06-12 | access-date=2018-02-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021151309/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | archive-date=2012-10-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> although ''Aronow'' was decided on the same grounds in the Ninth Circuit and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.

In 2015, New Jersey state judge [[David F.

In November 1907, sitting U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] took issue with using the motto on American coinage considering its usage "dangerously close to [[sacrilege]]":
{{quotation|My own feeling in the matter is due to my very firm conviction that to put such a motto on coins, or to use it in any kindred manner, not only does no good, but does positive harm, and is in effect irreverence, which comes dangerously close to sacrilege. ...&nbsp; Any use which tends to cheapen it, and, above all, any use which tends to secure its being treated in a spirit of levity, is from every standpoint profoundly to be regretted. ... it seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins ...&nbsp; In all my life I have never heard any human being speak reverently of this motto on the coins or show any signs of its having appealed to any high emotion in him, but I have literally, hundreds of times, heard it used as an occasion of and incitement to ... sneering ...&nbsp; Every one must remember the innumerable cartoons and articles based on phrases like 'In God we trust for the 8 cents,' ...&nbsp; Surely, I am well within bounds when I say that a use of the phrase which invites constant levity of this type is most undesirable.|source=
