__NOTOC__
Within [[criticism of religion]], '''counter-apologetics''' is a field of thought that criticizes religious [[apologetics]]. Every religious apologist criticizes the defense of other religions, though the term counter-apologetics is frequently applied to criticism of religion in general by [[freethought|freethinkers]] and [[atheists]]. Luke Muehlhauser, the former executive director of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], defines counter-apologetics as "a response to [[Christian apologetics]]...examining the claims and tactics of Christian apologists and then equipping [a thinker] with [[skepticism|skeptical]] responses to them".<ref name=Muehlhauser2010/>

Christian apologist and blogger J.W. Wartick wrote "counter-counter apologetics" in response to [[Matt Dillahunty]]'s ''{{vanchor|Iron Chariots}}'' counter-apologetics encyclopedia.<ref>{{citation|author=Adam Lee|publisher=[[Patheos]]|title=Little-Known Bible Verses VII: Iron Chariots|date= November 4, 2007 |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2007/11/iron-chariots/}}</ref><ref name=Wartick/>

On his blog, as part of his "why they don't believe" series ("why they reject Christianity and/or theism"), Christian apologist and theologian [[Randal Rauser]] invited an anonymous blogger who calls himself Counter Apologist to explain his counter-apologetics, and Rauser provided his own counter-arguments.<ref name=Rauser/>

The [[New Testament]] is well understood to contain apologetics,{{sfn|Dulles|2005|p=1}} but counter-apologetics also appears in Christian theology. Theologian [[John Milbank]] has written in a 2012 work that Christianity "makes room for" counter-apologetics by not being a [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] system of thought,{{sfn|Milbank|2012|ps=&nbsp;"[T]he apophatic Christian ''apologia'', out of its own internal structure, always makes room for the counter-apologetics for the quotidian ... since Christianity is not Gnosticism or Marcionism, its qualified world refusal will, even at the ''eschaton'', allow the world a place..."|p=19}} and notes the "authentic Christian fusion of apologetic and counter-apologetic" as it stands in opposition to the anti-materialist nihilism of Browning's [[Caliban upon Setebos|Caliban]].{{sfn|Milbank|2012|p=24}} Likewise, Biblical scholar and theologian  Loveday Alexander has written that analysis of the Bible's books Luke and Acts by two other authors shows they contain counter-apologetic features perhaps to convey a pro-Roman perspective to the reader.{{sfn|Alexander|1999|ps=&nbsp;"...Luke-Acts contains too many counter-apologetic features to impress a Roman reader ... and therefore proposes a reverse reading of the narrative as an ''apologia pro imperio'': it embodies a pro-Roman perspective to a church harboring anti-Roman sentiment..."|p=24}}
