In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), there is a general prohibition, deriving from the [[Word of Wisdom]], against intoxicating substances; [[cannabis]] has been explicitly banned by the church since 1915.<ref name="Sanna2014"/>
Since then the church has changed its view in favor of the use of medical marijuana, but not recreational use.<ref>"We are in favor of appropriate use of medicinal marijuana, and it's our view that by calling upon our legislature and local leaders, we can quickly find an appropriate resolution." —Elder Jack N. Gerard of the Seventy https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/church-says-yes-to-regulated-medical-marijuana-but-no-to-utah-initiative?lang=eng</ref>

==Early prohibitions==
In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members, and two months later the state of [[Cannabis in Utah|Utah banned cannabis]]. Some scholars have linked the two events, arguing that cannabis usage by Mormon returnees who had earlier fled to [[Mexico]] led the church, and later the state, to make their decisions.<ref name="Sanna2014">{{cite book|author=E.J. Sanna|title=Marijuana: Mind-Altering Weed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnDTBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT88|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Mason Crest|isbn=978-1-4222-9299-0|pages=88–}}</ref> Others contradict this, noting that Utah's prohibition laws were part of a larger package of anti-drug laws which happened to include cannabis, but did not indicate a statewide concern.<ref name="Newton2017">{{cite book|author=David E.

==1971 decriminalization==
The decriminalization effort in 1971 was said to be strong in Utah due to the state's high rate of use of cannabis, and Mormon members' preference to handle matters within the church and family.<ref name="Clark 2007 p. 508">{{cite book | last=Clark | first=D.S. | title=Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives | publisher=SAGE Publications | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-7619-2387-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlGoODMSEKcC&pg=PT508 | page=508}}</ref>

==Response to modern cannabis movement==
As medical and recreational cannabis [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalization movements]] began in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century in the [[United States]], the LDS Church has been asked for its position on the issue.

In a 2010 conference for local church leaders in Colorado, [[general authorities]] of the church, including now current [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Russell M. Nelson]], explained in answer to a question that the church has no position on [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] and that the issue was left to individual consultation with scriptures and a member's [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/2018/04/12/gehrke-lds-churchs-stance-on-medical-marijuana-doesnt-make-sense-why-is-it-ok-for-a-nevada-mormon-but-not-a-utah-mormon/|title=Gehrke: LDS Church’s stance on medical marijuana doesn’t make sense. Why is it OK for a Nevada Mormon but not a Utah Mormon?|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en-US}}</ref> This same stance was later reiterated in a private discussion among the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] in a 2010 video that was made public in 2016. The discussion included consensus that the church opposed recreational marijuana use more broadly but had no position on medical use specifically.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mormon Leaks|title=In Which They Fret Over the Growing Popularity of Marijuana|date=2016-10-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8hVH919KmY|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref>

In February 2016, the church released a statement supporting efforts to legalize [[CBD oil]] in Utah, but not whole-plant cannabis remedies:

{{quote|While we are not in a position to evaluate specific medical claims, the Church understands that there are some individuals who may benefit from the medical use of compounds found in marijuana. For that reason, although the Church opposes [[Utah Senate Bill 73|SB 73]], it has raised no objection to SB 89. These two competing pieces of legislation take very different approaches when it comes to issues like access, distribution, control and the potential harm of the hallucinogenic compound, THC.<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Wells |url= http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/ |title= LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana |publisher= [[KSTU]] (fox13now.com) |date= February 12, 2016 |accessdate= 2017-03-06}}</ref>}}

In October 2016, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church sent a letter to [[ward (LDS Church)|congregations]] in [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]] (states which were to vote on legalized recreational cannabis in November), urging members to oppose legalization:

{{quote|Drug abuse in the United States is at epidemic proportions, and the dangers of marijuana to public health and safety are well documented. Recent studies have shed light particularly on the risks marijuana use poses to brain development in youth. The accessibility of recreational marijuana in the home is also a danger to children. ... We urge Church members to let their voices be heard in opposition to the legalization of recreational marijuana.<ref>{{cite news |last=Curtis |first=Larry D. |url=http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-leaders-urge-members-to-vote-against-legalizing-marijuana |title=LDS leaders urge members to vote against legalizing marijuana |publisher= [[KUTV]] |date= October 13, 2016 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}</ref>}}

In a 2019 article in the church's youth magazine ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', the following statement was given regarding cannabis: {{quote|Marijuana may be legal for medicinal or even recreational use in a lot of places now, but that doesn't mean that any use is suddenly not against the Word of Wisdom. Medical uses are being studied, but just like many pain medications such as opioids, marijuana is an addictive substance. Such habit-forming substances should be avoided except under the care of a competent physician, and then used only as prescribed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2019/08/vaping-coffee-tea-and-marijuana |title=Vaping, Coffee, Tea, and Marijuana |accessdate=2019-08-05}}</ref>}}
