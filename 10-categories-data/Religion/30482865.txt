The '''Mount Zion Award''' is a [[wikt:biennial|biennial]] award by the Mount Zion Foundation, which has its seat at the Institute for Jewish-Christian Research (IJCF) at the [[University of Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]]. The award is presented every other year close to October 28th. In 1986 the Mount Zion Foundation was created by the German Reverend Wilhelm Salberg (1925–1996), son of a Jewish father and a Christian mother. The Mount Zion Award is presented to persons of Jewish, Muslim or Christian faith, who have significantly contributed to the Jewish-Christian [[Interfaith dialog|dialogue]] or to the understanding of the three [[Abrahamic religions]], Judaism, Christianity and Islam, in Israel.

The presidents of the foundation, Prof. Dr. Verena Lenzen, director of the Institute for Jewish-Christian Research at the University of Lucerne, and the [[abbot]] of the [[Hagia Maria Sion Abbey|Dormition Abbey]] in [[Jerusalem]], Bernhard Maria Alter OSB, present the Mount Zion Award always at the end of October or at the beginning of November, in remembrance of the Declaration on the Relation of the Catholic Church with Non-Christian Religions ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' of October 28, 1965.
