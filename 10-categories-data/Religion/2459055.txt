== Committee for Skeptical Inquiry ==
[[File:Nickell in office.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joe Nickell]], Research Fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, in office. Amherst, New York, 2013]]

Through the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI), and its journal, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, published by the Center for Inquiry, CSI examines evidential claims of the paranormal or supernormal, including psychics, ghosts, telepathy, clairvoyance, UFOs, and creationism.

They also examine pseudoscientific claims involving vaccines, cellphones, power lines, GMOs, and alternative medicine. In the area of religion, they examine beliefs that involve testable claims, such as faith healing and creationism, but stay away from untestable religious beliefs such as the existence of God.<ref name="psychologytoday">{{

The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), then known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), was, alongside magician and prominent skeptic [[James Randi]], sued by TV celebrity [[Uri Geller]] in the 1990s after Randi told a newspaper interviewer that that Geller's tricks "are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes when I was a kid."<ref name="latimes">{{cite web

[[File:Council for Secular Humanism logo.png|350px|thumb|Logo of the Council for Secular Humanism (CSH).]]
The Center promotes critical inquiry into the foundations and social effects of the world religions. Since 1983, initially through its connection with [[Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion]], it has focused on such issues as fundamentalism in Christianity and Islam, humanistic alternatives to religious ethics, and religious sources of political violence. It has taken part in protests against religious persecution around the world<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Gryboski |title=Ted Cruz Joins Demonstrators in Front of White House; Calls on Obama to Help Imprisoned Sudanese Christian Woman |work=[[The Christian Post]] |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ted-cruz-joins-demonstrators-in-front-of-white-house-calls-on-obama-to-help-imprisoned-sudanese-christian-woman-121430/ |date=2014-06-12 |access-date=2014-06-29}}</ref> and opposes religious privilege, for example benefits for clergy in the [[Taxation in the United States|US Tax Code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi_tells_federal_court_end_taxpayer_funding_of_clergy_housing/ |title=CFI Tells Federal Court: End Taxpayer Funding of Clergy Housing |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=2014-06-24 |access-date=2014-06-29}}</ref> In 2014 and 2017, respectively, the CFI won two lawsuits compelling the states of Illinois and Indiana to allow weddings to be performed by officiants who are neither religious clergy nor government officials.

The Center for Inquiry Institute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/education/institute_catalogue/ |title=Institute Catalogue |publisher=Center for Inquiry |accessdate=2014-03-01}}</ref> offered undergraduate level online courses, seminars, and workshops in critical thinking and the scientific outlook and its implications for religion, human values, and the borderlands of science. In addition to transferable undergraduate credit through the University at Buffalo system, CFI offered a thirty credit-hour Certificate of Proficiency in Critical Inquiry. The three-year curriculum plan offered summer sessions at the main campus at the University at Buffalo in Amherst.

}} Professional organizations which issued position statements indicating that facilitated communication is not a scientifically valid technique; Most effective intervention for autism according to scientists; Symptoms of autism; Reason for the abundance of untested and ineffective therapies for autism</ref> and in psychiatry.<ref>"Power Therapies and possible threats to the science of psychology and psychiatry".  By: Devilly, Grant J. ''[[Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|Australian & New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry]]''. Jun 2005, Vol. 39 Issue 6, pp. 437–445. 9p.  This paper reviews a collection of new therapies collectively self-termed ‘The Power Therapies’, outlining their proposed procedures and the evidence for and against their use. These therapies are then put to the test for pseudoscientific practice.  It is concluded that these new therapies have offered no new scientifically valid theories of action, show only non-specific efficacy, show no evidence that they offer substantive improvements to extant psychiatric care, yet display many characteristics consistent with pseudoscience.</ref>

=== Naturalism Research Project ===
CFI also ran the Naturalism Research Project, a major effort to develop the theoretical and practical applications of [[philosophical naturalism]]. As part of this project, CFI's libraries, research facilities, and conference areas were available to scientists and scholars to advance the understanding of science's methodologies and conclusions about naturalism.<ref>{{cite web

Activities of the Naturalism Research Project included lectures and seminars by visiting fellows and scholars; academic conferences; and support CFI publications of important research. Among the central issues of naturalism include the exploration of varieties of naturalism; problems in philosophy of science; the methodologies of scientific inquiry; naturalism and humanism; naturalistic ethics; planetary ethics; and naturalism and the biosciences.<ref>

=== Consumer fraud lawsuits against CVS and Walmart ===

In July 2018, CFI filed suit against [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] in the District of Columbia for consumer fraud over its sale and marketing of ineffective homeopathic medicine. The lawsuit in part accuses the country's largest drug retailer of deceiving consumers through its misrepresentation of homeopathy's safety and effectiveness, wasting customers’ money and putting their health at risk. Nicholas Little, CFI's Vice President and General Counsel said, "CVS is taking cynical advantage of their customers’ confusion and trust in the CVS brand, and putting their health at risk to make a profit and they can't claim ignorance. If the people in charge of the country's largest pharmacy don't know that homeopathy is bunk, they should be kept as far away from the American healthcare system as possible."<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Center For Inquiry Sues CVS for Fraud Over Sale of Homeopathic Fake Medicine |url=https://centerforinquiry.org/press_releases/cfi-sues-cvs/ |publisher=Center for Inquiry |date=9 July 2018 |access-date=9 July 2018}}</ref> {{As of |June 2019}}, the lawsuit is still in negotiations.

=== Lack of racial diversity on its board of directors ===

In 2016, the atheist [[Sikivu Hutchinson]] criticized the merger of the secular organizations Center for Inquiry and the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]], which gave [[Richard Dawkins]] a seat on the board of directors of the Center for Inquiry. Her criticism was that both organizations had all white board of directors.<ref>[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sikivu-hutchinson/atheismsowhite-atheists-o_b_9078736.html #AtheismSoWhite: Atheists of Color Rock Social Justice] by Sikivu Hutchinson, ''Huffington Post'', January 26, 2016</ref>

=== Wyndgate Country Club and Richard Dawkins, 2011 ===

During Richard Dawkins' October 2011 book tour, Center for Inquiry – the tour's sponsor – signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site.

=== CSH actions against faith-based initiatives ===
In 2007, CSH sued the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) to block the use of state funds in contracts to faith-based programs for released inmates, claiming that this use is prohibited under the "No Aid" provision or [[Blaine amendment]] of the Florida constitution. The initial decision found in favor of the DOC but, on appeal, the case was remanded in 2010 on just the issue of the unconstitutionality of appropriating state funds for this purpose.<ref name=CHS2010 >{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1519849.html
