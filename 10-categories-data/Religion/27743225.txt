The '''Catholic Negro-American Mission Board''' is a U.S. [[Roman Catholic]] institution that raises funds and supports mission work in among [[African Americans]].

==History==
In 1905, the Catholic archbishops of the United States determined that the needs for Catholic mission work in the black community exceeded the funding available from the annual appeal administered by the [[Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians]].<ref name=marquette>{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC2.shtml|title=Commission for Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians: Historical Note/Scope And Content|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=September 21, 2016}}.</ref> To create a second funding stream, the archbishops called for the establishment of the Catholic Board, which they incorporated in 1907 with Fr. [[John E. Burke]] as executive director in [[New York City]].<ref name=marquette1>{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC3.shtml|title=The Catholic Negro-American Mission Board (The Catholic Board For Mission Work Among The Colored People): Historical Note/Scope And Content.|publisher=Marquette University|accessdate=June 17, 2010}}.</ref>

Since its founding, the Catholic Board has supported hundreds of priests and women religious who served Black parishes and schools throughout the United States, and in so doing, it also endorsed efforts to address Black social concerns as well.<ref>''Our Colored Missions'', 1922-1970; ''Educating in Faith'', 1981-1984.</ref> The Catholic Board was renamed in 1970, and it joined the [[Black and Indian Mission office]] a decade later.<ref name=marquette/>

==Archival collections==
[[Marquette University Special Collections and University Archives]] serves as the archival repository for the Catholic Negro-American Mission Board and its affiliated institutions, the [[Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians]] and the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]]. Collectively, these institutions comprise the [[Black and Indian Mission office]]. However, the archival records of the institutions are known as the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions Records after the oldest of the three institutions, which has generated the bulk of the archival records. Marquette University provides selected images from the CNAMB records as a separate online digital collection, African American Catholics of the United States.
