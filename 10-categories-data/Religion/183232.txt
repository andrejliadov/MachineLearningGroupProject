A '''chaplain''' is, traditionally, a [[cleric]] (such as a  [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[priest]], [[pastor]], [[rabbi]], [[purohit]], or [[imam]]), or a [[laity|lay]] representative of a religious tradition, attached to a [[secularity|secular institution]] such as a [[hospital]], [[prison]], military unit, [[intelligence agency]], [[embassy]], school, [[labor union]], business, police department, fire department, [[university]], sports club, or private [[chapel]].

==Types of chaplaincies==

===Education===
School chaplains are a fixture in religious and, more recently, secular schools. In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups. School chaplains can also liaise with external organizations providing support services for the school.<ref>{{cite web |title=What are school chaplains |url=http://tuggerahlakeschaplai.domain.com/styled-3/index.html |publisher=Tuggerah Lakes Chaplains |url-status=live|date = 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125054025/http://www.tuggerahlakeschaplains.com/styled-3/index.html |archive-date=January 25, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Many schools now have pupil support departments with several mentors whose jobs are to look out for the pupils and always be there to help but they give no religious or spiritual guidance because of multiculturalism and diverse opinions on religion and beliefs.{{citation needed|date=July 2014|reason="many" is a weasel word, do they give "no" or "limited" spiritual guidance, are these really the reasons, anyway we need a source for this}} Chaplains have also been referred to as spiritual animators<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torontosun.com/2013/10/11/religious-education-out-spiritual-animators-in-at-quebec-schools/wcm/14c2bdcd-0efd-4d55-b876-943cf528b11b|title=Religious education out, 'spiritual animators' in at Quebec schools |first=Brian|last = Daly|date=October 11, 2013|website=torontosun.com}}</ref> (also faith animators or pastoral animators)<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ylZKAgAAQBAJ&q=spiritual+animator&pg=PA228|title=Global Perspectives on Spirituality and Education|editor1-first=Jacqueline|editor1-last=Watson|editor2-first=Marian de|editor2-last=Souza|editor3-first= Ann |editor3-last=Trousdale|first=Michael|last=Dallaire|chapter=Spirituality in Canadian Education | page=228 | date=December 4, 2013 |publisher= [[Routledge]] | isbn =  9781136199127 | series=Routledge Research in Education | access-date=April 26, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AQGTTvm1HYYC&pg=PA334| title= International Handbook of Catholic Education: Challenges for School Systems in the 21st Century| isbn=978-1-4020-5776-2| last1=Grace| first1=Gerald| last2=Joseph| first2=SJ O'Keefe| date=2007-12-07}}</ref> based on the French concept of ''animation spirituelle'' or spiritual care.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JB6oBgAAQBAJ&q=chaplains+as+animators&pg=PA189 |title= Issues in Religion and Education: Whose Religion?|editor1-first=Lori G. |editor1-last=Beaman |editor1-link=Lori G.

In Australia chaplains in state schools have, controversially,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-28/revised-chaplaincy-funding-moves-labelled-arrogant-disgraceful/5702012|title=Revised school chaplaincy funding arrangements labelled 'arrogant and disgraceful' by High Court challenger|website=ABC News|date=2014-08-27}}</ref> been funded by the federal government and local communities since 2007. Australian chaplains assist school communities to support the spiritual, social, and emotional well-being of their students.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Chaplaincy |url=http://www.genr8.org.au/chaplains/about|location=Sydney |publisher=Genr8 Ministries |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref> Chaplaincy services are provided by non denominational companies. {{As of|August 2013}} there are 2339 chaplains working in Australian secular schools, along with 512 student welfare workers.<ref>{{cite web |date=September 27, 2013 |title=National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program Statistics |url=http://docs.education.gov.au/documents/national-school-chaplaincy-and-student-welfare-program-statistics |publisher=Australian Government Department of Education |access-date=July 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628233705/http://docs.education.gov.au/documents/national-school-chaplaincy-and-student-welfare-program-statistics |archive-date=June 28, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Australian schools will lose the option of appointing secular social workers under the national school chaplaincy program, for which the [[Abbott government]] has found an extra $245m in [[2014 Australian federal budget|the 2014 budget]] funding.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hurst |first=Daniel |date=May 14, 2014 |title=It will be chaplains, not secular social workers, at schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/14/budget-it-will-be-chaplains-not-secular-social-workers-at-schools |work=The Guardian |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name="books.google.com"/>

Similarly, in Scotland the focus of school chaplaincy is on welfare and building positive relationships joining students on excursions and sharing meals. Chaplains are also non-denominational and act as a link between the school community and society. Like Australian chaplains it is expected that they will not proselytise.<ref>{{cite web |date=Nov 13, 2012 |title=The Role of the School Chaplain |url=http://www.churchofscotland.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/13296/302_C_and_S_Reps_Handbook_Leaflet7.pdf |publisher=The Church of Scotland |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

In Ireland chaplaincy takes a very different approach in which chaplains are expected to teach up to four hours of class instruction per week and are usually Catholic themselves. Chaplaincy duties include visiting homes, religious services, retreats and celebrations, as well as counseling.<ref>{{cite web |title=The School Chaplain |url=http://www.irishschoolchaplains.com/page17.htm |publisher=School Chaplains' Association of Ireland |access-date=July 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102193011/http://www.irishschoolchaplains.com/page17.htm |archive-date=January 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Higher education===
For higher education, chaplains are appointed by many colleges and universities, sometimes working directly for the institution, and sometimes as representatives of separate organizations that specifically work to support students, such as [[Hillel International]] for Jews or the [[Newman Centers]] for Catholics. In the United States, the National Association of College and University Chaplains works to support the efforts of many of these chaplains, helping chaplains minister to the individual faith of students, faculty, and staff, while promoting inter-religious understanding.<ref>{{cite web |title=NACUC Mission |url=http://www.nacuc.net/mission-of-NACUC/ |publisher=The National Association of College and University Chaplains |access-date=July 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724190640/http://www.nacuc.net/mission-of-NACUC/ |archive-date=July 24, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Chaplains often also oversee programs on campus that foster spiritual, ethical, religious, and political and cultural exchange, and the promotion of service. Each day communities respond to numerous disasters or emergencies. Most often, these incidents are managed effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a collaborative approach that includes personnel from: 1. Multiple jurisdictions, 2. A combination of specialties or disciplines, 3. Several levels of government, 4. Non-governmental organizations, and 5. The private sector. Chaplain Fellowship Disaster Response certifies first responder chaplain for crisis and disaster response.

===Industrial chaplains===

====Law enforcement and police====
Law enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank. They will always wear distinguishing insignia or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.

====Fire departments====
Chaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement agencies, and sometimes face even greater danger working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.

At the scene of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], for example, [[New York City Fire Department]] chaplain Fr. [[Mychal Judge]] was killed by flying debris from the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] when he re-entered the lobby of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the World Trade Center, shortly after administering last rites to a wounded firefighter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/27/nyregion/killed-on-9-11-fire-chaplain-becomes-larger-than-life.html?pagewanted=1|title=Killed on 9/11, Fire Chaplain Becomes Larger Than Life|date=September 27, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Wakin|first1=Daniel J.}}</ref>

====Labor====

Many workplace chaplains (commonly called industrial chaplains) are sponsored by labor unions, including in some cases chaplains for police and firefighters. The [[United Auto Workers]] Union (UAW) sponsors a chaplaincy program for all of its local unions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://uaw.org/pro-member-the-uaw-chaplaincy-program/ | title=PRO-Member: The UAW Chaplaincy Program| date=2015-05-15}}</ref> In New York City, the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|Electricians Union]] (IBEW Local 3) has affiliated [[Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Masonic]] organizations with chaplains.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://local3ibew.org/club-directory | title=Club Directory}}</ref>

Union chaplains are often viewed as advantageous as they are accountable to the employees and not corporate management.

====Corporate====
Some businesses, large or small, employ chaplains for their staff or clientele. Services provided may include employee assistance and counseling services; wellness seminars; conflict management and mediation; leadership and management development; and trauma/serious incident response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplainswithoutborders.org/about-us/|title=About Us|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022175718/http://www.chaplainswithoutborders.org/about-us/|archive-date=October 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2007, 4,000 corporate chaplains were reported to be working in the U.S.,<ref>The Economist (August 25, 2007, p 64).</ref> with the majority being employees of specialist chaplaincy companies such as Marketplace Chaplains USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchapusa.com|title=Workplace Chaplains Counseling Employee Wellness Program Corporate Chaplain}}</ref> and Corporate Chaplains of America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaplain.org|title=Corporate Chaplains of America - A nationwide network of full-time, trained chaplains bringing caring to the workplace}}</ref> In 2014, Marketplace Chaplains USA reported employing over 2,800 chaplains in 44 states and over 960 cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mchapusa.com/about-us|title=Corporate Chaplaincy Service Employee Wellness Program : Marketplace Chaplains|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812172933/http://mchapusa.com/about-us|archive-date=August 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The organization added an international arm in 2006; Marketplace Chaplains International serves Canada, the U.K., Mexico and Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketplaceministries.com/chaplainsinternational-whatwedo.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140725230633/http://www.marketplaceministries.com/chaplainsinternational-whatwedo.aspx |archive-date=July 25, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> Capellania Empresarial<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capellania.com.py/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-12-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130183145/http://www.capellania.com.py/index.html |archive-date=January 30, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> provides corporate chaplaincy services in Paraguay.

{{Main|Military chaplain}}
Military chaplains provide pastoral, spiritual and emotional support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea, on bases or in the field. Military chaplains have a long history; the first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century.  Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]].

Chaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional [[theology|theological]] training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain.  Naval chaplains called to service with the [[Royal Marines]] undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos' [[Green beret|Green Beret]].  British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].  [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains must complete a 12-week Specialist Entrant course at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|RAF College Cranwell]] followed by the Chaplains' Induction Course at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House of a further two weeks. The United States Navy will often give chaplain training to cadets seeking a theological route in the military.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaplain Training|url=http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf|access-date=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124181956/http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf#|archive-date=January 24, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, they are granted instant employment as a Navy chaplain once ordained.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaplain Jobs|url=http://www.navy.com/jobs/chaplain.html}}</ref> Additionally, in the United States military, chaplains must be endorsed by their religious affiliation in order to serve in any facet of the military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/chaplain/requirements.jsp|title=Requirements|website=goarmy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113224027/http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |archive-date=November 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In some cases, like that of the U.S. Navy, a Religious Program Specialist may be appointed to help alleviate some of the duties bestowed upon Naval chaplains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religious Program Specialist|url=http://www.navy.com/careers/chaplain-support/religious-program-specialist.html}}</ref>

Military chaplains are normally accorded officer status, although [[Sierra Leone]] had a Naval Lance Corporal chaplain in 2001. In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.

Though the [[Geneva Conventions]] does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed.  Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience.  Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.
[[File:Military chaplain.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy chaplain in [[Iraq]] studies his [[Bible]] for an upcoming service.]]

Inevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] were [[killed in action]] during World War II: a casualty rate greater "than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps" (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]: Chaplain ([[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|LCDR]]) [[Joseph T. O'Callahan]], [[United States Navy|USN]] ([[World War II]]); Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Emil Kapaun]], USA (Posthumous, [[Korean War]]); Chaplain ([[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]]) [[Vincent Capodanno]], USN (Posthumous, [[Vietnam War]]); Chaplain ([[Major (United States)|MAJ]]) [[Charles J. Watters]], [[United States Army|USA]] (Posthumous, Vietnam War); and Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Angelo J. Liteky]], USA (Vietnam).  (Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.

In 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |access-date=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016035152/http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United States European Command]] has co-sponsored an annual [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] every year since 1991 to consider the various issues affecting chaplaincy ministry and other military personnel.

===Music===
Some chaplains use live music as a therapeutic tool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psr.edu/news/singing-chaplain-uses-music-comfort-ailing-patients|title=Singing chaplain uses music to comfort ailing patients - Pacific School of Religion|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218145537/http://www.psr.edu/news/singing-chaplain-uses-music-comfort-ailing-patients|archive-date=December 18, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Music can aid in healing, access core faith and emotions, and help to build rapport in the chaplaincy relationship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.professionalchaplains.org/files/publications/chaplaincy_today_online/volume_28_number_2/28_2paledofsky.pdf |title=Song of the Soul: The Use of Live Music in Professional Chaplaincy |author= Jesse Paledofsky |website=Chaplaincy Today, vol. 28, no. 2, Autumn/Winter 2012, pp. 31–36|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Some nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have chaplains appointed to work with parliamentary bodies, such as the [[Chaplain of the United States Senate]], the [[Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives]], and Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/supporting-the-speaker/speakers-chaplain/|title=Speaker's chaplain|website=UK Parliament}}</ref> In addition to opening proceedings with prayer, these chaplains provide pastoral counseling to congressional members, their staffs, and their families;  coordinate the scheduling of guest chaplains, who offer opening prayers; arrange and sometimes conduct marriages, memorial services, and funeral services for congress, staff, and their families; and conduct or coordinate religious services, study groups, prayer meetings, holiday programs, and religious education programs, as well.

[[File:Rabbi Philip Alstat.jpg|thumb|[[Rabbi]] [[Philip R. Alstat]], c.1920, Jewish chaplain for "[[The Tombs]]" – the Manhattan Correctional Facility – for thirty years.]]
Rabbi [[Philip R. Alstat]] (1891–1976), who—in addition to work as a chaplain in New York hospitals and senior citizen facilities—served for three decades as the Jewish chaplain for "[[The Tombs]]", the Manhattan Detention Facility, once described his service as follows: "My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities—to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars.
Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart."<ref>Edward Fiske, ''New York Times, ''City Prison Chaplains' Load is Heavy, October 26, 1970.</ref>

Chaplains to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years. The [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have well established [[Christianity|Christian]] sports chaplaincy [[Christian ministry|ministries]].

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but occasionally, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration. Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport. This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but also to give them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

===Colonial===
A colonial chaplain was appointed to a [[colony]]. The term is commonly used to refer to the chaplain appointed as a non-[[military chaplain]] to one of the [[Crown Colony|Crown Colonies]] from the late 18th century or early 19th century. [[Richard Johnson (chaplain)|Richard Johnson]] (1756–1827) was the first colonial chaplain appointed to the new [[prison colony]] at [[New South Wales]] in 1786.

===Environmental===
Environmental chaplaincy is an emerging field within chaplaincy. Environmental chaplains (also known as eco-chaplains, Earth chaplains, nature chaplains) provide spiritual care in a way that honors humanity's deep connection to the earth. Environmental chaplains hold many roles. They may support people working on the frontlines of issues like climate change or other environmental issues or they may support people impacted by industrial or other disasters by providing pastoral care, presence, and rituals. Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality. Their role can be to "usher in a new conscience and consciousness to find contentment, the appreciation of inner riches over outer wealth, quality over quantity" using universally appreciated values, such as honesty and vision.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chaplaincy Program Graduates |url=https://www.upaya.org/uploads/pdfs/Corinna.pdf |publisher=Upaya Zen Center |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> Sarah Vekasi <ref>{{cite web |title=The Work that Reconnects |url=http://ecochaplaincy.net/ecochaplaincy.html |publisher=the Eco-Chaplaincy Initiative |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> created a vision of eco-chaplaincy inspired by [[Joanna Macy]]'s The Work that Reconnects,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Work that Reconnects |url=http://workthatreconnects.org |publisher= The Work that Reconnects |access-date=August 20, 2015}}</ref> and saw eco-chaplaincy as a path to facilitating the "Great Turning," which is described as the turning away from a business-as-usual way of being and turning toward a life-sustaining way that protects people and the planet <ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Turning |url=http://workthatreconnects.org/the-global-context/ |publisher= The Work that Reconnects |access-date=August 20, 2015|date=2012-09-21 }}</ref>

===Health care===
Many hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospices employ chaplains to assist with the spiritual, religious, and emotional needs of patients, families and staff. Chaplains are often employed at residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFE) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) as well. Chaplains care for people of all faiths and no faith. In mental health work, chaplains are highly skilled,{{how|date=May 2018}} working with other therapists as part of a multi-disciplinary team, especially where the patient's mental health is associated with their religiosity, or where their mental well-being can be aided by spiritual care.

In the [[United States]], health care chaplains who are board-certified have completed a minimum of four units of Clinical Pastoral Education training through The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acpe.edu|title=Home|first=Advanced Solutions International|last=Inc.|website=www.acpe.edu|access-date=June 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427214433/https://www.acpe.edu/|archive-date=April 27, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Healthcare Chaplains Ministry Association,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcmachaplains.org|title=Home}}</ref> The Institute for Clinical Pastoral Training,;<ref name="certifiedchaplains.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.certifiedchaplains.org|title=Association of Certified Christian Chaplains - Home|website=www.certifiedchaplains.org}}</ref> or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy<ref name="CPSP Pastoral Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsp.org|title=CPSP Pastoral Report}}</ref> and may be certified by one of the following organizations: The Spiritual Care Association,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiritualcareassociation.org/|title=Spiritual Care Association|website=Spiritual Care Association (New York, USA)}}</ref> The Association of Professional Chaplains,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalchaplains.org|title=Association of Professional Chaplains|website=www.professionalchaplains.org}}</ref> The National Association of Catholic Chaplains,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nacc.org|title=Main Page|journal=Scholarpedia|volume=1|issue=2|pages=1|bibcode=2006SchpJ...1....1I|last1=Izhikevich|first1=Eugene|year=2006|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1|doi-access=free}}</ref> Neshama: Association of Jewish Chaplains (formerly The National Association of Jewish Chaplains),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.najc.org|title=Our Mission}}</ref> The Association of Certified Christian Chaplains,<ref name="certifiedchaplains.org"/> or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy.<ref name="CPSP Pastoral Report"/> Certification typically requires a Masters of Divinity degree (or its equivalent), faith group ordination or commissioning, faith group endorsement, and four units (1600 hours) of Clinical Pastoral Education (the [[Military Chaplains Association|Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America]] does require more, but they are a dod2088 501c-3 military support group founded in 1954 by Military Chaplains).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmca.homestead.com|title=Website Disabled}}</ref> The [[Chaplain Innovation Lab]], set up in 2008, has responded rapidly and creatively to the unique pastoral demands of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; it has 3000 members world-wide.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53284610</ref>

In Canada, health care chaplains may be certified by the Canadian Association for Spiritual Care.

In the UK, health care chaplains are employed by their local [[NHS Trust]] (Health Boards in Scotland and Wales) or by [[charities]] associated with delivering health care such as a [[hospice]] or private hospital. The NHS in England publishes occasional guidance on chaplaincy practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nhs-chaplaincy-guidelines-2015.pdf|title=NHS Chaplaincy Guidelines 2015|website=NHS England}}</ref> UK Chaplains are drawn from a range of faith and belief backgrounds, and are not necessarily ordained or a recognised faith leader. In Scotland Healthcare Chaplaincy developed to be 'generic' from 2002 onwards; that is the chaplaincy provides spiritual care to all people and chaplains do not represent a faith or belief group. They may work on a full-time and [[Part-time job|part-time]] basis, and some work unpaid but with formal recognition for a faith or belief group regarding their training and status and may be termed ''honorary'' chaplain. The term ''Voluntary'' Chaplain is frowned on.{{By whom|date=October 2018}} The largest [[professional body]] for the UK is the College of Health Care Chaplains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.healthcarechaplains.org/|title=Home - College of Health Care Chaplains|website=College of Health Care Chaplains}}</ref> Scotland historically had a distinct professional body, the Scottish Association of Chaplains in Healthcare (SACH) but this has since dissolved. Northern Ireland also has the Healthcare Chaplains Association. Membership of the College of Health Care Chaplains was historically not open to Catholic Priests as it carries with it the  membership of the Unite [[Trade Union]], but this changed in April 2018. Chaplains working in a [[palliative care]] setting may also choose to join the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpcc.org.uk/|title=AHPCC|website=www.ahpcc.org.uk}}</ref> Other less formal networks also exist supporting Chaplaincy in Paediatric settings and GP based Chaplaincy.

Within the UK there is also the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbhc.org.uk/|title=Welcome to the website of the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy - UKBHC|website=www.ukbhc.org.uk}}</ref> (UKBHC) which has been set up in order to regulate the ministry and professional practice of health care chaplains. They publish a code of conduct which all registered chaplains are bound to abide by. The UKBHC has successfully applied to the Professional Standards Authority<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/|title=Professional Standards Authority - Home|website=www.professionalstandards.org.uk}}</ref> to be an accredited register of healthcare chaplains demonstrating that it meets the Authority's high standards in areas such as governance and training.

Peer-reviewed journals that publish scholarly articles and research on healthcare chaplaincy include the ''Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy (USA)'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/whcc20/current|title=Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy: Vol 23, No 3|website=www.tandfonline.com}}</ref> the international journal ''Health and Social Care Chaplaincy'' (UK) <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/journals/hscc-parent/|title=Health and Social Care Chaplaincy -Equinox Publishing}}</ref> and the ''Journal of Religion and Health'' (US).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Journal of Religion and Health (Springer, New York, USA)|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/10943|journal=Journal of Religion and Health}}</ref>

===Cruise===
Working on board cruise ships, cruise chaplains provide pastoral and spiritual support to both passengers and crew members. With the co-operation of cruise companies, chaplains normally stay on board for the specific duration of a cruise. Catholic seafarers' charity Apostleship of the Sea<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/|title=Apostleship of the Sea Welcomes You - AoS|website=apostleshipofthesea.org.uk}}</ref> currently deploys chaplains on board [[P&O Cruises]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocruises.com/?gclid=COT8_5qPkcQCFWL3wgodc6AAUQ|title=P&O Cruises: 2017, 2018 & 2019 Cruise Holidays|first=P&O|last=Cruises|website=www.pocruises.com}}</ref> and [[Cunard Line]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cunard.co.uk/|title=Cruise Vacations|first=Cunard|last=UK|website=Cunard}}</ref> ships during the Christmas and Easter periods. While ministering to passengers are part of Apostleship of the Sea's chaplains<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/cruise-chaplaincy|title=Cruise Chaplaincy - AoS|website=apostleshipofthesea.org.uk}}</ref> role, their main focus is the welfare of the crew, who can often spend many months at sea away from home.

===Domestic===
<!-- "Domestic chaplain" redirects here - please change redirect if changing header name -->
A domestic chaplain was a chaplain attached to a [[nobility|noble]] [[household]] in order to grant the family a degree of self-sufficiency in religion. The chaplain was freed from any obligation to reside in a particular place so could travel with the family, internationally if necessary, and minister to their spiritual needs. Further, the family could appoint a chaplain who reflected their own doctrinal views. Domestic chaplains performed family christenings, funerals and weddings and were able to conduct services in the family's private chapel, excusing the nobility from attending public worship.<ref name="gibson">Gibson (1997) ''pp''1–6</ref>

In feudal times most laymen, and for centuries even most noblemen, were poorly educated and the chaplain would also be an important source of [[scholarship]] in the household, tutoring children and providing counsel to the family on matters broader than religion.<ref name="gibson"/> Before the advent of the [[lawyer|legal profession]], modern [[bureaucracy]] and [[civil service]], the literate clergy were often employed as [[secretary|secretarial]] staff, as in a [[chancellor|chancery]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Hence the term ''clerk'', derived from Latin ''clericus'' (clergyman).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This made them very influential in temporal affairs. There was also a moral impact since they heard the confessions of the elite.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

The domestic chaplain was an important part of the life of the [[peerage]] in [[England]] from the reign of [[Henry VIII]] to the middle of the 19th century. Up until 1840, [[Anglican]] domestic chaplains were regulated by [[law]] and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a [[license]] to hold two [[benefice]]s simultaneously while residing in neither.<ref name="gibson"/>

Many monarchies and major [[nobility|noble]] houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their [[Ecclesiastical Household]], either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II has 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one [[Chapel Royal]], sometimes as significant as a [[cathedral]]. A modern example is [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], also the home of the [[Order of the Garter]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Other<!--'Examining chaplain' and 'Examining chaplains' redirect here-->===
[[File:Chaplain Office York Railway Station.JPG|thumb|Chaplain's Office, [[York railway station]]]]

There are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as [[Boys' Brigade|Boys']] and [[Girls' Brigade]] companies and [[Scouting|Scout]] troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, and theaters.

The term can also refer to priests attached to [[Catholic]] [[convent]]s. There is also the position of [[Chaplain of His Holiness]], a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.

{{anchor|examining chaplain}}In the [[Church of England]] and other Anglican churches, a Bishop's "'''examining chaplain'''('''s'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->)" are those (usually priests) who examine candidates for ordination and advise the bishop as to their suitability. This role, and ordination processes, have varied greatly in the churches' history and between the churches.<ref>[https://anglicanenl.net/home/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ordinationpamphlet.pdf]</ref>

At the [[University of Oxford]], the term [[Dafydd ap Gwilym Society#Caplaniaid of Y Dafydd|Caplan]] is used for the position equivalent to president, for the head of the [[:cy:Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym|Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym]], ([[Dafydd ap Gwilym Society]]) the Oxford University Welsh society, named after the 14th-century Welsh poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym.
