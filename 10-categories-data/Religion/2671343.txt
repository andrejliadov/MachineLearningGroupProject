Historical records of criticism of religion go back to at least 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]], with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the Atheist" of Melos]]. In [[ancient Rome]], an early known example is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[De rerum natura]]'' from the 1st century BCE.

==Definition of religion==
{{Main|Definition of religion|Religion}}
Before the 17th century, religion was conflated with every day life.

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.<ref name="Nongbri"/><ref name="50 myths"/> However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.<ref name="Fitzgerald">{{Cite book|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC|isbn= 9780198041030}}</ref><ref name="Nongbri" /><ref name="50 myths" /><ref name="dubuisson"/>

==History of criticism==
In his work ''[[De rerum natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Lucretius|Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |author-link=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |access-date=2007-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archive-date=2007-06-30 }}</ref> A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, Lucretius believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2007-08-05 }}</ref><ref name="Stanford - Lucretius">{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|access-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.<ref name="Latin-English: On Nature">{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D.

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".<ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}">{{Cite book |author1=Middlemore, S.

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
In the early 21st century, the [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the "Four Horsemen's" works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion, injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attack human dignity and on the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. According to Zenc, while the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged, it does not stand up to the full definition of a movement.<ref>The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.<ref>Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.</ref>

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Baháʼí Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |url=https://archive.org/details/breakingspell00dani |url-access=registration |publisher=Viking Adult |year= 2006|isbn=978-0-670-03472-7 }}</ref> These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).<ref>{{cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | access-date=2010-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html }}</ref> Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.<ref name="The God Delusion" /><ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}">{{Cite book |author=Onfray, Michel |author-link=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55970-820-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/indefenseofathei0000onfr }}</ref>

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quote|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]<ref name="critright"/>}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].<ref name="critright">{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | author-link =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | chapter-url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}</ref>

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | author-link =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | year =1867 | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | no-pp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}</ref>

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'']]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =The Selfish Gene, 30th Anniversary edition  | year =2006 | title-link =The Selfish Gene }}</ref> He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.<ref>{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =Viruses of the Mind | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html }}</ref>

====Response to virus of the mind criticism====
Both the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} Some have criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that it is far removed from evidence and data" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes.<ref>In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.</ref> [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support</ref> or that religious ideas function the way Dawkins claims.<ref>''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138</ref>

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''Why People Believe Strange Things'' he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand.

===Immature stage of societal development===

Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subjective, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive".<ref>{{cite web|last=Comte|first=Auguste|title=Course of Positive Philosophy (1830)|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/comte_cpp.html}}</ref>

This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer & Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky & Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}</ref>

===Honor killings and stoning===
{{Main|Honor killings|stoning}}
Honor killings once well known in the Western countries are now extremely rare, however, they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor killing is when a person is killed by family for bringing [[honour|dishonor]] or [[shame]] upon the family.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3 |title=Ethics - Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |access-date=2013-08-16}}</ref>

Stoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group batters a person with thrown stones until the person dies.

===Genital modification and mutilation===
{{See|Circumcision controversies|Female genital mutilation#Religion|Religious male circumcision}}

According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries, it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom, with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> The Jewish Bible, the New Testament, and the Quran themselves do not contain textual support for the practice of female genital mutilation even though the practice predates both Islam and Christianity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Damanhoury |first1=El |title=The Jewish and Christian view on female genital mutilation |journal=African Journal of Urology |date=September 2013 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=127–129 |doi=10.1016/j.afju.2013.01.004|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]]'s execution.

During the 19th century, the [[conflict thesis]] developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=David B.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science & Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|chapter=The Historiography of Science and Religion}}</ref> The historical conflict thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Colin A.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science & Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|page=7|chapter=The Conflict Thesis |quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}</ref><ref name="Shapin1996">{{Cite book

==Morality==
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] contends that [[Theism|theistic religions]] devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the [[Bible]] contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.<ref name="The God Delusion" /> [[Albert Einstein]] stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| newspaper=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}</ref>

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold views different from those of non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".<ref name="Morality Continues to Decay">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay"] (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]]), [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})</ref>

===Children===

In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.<ref>"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''</ref>

===Homosexuals===
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}
[[File:Anti gay San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Christian protest against [[San Francisco Pride]] 2010]]
[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old Testament of the Bible and in the Quran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+10%2C+2006&author=Stephanie+Simon&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies }}</ref>

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduced discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.<ref>{{cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |work=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |access-date=2010-01-02}}</ref>

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don't We Practice What We Preach?

===Women===

[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]
The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] regardless of gender but fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|newspaper=the Guardian|access-date=30 September 2014|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref> This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref> [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: <blockquote>"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&btnG=Search+Books|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

[[Islamic laws]] have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women.<ref>https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf</ref> The [[United Nations]] say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful [[female genital mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.<ref name="unfpa.org">{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | access-date=2008-02-08 }}</ref> [[Maryam Namazie]] argues that women are victimized under [[Sharia law]], both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.<ref name="onelawforall.org.uk">{{Cite web |url=http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208211345/http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf |archive-date=2019-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|journal=Middle East Forum|access-date=30 September 2014|date=March 2009|last1=Chesler|first1=Phyllis}}</ref>

Christianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2030628|title=The Christian Men's Oldest Prejudice: Misogyny, Hate Or Fear?|access-date=30 September 2014|last1=Ozturk|first1=Anil}}</ref> Katharine M.

Christian religious figures have been involved in the Middle Ages and early modern period [[Witch-hunt|witch trials]], which were generally used to punish assertive or independent women such as [[midwife|midwives]] since [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence,<ref>{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}</ref> or [[activists]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}</ref>

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy.

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|work=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}</ref>

The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States.

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.<ref name="Nongbri"/><ref name="50 myths"/> However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.<ref name="Fitzgerald">{{Cite book|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC|isbn= 9780198041030}}</ref><ref name="Nongbri" /><ref name="50 myths" /><ref name="dubuisson"/>

==History of criticism==
In his work ''[[De rerum natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Lucretius|Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |author-link=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |access-date=2007-08-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archive-date=2007-06-30 }}</ref> A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, Lucretius believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2007-08-05 }}</ref><ref name="Stanford - Lucretius">{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|access-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.<ref name="Latin-English: On Nature">{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D.

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".<ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}">{{Cite book |author1=Middlemore, S.

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Christopher Hitchens]], journalist and author of ''[[God is not Great]]'']]
In the early 21st century, the [[New Atheism|New Atheists]] became focal polemicists in modern criticism of religion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=David|title=What are the merits of recent claims by atheistic scholars that modern science proves religion to be false and vain?|url=http://www.sciencemeetsreligion.org/theology/atheists.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The New Atheists|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> The four authors come from widely different backgrounds and have published books which have been the focus of criticism of religion narratives, with over 100 books and hundreds of scholarly articles commenting on and critiquing the "Four Horsemen's" works. Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion, injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attack human dignity and on the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. According to Zenc, while the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged, it does not stand up to the full definition of a movement.<ref>The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.<ref>Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.</ref>

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Baháʼí Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |url=https://archive.org/details/breakingspell00dani |url-access=registration |publisher=Viking Adult |year= 2006|isbn=978-0-670-03472-7 }}</ref> These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).<ref>{{cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | access-date=2010-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html }}</ref> Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.<ref name="The God Delusion" /><ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}">{{Cite book |author=Onfray, Michel |author-link=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55970-820-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/indefenseofathei0000onfr }}</ref>

Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]<ref name="critright"/>}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].<ref name="critright">{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | author-link =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | chapter-url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}</ref>

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | author-link =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | year =1867 | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | no-pp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}</ref>

===Immature stage of societal development===
[[File:Daniel Huntington Philosophy and Christian Art.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Natural philosophy|Philosophy]] and [[Christian Art]], W. Ridgway, 1878]]
Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subjective, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive".<ref>{{cite web|last=Comte|first=Auguste|title=Course of Positive Philosophy (1830)|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/comte_cpp.html}}</ref>

This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer & Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky & Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events.

===Genital modification and mutilation===
{{See|Circumcision controversies|Female genital mutilation#Religion|Religious male circumcision}}

According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries, it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom, with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> The Jewish Bible, the New Testament, and the Quran themselves do not contain textual support for the practice of female genital mutilation even though the practice predates both Islam and Christianity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Damanhoury |first1=El |title=The Jewish and Christian view on female genital mutilation |journal=African Journal of Urology |date=September 2013 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=127–129 |doi=10.1016/j.afju.2013.01.004|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Despite [[honor killings]] occurring in multiple cultures and religions, [[Islam]] is frequently blamed for their institution and persistence. Professor Tahira Shaid Khan notes that there is nothing in the [[Qur'an]] that permits or sanctions [[honor killings]],<ref name=r1>Hilary Mantell [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"].

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress. Examples cited in their writings include the [[Galileo affair|trial of Galileo]] and [[Giordano Bruno]]'s execution.

During the 19th century, the [[conflict thesis]] developed. According to this model, any interaction between religion and science must inevitably lead to open hostility, with religion usually taking the part of the aggressor against new scientific ideas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=David B.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science & Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|chapter=The Historiography of Science and Religion}}</ref> The historical conflict thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach in the [[history of science]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but its original form is almost entirely discarded by scholars today.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=Colin A.|editor=Gary Ferngren|title=Science & Religion: A Historical Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7038-5|page=7|chapter=The Conflict Thesis |quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}</ref><ref name="Shapin1996">{{Cite book

According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".<ref name="Morality Continues to Decay">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay"] (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]]), [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})</ref>

In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.<ref>"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''</ref>

===Homosexuals===
{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}
[[File:Anti gay San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Christian protest against [[San Francisco Pride]] 2010]]
[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old Testament of the Bible and in the Quran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+10%2C+2006&author=Stephanie+Simon&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies }}</ref>

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduced discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.<ref>{{cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |work=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |access-date=2010-01-02}}</ref>

===Racism===
[[File:Ku Klux Klan members and a burning cross, Denver, Colorado, 1921.jpg|thumb|Burning cross often used by [[Ku Klux Klan]] to intimidate minorities]]
In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don't We Practice What We Preach?

Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]].

===Women===
{{See also|Gender and religion|Christianity and domestic violence|Islam and domestic violence|Misogyny}}
[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]
The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] regardless of gender but fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|newspaper=the Guardian|access-date=30 September 2014|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref> This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref> [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: <blockquote>"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&btnG=Search+Books|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|access-date=30 September 2014}}</ref>

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|journal=Middle East Forum|access-date=30 September 2014|date=March 2009|last1=Chesler|first1=Phyllis}}</ref>

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy.

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|work=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}</ref>

The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].<ref>{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | author-link =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston }}</ref> Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W. Whitehead]] and although they represent different theological and political ideas, dominionists believe they have a Christian duty to take "control of a sinful secular society", either by putting fundamentalist Christians in office, or by introducing biblical law into the secular sphere.<ref name=berlet1998 /><ref>{{Cite book | last =Ansell | first =Amy E | title =Unraveling the Right: The New Conservatism in American Thought and Politics | publisher =Westview Press | year =1998 | url =https://archive.org/details/unravelingright00amye_0 | isbn =978-0-8133-3147-8 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last =Schaeffer | first =Francis | author-link =Francis Schaeffer | title =A Christian Manifesto | publisher =Crossway Books | year =1982  |  isbn=978-0-89107-233-1  }}</ref> Social scientists have used the word "dominionism" to refer to adherence to [[dominion theology]]<ref name="Barron1992a">{{cite book | last=Barron | first=Bruce | year=1992 | title=Heaven on Earth?
