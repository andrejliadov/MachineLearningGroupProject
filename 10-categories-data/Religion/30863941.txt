{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=concepts}}
'''Religious censorship''' is a form of [[censorship]] where [[freedom of expression]] is controlled or limited using [[religious authority]] or on the basis of the teachings of the [[religion]]. This form of censorship has a long history and is practiced in many societies and by many religions. Examples include the [[Edict of Compiègne]], the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (list of prohibited books) and the condemnation of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' by [[Iran]]ian leader [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]].

Religious censorship can also take form in the destruction of monuments and texts that contradict or conflict with the religion practiced by the oppressors, such as attempts to censor the ''[[Religious debates over the Harry Potter series|Harry Potter]]'' book series.<ref>{{cite book|title = Literature Suppressed on Religious Grounds|edition = Revised |date = 2006|publisher=Facts on File|isbn =0816062692|first1=Margaret |last1=Bald |first2= Ken|last2= Wachsberger}}</ref> Destruction of historic places is another form of religious censorship. One cited incident of religious censorship was the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] statues in Afghanistan by radical Islamists as part of their religious goal of oppressing another religion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/toppling-monuments-erasing-history/2017/08/18/1a4a4176-82c3-11e7-9e7a-20fa8d7a0db6_story.html|title=Toppling monuments, erasing history|date=18 August 2017|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

==Overview==
Religious censorship is defined as the act of suppressing views that are contrary of those of an [[organized religion]]. It is usually performed on the grounds of [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], [[sacrilege]] or [[impiety]] - the censored work being viewed as [[obscene]], challenging a [[dogma]], or violating a religious [[taboo]]. Defending against these charges is often difficult as some religious traditions permit only the religious authorities ([[clergy]]) to interpret [[doctrine]] and the interpretation is usually [[dogmatic]]. For instance, the [[Catholic Church]] banned hundreds of books on such grounds and maintained the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (''list of prohibited books''), most of which were writings that the Church's [[Holy Office]] had deemed dangerous, until the Index's abolishment in 1965.

==In Christianity==
The invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] around 1440 changed the nature of book publishing.<ref>McLuhan, Marshall (1962), The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man (1st ed.), University of Toronto Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-6041-9}} page 124</ref> As of the 16th century, in most European countries both the church and governments attempted to regulate and control printing. Governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them to have official licenses to trade and produce books.<ref name="MacQueen 2007 34">{{Cite book | last = MacQueen | first = Hector L |author2=Charlotte Waelde |author3=Graeme T Laurie | title = Contemporary Intellectual Property: Law and Policy | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | page = 34 | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=_Iwcn4pT0OoC&dq=contemporary+intellectual+property&source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 978-0-19-926339-4}}</ref><ref name="de Sola Pool 1983 14">{{Cite book| last = de Sola Pool| first = Ithiel| title = Technologies of freedom| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 1983| page = [https://archive.org/details/technologiesoffr00ithi/page/14 14]| url = https://archive.org/details/technologiesoffr00ithi/page/14| isbn = 978-0-674-87233-2| url-access = registration}}</ref> In 1557 the [[English Crown]] aimed to stem the flow of dissent by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was restricted to the two universities ([[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]) and the 21 existing printers in the [[City of London]]. In France, the 1551 [[Edict of Châteaubriant]] included provisions for unpacking and inspecting all books brought into France.<ref>''The Rabelais encyclopedia'' by Elizabeth A.

A first version of the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' ("List of Prohibited Books") was promulgated by [[Pope Paul IV]] in 1559, and multiple revisions were made to it over the years.

Some works named in the ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' are the writings of [[Desiderius Erasmus]], a Catholic scholar who argued that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was probably forged and ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', a treatise by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] arguing for a [[Heliocentric theory|heliocentric orbit of the earth]], both works that at the time contradicted the Church's official stance on particular issues.

The final (20th) edition appeared in 1948, and it was formally abolished on 14 June 1966 by [[Pope Paul VI]].<ref>[http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/starry/galbooks.html Cambridge University on Index.]</ref><ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285220/Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'']</ref> However, the moral obligation of the Index was not abolished, according to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].<ref>"Haec S. Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei, facto verbo cum Beatissimo Patre, nuntiat Indicem suum vigorem moralem servare, quatenus Christifidelium conscientiam docet, ut ab illis scriptis, ipso iure naturali exigente, caveant, quae fidem ac bonos mores in discrimen adducere possint; eundem tamen non-amplius vim legis ecclesiasticae habere cum adiectis censuris" (''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 58 (1966), p. 445).

In order to preserve the integrity of the truths of faith and morals, the pastors of the Church have the duty and right to be watchful so that no harm is done to the faith or morals of the Christian faithful through writings or the use of instruments of social communication. They also have the duty and right to demand that writings to be published by the Christian faithful which touch upon faith or morals be submitted to their judgment and have the duty and right to condemn writings which harm correct faith or good morals. §2. Bishops, individually or gathered in particular councils or conferences of bishops, have the duty and right mentioned in §1 with regard to the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the supreme authority of the Church, however, has this duty and right with regard to the entire people of God. Can. 824 §1. Unless it is established otherwise, the local ordinary whose permission or approval to publish books must be sought according to the canons of this title is the proper local ordinary of the author or the ordinary of the place where the books are published. §2.

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}

Although nothing in the Qur'an explicitly imposes censorship, similar methodology has been carried out under [[Islam]]ic [[theocracy|theocracies]], such as the [[fatwa]] (''religious judgment'') against ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (a novel), ordering that the author be executed for [[blasphemy]].

Some [[Islamic]] societies have religious police, who seize banned consumer products and media regarded as un-Islamic, such as CDs/DVDs of various Western musical groups, television shows and film.<ref name="asianews.it">[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&art=5869 SAUDI ARABIA Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh - Asia News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323184717/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&art=5869 |date=23 March 2015 }}</ref> In [[Saudi Arabia]], religious police actively prevent the practice or proselytizing of non-Islamic religions within Arabia, where they are banned.<ref name="asianews.it"/> This included the ban of the film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

Examples of Muslim censorship:

* [[Depictions of Muhammad]] have inspired considerable controversy and censorship in the 2000s, including the adjacent image.
* ''[[The Jewel of Medina]]'', a work of historical fiction censored pre-publication.

== In Judaism ==
Throughout the history of the publishing of Jewish books, various works have been censored or banned. These can be divided into two main categories: Censorship by a non-Jewish government, and self-censorship. Self-censorship could be done either by the author himself, or by the publisher, out of fear from the gentiles or public reaction. Another important distinction that has to be made is between the censorship which existed already on manuscripts, before the printing press was invented, and the more official censorship after the printing press was invented.

===Non-jewish government censorship===
Many studies have been written on censorship and its influence on the publishing of Jewish books. For example, studies have appeared on the censorship of Jewish books when they were first starting to be published, in [[Italy]] in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. Other studies have been written on the censorship of the Czarist government in [[Russia]] in the nineteenth century.

Many of the "official" Christian government censors of Jewish books were Jewish apostates. The main reason for this was due to their knowledge of Hebrew, especially Rabbinic Hebrew.

In Czarist Russia in the nineteenth century, it was decreed that Jewish books could only be published in two cities, [[Vilnius]] and [[Zhitomir]].

===Censorship by Jewish religious authorities===
{{see also|Heresy in Judaism#Jews accused of heresy}}
The [[Mishnah]] ([[Sanhedrin]] 10:1) prohibits the reading of [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|extra-biblical books]] (ספרים חיצונים). The [[Talmud]] explains this to mean the book of Ben Sirah ([[Sirach]]).
In the early thirteenth century the philosophical book ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' by [[Maimonides]] was prohibited to be read until one was older by some French and Spanish Jewish leaders, because of the perceived danger of [[philosophy]]. Philosophy was prohibited to be learned until the age of forty. The same restriction was later applied to [[Kabbalah]], in the fifteenth century.
In the 1720s, the kabbalistic works of Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzato]] were banned by religious leaders. In the 1690s, the book [[Pri Chadash]] was banned in Egypt for arguing on earlier authorities.<ref>http://www.thejewisheye.com/gedolimb34.html|accessed{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 4 August 2011</ref>

In the modern era, when government censorship of Jewish books is uncommon, books are mainly self-censored, or banned by Orthodox Jewish religious authorities. [[Marc Shapiro]] points out that not all books considered heretical by Orthodox Jews are banned; only those books on which there is a risk that Orthodox Jews may read them are banned.<ref>http://www.edah.org/backend/JournalArticle/3_2_Shapiro.pdf | Accessed 4 August 2011</ref>
Some examples:
*The [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Siddur]] (1945), revised by [[Mordecai Kaplan]].
*''Torah Study: A Survey of Classic Sources on Timely Issues'' (1990), by Rabbi [[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Leo Levi]], was banned by Rabbi [[Elazar Shach]]. It was banned because it discussed the value of studying subjects other than [[Torah study|Torah]].
*''My Uncle The Netziv'' (1988), an excerpt of the book ''Mekor Baruch'' by Rabbi [[Baruch Epstein]], was banned by anonymous Rabbis in [[Lakewood CDP, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[New Jersey]]. It was banned because it was perceived to have said unflattering things about the [[Netziv]].<ref>http://download.yutorah.org/2011/TU2_Schachter1.pdf (PDF)|Accessed 6 August 2011</ref>
*''HaGaon'' (Hebrew, 2002), a biography of the [[Vilna Gaon]], by Dov Eliach, was banned by [[Chassidic]] leaders for its attacks against Chassidus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seforim.traditiononline.org/index.cfm/HaGaon |title=Tradition Seforim Blog : HaGaon |publisher=Seforim.traditiononline.org |accessdate=2013-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709071211/http://seforim.traditiononline.org/index.cfm/HaGaon |archivedate=9 July 2013}}</ref>
*''The Science of Torah'' (2001), by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]], was banned by Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and others. It was banned because it explained how the theory of evolution can fit with Judaism; evolution is opposed by many authorities. Slifkin's books ''Mysterious Creatures'' (2003) and ''The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax'' (2004) were also banned, because they brought down opinions that [[Chazal]] could be incorrect in their scientific knowledge.
*''[[Making of a Godol]]'' (2002), by Rabbi Nathan Kamenetsky, was banned by Rabbi [[Yosef Shalom Elyashiv]] and other Orthodox Jewish authorities because of its sometimes unflattering portrayals of Jewish leaders.
*''The Dignity of Difference'' (2002), by Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], was banned by Rabbi Elayshiv and others. It was banned because it was perceived to equate Judaism with other religions.
*''One People, Two Worlds: A Reform rabbi and an Orthodox rabbi explore the issues that divide them'' (2003) by [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] Rabbi [[Ammiel Hirsch]] and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Rabbi [[Yosef Reinman]], was banned by the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] of [[Agudath Israel of America]] and the heads of [[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey.
*''[[Kosher Jesus]]'', by Rabbi [[Shmuley Boteach]], was banned in 2012 by the [[Chabad]] rabbi [[Jacob Immanuel Schochet]], who labelled the book as heretical and stated that it "poses a tremendous risk to the Jewish community," and that "I have never read a book, let alone one authored by a purported ''[[frum]]'' Jew, that does more to enhance the evangelical [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary]] message and agenda than the aforementioned book".<ref name=Canada>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/life/Kosher+Jesus+book+ignites+skirmish+between+Jewish+scholars/6064343/story.html |title='Kosher Jesus' book ignites skirmish between Jewish scholars |last=Boswell |first=Randy |date=30 January 2012|work=Canada.com}}</ref>

== In the Baháʼí Faith ==
The [[Baháʼí Faith]] has a requirement that Baháʼí authors should seek review of their works by the [[Spiritual Assembly#National Spiritual Assemblies|National Spiritual Assembly]] of the country in which it will be printed. The requirement was initiated by [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] and intended to sunset when the religion grows in numbers. The publication review requirement does not apply to most online content or local promotional material. According to the [[Universal House of Justice]], the highest governing body of the religion, 
{{quote|The purpose of review is to protect the Faith against misrepresentation by its own followers at this early stage of its existence when comparatively few people have any knowledge of it. An erroneous presentation of the Teachings by a Baháʼí who is accounted a scholar, in a scholarly journal, would by that very fact, do far more harm than an erroneous presentation made by an obscure Baháʼí author with no pretensions to scholarship.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lights of Guidance|page=101|url=http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance.html&chapter=2|editor=Helen Hornby|publisher = Baháʼí Library Online}}</ref>}}

The review requirement has been criticized by a few academic Baháʼís as censorship. [[Juan Cole]], professor of history at the University of Michigana, had conflicts over the issue and withdrew his membership as a Baháʼí, claiming that it "has provoked many conflicts between Baháʼí officials and writers over the years."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cole |first= Juan R.I. | authorlink = Juan Cole |title= The Baha'i (sic) Faith in America as Panopticon, 1963-1997 | url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahai/1999/jssr/bhjssr.htm |journal= [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |date= June 1998 |volume= 37 |issue= 2 |pages=234–248 |doi= 10.2307/1387523 |jstor= 1387523 |oclc=781517232 |access-date= 30 September 2016 |via=Baháʼí Library Online}}</ref> [[Denis MacEoin]] similarly resigned his membership and said that the review stifled research in [[Baháʼí studies]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= MacEoin |first= Denis |authorlink=Denis MacEoin |title=The crisis in Bábí and Baháʼí studies: part of a wider crisis in academic freedom? |url= http://fglaysher.com/bahaicensorship/archives/Denis%20MacEoin,%20Crisis%20in%20Babi%20and%20Baha'i%20Studies.pdf |journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |publisher=[[British Society for Middle Eastern Studies]] |date=1990 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=55–61|doi=10.1080/13530199008705506}}</ref> [[Moojan Momen]], another academic in the field of [[Baháʼí studies]] who has called MacEoin and Cole "[[Apostasy|apostates]]," disagrees and states that "there is no more 'censorship' involved in this process than with any other academic journal."<ref>{{cite journal | title= Marginality and Apostasy in the Baháʼí Community | url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_marginality_apostasy| first = Moojan | last= Momen |authorlink= Moojan Momen | journal=[[Religion (journal)|Religion]] |publisher=[[Routledge]]| pages = 187–209 | year = 2007 | volume=37| number = 37:3 | doi=10.1016/j.religion.2007.06.008| s2cid=55630282|oclc=186359943}}</ref>

==In Buddhism==
Art was censored extensively under the [[State Peace and Development Council|military government]] in [[Myanmar]] at the end of the 20th century. Nudity was not permitted, and art was also censored when it was deemed that [[Buddhism]] was portrayed in a non-typical fashion. Following the [[2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms|governmental transition]] in 2011, relevant censorship laws remained in effect but were enforced more loosely.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=Melissa |title=Painting as cipher: censorship of the visual arts in post-1988 Myanmar |journal=Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia |date=March 2016 |page=145}}</ref>

Broadly, the public reaction to Mandel's [[censorship]] decree was one of disapproval.<ref>[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=60311&postcount=21 Donna McKinnon, "No Place For Censorship," Edmonton Journal, 23 September 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=60548&postcount=29 "Venting," compiled by Terry McConnell, Edmonton Journal, 25 September 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.connect2edmonton.ca/forum/showpost.php?p=61473&postcount=38 Krishna Bagdiya, "Sculptures No Threat," Edmonton Journal, 30 September 2007]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In an interview with the [[Edmonton Journal]]'s Paula Simons, David Goa, religious scholar, cultural anthropologist, and director of the University of Alberta's [[Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life]], states ''"In India, Lord Ganesha is on everything -- playing cards, advertising signs, lotto tickets, even diapers, I suspect."'' Within the traditional [[Thirty-two forms of Ganesha]] in Hinduism, Ganesha is sometimes presented nude, in both infant ([[Bala Ganapati]]) and erotic ([[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]) forms. Simons concludes, ''"In his haste to appease a few protesters, the mayor, usually a champion of the arts, made a serious error in judgment. Instead of giving McCourt's divinely inspired statues the bum's rush, we should be celebrating this Canadian cross-pollination of cultures and aesthetic forms"''.<ref name="sac" /> ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s columnist [[Margaret Wente]] agreed with Simons: ''"The mayor, of course, was quite wrong. Mr. McCourt's sculptures did not insult the Hindu community. They insulted a small but vocal conservative religious group that is about as representative of Hindus as Hassidic Jews are of Jews.... There's a big difference between respecting different cultures and caving in to illiberalism and superstition."''<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/why-are-we-so-afraid-to-offend/article725582/ Margaret Wente, "Why Are We So Afraid To Offend?," The Globe and Mail, 29 September 2007]</ref>

Despite such negative responses in the media to visual art censorship in Canada, in 2014 the Edmonton Arts Council subsequently refused a donation of one of McCourt's sculptures, "''Destroyer of Obstacles''," evidently because the sculpture had genitalia ''beneath its clothes''.<ref>[http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2015/04/24/reaching-for-a-reasonable-justification-for-censorship/ PZ Myers, "Reaching For a Reasonable Justification for Censorship," Pharyngula, 24 April 2015]</ref> After meeting with seven Hindu community group representative to seek out their opinion of the donation, the Edmonton Arts Council received a response that McCourt's sculpture was ''"an offense to their religion"'' and that the ban enacted by Mayor Mandel should remain in place.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://us6.campaign-archive2.com/?u=5abab0a9c9b37e16ccd9e973c&id=7a39732458 |publisher =Edmonton Arts Council |work = Briefing Note|date= 12 June 2014|title =Open Letter to the CCLA, the ACLRC, & the RMCLA|first= Ryan|last= McCourt}}</ref> As a result of this consultation, ''"the Public Art Committee unanimously voted to decline acceptance of the gift, as the artwork did not meet "community or civic suitability" criteria."'' In McCourt's view, ''"It is not the purpose of a city’s public art collection to placate special interests",'' he says. ''"I want Edmonton to build the best civic art collection that we can get, never mind the politics, the religion, etc. of the artists making the work".''<ref>[http://www.curiousarts.ca/the-pleasures-and-perils-of-public-art Donna McKinnon, "The Pleasures and Perils of Public Art," Curious Arts, 27 November 2015]</ref>
