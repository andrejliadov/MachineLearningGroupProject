{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have received criticism from mainstream [[Christianity]], members of the medical community, former members, and commentators regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|their beliefs]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices|practices]]. The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of [[blood transfusions]], particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of [[sexual abuse]] to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.

===Failed predictions===
{{Main|Unfulfilled Watch Tower Society predictions}}
{{See also|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
Central to Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs are their interpretations of the [[second coming]] of Christ, the [[Millenarianism|millennium]] and the [[kingdom of God]]. [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] publications have made, and continue to make, predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.<ref>{{cite book | last=Crompton | first=Robert | title=Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher=James Clarke & Co | year=1996 | location=Cambridge | pages=9, 115 | isbn=0-227-67939-3}}</ref> Some of those early predictions were described as "established truth",<ref>''The Time is at Hand'', Watch Tower Society, 1889, pages 99: "In view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth, that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the kingdom of God will be accomplished by A.D. 1914."; cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 193.</ref> and beyond any doubt.<ref>In 1892 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' stated that God's battle, Armageddon, which was believed to be already under way, would end in October 1914, a date "definitely marked in Scripture" (15 January 1892, page 1355 reprint), and ''Watch Tower'' editor Charles Taze Russell declared:

: "We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, God's dates, not ours." (''The Watchtower'', 15 July 1894, page 1677).
After comparing "unreliable secular chronology" to reliable "Bible chronology", ''The Watch Tower'' stated,

: "It was on this line of reckoning [using the chronology of the Bible as an established fact] that the dates 1874, 1914, and 1918 were located; and the Lord has placed the stamp of his seal upon 1914 and 1918 beyond any possibility of erasure.... Using this same measuring line, beginning with the entry ... of Israel into Canaan, and counting the full 70 cycles ..., as clearly indicated by Jehovah's sending of the Jews into Babylon for the full 70 years, it is an easy matter to locate 1925, probably the fall, for the beginning of the antitypical jubilee. There can be no more question about 1925 than there was about 1914.... Looking back we can now easily see that those dates were clearly indicated in Scripture and doubtless intended by the Lord to encourage his people.... That all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year will not alter the date one whit more than in the other cases." (''The Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, p. 150; Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, page 224).</ref>
Witnesses are told to "be complete in accepting the visible organization's direction in every aspect" and that there is no need to question what God tells them through his Word and organization since love "believes all things".<ref name="FollowingFaithful">{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=1 October 1967|page=591|title=Following Faithful Shepherds with Life in View|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1967723|quote=Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ.

Failed predictions that were either explicitly stated or strongly implied, particularly linked to dates in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925 and 1975, have led to the alteration or abandonment of some teachings. The Society's publications have at times suggested that members had previously "read into the ''Watch Tower'' statements that were never intended"<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', Watch Tower Society, 1959, page 52.</ref> or that the beliefs of members were "based on wrong premises".<ref>"A Solid Basis for Confidence", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1976, page 440.</ref> According to Professor Edmond Gruss, other failed predictions were ignored, and replaced with new predictions; for example, in the book, ''The Finished Mystery'' (1917), events were applied to the years 1918 to 1925 that earlier had been held to occur prior to 1914. When the new interpretations also did not transpire, the 1926 edition of the book changed the statements and removed the dates.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gruss| first=Edmond C.| title=The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation| publisher=Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co| year=1972| pages=87–88| isbn=0-87552-306-4}}</ref>

Raymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has cited publications that claimed God has used Jehovah's Witnesses as a collective prophet.<ref>In ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2002, p. 173, Franz quotes from "They Shall Know That a Prophet Was Among Them" (''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972), which states that God had raised Jehovah's Witnesses as "a prophet to help [people], to warn them of dangers and declare things to come". He also cites "Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8), which identifies the Witnesses as his "true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true", in contrast to "false messengers", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, p. 70, 292), which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, "a genuine prophet within our generation". The Watch Tower book noted: "Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them." He also cites "Execution of the Great Harlot Nears" (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, p. 17), which claims God gives the Witnesses "special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end".</ref> Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as "pathetic".<ref>James A.

These opponents say that dates have been set, but nothing has happened.... Yes, Jehovah's people have had to revise expectations from time to time. Because of our eagerness, we have hoped for the new system earlier than Jehovah's timetable has called for it. But we display our faith in God's Word and its sure promises by declaring its message to others. Moreover, the need to revise our understanding somewhat does not make us false prophets or change the fact that we are living in 'the last days'.... How foolish to take the view that expectations needing some adjustment should call into question the whole body of truth! The evidence is clear that Jehovah has used and is continuing to use his one organization."</ref> Raymond Franz claims that the Watch Tower Society tries to evade its responsibility when citing human fallibility as a defense, adding that the Society represents itself as God's appointed spokesman, and that throughout its history has made many emphatic predictions. Franz adds that the organization's eagerness for the Millennium does not give it license to impugn the motives of those who fail to accept its predictions.<ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 174" />

[[George D. Chryssides]] has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses "keep changing the dates" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions. Chryssides states, "For the Jehovah's Witnesses prophecy serves more as a way of discerning a divine plan in human history than a means to predicting the future."<ref name="Georgie">[http://www.cesnur.org/2010/to-chryssides.htm George Chryssides, ''They Keep Changing the Dates'', A paper presented at the CESNUR 2010 conference in Torino.] [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/IJSNR/article/viewFile/8147/pdf How Prophecy Succeeds: The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Expectations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210034539/http://www.equinoxjournals.com/IJSNR/article/viewFile/8147/pdf |date=2010-12-10}}</ref>

*'''1917:''' In 1918, Christendom would go down as a system to oblivion and be succeeded by revolutionary governments. God would "destroy the churches wholesale and the church members by the millions". Church members would "perish by the sword of war, revolution and anarchy". The dead would lie unburied.

*'''1920:''' Messiah's kingdom would be established in 1925 and bring worldwide peace. God would begin restoring the earth.

Russell wrote in 1910 that God had the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt built as a testimony to the truth of the Bible and proof of its chronology identifying the "last days".<ref>[http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html "The Corroborative Testimony of God's Stone Witness and Prophet, The Great Pyramid in Egypt", Chapter 10, ''Thy Kingdom Come'', third volume of Studies in the Scriptures, 1910].</ref><ref>''Watchtower'', June 15, 1922, page 187, as reproduced by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 225, 226.</ref> In 1928 ''The Watch Tower'' rejected the doctrine and claimed the Pyramid had been built under the direction of Satan.<ref>''The Watch Tower''.

*''Beginning of the "last days"''. From the earliest issues of the ''Watch Tower'', Russell promoted the belief that the "last days" had begun in 1799 and would ''end'' in 1914.<ref>''Thy Kingdom Come'', 1891, page 23.</ref> As late as 1927 and 1928 Watch Tower publications were still claiming the last days had begun in 1799.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/download/WatchtowerLibrary/books/1927_cre_E.pdf|title=Creation|author=J.

*''Jews' role in God's Kingdom''. Russell followed the view of [[Nelson H. Barbour]], who believed that in 1914 Christ's kingdom would take power over all the earth and the Jews, as a people, would be restored to God's favor.<ref>M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', pages 21, 46.</ref> In 1889 Russell wrote that with the completion of the "Gentile Times" in 1914, Israel's "blindness" would subside and they would convert to Christianity.<ref>C.T. Russell, ''The Time Is At Hand'', Watch Tower Society, 1889, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 190, 204.</ref> The book ''Life'' (1929) noted that the return of Jews to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] signaled that the end was very close, because Jews would "have the favors first and thereafter all others who obey the Lord" under God's restoration of his kingdom.<ref>''Life'', Watch Tower Society, 1929, page 170, as cited by Edmond C. Gruss, ''The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation'', Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, page 87.</ref> In 1932 that belief was abandoned and from that date the Watch Tower Society taught that Witnesses alone were the Israel of God.<ref>J.

*''Identity of the "superior authorities"''. Russell taught that the "superior authorities" of Romans 13:1, to whom Christians had to show subjection and obedience, were governmental authorities. In 1929 ''The Watch Tower'' discarded this view, stating that the term referred only to God and Christ, and saying the change of doctrine was evidence of "advancing light" of truth shining forth to God's chosen people.<ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484">Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', 2007, page 484.</ref> In 1952, ''The Watchtower'' stated that the words of Romans 13 "could never have applied to the political powers of Caesar's world as wrongly claimed by the clergy of Christendom",<ref>''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1952, page 376.</ref> and in 1960 ''The Watchtower'' described the earlier view as a factor that had caused the Bible Student movement to be "unclean" in God's eyes during the 1914–1918 period. Two years later, in 1962, ''The Watchtower'' reverted to Russell's initial doctrine.<ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484"/>
*''Identity and function of the Governing Body''.

An organizational change on January 1, 1976, for the first time gave the Governing Body the power to rule on doctrines<ref>Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, pages 58–79.</ref> and become the ruling council of Jehovah's Witnesses.<ref>M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', 1997, page 216.</ref> Despite this, ''The Watchtower'' in 1971 claimed that a Governing Body of anointed Christians had existed since the 19th century to govern the affairs of God's anointed people.<ref>''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1971, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 78.</ref>
*''Treatment of disfellowshipped persons''.

===United Nations association===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and the United Nations}}
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the United Nations is one of the 'superior authorities' that exist by God's permission, and that it serves a purpose in maintaining order, but do not support it politically and do not consider it to be the means to achieve peace and security. Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that the United Nations is the "[[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|image of the wild beast]]" of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:1–18, and the second fulfilment of the "abominable thing that causes desolation" from Matthew 24:15; that it will be the means for the devastation of organized false religion worldwide;<ref>[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2001844#h=17 "No Calamity Will Befall Us" (Subheading)].

Appropriately, they are described at Revelation 17:5 as "Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth". Jeremiah described the doom of this hypocritical conglomerate.

On October 8, 2001, an article was published in the British ''Guardian'' newspaper questioning the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society's registration as a non-governmental organization ([[non-governmental organization|NGO]]) with the [[United Nations]] Department of Public Information and accusing the Watch Tower Society of hypocrisy.<ref>Bates, Stephen (Oct. 8, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,565199,00.html "Jehovah's Witnesses link to UN queried"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Within days of the article's publication, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society submitted a formal request for disassociation, removing all association with the United Nations Department of Public Information,<ref>Bates, Stephen (Oct. 15, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4277197,00.html "'Hypocrite' Jehovah's Witnesses abandon secret link with UN"], ''The Guardian''</ref> and released a letter stating that the reason for becoming associated with the United Nations Department of Information (DPI) was to access their facilities, and that they had not been aware of the change in language contained in the criteria for NGO association.<ref>[http://www.randytv.com/secret/enclosure4USE.jpg Letter to Editor - The Guardian"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303080851/http://www.randytv.com/secret/enclosure4USE.jpg |date=2007-03-03}} (Oct. 22, 2001) ''Office of Public Information''</ref> However, when the Watch Tower Society sought NGO association, "the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations", acknowledging that the purpose of membership is to "promote knowledge of the principles and activities of the United Nations".<ref>Letter from United Nations DPI/NGO Resource Centre</ref>

===Fall of Jerusalem===
Jehovah's Witnesses assert that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC and completely uninhabited for exactly seventy years. This date is critical to their selection of October 1914 for the arrival of Christ in kingly power—2520 years after October 607 BC.<ref>''Pay Attention to Daniel's Prophecy!'' chap. 6 par. 25–29</ref><ref name=gruss>Edmond C.

They also believe that the gathering of Jews in Jerusalem, shortly after their return from Babylon, officially ended the exile in Jewish month of ''[[Tishrei]]'' (Ezra 3:1). According to the Watch Tower Society, October 607 BC is derived by counting back seventy years from ''Tishrei'' of 537 BC, based on their belief that Cyrus' decree to release the Jews during his first regnal year "may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C".<ref name="WT 10/1">"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011736 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part One]" ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2011, page 26</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|title=Evidences of the Year's Correctness|date=May 1, 1952|pages=271–2|quote=It was in this first regnal year of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. (Ezra 1:1) The decree may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C. In either case this would have given sufficient time for the large party of 49,897 Jews to organize their expedition and to make their long four-month journey from Babylon to Jerusalem to get there by September 29–30, 537 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month, to build their altar to Jehovah as recorded at Ezra 3:1–3. Inasmuch as September 29–30, 537 B.C., officially ends the seventy years of desolation as recorded at 2 Chronicles 36:20, 21, so the beginning of the desolation of the land must have officially begun to be counted after September 21–22, 607 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month in 607 B.C., which is the beginning point for the counting of the 2,520 years.}}</ref> Secular sources assign the return to either 538 BC or 537 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47693/Babylonian-Exile |title=Babylonian Exile |date=February 26, 2016 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/exile2.html |title=Timeline of Judaism after the Babylonian Exile (538 BCE – 70 CE) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |access-date=2012-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Keller | first=Werner | title=The Bible As History| url=https://archive.org/details/bibleashistory00kell | url-access=limited | publisher=Bantam; 2 Revised edition | year=1983| page=[https://archive.org/details/bibleashistory00kell/page/352 352] | isbn=0-553-27943-2}}</ref><ref>''Dictionary of the Bible: Biographical, Geographical, Historical and Doctrinal'' by Charles Randall Barnes, Page 247.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Dyer | first=Charles | title=Nelson's Old Testament survey: Discovering essence, Background & Meaning about Every Old Testament book| year=2003}}</ref>

In ''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology & Christ's Return'', Carl O. Jonsson, a former Witness, presents eighteen lines of evidence to support the traditional view of neo-Babylonian chronology. He accuses the Watch Tower Society of deliberately misquoting sources in an effort to bolster their position.<ref>''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology & Christ's Return'' by Carl O. Jonsson. {{ISBN|0-914675-06-0}} Publisher: Commentary Press (July, 1998, Fourth edition 2004)</ref> The Watch Tower Society claims that biblical chronology is not always compatible with secular sources, and that the Bible is superior. It claims that secular historians make conclusions about 587 BC based on incorrect or inconsistent historical records, but accepts those sources that identify Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BC, claiming it has no evidence of being inconsistent and hence can be used as a pivotal date.<ref name="WT 10/1" /><ref>"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011810 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part Two]" ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2011, page 22</ref><ref>[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003156#h=17 ''Insight on the Scriptures''.

Since this date is an accepted one, there being no evidence to the contrary, it is usable as a pivotal date in coordinating secular history with Bible history."</ref>

[[Rolf Furuli]], a Jehovah's Witness and a lecturer in Semitic languages, presents a study of 607 BC in support of the Witnesses' conclusions in ''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews''.<ref>''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews'' (2003) {{ISBN|82-994633-3-5}}</ref> [[Lester L. Grabbe]], professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism at the University of Hull, said of Furuli's study: "Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship....

The relative positions of the moon, stars and planets indicated in the [[Babylonian astronomical diary]] ''VAT 4956'' are used by secular historians to establish 568 BC as the thirty-seventh year of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s reign.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stephenson |first1=F.

===Evolution===
The Watch Tower Society teaches a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]].<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|title=Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?|page=93}}</ref> It dismisses [[Young Earth creationism]] as "unscriptural and unbelievable",<ref>''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1986, pp. 12-13</ref> and states that Jehovah's Witnesses "are not creationists" on the basis that they do not believe the earth was created in six literal days.<ref>''Awake!'', May 8, 1997, p. 12</ref><ref>''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986, p. 30</ref>

Watch Tower Society publications attempt to refute the [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]], in favor of divine [[creationism|creation]].<ref>''Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution Or By Creation?'', Watchtower Bible & Tract Society, 1985</ref><ref>''Was Life Created?'', Watchtower Bible & Tract Society, 2010</ref> The Watch Tower Society's views of evolution have met with criticism typical of [[objections to evolution]]. [[Gary Botting]] described his own difficulty as a Jehovah's Witness to reconcile creation with simple observations of species diversification, especially after discussions with [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in India.<ref>Gary Botting, "Preface" to ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'', pp. xiv–xvi</ref>

The Society's 1985 publication, ''Life—How Did it Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?'' is criticized {{hid|by Whom- is this really encyclopedic worthy?}} for its dependency on the book ''The Neck of the Giraffe'' authored by [[Francis Hitching]], which is quoted 5 times. The book presents Hitching—a TV writer and paranormalist with no scientific credentials—as an evolutionist and scientist.<ref>Hitching is first introduced as an "evolutionist" (p. 15). A Hitching quote on page 71 is repeated on page 73, in the latter case presented as the statement of "a scientist". The 1986 Watchtower book ''The Bible—God's Word or Man's?'' likewise refers to Hitching as a scientist (p. 106).</ref> [[Richard Dawkins]] also criticizes the book for implying that "chance" is the only alternative to deliberate design, stating, "[T]he candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and [[natural selection]]."<ref>Richard Dawkins: ''The God Delusion'', p. 145. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 2006. {{ISBN|0-618-68000-4}}.</ref>

<!--Defense from Jehovah's witnesses-->
The Society has described its intolerance of dissident and divergent doctrinal views within its ranks as "strict", but claims its stance is based on the scriptural precedent of 2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17, 18 in which the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] condemns [[Christian heresy|heretics]] [[Hymenaeus (Ephesian)|Hymenaeus]] and [[Philetus (Ephesian)|Philetus]] who denied the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. It said: "Following such Scriptural patterns, if a Christian (who claims belief in God, the Bible, and Jesus) unrepentantly promotes false teachings, it may be necessary for him to be expelled from the congregation.... Hence, the true Christian congregation cannot rightly be accused of being harshly dogmatic."<ref>"Questions from readers", ''Watchtower'', April 1, 1986.</ref>

<!--Conclusion with scholars-->
Sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] says that Jehovah's Witness leaders are "not always very democratic" and members are expected to conform to "rather strict standards", but that enforcement tends to be informal, sustained by close bonds of friendship, and that Jehovah's Witnesses see themselves as "part of the power structure rather than subject to it".<ref name="Stark">{{Cite journal |author=Rodney Stark |author2=Laurence R.

===Description as a cult===

Hoekema bases his judgment on a range of what he describes as general characteristics of a cult, including the tendency to elevate peripheral teachings (such as door-to-door preaching) to great prominence, extra-scriptural source of authority (Hoekema highlights Watch Tower teachings that the Bible may be understood only as it is interpreted by the Governing Body), a view of the group as the exclusive community of the saved (Watch Tower publications teach that Witnesses alone are God's people and only they will survive [[Armageddon]]) and the group's central role in eschatology (Hoekema says Witness publications claim the group was called into existence by God to fill in a gap in the truth neglected by existing churches, marking the climax of sacred history).<ref>{{cite book | last=Hoekema | first=Anthony A. | author-link=Anthony A.

Jehovah's Witnesses state that they are not a cult<ref>"Are Jehovah's Witnesses a Cult?", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1994, pages 5–7</ref> and say that although individuals need proper guidance from God, they should do their own thinking.<ref>"Do Others Do Your Thinking?", ''Awake!'', August 22, 1978, page 4.</ref><ref>"Who Molds Your Thinking?", ''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1999, page 22, "You have free will.

In 1992, American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] placed the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination in a list of "established cults".<ref>J. Gordon Melton, 1992, ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'', p. v, 81–89</ref> However, he and others have since been more reluctant to use the term "cult" for various groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, because the term is considered too controversial.<ref>Joseba Zulaika and William Douglass, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism'', 1996, p. 103</ref> Ex-cult watchdog John Bowen Brown II<ref>{{cite journal | author=John Bowen Brown II | title=UDHR Article 30: Cult Watchdog Organizations and Jehovah's Witnesses | journal=Twenty Years and More: Research into Minority Religions, New Religious Movements and 'the New Spirituality'| publisher=Center for Studies on New Religions in association with the London School of Economics | date=2008-04-16 | url=https://www.cesnur.org/2008/london_brown.htm | access-date=2010-03-03}}</ref> and ''[[Knocking (documentary)|Knocking]]'' producer [[Joel P.

===Coercion===
Since 1920 the Watch Tower Society has required all congregation members participating in the preaching work to turn in written reports of the amount of their activity,<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', page 96, as cited by R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 4.</ref> explaining that the reports help the Society to plan its activities and identify areas of greater need<ref>Question Box, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1979, page 4.</ref> and help congregation elders to identify those who may need assistance.<ref>"Do You Contribute to an Accurate Report?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', December 2002, page 8.</ref> In 1943 the Society imposed personal quotas, requiring all active Witnesses to spend at least 60 hours of door-to-door preaching per month, claiming these were "directions from the Lord".<ref>"Righteous requirements", ''Watchtower'', July 1, 1943, pages 204–206, "Jehovah ... has appointed his 'faithful and wise servant, who is his visible mouthpiece.... These expressions of God's will by his King and through his established agency constitute his law or rule of action.... The Lord breaks down our organization instructions further.... He says the requirements for special pioneers shall be 175 hours and 50 back-calls per month ... and for regular pioneers 150 hours.... And for company publishers, he says, 'Let us make a quota of 60 hours and 12 back-calls and at least one study a week for each publisher'. These directions come to us from the Lord through his established agency directing what is required of us.... This expression of the Lord's will should be the end of all controversy.... The Lord through his 'faithful and wise servant' now states to us, ''Let us cover our territory four times in six months''. That becomes our organization instructions and has the same binding force on us that his statement to the Logos had when he said, 'Let us make man in our image'. It is our duty to accept this additional instruction and obey it."</ref> Although these quotas were subsequently removed, Raymond Franz claims "invisible" quotas remained, obliging Witnesses to meet certain levels of preaching work to remain in good standing in the congregation<ref name=Franz16>R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 16.</ref> or to qualify for eldership.<ref name=Franz6 /> Franz describes repeated urging for adherents to "put kingdom interests first" and devote increasing amounts of time to door-to-door preaching efforts as coercive pressure. He says many Witnesses constantly feel guilty that they are not doing more in "field activity".<ref name=Franz6>R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 6.</ref>

Former Witnesses Heather and Gary Botting, claiming an emphasis on a personal track record would mean that salvation is effectively being "bought" with "good works", observed: "No matter how long a Witness remains an active distributor of literature, the moment he ceases to be active he is regarded by his peers as good as dead in terms of achieving the ultimate goal of life everlasting in an earthly paradise.... Few realize upon entering the movement that the purchase price is open-ended and that the bill can never be paid in full until death or the advent of Armageddon."<ref name=orwell />

''The Watchtower'', however, noted that although public preaching is necessary, such works do not "save" a Christian and it urged Witnesses to examine their motive for engaging in preaching activity.<ref>"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005404 Saved, Not by Works Alone, But by Undeserved Kindness]", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 2005, pages 17–18.</ref>

According to Andrew Holden, "those who fail to devote a satisfactory amount of time to doorstep evangelism soon lose the respect of their co-religionists. The Witnesses are thus forced to think quantitatively about their salvation."{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=72}}

In a case involving a review of a Russian district court decision, the European Court of Human Rights found nothing in the judgements to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." The court said: "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others." The court also stated that, "even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=869647&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref>

The Watch Tower Society has attracted criticism for disfellowshipping members who decide they cannot conscientiously agree with all the denomination's teachings and practices. Sociologist Andrew Holden says that because the group provides no valid reason for leaving, those who do choose to leave are regarded as traitors.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=150}} According to Raymond Franz, those who decide they cannot accept Watch Tower teachings and practices often live in a climate of fear, feeling they must constantly be on guard about what they say, do and read. He says those who do express any disagreement, even in a private conversation with friends, risk investigation and trial by a judicial committee as apostates or heretics<ref>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| page=384| isbn=978-0-914675-17-4}}</ref> and classed as "wicked".<ref>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| page=351| isbn=978-0-914675-17-4}}</ref>

Franz argues that the threat of expulsion for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence.<ref>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| page=359| isbn=978-0-914675-17-4}}</ref> The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=151}} Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism<!--does source say "ultimate control mechanism"?--><!--yes--> among the Witnesses;<ref name="Penton249">{{cite book |author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=249}}</ref> Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=163}} Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.<ref>Ronald Lawson, "Sect-State Relations: Accounting for the Differing Trajectories of Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Sociology of Religion'', 1995, 56:4, pg 371.</ref>

Watch Tower Society publications defend the practice of expelling and shunning those who "promote false teaching", claiming such individuals must be quarantined to prevent the spread of their "spiritual infection".<ref>"Maintain Your Faith and Spiritual Health", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1989.</ref> They have cited a dictionary definition of apostasy ("renunciation of a religious faith, abandonment of a previous loyalty") to rule that an individual who begins affiliating with another religious organization has disassociated from the Witnesses, warranting their shunning to protect the spiritual cleanness of the Witness congregation on the basis of the reference in 1 John 2:19 that those who leave Christianity are "not of our sort".<ref>"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1986, page 31.</ref> An individual's acceptance of a blood transfusion is similarly deemed as evidence of disassociation.<ref>Osamu Muramoto, "Bioethical aspects of the recent changes in the policy of refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses", ''British Medical Journal'', January 6, 2001, page 37.</ref> They say Witnesses also obey the "strong counsel" at 1 Corinthians 5:11 that Christians should "quit mixing in company" with people who unrepentantly reject certain scriptural standards.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Ridley | first1=Donald T. | year=1999 | title=Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal of blood: Obedience to scripture and religious conscience | journal=Journal of Medical Ethics | volume=25 | issue=6| pages=469–72 | doi=10.1136/jme.25.6.469| pmid=10635500 | pmc=479295}}</ref>

The Witnesses' judicial process has also been criticized. Hearings take place in secret,<ref name="Penton249" /> with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor.<ref name="Penton, M. J. 1997 89"/> According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but are not permitted to remain for the discussion.<ref name="Franz38">{{cite book |author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/crisisofconscien00raym/page/38 38]|isbn=0-914675-23-0|url=https://archive.org/details/crisisofconscien00raym/page/38}}</ref> Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.<ref name="Botting91">{{cite book | last=Botting| first=Heather | author2=Gary Botting| title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher=University of Toronto Press| year=1984| page=91|isbn=0-8020-6545-7}}</ref>

When a decision is made regarding disfellowshipping or disassociation, an announcement is made that the person is "no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses", at which point shunning is immediate. Members are not told whether the person has disassociated or has been disfellowshipped. Neither testimony nor evidence in support of the judicial decision are provided. Congregation members are told to accept the rulings without question and Witnesses who refuse to abide by a judicial committee decision will themselves suffer expulsion.<ref name="Penton249" /> Members are forbidden to talk with the expelled member, removing any opportunity for the person to discuss or explain their actions.<ref name="Franz38" /><ref>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| page=371| isbn=978-0-914675-17-4}}</ref> Penton claims judicial committee members and the Watch Tower Society frequently ignore established procedures when dealing with troublesome individuals, conspiring to have them expelled in violation of Society rules.<ref>{{cite book |author=Penton, M.

Criticism has also been directed at the 1981 change of policy<ref>"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 23.</ref> that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were to be treated as though they were disfellowshipped.<ref>{{cite book |author=Penton, M.

===Blood===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}
Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions of whole allogenic blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as [[Leviticus]] 17:10–14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion.<ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life">{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=22}}</ref> Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.<ref name="Muramoto"/>

====Fractions and components====
In the case of [[Blood plasma fractionation|minor fractions derived from blood]], each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable.<ref>"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004445 Be guided by the Living God]" (Jun. 15, 2004). ''The Watchtower''</ref><ref>"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000447 Questions from readers: Do Jehovah's Witnesses accept any minor fractions of blood?]" (Jun. 15, 2000). ''The Watchtower''</ref> Consequently, some Jehovah's Witnesses accept the use of blood fractions and others do not. However, fractions that carry out "the key function of a primary component" or make up "a significant portion of that component" are not permitted.<ref>[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006283#h=13 ''Awake!'' August 2006 box on P. 11]</ref>

Such a stance of dividing blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components to be poured out onto the ground has led to criticism from organizations such as the ''Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajwrb.org/|title=AJWRB.org|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid ''per se'' is not the real issue. They say the real issue is ''respect'' and ''obedience'' regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property.<ref>''The Watchtower'' November 1, 1961, p. 669 Questions From Readers</ref><ref>[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005143#h=16 ''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'' 2005 P.128]</ref> Members are allowed to eat [[meat]] that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the ''respect'' has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |title=OK Kosher Certification — Salting of Meat |publisher=Ok.org |access-date=2012-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |title=Making Meat Kosher: Between Slaughtering and Cooking |publisher=My Jewish Learning |access-date=2012-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225165156/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |archive-date=2009-02-25 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to lawyer Kerry Louderback-Wood, a former Jehovah's Witness,<ref>[http://marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm "Religion Today", ''New York Times'', January 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427200056/http://www.marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm |date=April 27, 2010}}</ref> the Watch Tower Society misrepresents the scope of allowed fractions. If taken together, they "total the entire volume of blood they came from".<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005 p. 815</ref> An example of this can be seen in blood plasma, which consists of 90–96% water. The remaining amount consists mainly of albumin, globulins, fibrinogen and coagulation factors. These four fractions are allowable for use, but only if taken separately. Raymond Franz has likened this to banning the eating of a ham and cheese sandwich but allowing the eating of bread, ham and cheese separately.<ref>Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07}}. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-914675-16-8}}. p.732.</ref>

====Storing and donation====
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that storing blood violates direction from the Bible to 'pour blood out onto the ground'. They do not donate blood except for uses they have individually pre-approved.<ref>"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000767 Questions From Readers]", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2000, page 31, "Jehovah's Witnesses ... do not donate blood [without preconditions on its use], nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be 'poured out'. That practice conflicts with God's law. Other procedures or tests involving an individual's own blood are not so clearly in conflict with God's stated principles.... The goal may be to isolate some of a blood component and apply that elsewhere.... A Christian must decide for himself how his own blood will be handled.... Ahead of time, he should obtain from the doctor or technician the facts about what might be done with his blood during the procedure. Then he must decide according to what his conscience permits."</ref> However, they are told that acceptance of blood fractions from donated blood is a matter of conscience. A 2006 issue of Jehovah's Witnesses' newsletter ''Our Kingdom Ministry'' stated, "Although [Jehovah's Witnesses] do not donate or store their own blood ''for transfusion purposes'', some procedures or tests involving an individual's blood are not so clearly in conflict with Bible principles. Therefore, each individual should make a conscientious decision" [emphasis added].<ref>"How Do I View Blood Fractions and Medical Procedures Involving My Own Blood?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2006, page 4.</ref> Raymond Franz has challenged these policies because acceptable blood fractions can only be derived from stored blood provided by donors.<ref>Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07}}. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 1991. Pbk. {{ISBN|0-914675-16-8}}. pp.732.</ref>

====Legal considerations====
Regardless of the medical considerations, Jehovah Witnesses advocate that physicians should uphold the right of a patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion).<ref>[http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 Ivanhoe's Medical Breakthroughs - When Religion and Medicine Collide<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125211155/http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 |date=2005-11-25}}</ref> Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out of his or her own requests.<ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life"/> However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a [[Jehovah's Witnesses and governments#Other cases|case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France]].

The situation has been controversial, particularly in the case of children. In the [[United States]], many physicians will agree to explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians. Some state laws require physicians to administer blood-based treatment to minors if it is their professional opinion that it is necessary to prevent immediate death or severe permanent damage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Even when an adult's life is at stake, some philosophers argue that since blood refusal is based on irrational beliefs, the patient's decision may be challenged.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=1377366 | pmid=9358347 | volume=23 | issue=5 | title=Should informed consent be based on rational beliefs? | journal=Journal of Medical Ethics | pages=282–8 | last1=Savulescu | first1=J | last2=Momeyer | first2=RW | doi=10.1136/jme.23.5.282|quote=we believe that JWs' beliefs are irrational even in terms that should be acceptable to JWs. Firstly, their interpretation is inconsistent with other passages of The Bible and Christian practices. It is inconsistent with the Christian practice of communion..... Secondly, Paul warns against slavish obedience to law.... Paul himself does not understand The Bible to be literally true, as evidenced when he speaks of the story of the origin of Abraham's sons being "an allegory".... What is required is rational argument. | year=1997}}</ref>

Kerry Louderback-Wood has claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses' legal corporations are potentially liable to significant claims for compensation if the organization misrepresents the medical risks of blood transfusions. Wood claims that constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not remove the legal responsibility that every person or organization has regarding misrepresenting secular fact.<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005</ref>

====Animal blood====
''The Watchtower'' has stated that "Various medical products have been obtained from biological sources, either animal or human.... Such commercialization of ... blood is hardly tempting for true Christians, who guide their thinking by God's perfect law. Our Creator views blood as sacred, representing God-given life ... blood removed from a creature was to be poured out on the ground, disposed of."<ref>''The Watchtower''. February 1, 1997, p. 30.</ref>

The answer is yes ... we, as the case files will show, have disfellowshipped people for being in an inappropriate setting where there is some allegation.}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/file-list/Case%20Study%2029%20-%20Transcript%20-%20Jehovahs%20Witnesses%20-%20Day%20155%20-%2014082015.pdf|title=Public Hearing - Case Study 29 (Day 155)|page=44,45|website=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, Australia}}</ref>

==Biblical criticisms==
{{See also|New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures#Critical review}}
The [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] has been criticized for its refusal to reveal the names and academic credentials of the translators of its ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' (NWT).<ref name="pentonbible">{{cite book |author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|pages=174–176}}</ref> The Society has claimed members of the NWT's translation committee wished to remain anonymous in order to exalt only the name of God,<ref>"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1950, page 320.</ref> ''The Watchtower'' stating that the educational qualifications of the translators were unimportant and that "the translation itself testifies to their qualifications".<ref>Questions from readers, ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1974, page 767.</ref> [[Raymond Franz]], a former member of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]], has claimed that of the four men he says constituted the committee, only one—its principal translator, his uncle [[Frederick William Franz|Frederick Franz]]—had sufficient knowledge of biblical languages to have attempted the project.<ref>In a 1954 court case, Franz was invited to translate a passage of Genesis from English to Hebrew. (Translator's proof, page 102-103). He declined, saying he would not attempt it. Heather and Gary Botting wrongly claim (page 98) he could make no sense of "an elementary passage of Hebrew from Genesis".</ref> Frederick Franz had studied Greek for two years and was self-taught in Hebrew.<ref name=fred56>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=Crisis of Conscience| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| page=[https://archive.org/details/crisisofconscien00raym/page/56 56]| isbn=978-0-914675-23-5| url=https://archive.org/details/crisisofconscien00raym/page/56}}</ref>

Much criticism of the NWT involves the rendering of certain texts considered to be biased towards specific Witness practices and doctrines.<ref name="pentonbible" /><ref>Robert M.

Also criticized is the NWT's insertion of the name ''[[Jehovah]]'' 237 times in the [[New Testament]] without extant New Testament Greek manuscript evidence that the name existed there.<ref>{{cite book | last=Franz| first=Raymond| author-link=Raymond Franz| title=In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher=Commentary Press| year=2007| pages=494–505| isbn=978-0-914675-17-4}}</ref><ref>G.

The Society has claimed its translation "courageously restores God's name, Jehovah, to its proper place in the Biblical text, is free from the bias of religious traditionalism, and ... gives the literal meaning of God's Word as accurately as possible."<ref>"Your Bible—How It Was Produced", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1981, page 15</ref> [[Jason BeDuhn]], associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University, in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], compared major translations for accuracy. He stated that whilst there are "a handful of examples of bias in the [New World Translation (NW)]", that "most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers." He also wrote that the NWT's introduction of the name "Jehovah" into the New Testament 237 times was "not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy".<ref>Jason D. BeDuhn, ''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'', 2004, pages 165, 169, 175, 176. BeDuhn compared the ''King James'', the ''(New) Revised Standard'', the ''New International'', the ''New American Bible'', the ''New American Standard Bible'', the ''Amplified Bible'', the ''Living Bible'', ''Today's English'' and the ''NWT'' versions in Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:6, Colossians 1:15-20, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58, John 1:1.</ref> He concluded that "the NW and [another translation] are not bias free, and they are not perfect translations. But they are remarkably good translations ... often better than [the other six translations analyzed]."<ref>''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'' by Jason BeDuhn, 2004, pages 165, University Press of America, {{ISBN|0-7618-2556-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-2556-2}}</ref> In his rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticizes BeDuhn's positive review of the ''New World Translation'', stating that the main goal of BeDuhn's book is to deny the deity of Christ.<ref>Thomas A Howe, ''Bias in New Testament Translations?'', 2010, p. 326 (back cover), "In this critical evaluation, BeDuhn's arguments are challenged and his conclusions called into question." - See also Thomas A.
