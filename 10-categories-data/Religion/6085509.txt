==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&q=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&pg=PT31|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&pg=PA12|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/darkfibertrackin0000lovi/page/334 334]|url=https://archive.org/details/darkfibertrackin0000lovi|url-access=registration|quote=religion.|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}</ref>

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018|title=The Greater Poop #30, July/August 1970, Page 00001. &#124; Historia Discordia}}</ref>

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=2005-11-09}}</ref> The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics & Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.<ref>{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823/page/59 59] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565925823/page/59 }}</ref> The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504222939/http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|archive-date=4 May 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, public access and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.<ref  name="jacobs">{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=2012-06-12}}</ref>

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref> Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 |date=2002-08-09 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}</ref> Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref>

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}</ref> For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."<ref>{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}</ref> The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}</ref> and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.<ref name="jacobs"/>

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."<ref>{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref> In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.<ref>Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)</ref>

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref>

==Open-source in establishing new religions==

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".<ref>{{cite book|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref> The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.
