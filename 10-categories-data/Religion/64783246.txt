{{Main|Canonical hours}}
From the time of the [[early Church]], the practice of seven fixed prayer times have been taught. In ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] instructed Christians to pray seven times a day, "on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight" and "the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion."<ref name="DanielouOrigen2016"/><ref name="Chadwick1993">{{cite book |author1=[[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] |title=The Early Church |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-1-101-16042-8 |language=English|quote=Hippolytus in the ''Apostolic Tradition'' directed that Christians should pray seven times a day - on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight, and also, if at home, at the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion. Prayers at the third, sixth, and ninth hours are similarly mentioned by Tertullian, Cyprian, Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and must have been very widely practised. These prayers were commonly associated with private Bible reading in the family.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Weitzman |first1=M. P. |title=The Syriac Version of the Old Testament |date=7 July 2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-01746-6 |language=English |quote=Clement of Alexandria noted that "some fix hours for prayer, such as the third, sixth and ninth" (Stromata 7:7). Tertullian commends these hours, because of their importance (see below) in the New Testament and because their number recalls the Trinity (De Oratione 25). These hours indeed appear as designated for prayer from the earliest days of the church. Peter prayed at the sixth hour, i.e. at noon (Acts 10:9). The ninth hour is called the "hour of prayer" (Acts 3:1). This was the hour when Cornelius prayed even as a "God-fearer" attached to the Jewish community, i.e. before his conversion to Christianity. it was also the hour of Jesus' final prayer (Matt. 27:46, Mark 15:34, Luke 22:44-46).}}</ref><ref name="Lössl2010">{{cite book |last1=Lössl |first1=Josef |title=The Early Church: History and Memory |date=17 February 2010 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=978-0-567-16561-9 |page=135 |language=English|quote=Not only the content of early Christian prayer was rooted in Jewish tradition; its daily structure too initially followed a Jewish pattern, with prayer times in the early morning, at noon and in the evening. Later (in the course of the second century), this pattern combined with another one; namely prayer times in the evening, at midnight and in the morning. As a result seven 'hours of prayer' emerged, which later became the monastic 'hours' and are still treated as 'standard' prayer times in many churches today. They are roughly equivalent to midnight, 6 a.m., 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Prayer positions included prostration, kneeling and standing. ... Crosses made of wood or stone, or painted on walls or laid out as mosaics, were also in use, at first not directly as objections of veneration but in order to 'orientate' the direction of prayer (i.e. towards the east, Latin ''oriens'').}}</ref> Christians attended the [[Christian liturgy|liturgy]] on the [[Lord's Day]], worshipping communally in both the morning and evening. They prayed privately throughout the rest of the week, with the exception of [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastics]] who gathered for prayer corporately.<ref name="Beckwith2005">{{cite book |last1=Beckwith |first1=Roger T. |title=Calendar, Chronology And Worship: Studies in Ancient Judaism And Early Christianity |date=2005 |publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]] |isbn=978-90-04-14603-7 |page=193 |language=English}}</ref> This practice of seven fixed prayer times was done in the bodily positions of [[prostration]] and standing, which continues today in some Christian denominations, especially those of Oriental Christianity.<ref name="Lössl2010"/>

[[Oriental Orthodox Christian]]s (such as [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Copts]] and [[Indian Orthodox Church|Indians]]), as well as members of the [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church]] (an [[Oriental Protestant Christianity|Oriental Protestant]] denomination), use a [[breviary]] such as the [[Agpeya]] and [[Shehimo]] to [[Christian prayer|pray]] the [[canonical hours]] seven times a day while facing in the [[ad orientem|eastward direction]], in anticipation of the [[Second Coming of Jesus]]; this Christian practice has its roots in {{Bibleverse|Psalm|118:164|KJV}}, in which the prophet [[David]] prays to God seven times a day.<ref name="Amherst1906"/><ref name="Richards1908">{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=William Joseph |title=The Indian Christians of St. Thomas: Otherwise Called the Syrian Christians of Malabar: a Sketch of Their History and an Account of Their Present Condition as Well as a Discussion of the Legend of St. Thomas |date=1908 |publisher=Bemrose |page=98 |language=English |quote=We are commanded to pray standing, with faces towards the East, for at the last Messiah is manifested in the East. 2.

There before the image of the cross, they used to pray seven times a day ... with their faces turned to the east." It is easy to see the importance of this passage when you compare it with what Origen says. The custom of turning towards the rising sun when praying had been replaced by the habit of turning towards the east wall. This we find in Origen. From the other passage we see that a cross had been painted on the wall to show which was the east. Hence the origin of the practice of hanging crucifixes on the walls of the private rooms in Christian houses. We know too that signs were put up in the Jewish synagogues to show the direction of Jerusalem, because the Jews turned that way when they said their prayers. The question of the proper way to face for prayer has always been of great importance in the East. It is worth remembering that Mohammedans pray with their faces turned towards Mecca and that one reason for the condemnation of Al Hallaj, the Mohammedan martyr, was that he refused to conform to this practice.}}</ref><ref name="Johnson2016">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Maxwell E. |title=Between Memory and Hope: Readings on the Liturgical Year |date=2016 |publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-6282-3 |language=English |quote=Because Christ was expected to come from the east, Christians at a very early date prayed facing that direction in order to show themselves ready for his appearing, and actually looking forward to the great event which would consummate the union with him already experienced in prayer. For the same reason the sign of the cross was frequently traced on the eastern wall of places of prayer, thereby indiciating the direction of prayer, but also rendering the Lord's coming a present reality in the sign which heralds it. In other words, through the cross the anticipated eschatological appearance becomes ''parousia'': presence. The joining of prayer with the eschatological presence of Christ, unseen to the eye but revealed in the cross, obviously underlies the widely attested practice of prostrating before the sacred wood while praying to him who hung upon it.}}</ref> Before praying, Oriental Orthodox Christians and Oriental Protestant Christians [[Hygiene_in_Christianity#Washing_before_Christian_prayer_and_worship|wash their hands, face and feet]] in order to be clean before and present their best to God; [[Tradition of removing shoes in the home and houses of worship|shoes are removed]] in order to acknowledge that one is offering prayer before a holy God.<ref name="Smith1909">{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Bertha H. |title=The Bath as a Religious Rite among Mohammedans |journal=Modern Sanitation |date=1909 |volume=7 |issue=1 |publisher=Standard Sanitary Mfg.
