'''Antitheism''', sometimes spelled '''anti-theism''', is the opposition to [[theism]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismatheiststheism/a/AntiTheism.htm |title=Atheism and Anti-Theism: What's the Difference? What is Anti-Theism? |author=Austin Cline |publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/antitheism |title=antitheism |publisher=[[The Free Dictionary]]}}</ref> The term has had a range of applications. In [[secularism|secular]] contexts, it typically refers to direct opposition to the belief in any [[deity]].

==Etymology==
The word ''antitheism'' (or hyphenated ''anti-theism'') has been recorded in English since 1788.<ref>{{cite web|title=antitheism|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=antitheism&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> The [[etymology|etymological]] roots of the word are the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wikt:ἀντί|anti]]'' and ''[[wikt:θεός#Ancient Greek|theos]].''

==Opposition to theism==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''antitheist'' as "One opposed to belief in the existence of a god". The earliest citation given for this meaning dates from 1833.<ref>The Shorter OED (1970 reprint) page 78</ref> ''Antitheism'' has been adopted as a label by those who regard theism as dangerous, destructive, or encouraging of harmful behavior. [[Christopher Hitchens]] offers an example of this approach in ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'' (2001), in which he writes: "I'm not even an [[Atheism|atheist]] so much as I am an antitheist; I not only maintain that all religions are versions of the same untruth, but I hold that the influence of churches, and the effect of religious belief, is positively harmful."<ref>

==Opposition to the idea of God==
Other definitions of antitheism include that of the French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] (1953), for whom it is "an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God" (p.&nbsp;104), and that of [[Robert Flint]] (1877), Professor of Divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Flint's [[The Baird Lecture|Baird Lecture]] for 1877 was entitled ''Anti-Theistic Theories''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Flint| first=Robert| title=Anti-Theistic Theories: Being the [[Baird Lecture]] for 1877| edition=5| year=1894| location=London| publisher=William Blackwood and Sons}}</ref> He used it as a very general [[umbrella term]] for all opposition to his own form of theism, which he defined as the "belief that the heavens and the earth and all that they contain owe their existence and continuance to the wisdom and will of a supreme, self-existent, omnipotent, omniscient, righteous, and benevolent Being, who is distinct from, and independent of, what He has created."<ref>Flint, p. 1</ref> He wrote:

<blockquote>In dealing with theories which have nothing in common except that they are antagonistic to theism, it is necessary to have a general term to designate them. Anti-theism appears to be the appropriate word. It is, of course, much more comprehensive in meaning than the term atheism. It applies to all systems which are opposed to theism. It includes, therefore, atheism, but short of atheism, there are anti-theistic theories. Polytheism is not atheism, for it does not deny that there is a deity; but it is anti-theistic since it denies that there is only one. Pantheism is not atheism, for it asserts that there is a god; but it is anti-theism, for it denies that God is a being distinct from creation and possessed of such attributes as wisdom, and holiness, and love. Every theory which refuses to ascribe to a god an attribute which is essential to a worthy conception of its character is anti-theistic. Only those theories which refuse to acknowledge that there is evidence even for the existence of a god are atheistic.<ref>Flint, p. 23</ref></blockquote>

However, Flint also acknowledges that antitheism is typically understood differently from how he defines it. In particular, he notes that it has been used as a subdivision of atheism, descriptive of the view that theism has been disproven, rather than as the more general term that Flint prefers. He rejects ''[[nontheism|non-theistic]]'' as an alternative, "not merely because of its hybrid origin and character, but also because it is far too comprehensive. The theories of physical and mental science are non-theistic, even when in no degree, directly or indirectly, antagonistic to theism."<ref>Flint, p. 444–445</ref>

Opposition to the existence of a god or gods is frequently referred to as [[dystheism]], which would actually mean "belief in a deity that is not benevolent", or [[misotheism]] – strictly speaking, this means "hatred of God". Examples of belief systems founded on the principle of opposition to the existence of a god or gods include some forms of [[Atheistic Satanism]] and [[Misotheism#maltheism|maltheism]].

==Other uses==
{{see also|Misotheism#Terminology}}Another use of the term ''antitheism'' was coined by [[Christopher New]] in a thought experiment published in 1993. In his article, he imagines what arguments for the existence of an evil god would look like: "Antitheists, like theists, would have believed in an omnipotent, omniscient, eternal creator; but whereas theists in fact believe that the supreme being is also perfectly good, antitheists would have believed that he was perfectly evil."<ref>{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism – A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36–43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}. See also: Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177–181.</ref> New's usage has reappeared in the work of Wallace A. Murphree.<ref>Murphree, Wallace A. (1997). "[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02786044 Natural Theology: theism or antitheism]", ''Sophia'', Vol.36 (1), March, pp.75–83</ref>
