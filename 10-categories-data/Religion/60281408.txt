== Legend ==
[[File:Temblai Ganpati.jpg|alt=Ganesha statue at the Temblai hill temple complex|thumb|Ganesha statue at the Temblai hill temple complex]]
Local legends say that Goddess Renuka is the sister of Mahalaxmi and she actively supported Mahalaxmi in her endeavours to slay the demons in the region. However after the wars Mahalaxmi did not accord her due respect to Goddess Renuka and she came down to the hill and sat there with her back towards Mahalaxmi. This is the reason why the idol of Mahalaxmi at her temple faces the west and that of the Goddess Renuka at Temblai faces the east. Every year during Navratri there is a procession that celebrates the reconciliation of the two sisters on the fifth day of Lalitpanchami.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/traveller/ot-getaway-guides/kolhapur-modern-temple-town/|title=Kolhapur: Modern Temple Town|website=Outlook Traveller|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/traveller/ot-getaway-guides/kolhapur-modern-temple-town/|title=Kolhapur: Modern Temple Town|website=Outlook Traveller|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref>

As of 2013, over 1 million devotees visited the temple during Navratri festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Temblai-temple-abuzz-on-fifth-day-of-Navaratra/articleshow/23836752.cms|title=Temblai temple abuzz on fifth day of Navaratra - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> Local dialects use a common salutation to the Goddess ''Tembali chya navane chang bhala,'' this has extensively been used in ''sholkas'' and ''bhajans'' that devotees sing and play during the annual pilgrimage and other times at their homes.<ref>''Song dedicated to Goddess Temblai''[https://ormp3.org/fabcde/temblai-chya-navan-changbhal.html]</ref> During the festival special arrangements are made by the administration to manage traffic and diversions for the convenience of the devotees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/Police-to-divert-traffic-for-yatra-to-Tremboli-Traffic-diversion-for-Tremboli-yatra/articleshow/54670018.cms|title=tremboli: Police to divert traffic for yatra to Tremboli Traffic diversion for Tremboli yatra {{!}} Kolhapur News - Times of India|last=Oct 4|first=TNN {{!}} Updated|last2=2016|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-08-30|last3=Ist|first3=10:39}}</ref> The royal family of Shahu II had special regard for the Temblai fair as people had a special importance for his presence during the event.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.63251|title=Shri Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaja Of Kolhapur Vol I|last=Latthe A.b|date=1924}}</ref>

Another legend from the ''Karvir Puran'' states that Temblai, the younger sister of Mahalaxmi, left the city of Kolhapur 1800 years ago and came over to the hillock three miles from the city and remained there with her back to her elder sister at [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Mahalaxmi temple]]. Every year in the month of ''Ashvin'', on the fifth day of the bright moon, the elder sister Mahalaxmi visits her younger sister at Temblai. The festival is now celebrated as traditional event where a procession is carried out with Mahalaxmi placed in a palkhi and followed by a young unmarried girl cutting a pumpkin to commemorate the killing of the demon ''Kolhasur'' by Mahalaxmi [[Ambabai]]. Temblai hill hosts a fair in the temple complex that has 15000-20000 pilgrims. There are offerings and distribution of sweets to the Goddess. The fair has food and toy stalls along with fun rides attractions for children.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=asAMAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA311&dq=temblai#v=onepage&q=temblai&f=false|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|last=State)|first=Bombay (India|date=1886|publisher=Government Central Press|language=en}}</ref>

The royal family of the Maratha empire had also been actively participating in the temple celebrations. On one instance, the queens of the royal family of Kolhapur had invited [[Shahu II of Kolhapur|Shahu II]] to perform a ceremony at the Temblai festival after his marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zOMdAAAAMAAJ&dq=temblai+shahu&q=temblai|title=Shahu Chhatrapati: A Royal Revolutionary|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1976|publisher=Popular Prakashan|language=en}}</ref>
