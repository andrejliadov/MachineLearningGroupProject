== Religious cognition ==
Research in [[evolutionary psychology]] suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history.<ref name=":norenbuss" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=H. Clark|last2=Kurzban|first2=Robert|title=Modularity in Cognition: Framing the Debate|journal=Psychological Review|date=2006|volume=113|issue=3|pages=628–647|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.113.3.628|pmid=16802884}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fodor|first1=Jerry A.|title=The modularity of mind: an essay on faculty psychology|date=1984|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.

These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include [[theory of mind]], [[Essentialism|essential psychology]] and the [[hyperactive agency detection device]].<ref name=":norenbuss" /> Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.<ref name="atranhenrich">{{cite journal|last1=Atran|first1=Scott|last2=Henrich|first2=Joseph|title=The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions|journal=Biological Theory|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1162/BIOT_a_00018|citeseerx=10.1.1.612.2435}}</ref>

=== Theory of mind ===
Theory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Premack|first1=David|last2=Woodruff|first2=Guy|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=4 February 2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=515|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512|doi-access=free}}</ref> This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barclay|first1=Pat|editor1-last=Buss|editor1-first=David|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|date=2016|edition=2nd|chapter=Reputation}}</ref> Cases of [[autism]] have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baron-Cohen|first1=Simon|title=Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass [u.a.]|isbn=978-0262522250|edition=1. pbk.}}</ref> ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of [[mind-body dualism]], where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a "soul").<ref name="boyer" /><ref name="pursosis">{{cite book|last1=Purzycki & Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}</ref>

=== Essentialism ===
[[Folk psychology]] among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of "essences." This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a [[fuzzy set]] of the object's [[Ontology|ontological]] features.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Miller|first2=Dale T.|title=Psychological Essentialism of Human Categories|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00504.x}}</ref> Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.<ref name="pursosis" />

=== Hyperactive agency detection device ===
The capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation.<ref name="boyer">{{cite book|last1=Boyer|first1=Pascal|title=Religion explained : the evolutionary origins of religious thought|url=https://archive.org/details/religionexplaine00boye|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0465006960}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=K.|last2=Wegner|first2=D.

=== Minimally counterintuitive beliefs ===
The integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the [[intentional stance]]. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=The intentional stance|date=1989|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262540537|edition=1st MIT Press paperback|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intentionalstanc00dani}}</ref>

Religious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless.<ref name="atranhenrich" /> For example, the concept of a [[ghost]] exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]]. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mesoudi|first1=Alex|title=Cultural Evolution. ; How Darwinian Theory Can Explain Human Culture and Synthesize the Social Sciences.|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226520445}}</ref>

Religious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept.<ref name=":1" /> Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|last3=Richerson|first3=Peter J.|title=Five Misunderstandings About Cultural Evolution|journal=Human Nature|date=19 April 2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–137|doi=10.1007/s12110-008-9037-1|pmid=26181460|citeseerx=10.1.1.226.8677}}</ref> However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated.<ref name="purzinpress">{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S88–S104|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}</ref> This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.<ref name="boyer" /><ref name="purz12">{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin G.|last2=Finkel|first2=Daniel N.|last3=Shaver|first3=John|last4=Wales|first4=Nathan|last5=Cohen|first5=Adam B.|last6=Sosis|first6=Richard|title=What Does God Know?

== Ecology of god concepts ==
Cross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods.<ref name="norenbiggods">{{cite book|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|title=Big gods : how religion transformed cooperation and conflict|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0691151212}}</ref> Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge.<ref name="pursosis" /> The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment.<ref name=":1" /> While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges.<ref name="botero" /> This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.<ref name="purzinpress" /><ref name="norenbiggods" />

=== Large-scale cooperation ===
Cases of large-scale [[cooperation]] in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included [[kin selection]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=W.D.|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour.

This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of [[punishment]] to defectors.<ref name="mathew">{{cite journal|last1=Mathew|first1=S.|last2=Boyd|first2=R.|title=Punishment sustains large-scale cooperation in prestate warfare|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=13 June 2011|volume=108|issue=28|pages=11375–11380|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105604108|pmid=21670285|pmc=3136302}}</ref> For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural [[Coordination game|coordination solution]] stabilized by sanction threats must exist.<ref name="purz12" />

Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schloss|first1=Jeffrey P.|last2=Murray|first2=Michael J.|title=Evolutionary accounts of belief in supernatural punishment: a critical review|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=46–99|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2011.558707}}</ref>

This has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity.<ref name="norenetalpress" /> Examples of sharing behaviors in [[Experimental economics|experimental economic games]] played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Xygalatas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Klocová|first2=Eva Kundtová|last3=Cigán|first3=Jakub|last4=Kundt|first4=Radek|last5=Maňo|first5=Peter|last6=Kotherová|first6=Silvie|last7=Mitkidis|first7=Panagiotis|last8=Wallot|first8=Sebastian|last9=Kanovsky|first9=Martin|title=Location, Location, Location: Effects of Cross-Religious Primes on Prosocial Behavior|journal=The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|date=9 November 2015|pages=304–319|doi=10.1080/10508619.2015.1097287|volume=26|issue=4|url=https://pure.au.dk/ws/files/104543951/Location_Location_Location_Effects_of_Cross_Religious_Primes_on_Prosocial_Behavior.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shariff|first1=A.

=== Costly signaling ===
Concerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; [[rational agent]]s who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sosis|first1=Richard|last2=Bressler|first2=Eric R.|title=Cooperation and Commune Longevity: A Test of the Costly Signaling Theory of Religion|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=1 May 2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=211–239|doi=10.1177/1069397103037002003|citeseerx=10.1.1.500.5715}}</ref> Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Ronald|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|title=Extreme Rituals as Social Technologies|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|date=6 November 2014|volume=14|issue=5|pages=345–355|doi=10.1163/15685373-12342130|url=https://pure.au.dk/ws/files/83299043/15685373_014_05_s002_text.pdf}}</ref> Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations,<ref name="purz11">{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Tyvan and the socioecological constraints of supernatural agents' minds|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|date=February 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–45|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2010.550723}}</ref> and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns.<ref name="purzinpress" /> More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bulbulia|first1=Joseph|last2=Sosis|first2=Richard|title=Signalling theory and the evolution of religious cooperation|journal=Religion|date=September 2011|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–388|doi=10.1080/0048721X.2011.604508}}</ref> In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.

=== Resource management ===
Resource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McNamara|first1=Rita Anne|last2=Norenzayan|first2=Ara|last3=Henrich|first3=Joseph|title=Supernatural punishment, in-group biases, and material insecurity: experiments and ethnography from Yasawa, Fiji|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|date=18 June 2014|volume=6|issue=1|pages=34–55|doi=10.1080/2153599X.2014.921235}}</ref><ref name="purz13">{{cite journal|last1=PurzyckI|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=Toward a Cognitive Ecology of Religious Concepts: Evidence from the Tyva Republic|journal=Journal for the Cognitive Science of Religion|date=13 August 2012|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1558/jcsr.v1i1.99}}</ref> While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment.<ref name=":1" /> An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist [[Marvin Harris]], who wrote about the economic reasons that [[Hindu]] beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars, & witches : the riddles of culture|date=1989|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0679724681|edition=Vintage Books|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/cowspigswarswitc00marv}}</ref> Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by [[Roy Rappaport]] in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in [[Papua New Guinea]] during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rappaport|first1=Roy Abraham|title=Pigs for the ancestors : ritual in the ecology of a New Guinea people|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Il.|isbn=978-1577661016|edition=2.}}</ref> Furthermore, [[human behavioral ecology]] researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian [[Martu people]] and the consequential increases in local biodiversity.

Another ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the [[Tuva people|Tyva people]], a pastoralist population in southern [[Siberia]]. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (''cher eezi''). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to ''cher eezi'' is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The ''cher eezi'' are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them.<ref name="purz11" /><ref name="purz13" /> More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the ''cher eezi'' have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.<ref name="purzinpress" />
