The '''allegory of the long spoons''' is a [[parable]] that shows the difference between heaven and hell by means of people forced to eat with long spoons. It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of [[Rumšiškės|Romshishok]], as well as other sources.<ref name="tribune">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-23/features/sns-201208221330--tms--godsqudctngs-a20120823-20120823_1_remarkable-story-heaven-text|title=Famous spiritual story varies among faiths and cultures, but carries the same message|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>

The allegory can be summarized as follows:
:In each location, the inhabitants are given access to food, but the utensils are too unwieldy to serve oneself with.  In [[hell]], the people cannot cooperate, and consequently starve. In [[heaven]], the diners feed one another across the table and are sated. 

The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are [[#Interpretation|various interpretations]] of the fable including its [[#sermons|use in sermons]] and in advice to lonely people.

== Interpretation ==
The story suggests that people have the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people treat each other.

Given the same level playing field one group of people who treat each other well will create a pleasant environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer [[Dawn Eden]] suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.<ref name="eden" />

== Variations ==
The long spoons allegory has become part of the [[folklore]] of several cultures, for example: Jewish,<ref name=allegory>{{cite web|last=Rabbi|first=Haim|title=Narrative of the allegory|url=http://www.hodu.com/parable.shtml|work=Citation source|publisher=Hodu|accessdate=6 Aug 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060500/http://hodu.com/parable.shtml|archive-date=2011-02-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hindu,<ref name=hindu>{{cite web|last=Lord|first=Shiva|title=Hindu parable: A Long Handled Spoon|url=http://www.forwardsteps.com.au/LongHandledSpoon.html|work=Swami|accessdate=5 Aug 2011}}</ref> Buddhist,<ref>{{cite book|last=Horn|first=Nils|title=Yoga Basic Knowledge and Exercises By|pages=30}}</ref> "Oriental" (Middle-Eastern)<ref>{{cite book|last=Peseschkian|first=Nossrat|author-link=Nossrat Peseschkian|title=Oriental Stories as Tools in Psychotherapy: The Merchant and the Parrot|year=1986|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=26}}</ref> and Christian.<ref name="eden" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Tietze|first=Harald W|title=Happyology|publisher=The Pope tells the story of the long spoons|pages=61}}</ref> In medieval Europe, the food in the story is a bowl of stew; in China, it is a bowl of rice being eaten with long chopsticks.<ref name="tribune"/>

In some versions of the story the diners are using regular cutlery but are unable to bend their arms,<ref name="tribune"/> with a story attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok describing how "both arms were splinted with wooden slats so he could not bend either elbow to bring the food to his mouth".

==Art and popular culture==
<span id="sermons"></span>While the parable itself is seldom depicted in art, it is well known and used in sermons when referring to hell, where the fashion for depicting hell in terrible, painful, gruesome terms is fading in recent times.<ref name="eden">{{cite book|last=Eden|first=Dawn|title=The Thrill of the Chaste: Finding Fulfillment While Keeping Your Clothes On|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8499-1311-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/thrillofchaste00eden/page/194 194]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thrillofchaste00eden/page/194}}</ref>

The parable is told by [[Norman McCay]] in the novelization of ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. In the 2011 ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' episode "Under God's Power She Flourishes", Father Brennan tells Margaret the allegory of the long spoons while Emily is fitted for leg braces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2046372/synopsis?ref_=tt_ft|title="Boardwalk Empire" Under God's Power She Flourishes (2011) - Synopsis|work=IMDb|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> A scene in the 2013 thriller ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'' draws strong comparisons to the allegory when protagonist Sarah is depicted as selfish for neglecting to feed her adjacent diner while in a straitjacket. It is also retold in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel ''[[The Bean Trees]]''. The plot of 2019's [[The Platform (film)]] has also been compared to the allegory. <ref name="The Platform">{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|title="The Platform review – fiendish Netflix thriller about a gory battle for food"|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/20/the-platform-review-fiendish-netflix-thriller-about-a-gory-battle-for-food|work=Citation source|publisher="The Guardian"|accessdate=3 Mar 2020}}</ref>
