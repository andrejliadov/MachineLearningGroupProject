'''''In Search of Noah's Ark''''' is a 1976 [[documentary film]] released by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]] that explores the alleged final resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].

==Production notes==
''In Search of Noah's Ark'' was produced by [[Sunn Classic Pictures]], a [[Utah]]-based [[independent film]] company that specialized in releasing [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] family films and documentaries. Along with such features as ''[[Beyond and Back]]'' (1978) and ''[[In Search of Historic Jesus]]'' (1979), the film was one of a series of releases from the company that attempted to present convincing scientific evidence for [[Christian theology]].<ref>[http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1978/Beyond+and+Back ''Beyond and Back'', AMC Movie Guide.] [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]. Retrieved July 14, 2014.</ref> Parts of the film were shot in [[Park City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref>

The film was based on the book by David Balsiger. Filmed independently and inexpensively, the documentary makes the assertion that Noah's Ark, from the [[Genesis flood narrative|biblical flood narrative]], has been found on [[Mountains of Ararat|the slopes]] of [[Mount Ararat]] in [[Turkey]], though physical and political difficulties prevent a more extensive study of the alleged vessel. The movie included a dramatic re-enactment of Noah's story as one of its highlights.<ref>[http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/in-search-of-noahs-ark/ ''In Search of Noah's Ark'' at Christian Film Database.] [[Christian Film Database|CFDb]].

==Follow-up film==
On February 20, 1993, [[CBS]] aired a [[television special]] entitled ''The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark''.  Produced by Sun International Pictures, it was intended as an updated follow-up to ''In Search of Noah's Ark''.  Hosted by [[Darren McGavin]], the special features interviews with [[John C. Whitcomb]], [[Philip C. Hammond]], [[Charles Berlitz]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|David Coppedge]], [[Carl Baugh]] and [[Tim LaHaye]].  The special included a section devoted to the claims of George Jammal, who showed what he called "sacred wood from the ark."  Jammal's story of a dramatic mountain expedition which took the life of "his Polish friend Vladimir" was actually a deliberate hoax concocted with scholar [[Gerald A. Larue#Noah's Ark Hoax|Gerald Larue]].  Jammal – who was really an actor – later revealed that his "sacred wood" was taken from railroad tracks in [[Long Beach, California]] and hardened by cooking with various sauces in an oven.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cerone|first=Daniel|date=October 30, 1993|title=Admitting "Noah's Ark" Hoax|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-30-ca-51222-story.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|date=November 1, 1993|title=Will CBS Realize the Error of its Ways?|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-01-ca-52035-story.html}}</ref>
