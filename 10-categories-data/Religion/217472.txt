'''Eternity''' in [[common parlance]] means infinite [[time]] that never ends (or the quality, condition or fact of being eternal).<ref>"eternity, n." 1. and 2. OED Online. September 2019. Oxford University Press. https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/64704 (accessed October 26, 2019).</ref> In [[classical philosophy]], however, it is defined as what exists outside time as describing supranatural beings and forces, whereas sempiternity corresponds to the infinitely temporal, non-metaphoric definitions, as recited in [[requiem]] prayers for the dead.  [[Thomas Hobbes]] and many others in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] drew on the classical distinction  to put forward metaphysical hypotheses such as "eternity is a permanent Now".<ref>''Mr. Hobbes Considered in his Loyalty, Religion, Reputation, and Manners. By way of Letter to Dr. Wallis (English autobiography)'' T. Hobbes, 1662 at p.50</ref>

Eternity as infinite duration is an important concept in many [[religion]]s, where the god or gods are said to endure eternally. Some, such as [[Aristotle]], would say the same about the natural [[cosmos]] in regard to both past and future eternal duration, and like the eternal [[Platonic realism|Platonic form]]s, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] was considered essential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/eternity/#Ety |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Eternity |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> Today cosmologists, philosophers, and others look to analyses of the concept from across cultures and history. They debate, among other things, whether an absolute concept of eternity has real application such for the fundamental [[laws of physics]] such as the [[arrow of time]] in [[entropy]].

[[Aristotle]] [[arguments for eternity|argued]] that the [[cosmos]] has no beginning. In Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]], eternity is the [[unmoved mover]] (God), understood as the [[gradient]] of [[Minimum total potential energy principle|total synergy]] ("produces motion by being loved").<ref>Yu, Jiyuan [https://books.google.com/books?id=T5pRlUoAbmIC&pg=PA188 The Structure of Being in Aristotle’s Metaphysics] Springer, 2003, p. 188</ref> [[Boethius]] defined eternity as "simultaneously full and perfect possession of interminable life".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boedder|first1=Bernard|title=Natural Theology|url=http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|publisher=University of Notre Dame|access-date=March 15, 2015|quote=Aeternitas est interminablis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051152/http://www3.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/nath34.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Symbolism ==
{{see also|Engagement ring|eternity ring|wheel of time}}
Eternity is often symbolized by the endless snake, swallowing its own tail, the [[ouroboros]] (or oroboros). The circle, band or ring is also commonly used as a symbol for eternity, as is the mathematical symbol of infinity, <math>\infty</math>. Symbolically these are reminders that eternity has no beginning/end.
