[[Image:Bhagavad-Gita As It Is (Russian).jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Color image of the Russian edition of Bhagavad Gita As It Is front cover|The Russian edition of ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'', which was put on trial in [[Tomsk]].]]
The '''''Bhagavad Gita As It Is''''' '''trial in Russia''' was a trial that commenced in 2011 about banning the Russian edition of the book ''[[Bhagavad Gita As It Is]]'' (1968), a translation and commentary of the [[Hindu]] holy text ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', on charges that the commentaries fomented [[religious extremism]]. It contains a translation and commentary by [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement.

The trial was initiated in June 2011 in [[Tomsk, Russia]], based on an assessment of the book by scholars of [[Tomsk State University]], which concluded that Prabhupada's commentaries incite religious, social, and racial intolerance. The trial caused controversy, which was reported in the Indian, Russian, and international media, as well as on social networks. The Indian government harshly criticized the proposed ban as "patently absurd" undertaking of "ignorant and misdirected or motivated individuals". The overwhelmingly wide negative response to the trial forced Russian officials to offer apologies to India, promising the necessary remedial measures to prevent the ban. The trial also sparked public protests and legal actions in India against the proposed ban and drew harsh criticism of the intellectual community in Russia, leading Russian scholars publicly denounced the perpetuation of the trial. The scholars appealed to President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and Premier [[Vladimir Putin]] for intervention and warned them of the trial's negative consequences for [[India-Russia relations]] and for Russia's international reputation.

In December 2011, the judge dismissed the court case, a decision praised by the communities both in India and Russia. On January 26, 2012, the Tomsk prosecutor's office filed an appeal against the judge's ruling, but on March 21, 2012, the appeal court dismissed it, upholding the lower court's verdict. On May 29, 2012 Tomsk region prosecutor's office decided not to challenge the appeal court's verdict. The ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was included in the 2011 annual [[International Religious Freedom Report]]  of the [[U.S. Department of State]] among instances of attempted restrictions of religious freedom by the Russian government.

In the first, second, and third court hearings held on 12, 18, and 29–30 August 2011 respectively, Federal Judge Galina Butenko dismissed the assessment as inadequate and subjective after the prosecutor's experts said that their opinion in the assessment should be taken as private rather than official.<ref name=TOI-MAU /><ref name=RIR-Vanina /> According to Avanesov, the 2010 expert analysis was personally requested by [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security]] officer Dmitry Velikotsky.<ref name=F18>{{cite news|last=Corley|first=Felix|title=RUSSIA: Has "madness" of banning religious publications been stopped?|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1652|accessdate=21 March 2012|newspaper=[[Forum 18]]|date=5 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=lenta>{{cite news|last=Попова|first=Анна|title=На поле дхармы|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/12/21/bhagavadgita/|accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=28 December 2011}}</ref> They also stated that the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' did not contain any extremist statements.<ref name=MoscowTimes /><ref name=TOI-MAU /> Two experts invited by the court, N. V. Serebrennikov (Tomsk) and N. N. Karpitsky (Tomsk), also rejected the written expert opinion, maintaining, that while Prabhupada's commentaries used abusive words for those who are not Krishna's devotees, the use of these words did not attempt to create a racial or religious divide, to which the Judge recalled that similarly emotionally charged statements are found in the [[Bible]], like: "Don't throw [[wikt:cast pearls before swine|pearls before swine]]".<ref name=TOI-MAU /> The court noted that, despite some claims of exclusiveness in Prabhupada's commentaries, such statements are characteristic of most religious texts and therefore posed no evidence to support the accusations made against the book.<ref name=TOI-MAU /><ref name=RIR-Vanina />

The judge consequently postponed the next hearing until December 2011, as the prosecution requested a new assessment of the book by a panel of three professors of [[Kemerovo State University]], including linguist Michael Osadchy, psychologist Sergei Dranishnikov, and religious studies expert Alexei Gorbatov.<ref name=lenta /> They were divided on the issue: two found signs of extremism in the text and one did not.<ref name=F18 /><ref name=ITAR-TASS>{{cite news|author=[[ITAR-TASS]]|script-title=ru:Томский суд отказался признать "Бхагавад-гиту" экстремистской|trans-title=Tomsk court refused to recognize the "Bhagavad Gita" as extremist|date=28 December 2011|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/c9/308329.html|language=Russian}}</ref> Following a plea by ISKCON advocate Mikhail Fralov to seek a statement of the Russian Human Rights Committee on the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' and on the right of religious minorities, the Judge agreed to hear their opinion and postponed the final verdict until December 28, 2011.<ref name=TOI-SPD>{{cite news|title=As Hindus rally, Russia court defers Gita verdict|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|archive-url=https://archive.today/20111230042909/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-20/india/30537774_1_sadhu-priya-das-iskcon-religious-movement-russia-court|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2011|accessdate=24 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=20 December 2011|agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}</ref>

On February 16, 2012, explaining the rationale behind the appeal, first deputy prosecutor general of Russia Alexander Buksman said in an interview during his visit to Tomsk that the public misunderstood the initial plea of prosecutor's office to have the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' declared an extremist text. He stated that the prosecutor’s office sought a ban of the Russian version of the book’s commentaries rather than on the Hindu text itself, adding, "it’s important to discern gems from the chatter in this very case; the society’s perception of this issue is that prosecutors are standing against the concepts of this religion [Hinduism]. However, the problem is that the Russian translation has paragraphs that could be seen as promoting extremism; prosecutors started the case for that reason." Deputy prosecutor general of Russian in Siberia region Ivan Semchishyn confirmed, "That is why the prosecutor now has to stand up for his position in the appellate court".<ref name=RIA-APP /><ref name=newsru-proc>{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/religy/16feb2012/bhagavad.html|script-title=ru:В Генпрокуратуре считают, что дело "Бхагавад-гиты" представляется в обществе искаженно|trans-title=The prosecutor's office believes that the "Bhagavad Gita" case is distorted in the community|newspaper=[[NEWSru.com]]|date=16 February 2012|language=Russian}}</ref>

===Dismissal of appeal (March 2012)===

====Atheists and rationalists====
[[Sanal Edamaruku]], the president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], opposed the ban calling for the right to read any literature under the freedom of expression, even if he considered the book to be promoting the caste system. Similarly, Dr Jayagopal, the founder of the Atheist Society of India, opposed the ban, in spite of considering the book to be undemocratic and against the spirit of the constitution. He also suspected that the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] may have been behind the ban. Megh Raj Mitter, the founder of the [[Tarksheel Society]], also opposed this move, but admitted that Russians may have been offended by the book and their sentiments should be respected.<ref name=atheist/>

On the other hand, [[Dalit]] [[Marxist]] scholar Chittibabu Padavala supported the ban, as he considered Gita to be promoting inequalities from the birth unlike other religious texts.<ref name=atheist>{{cite news|title=Atheists, rationalists oppose ban on Bhagwat Gita|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-12-23/news/30550973_1_ban-iskon-bhagwat-gita|publisher=The Economic Times|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 December 2011}}</ref>

====Russian community in Goa====

On December 21, 2011,  the Russian community in [[Goa]] has issued a statement condemning the proposed ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' in Russia. Speaking on behalf of the 150-strong community, Russian consulate in Goa [[Vikram Varma]] stated: "The Russian community in Goa as a whole condemns the possibility of a ban on any of India's ancient scriptures. It is felt by the Russian community in Goa as well as by a large section of Russians visiting Goa that the depth of knowledge and wisdom offered by the Bhagavad Gita cannot be understood by a casual reader. It is well accepted that all the ancient Hindu scriptures are of tremendous importance not only to India but to the rest of the world."<ref>{{cite news|title=Russians in Goa flay possibility of ban on Gita|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-22/goa/30545829_1_russian-consulate-russian-city-goa|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=22 December 2011|agency=[[Times News Network]]}}</ref>

====Society====
The trial sparked community protests in India. On December 16, 2011, an online petition to stop the ''Bhagavad Gita'' trial was launched, and by December 22 more than 45,000 people from  all over the world, mostly from India.<ref name=TOI-On />

The topic has gone viral on social networks, with the [[hashtag]] #Gita becoming a leading trend on Indian [[Twitter]].<ref name=Reuters /><ref name=TOI-On /><ref name=DB-NET /> Noted poet and lyricist [[Javed Akhtar]], for instance, twitted: "Banning Gita ?

Prominent social activists from a broad societal spectrum also condemned the trial.<ref name=Rediff-3>{{cite news|last=Nanjappa|first=Vicky|title=Bhagavad Gita ban:Three views, three solutions|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-debate-bhagavad-gita-ban/20111223.htm|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Rediff News|date=23 December 2011}}</ref>

===In Russia===
The Russian society appears to be embarrassed by the court case over the Gita, with the media mostly condemning the ongoing trial, carrying reports titled like "Trial of Indian book brings shame to Tomsk". A prominent Russian Internet paper Gazeta.ru published a satirical article on how a work that was created 5,000 years ago has suddenly become an extremist document.<ref name=TOI-MAU />

====Indian diaspora and ISKCON====

====Scholars====
[[Islamic studies]] scholar [[Roman Silantyev]] opined that  Prabhupada's interpretation "has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism" and that his commentaries contained statements that can be considered extremist.<ref name=Interfax-MID>{{cite news|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper&nbsp;– ministry|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=8941|accessdate=23 December 2011|date=23 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}</ref>

On November 28, at a round table organized by Russian newspaper ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]'', scientists and members of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] along with a few religious leaders stated in a resolution, "there is no basis for conducting such a trial and the very fact of initiating a trial by the public prosecutor is an insult to the religious feelings of followers of Vaishnavism in India and Russia and it will give a body blow to Indo-Russian relations."<ref name=TOI-MAU />

Sergey Serebryanny, the head of the [[Institute of High Humanitarian Studies]] at the [[Russian State University for the Humanities]] and an Indologist, said Russian courts give the term ‘extremism’ a very broad interpretation, which allows them to label as extremist anything going against the authorities, whether secular or religious. He also opined that, while Prabhupada supplemented his version of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' with his own ideas and beliefs, his followers "have the same right for the freedom of conscience as believers of other religious confessions that observe the laws of the Russian Federation".<ref name=RT />

Russian Indologist Yevgenia Vanina of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] wrote an article severely criticizing the court case over the ''Bhagavad Gita'', which "is revered by millions in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and wherever Hindus live". She reminded that in Europe, the Gita was "admired by many great philosophers and thinkers, such as Herder, Schopenhauer and Tolstoy" and thought it ironic that while the Hindu scripture was first translated into Russian in 1788, "nobody put the book and its translators on trial in the Orthodox Russian Empire in 1788, but it’s being judged in secular democratic Russia". Vanina also argued that charges of extremism  against Prabhupada's "copious" commentaries on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' are fallacious and based on a "primitive" screening of the religious text for negative words (such as "fool," "enemy," "demon, "kill"). According to Vanina, using this approach, any ancient text, from the Greek myths to the Bible, and the Koran, can be found extremism, especially when  "specialists in philosophical suicidology are entrusted with passing judgement on ancient Indian texts". Vanina concluded by opining that, despite people's right to their attitudes towards "a Russian lad wearing Indian clothes and singing Hare Krishna", ISKCON followers have the right to practice their religion, and that the Russian Orthodox Church, instead of calling for a ban on competitors or attempting to legally equate their holy  book to ''Mein Kampf'', should introspect as to the reasons that deter young Russians from joining the Church. Otherwise, Vanina predicted, "people will again start being burned alive".<ref name=RIR-Vanina />

Historian and full professor of the Diplomatic Academy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia Andrey Volodin opined that the move to ban the ''Gita'' was "contrary to the basic principle of tolerance inherent in Russian civilisation". He said that this trial, held in Tomsk, "one of Russia’s intellectual capitals, raises doubts as to whether the local leaders are sane and the intellectual community in one of the country’s main academic and university centers is actually mature". To a question, which forces in Russia are interested in a ban on the ''Bhagavad Gita'' Volodin replied that "all the intelligence services in the world, including the CIA and M16, could never have come up with a more effective move to compromise Russia in India and in the world".<ref name=RIR-Volodin>{{cite news|last=Volodin|first=Andrei|title=Gita row: A test of Russian toleration|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/gita_row_a_test_of_russian_toleration_14077.html|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=Russia & India Report|date=23 December 2011}}</ref>

At a December 22, 2011 press briefing, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] spokesman Alexander Lukashevich attempted to clarify a number of points seemingly misunderstood by his Indian colleagues: "In June this year Tomsk prosecutors instigated legal proceedings against the third edition of the Russian translation of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' with a view to have it added to the federal list of extremist materials. I would like to stress that the trial is not about 'Bhagavad Gita', a religious philosophical poem, which forms part of the great Indian epic Mahabharata and is one of the most famous texts of the ancient Hindu literature. In Russia, the book was first published in Russian in 1788 and then went through many editions in different years and in various translations. The Tomsk court case is about classifying as extremist material the Russian-language edition of 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is', written in 1968 by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. The work represents an authorized translation of the original from Sanskrit into English. The book was translated into Russian in 1984. As evident from the materials available, the complaints of law enforcement are not so much about the text of the book itself, whose double translation suffers from semantic distortions, as about the author's comments which were regarded as falling under Article 13 of the Federal Law 'On Counteracting Extremist Activity'."<ref name=Interfax-MID /><ref name=RIR-Interfax>{{cite news|author=Interfax|title=Tomsk trial held over "Bhagavad Gita" translation, not book proper - ministry|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2011/12/23/tomsk_trial_held_over_bhagavad_gita_translation_not_book_proper_-_mi_14078.html|newspaper=Russia & India Report|date=23 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=TheHindu-MID /><ref name=MID-brief>{{cite press release |script-title=ru:Брифинг официального представителя МИД России А.К.Лукашевича, 22 декабря 2011 года|trans-title=Briefing by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Mr. Lukashevitch, December 22, 2011|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Foreign Ministry]]|date=22 December 2011|url=http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/briefview/5A299EC9BE98767A4425796E005447BD|language=Russian}}</ref>

Nelly Krechetova, Human Rights Ombudsman of Tomsk region, has termed the trial "absurd". Speaking on the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'' radio station, she said, "This book is considered sacred by more than a billion people the world over, and in Russia itself the book has been in circulation for 20 years."  She continued that there was no manifest incident of extremism caused by the dissemination of the book. A ban on the book, she said, would amount to "violation of constitutional rights of citizens to freedom of conscience and faith." <ref name=TOI-MAU />

On March 12, 2012, a group of twenty leading Russian [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[Oriental studies|orientologists]], and [[philology|philologists]] published an open letter addressing both [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian Prime Minister]] and [[President-elect]] [[Vladimir Putin]], with copies sent to Russia's [[Prosecutor General of Russia|Presecutor General]], [[Ministry of Justice of Russia|Ministry of Justice]], and [[Public Chamber]], urging the ruling tandem to take the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' court case under their "personal control".<ref name=Hindu-20>{{cite news|last=Radyushin|first=Vladimir|title=Russian scholars' plea on Gita|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2999643.ece|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=15 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref name=Newsru-20>{{cite news|script-title=ru:Российские ученые просят Медведева и Путина взять процесс над "Бхагавад-гитой" под личный контроль|trans-title=Russian scholars ask Medvedev and Putin to take "Bhagavad Gita" court case under their personal control|url=http://newsru.com/religy/15mar2012/bhagavad.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=[[NEWSru]]|date=15 March 2012|language=Russian}}</ref>  The scholars said they were alarmed by the Tomsk prosecutor's attempting to overrule the earlier court's rejection of the extremest charges against the book, and filing a modified petition asking the court to ban only Bhaktivedanta Swami's commentaries and exempting the original text from the charges of extremism. The scholars criticized the prosecutor's indictment of the commentaries with extremism as "untrue and contrary to the traditions of Hinduism".<ref name=Hindu-20 /> They emphasized that, contrary to the prosecutor's accusations, the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' was considered sacred by a section of Hindu followers as belonging to the commentary tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Bengali Vaishnavism]], "one of the most popular branches of Hinduism",<ref name=Hindu-20 /> and "did not contain any signs of extremism and did not incite hatred on ethnic, religious or any other grounds".<ref name=Hindu-20 /> The scholars also warned Russia's top leaders that the trial "discredits Russia's cultural and democratic credentials in the eyes of the civilized world and is driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations".<ref name=Hindu-20 />

===ISKCON===
Maxim Osipov, a representative of ISKCON's [[Governing Body Commission]], said that the commentary to ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' is "a precise and clear reflection" on the religious tradition taught by Prabhupada, the founder-[[acharya]] of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.<ref name=RAPSI-Conf />

{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}

"I welcome the verdict of the Honourable District Court in Tomsk today, which has dismissed the appeal petition in the ''Bhagavad Gita'' case. It is good that the decision of the lower trial court in this matter has been reaffirmed. I trust that this issue is now conclusively behind us", said [[Ajai Malhotra]], Indian Ambassador to the Russian Federation.<ref name=RIR-Mar21>{{cite news|title=Tomsk court dismisses Bhagavad Gita case|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/03/21/tomsk_court_dismisses_bhagavad_gita_case_15204.html|date=21 March 2012}}</ref>

"We appreciate this sensible resolution of a sensitive issue and are glad to put this episode behind us. We also appreciate the efforts of all friends in Russia who made this outcome possible. This demonstrates yet again that the people of India and Russia have a deep understanding of each other’s cultures and will always reject any attempt to belittle our common civilizational values", said Indian foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash.<ref name=AP /><ref name=HTx />

====Human Rights Commissioner====
{{expand section|date=April 2012}}
On April 11, 2012 [[Vladimir Lukin]], the [[Human Rights]] [[Commissioner]] of Russia, "warned against court decisions on ''Bhagavad Gita'' texts based on judges' opinions rather than expert examinations." Lukin stated that the "Tomsk [judges] considered something they should not have… It should have been up to [[theologian]]s and [[historian]]s." Lukin noted that "[[Winston Churchill]] once said: Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it."<ref name=IT-Lukin>{{cite news|title=Russian ombudsman warns on Gita rulings|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/russian-ombudsman-warns-on-gita-rulings/1/184131.html|newspaper=[[India Today]]|date=12 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=RIA-Lukin>{{cite news|title=Bhagavad Gita Texts Up for Experts to Judge - Russian Ombudsman|url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120411/172744774.html|newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=11 April 2012}}</ref>

====Religions====
On December 28, 2011, the day the Tomsk court dismissed extremism charges against the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', director of the Human Rights Center of the World Russian People's Council [[Roman Silantyev]] said that the examination of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'' as extremist was accurate, and that "it has nothing to do with traditional Hinduism."

He also called Krishna devotees in Russia marginal pseudo-Hindu cult members with "extremely nasty reputation" and condemned their [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|charitable food distribution programs]] saying it was unacceptable for Orthodox, Muslim, Jews and Buddhist believers.<ref name=IFSil>{{cite news|title=Tomsk court didn't find "Bhagavad Gita" translation extremist|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=8953|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=28 December 2011|agency=[[Interfax]]}}</ref>

On January 18, 2012, a number of Russia's Islamic leaders denounced Hare Krishna followers in Russia as a "destructive cult" and called on the Russian authorities not to yield to the Indian pressure in regard of the proposed banning of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It''.  [[Mufti]] Muhammedgali Huzin, head of All-Russian Muslim Board executive committee, said, 
"I believe that Russian authorities should be principally tough in the question and shouldn't give way to any provocations and pressure. I think that Russia can do without semiliterate interpretations of ancient epos". First deputy chairman of the Central Spiritual Board of Russian Muslims Mufti of Moscow and Russia's Central Region Albir Krganov proposed to "pay the debt" to Krishna devotees in Russia for their charitable  food distribution by "delivering nutritious Halal canned beef to starving Krishna devotees of India. We are ready to personally distribute this meat to Russian Krishnaites".<ref name=IF-Mus>{{cite news|title=Russian Muslims believe Krishnaites a sect and ready to deliver them Halal meat|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=8986|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=18 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]}}</ref><ref name=RIR-Appeal>{{cite news|title=Siberian prosecutors make another attempt to ban Prabhupada’s Gita interpretation|url=http://indrus.in/articles/2012/01/26/siberian_prosecutors_make_another_attempt_to_ban_prabhupadas_gita_in_14630.html|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Russia & India Report|date=26 January 2012}}</ref> However, other all-Russia Islamic umbrella organizations rejected their statements as "fortunately" not representing the opinion of a majority of Russian Muslims of the issue.<ref name=RIR-Appeal />

On January 27, 2012, a group of Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the premises of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was in retaliation for the burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the ''Bhagavad Gita As It Is'', which they called an "anti-Russian … disgraceful act" and "one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign of pressing on Russian court".<ref>{{cite news|title=Orthodox believers conveyed a batch of tinned stewed meat to Moscow Krishnaites in protest against burning Russian flag|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=9015|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=27 January 2012}}</ref>

On January 31, 2012, the head of the Traditional Buddhist Sangha of Russia Andrey Baljirov called the Indian authorities who asked the Russian government to help avert the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is "misinformed" and "exerting pressure" and spoke against the proposed construction of the Krishna temple in Moscow because "there are Buddhist followers in Moscow who do not have a temple yet".<ref name=IF-Bud>{{cite news|script-title=ru:В буддийской общине РФ выступают против строительства храма кришнаитов в Москве|trans-title=The Buddhist community of Russia spoke against the construction of Krishna temple in Moscow|url=http://www.interfax-religion.ru/?act=news&div=44000|accessdate=16 February 2012|date=31 January 2012|agency=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian}}</ref>
