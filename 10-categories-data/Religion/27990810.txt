{{Refimprove|date= November 2010}}
In [[religion]], a '''covenant''' is a formal alliance or agreement made by [[God]] with a [[religious community]] or with humanity in general. The concept, central to the [[Abrahamic religions]], is derived{{by whom?|date=June 2019}} from the [[covenant (biblical) |biblical covenants]], notably from the [[Abrahamic covenant]].

==Usage==
{{See|Covenant (law)}}
A covenant in its most general sense and [[covenant (historical)|historical sense]], is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. A covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a [[contract]]ual [[terms and conditions|condition]]. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant) or not do some action (negative covenant).

Covenant is the customary word used to [[Bible translations|translate]] the [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] word ''berith''.<ref>(ברית [[Tiberian Hebrew]] ''bərîṯ'' [[Standard Hebrew]] ''bərit'')</ref> It is used in the [[Masoretic Text]] 264 times.<ref>[http://www.newjerusalem.org/Strongs.aspx?search=H1285]</ref> The equivalent word in the [[Septuagint]] and the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{lang|grc|διαθήκη}}, ''diatheke''.<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=1242 The Blue Letter Bible, Strong's G1242.]</ref>

{{main|Covenant (biblical)|Mosaic covenant}}
The Mosaic covenant refers to a [[Covenant (biblical)|biblical covenant]] between God and the [[Israelites#Biblical Israelites|biblical Israelites]].<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12391-proselyte Jewish Encyclopedia: Proselyte]: "...Isa. lvi. 3-6 enlarges on the attitude of those that joined themselves to Yhwh, "to minister to Him and love His name, to be His servant, keeping the Sabbath from profaning it, and laying hold on His covenant.""</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8|HE}}: "thy stranger that is within thy gates"</ref> The establishment and stipulations of the Mosaic covenant are recorded in the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which are traditionally attributed to [[Mosaic authorship]] and collectively called the [[Torah]], and this covenant is sometimes also referred to as the [[Law of Moses]] or Mosaic Law or the [[613 Mitzvot]].

Covenants are often initiated by an [[oath]] and can be of two types: grants or treaties.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Grants are generally unilateral, unconditional covenants such as those where God made unconditional promises to Noah (Genesis 9), Abraham (Genesis 15, Genesis 17) and David (2 Samuel 7:8ff).{{cn|date=July 2018}} Bilateral covenants are generally conditional with blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience as in Deuteronomy 28 and 30. 

==Christianity==
{{main|New Covenant}}
[[Biblical theology]] and [[systematic theology]] for covenants often intertwines the unilateral and the bilateral, the conditional and the unconditional, such that much has been written and said about "Old" and "New" Covenants and the extent to which the "Old Covenant" still persists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=[[Avery Dulles|Dulles SJ]] |first1=Avery |title=The Covenant with Israel |journal=First Things |date=November 2005 |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2005/11/the-covenant-with-israel |access-date=8 July 2018}}</ref>  The typology of covenants is governed by the distribution of covenant obligations between the covenanting parties.<ref name="ScottHahn">{{cite book |last1=[[Scott Hahn|Hahn]] |first1=Scott W. |title=Kinship by Covenant: A Canonical Approach to the Fulfillment of God's Saving Promises |date=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300140972 |pages=589 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Kinship-Covenant-Canonical-Fulfillment-Reference/dp/0300140975 |access-date=28 July 2018}}</ref>

The New Covenant is a [[biblical interpretation]] derived partly from a phrase in the Book of Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 31:31), in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. There are several [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologies]] that further define the New Covenant. For example, an [[inaugurated eschatology]] defines and describes the New Covenant as an ongoing relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the [[Second Coming of Christ]]; that is, it will not only be in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the [[World to Come#Christian eschatology|future external world]] as well.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The connection between the [[blood of Christ]] and the New Covenant is seen in most modern [[English translations of the Bible|English translations of the New Testament]]<ref>but not in the [[KJV]] for example</ref> with the saying: "this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+22&version=ESV |title=Luke 22:20 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |access-date=2011-09-24}}</ref>

Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant, and that the blood of Christ shed at his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] is the [[Propitiation|required blood of the covenant]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} As with all covenants between God and man described in the Bible, the New Covenant is considered "a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God."<ref>This definition of covenant is from [[O. Palmer Robertson]]'s book ''The Christ of the Covenants''. It has become an accepted definition among modern scholars. See this [http://www.apuritansmind.com/Baptism/McMahonOverviewRobertsonsBookChrist.htm critical review of his book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113194042/http://apuritansmind.com/Baptism/McMahonOverviewRobertsonsBookChrist.htm |date=2007-11-13 }} by Dr. C. Matthew McMahon.</ref> It has been theorized that the New Covenant is the [[Law of Christ]] as spoken during his [[Sermon on the Mount]].<ref>George R. Law, “The Form of the New Covenant in Matthew,” ''American Theological Inquiry'' 5:2 (2012).</ref>

[[Covenant theology]], a theological system within [[Reformed Christianity]], holds that God relates to man primarily through three covenants: the [[Covenant of Redemption]], the [[covenant of works|Covenant of Works]], and the [[Covenant of Grace]]. In this theological system a covenant may be defined as, "an unchangeable, divinely imposed legal agreement between God and man that stipulates the conditions of their relationship."<ref>Grudem, Wayne A.

===Latter Day Saints===
{{Main|Covenant (Latter Day Saints)}}
In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], a covenant is a promise made between [[God the Father|God]] and a person or a group of people.<ref name = ldsorg>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/covenant?lang=eng&_r=1 "Covenant"], churchofjesuschrist.org.</ref> God sets the conditions of the covenant, and as the conditions are met, he blesses the person who entered into and kept the covenant. If the covenant is violated, blessings are withheld and in some cases a penalty or punishment is inflicted.<ref name = ldsorg/>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that one enters a covenant through a ritual or a visible sign.<ref name = eom>Wouter Van Beek, [http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Covenants "Covenants"], in ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' (New York: Macmillan, 1992).</ref> Some leaders have taught that a covenant is always associated with an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]].<ref>Dennis B.

==Islam==
The original covenant made between God and mankind marked the beginning of creation according to [[Islamic theology]]. It is believed that before the creation of the heavens and the earth, God assembled all of creation (that would ever exist) in a timeless, placeless region and informed them of the truth of his existence. This moment is referred to in the verse 7:172 of the [[Quran]] as follows:<ref>See further: Kadi (Al-Qadi), Wadad (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1558296 "The Primordial Covenant and Human History in the Qur'ān"]. ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', Vol. 147, No. 4 (Dec., 2003), pp. 332-338.</ref> 

:{{lang|ar|وَ إِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ بَني‏ آدَمَ مِنْ ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَ أَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلى‏ أَنْفُسِهِمْ أَ لَسْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ قالُوا بَلى‏ شَهِدْنا أَنْ تَقُولُوا يَوْمَ الْقِيامَةِ إِنَّا كُنَّا عَنْ هذا غافِلين}}

:{{transl|ar|wa ʾiḏ ʾaxaḏa rabbika min banī ʾādama min ẓuhūrihim ḏurrīyatahum wa 'ašhadahum ʿalā ʾanfusihim ʾalastu bi-rabbikum? qālū balā šahidnā ʾan taqūlū yawma l-qiyāmati ʾinnamā kunnā ʿan hāḏā ḡāfilīn}}
 
:"When thy Lord drew forth their descendants from the children of Adam, He made them testify concerning themselves [saying]: 'Am I not your Lord?' They replied, 'Yes, we do so testify'; lest you may say on the day of Resurrection, 'Lo, we were ignorant of this'."

This covenant is significant in that it asserts that an understanding of the origin of man is something deeply inherent to and natural within every person. Any disconnection from this memory is referred to as being ‘forgetful’ within the scripture, ''[[hadith]]'' literature and commentary. The Quran constantly implores people to recall and remember. Scholars suggest that the call to remember throughout the Quran is in fact a call to remember this particular moment in their spiritual history. Suggestions are also made that where people recognise people with ease, it is usually as a memory from this event. To strive to remember through invocations and contemplation is thus considered a form of worship in Islam called ''[[dhikr]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

There are many scholarly perspectives taken on the significance of this covenant. It is understood as marking the beginning of human consciousness with mankind making their first conscious response to the divine question 'Am I not your lord?'. Some also see it as being relevant to the Islamic principle of ''[[Tawhid]]'' or unity as the entirety of mankind was said to have been assembled on this date.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Another perspective is that as an Abrahamic faith, the covenant was made with Abraham. Any person confessing to faith can become a [[Muslim]] and partake of this covenant with God: 
{{quote|Remember We made the House a place of assembly for men and a place of safety; and take ye the station of Abraham as a place of prayer; and We Covenanted with Abraham and Isma'il, that they should sanctify My House for those who compass it round, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves (therein in prayer).{{Cite quran|2|125}}}}

== Bahá'í Faith  ==
In the <u>[[Baháʼí Faith|Bahá'í Faith]]</u>, a religious covenant is considered a binding agreement between God and humans wherein a certain behavior is required of individuals and in return God guarantees certain blessings. For Bahá'ís there are two distinct covenants: a ''Greater Covenant'' which is made between every [[prophet]] or [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|messenger from God]] and his followers concerning the next divine teacher to come; and a ''Lesser Covenant'' that concerns successorship of authority within the religion after the prophet dies.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Peter|url=http://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit|title="Covenant (p. 114)"|work=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications, 2000|isbn=1-85168-184-1|location=Oxford, UK}}</ref>

According to <u>[[Baháʼu'lláh|Bahá'u'lláh]]</u>, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, in the greater covenant God promises to always send divine teachers to instruct humankind in a process known as <u>[[Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)|progressive revelation]]</u>.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hatcher|first=W.S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IZmkG1ASirgC|title=The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion (pp. 127-130)|last2=Martin|first2=J.D.|publisher=Harper and Row, 1998|isbn=0-87743-264-3|location=San Francisco, CA, USA|language=en}}</ref> Bahá'ís believe prophecies pertaining to God's greater covenant are found in the scriptures of all religions, and each messenger from God specifically prophesies about the next one to come.<ref name=":0" /> For their part in the greater covenant, the followers of each religion have a duty to investigate with an open mind whether a person who claims to be the promised messenger of their faith does, or does not, spiritually fulfill relevant prophecies.<ref name=":0" />

To differentiate it from God's eternal greater covenant with humankind, Bahá'ís refer to a manifestation's agreement with his followers regarding whom they should turn to and obey immediately after his passing as the lesser covenant.<ref name=":0" /> Two distinctive features of the Bahá'í lesser covenant, which is referred to within the Bahá'í Faith as the ''[[Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh#Lesser Covenant|Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh]]'', are that it is explicit and also conveyed in authenticated written documents.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Momen|first=Moojan|date=1995|title=The Covenant and Covenant-breaker. §'C. The Lesser Covenant'.|url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant|website=Bahá'í Library Online|language=en-US}}</ref> Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh's covenant as unique in religious history, and the most powerful means for ensuring the spiritual health of the Faith's adherents, and their enduring unity and complete protection from any efforts to foment dissension or to create schism.<ref name=":0" /> 

==Other religions==
In [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|Indo-Iranian]] religious tradition, [[Mithra]]-[[Mitra]] is the [[Hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] of covenant, and hence keeper and protector of moral, social and interpersonal relationships, including love and friendship.{{cn|date=July 2018}} In living [[Zoroastrianism]], which is one of the two primary developments of Indo-Iranian religious tradition, Mithra is by extension a judge, protecting agreements by ensuring that individuals who break one do not enter [[Heaven]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}
