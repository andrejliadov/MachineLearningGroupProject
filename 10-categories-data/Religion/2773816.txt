In [[Indian religions]], the term '''''chakravarti''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|चक्रवर्तिन्  cakravartin}}, [[Pali]]: ''cakkavatti'') refers to an ideal universal ruler<ref name=Madan>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/81 81]|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}</ref>
especially in the sense of an imperial ruler of the entire [[Indian sub-continent]] (as in the case of the [[Maurya Empire]] despite not conquering the southern kingdoms).<ref name="Rosenfield, 175">Rosenfield, 175</ref>
The first references to a ''Chakravala Chakravartin'' appear in monuments from the time of the early Maurya Empire, in the 4th to 3rd century BCE,  in reference to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and his grandson [[Ashoka]].

The word {{lang|sa|cakra-vartin-}} is a [[bahuvrihi|bahuvrīhi]] compound word, translating to "one whose wheels are moving", in the sense of "whose [[chariot]] is rolling everywhere without obstruction". It can also be analysed as an 'instrumental bahuvrīhi: "through whom the wheel is moving" in the meaning of "through whom the [[Dharmachakra]] ("Wheel of the [[Dharma]]) is turning" (most commonly used in Buddhism).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
The Tibetan equivalent  {{bo|t=ཁོར་ལོས་སྒྱུར་བའི་རྒྱལ་པོ་ |w=khor los sgyur ba'i rgyal po}} translates "monarch who controls by means of a wheel".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In Buddhism, the Chakravarti came to be considered the secular counterpart of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. In general, the term applies to temporal as well as spiritual kingship and leadership, particularly in [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. In [[Hinduism]], the term generally denotes a powerful ruler whose dominion extended to the entire earth.

The Indian concept of Chakravarti later evolved into [[devaraja]] concept of [[Divine right of kings#indic|divine right of kings]]{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}, which was adopted by the [[indianisation|indianised]] Hindu-Buddhist [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|kingdoms of Southeast Asia]] through Indian Hindu [[Brahmins]] scholars deployed in courts. It was first adopted by Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist empires ([[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]]) and through them by various Indianised Malay kingdoms, then by the [[Khmer Empire]], and subsequently by the [[Monarchy of Thailand|Thai monarches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Buddhism==
It was believed that once a cakravati emerged the "Future Buddha" [[Maitreya]] would appear on earth.<ref name="Rosenfield, 175"/>

In early Buddhist art there are more than 30 depictions, all from the [[Deccan]].  In most the Cakravarti King uses the "Royal Gesture" in which the king "clenches his left hand at his chest and reaches up with his right hand".  He is surrounded by his seven attributes: the [[Chakraratna]] wheel, his state elephant, charger horse, "the octagonal gem which is so luminous it can light the path of his army by night", his queen, prime minister and finance minister.<ref>Rosenfield, 175-176</ref>
 
The [[Early Buddhism|early Buddhist]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]'' (1.259f) and the ''[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]]'', as well as the [[Theravada|Theravadin]] [[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]], describe the marks of the cakravarti as ruler: {{IAST|[[Ushnisha|''uṣṇīṣa'']]}}, [[chhatra]] "parasol", "horn jewel" or [[vajra]], [[whisk]] and [[Upanah|sandals]]. These were the marks of the [[kshatriya]]. Plastic art of early [[Mahayana]] Buddhism illustrates [[bodhisattva]]s in a form called {{IAST|''uṣṇīṣin''}} "wearing a turban/hair binding", wielding the mudras for "nonviolent cakravarti rule".<ref name=Falk>Falk, Harry, "Small-Scale Buddhism" in {{cite book|editor1-last=Voegeli|editor1-first=François|editor2-last=Eltschinger|editor2-first=Vincent|editor3-last=Candotti|editor3-first=Maria Piera|editor4-last=Diaconescu|editor4-first=Bogdan|editor5-last=Kulkarni|editor5-first=Malhar|title=Devadattīyam : Johannes Bronkhorst felicitation volume|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Bern|isbn=9783034306829}}, p. 495</ref>

A Cakravarti King is a king who rules all of the great continents (Pubbavideha, Jambudipa, Aparagoyana, Uttarakuru) of earth. The King wins all of the continents with peace. Since he is virtuous, seven miracle treasures appear including a large wheel spinning (Chakraratnaya) in the sky. The king and his army can travel anywhere with that spinning wheel in the sky. He travels over the world and teaches all kings how to rule with peace [[Dasavidha-rājadhamma]]. He can travel to the lower heaven realms with the power of Chakraratnaya if he wants. Cakravarti king only appears when humans are virtuous and long lived. [[Jataka tales]], a part of the [[Pali Canon]], describe Buddhist Cakravarti Kings.

According to the traditions "[[Vishnu]], in the form of [[Chakra]], was held as the ideal of worship for Kings desirous of obtaining Universal Sovereignty",<ref>Wayne Edison Begley (1973).

In Southern India, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava period]] beginning with Simhavishnu (575 CE{{Dash}}900 CE) was a transitional stage in southern Indian society with monument building, establishment of (bhakti) sects of [[Alvars]] and [[Nayanars]], flowering of rural Brahmanical institutions of Sanskrit learning, and the establishment of ''Chakravartin'' model of kingship over a territory of diverse people; which ended the pre-Pallavan era of territorially segmented people, each with their culture, under a tribal chieftain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantstatesoci0000stei|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|pages=[https://archive.org/details/peasantstatesoci0000stei/page/63 63–64]}}</ref> The [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] period extolled ranked relationships based on ritual purity as enjoined by the ''shastras''.<ref name=stein>{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantstatesoci0000stei|url-access=registration|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantstatesoci0000stei/page/70 70]}}</ref> Burton distinguishes between the ''Chakravatin'' model and the ''[[Kshatriya]]'' model, and likens kshatriyas to locally based warriors with ritual status sufficiently high enough to share with ''[[Brahmin]]s''; and states that in south India the kshatriya model did not emerge.<ref name=stein/> As per Burton, South India was aware of the Indo-Aryan ''Varna'' organized society in which decisive secular authority was vested in the ''Kshatriyas''; but apart from the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]], [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] line of warriors which claimed ''Chakravartin'' status, only few locality warrior families achieved the prestigious kin-linked organization of northern warrior groups.<ref name=stein/>

During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Salakapurusa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 12 Chakravartin regularly appear.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} The [[Jain cosmology]] or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. As per Jain cosmology, Chakravartins are ''Universal Monarchs'' or ''World Conquerors''. Golden in complexion, they all belonged to the ''[[Kasyapa]]'' [[gotra]]. The mother of a Chakravartin sees some dreams at the time of conception. A chakravartin is considered an ideal human being endowed with thirty-two major signs of excellence and many minor signs of excellence.

The list of 12 chakravartin of ''Avasarpini'' as per [[Jainism]] is as follows<ref>{{citation |first=Jagmanderlal |last=Jaini |title=Outlines of Jainism |editor=F.W. Thomas}} appendix III.</ref>

#[[Bharata Chakravartin|Bharata]], son of [[Tirthankara]] [[Rishabhanatha]]
#[[King Sagara|Sagara]], ancestor of [[Bhagiratha]] as in the [[Puranas]]
# Maghava{{sfn|von Glasanapp|1999|p=306}}

# Subhauma{{sfn|von Glasanapp|1999|p=308}}
#[[Bimbisara|Padmanabha]]
#[[Harishena]]
# Jayasena
# Brahmadatt

In Jainism, a Chakravartin Samrat was characterised by his possession of ''Saptaratna'', or "Seven Jewels":{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
#[[Sudarshana Chakra|Ratna-Chakra]], a miraculous diamond serrated discus that never misses its target
#Empress
#Divine Jewellery
#Immense Wealth
#Huge Army of [[Ratha|War-Chariots]]
#Huge Army of Cavalry
#Huge Army of Elephants

Some lists cite [[navaratna]] or "nine jewels" instead, adding "[[Prime Minister]]" and "[[Son]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
