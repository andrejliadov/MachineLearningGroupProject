A '''cantor''' or '''chanter''' is a person who leads people in singing or sometimes in [[prayer]]. In formal [[Christianity|Christian]] worship, a [[Cantor (Christianity)|cantor]] is a person who sings solo verses or passages to which the choir or congregation responds.

In Judaism, a cantor is one who sings and leads people in prayer in a Jewish religious service, and may be called [[hazzan]]. A cantor in [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is an ordained clergyperson, similar to that of an ordained [[rabbi]], if the cantor has gone through [[Jewish seminary|seminary]] training or been certified as a "Cantor" from an endorsed seminary.

"Cantor" is used as a translation of equivalent terms in other languages, such as for the leader of singing on a traditional [[Kerala]] snake boat, a [[Chundan Vallam]]. A similar term is [[precentor]], defined as a leader of the singing of a choir or congregation.

More specific types of cantor include:

*[[Cantor (Christianity)|Cantor]] in Christianity, an ecclesiastical officer leading liturgical music in several branches of the Christian church
**[[Protopsaltis]], leader master cantor of the right choir (Orthodox Church)
** [[Lampadarios]], leader of the left choir (Orthodox Church)
** [[Domestikos]], leader assistant to the Protopsaltis of the right choir and/or to the Lampdarios of the left choir (Orthodox Church)
** [[Precentor]]
** [[Succentor]]
*[[Hazzan]] in Judaism, a singer and/or musician. [[Orthodox Judaism]] only allows men to be cantors, while the other branches allow women. Reform Judaism and Orthodox Judaism ordain cantors from seminaries. Ordained cantors serve as clergy in their congregations and perform all ministerial rites as rabbis.
*[[Adhan]] (Islam), a call to prayer by the ordained imam or muezzin that serve as clergy in their congregations and perform all ministerial rites as [[imam]]s.
