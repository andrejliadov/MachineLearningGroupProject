'''Akhenaten''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|ə|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|ən}}{{sfn|Dictionary.com|2008}}), also spelled '''Echnaton''',{{sfn|Montserrat|2003|pp=105, 111}} '''Akhenaton''',{{sfn|Britannica.com|2012}} '''Ikhnaton''',{{sfn|Rogers|1912|p=252}} and '''Khuenaten'''{{sfn|Kitchen|2003|p=486}}{{sfn|Tyldesley|2005}} ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜣḫ-n-jtn|ꜣḫ-n-jtn]]}}, meaning "Effective for the [[Aten]]"), was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] reigning c. 1353–1336{{sfn|Britannica.com|2012}} or 1351–1334 BC,{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=190}} the tenth ruler of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Before the fifth year of his reign, he was known as '''Amenhotep IV''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:jmn-ḥtp|jmn-ḥtp]]}}, meaning "[[Amun]] is satisfied", [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] as ''Amenophis IV'').

Akhenaten is noted for abandoning [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt's traditional polytheistic religion]] and introducing [[Atenism]], worship centered on [[Aten]]. The views of [[Egyptologists]] differ whether Atenism should be considered as absolute [[monotheism]], or whether it was [[monolatristic|monolatry]], [[religious syncretism|syncretism]], or [[henotheism]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=13–15}}{{sfn|Hart|2000|p=44}} This culture shift away from traditional religion was not widely accepted. After his death, Akhenaten's monuments were dismantled and hidden, his statues were destroyed, and his name [[Damnatio memoriae|excluded]] from [[regnal list|lists of rulers]] compiled by later pharaohs.{{sfn|Manniche|2010|p=ix}} Traditional religious practice was gradually restored, notably under his close successor [[Tutankhamun]], who changed his name from Tutankhaten early in his reign.{{sfn|Zaki|2008|p=19}} When some dozen years later rulers without clear rights of succession from the Eighteenth Dynasty founded a [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|new dynasty]], they discredited Akhenaten and his immediate successors, referring to Akhenaten himself as "the enemy" or "that criminal" in archival records.{{sfn|Gardiner|1905|p=11}}{{sfn|Trigger|Kemp|O'Connor|Lloyd|2001|pp=186–187}}

Akhenaten was all but lost to history until the late 19th century discovery of [[Amarna]], or Akhetaten, the new capital city he built for the worship of Aten.{{sfn|Hornung|1992|pp=43–44}} Furthermore, in 1907, a mummy that could be Akhenaten's was unearthed from the tomb [[KV55]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]] by [[Edward R. Ayrton]]. [[Genetic testing]] has determined that the man buried in KV55 was Tutankhamun's father,{{sfn|Hawass|Gad|Somaia|Khairat|2010}} but its identification as Akhenaten has since been questioned.{{sfn|Strouhal|2010|pp=97–112}}{{sfn|Duhig|2010|p=114}}{{sfn|Marchant|2011|pp=404–06}}{{sfn|Lorenzen|Willerslev|2010}}{{sfn|Bickerstaffe|2010}}

Akhenaten's rediscovery and [[Flinders Petrie]]'s early excavations at Amarna sparked great public interest in the pharaoh and his queen [[Nefertiti]]. He has been described as "enigmatic", "mysterious", "revolutionary", "the greatest idealist of the world", and "the first individual in history", but also as a "heretic", "fanatic", "possibly insane", and "mad".{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=13–15}}{{sfn|Spence|2011}}{{sfn|Sooke|2014}}{{sfn|Hessler|2017}}{{sfn|Silverman|Wegner|Wegner|2006|pp=185–188}} The interest comes from his connection with [[Tutankhamun]], the unique style and high quality of the pictorial [[Amarna art|arts he patronized]], and ongoing interest in [[Atenism|the religion]] he attempted to establish.

== Family ==

[[File:Relief depicting Akhenaton and Nefertiti with three of their daughters under the rays of Aton 01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Akhenaten, [[Nefertiti]] and their children]]

{{See also|Family tree of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}

The future Akhenaten was born Amenhotep, a younger son of pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and his [[Great Royal Wife|principal wife]] [[Tiye]]. [[Crown prince]] [[Thutmose (prince)|Thutmose]], Amenhotep III and Tiye's eldest son and Akhenaten's brother, was recognized as Amenhotep III's heir. Akhenaten also had four or five sisters, [[Sitamun]], [[Henuttaneb]], [[Iset (daughter of Amenhotep III)|Iset]] or Isis, [[Nebetah]], and possibly [[Beketaten]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=37–39}} After Thutmose died relatively young, perhaps around his father's thirtieth regnal year, Akhenaten was next in line for Egypt's throne.{{sfn|Dodson|2018|p=6}}

Akhenaten was married to [[Nefertiti]], his [[Great Royal Wife]]; the exact timing of their marriage is unknown, but evidence from the pharaoh's building projects suggests that this happened either shortly before or after Akhenaten took the throne.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2005}} Egyptologist [[Dimitri Laboury]] suggested that the marriage took place in Akhenaten's fourth regnal year.{{sfn|Laboury|2010|pp=62, 224}} A secondary wife of Akhenaten named [[Kiya]] is also known from inscriptions. Some have theorized that she gained her importance as the mother of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Smenkhkare]], or both. Some Egyptologists, such as [[William J. Murnane|William Murnane]], proposed that Kiya is a colloqial name of the [[Mitanni]] princess [[Tadukhipa]], daughter of the Mitanni king [[Tushratta]], widow of Amenhotep III, and later wife of Akhenaten.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=124}}{{sfn|Murnane|1995|pp=9, 90–93, 210–211}} Akhenaten's other attested consorts are the daughter of [[Šatiya]], ruler of [[Enišasi]], and a daughter of [[Burna-Buriash II]], king of [[Babylonia]].{{sfn|Grajetzki|2005}}

[[File:Spaziergang_im_Garten_Amarna_Berlin.jpg|thumb|left|This limestone relief of a royal couple in the Amarna style have variously been attributed as Akhenaten and [[Nefertiti]], [[Smenkhkare]] and [[Meritaten]], or [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Ankhesenamun]].]]

Akhenaten could have had seven or eight children based on inscriptions. Egyptologists are fairly certain about his six daughters, who are well attested in contemporary depictions.{{sfn|Dodson|2012|p=1}} Among his six daughters, [[Meritaten]] was born in regnal year one or five; [[Meketaten]] in year four or six; [[Ankhesenpaaten]], later queen of [[Tutankhamun]], before year five or eight; [[Neferneferuaten Tasherit]] in year eight or nine; [[Neferneferure]] in year nine or ten; and [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]] in year ten or eleven.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=78}}{{sfn|Laboury|2010|pp=314–322}}{{sfn|Dodson|2009|pp=41–42}}{{sfn|University College London|2001}} Tutankhamun, born Tutankhaten, was most likely Akhenaten's son, too, with Nefertiti or another wife.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=262}}{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=174–175}} There is less certainty around Akhenaten's relationship with [[Smenkhkare]], his coregent or successor,{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=38–39}} who could have been Akhenaten's eldest son with an unknown wife, and later married Meritaten, his own sister.{{sfn|Dodson|2009|pp=84–87}}

Some historians, such as [[Edward F. Wente|Edward Wente]] and [[James Peter Allen|James Allen]], have proposed that Akhenaten took some of his daughters as wives or sexual consorts to father a male heir.{{sfn|Harris|Wente|1980|pp=137–140}}{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=15–18}} While this is debated, some historical parallels exist: Akhenaten's father Amenhotep III married his daughter Sitamun, while [[Ramesses II]] married two or more of his daughters, even though their marriages might simply have been ceremonial.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=257}}{{sfn|Robins|1993|pp=21–27}} In Akhenaten's case, Meritaten, for example, recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare, is listed on a box from Tutankhamun's tomb alongside pharaohs Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife. Additionally, [[Amarna letters|letters written to Akhenaten]] from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as "mistress of the house." Egyptologists in the early 20th century also believed that Akhenaten could have fathered a child with his daughter Meketaten. Meketaten's death, at perhaps age ten to twelve, is recorded in the [[Royal Wadi and tombs|royal tombs at Akhetaten]] from around regnal years thirteen or fourteen. Early Egyptologists attributed her death possibly to childbirth, because of a depiction of an infant in her tomb. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption had been that Akhenaten was the father. [[Aidan Dodson]] believed this to be unlikely, as no Egyptian tomb has been found that mentions or alludes to the cause of death of the tomb owner, and Jacobus van Dijk proposed that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten's [[ancient Egyptian conception of the soul|soul]].{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=19–21}} Finally, various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten's daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten. The revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit ("junior") and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. Some view this to indicate that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally filled by Kiya's child.{{sfn|Harris|Wente|1980|pp=137–140}}{{sfn|Dodson|Hilton|2004|p=154}}

== Early life ==

[[File:Berlin_Neues_Museum_-_relief_du_prince_Thoutmosis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Akhenaten's elder brother [[Thutmose (prince)|Thutmose]], shown in his role as [[High Priest of Ptah]]. Akhenaten became heir to the throne after Thutmose died during their father's reign.]]

Egyptologists know very little about Akhenaten's life as prince. [[Donald B. Redford]] dated his birth before his father Amenhotep III's 25th regnal year, {{circa|1363–1361 BC}}, based on the birth of Akhenaten's first daughter, which likely happened fairly early in his own reign.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=190}}{{sfn|Redford|2013|p=13}} The only mention of his name, as "the King's Son Amenhotep," was found on a wine docket at Amenhotep III's [[Malkata]] palace, where some historians suggested Akhenaten was born. Others contended that he was born at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], where growing up he was influenced by the worship of the [[solar deity|sun god]] [[Ra]] practiced at nearby [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=40–41}} Redford and [[James K. Hoffmeier]] stated, however, that Ra's cult was so widespread and established throughout Egypt that Akhenaten could have been influenced by solar worship even if he did not grow up around Heliopolis.{{sfn|Redford|1984|pp=57–58}}{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|p=65}}

Some historians have tried to determine who was Akhenaten's tutor during his youth, and have proposed scribes [[TT226|Heqareshu]] or [[Meryre II]], the royal tutor Amenemotep, or the [[vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] [[Aperel]].{{sfn|Laboury|2010|p=81}} The only person we know for certain served the prince was [[Parennefer]], whose [[Amarna Tomb 7|tomb]] mentions this fact.{{sfn|Murnane|1995|p=78}}

Egyptologist [[Cyril Aldred]] suggested that prince Amenhotep might have been a [[High Priest of Ptah]] in Memphis, although no evidence supporting this had been found.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|p=64}} It is known that Amenhotep's brother, [[Thutmose (prince)|crown prince Thutmose]], served in this role before he died. If Amenhotep inherited his brother's roles in preparation for his accession to the throne, he might have become a high priest in Thutmose's stead. Aldred proposed that Akhenaten's unusual artistic inclinations might have been formed during his time serving Ptah, who was the patron god of craftsmen, and whose high priest were sometimes referred to as "The Greatest of the Directors of Craftsmanship."{{sfn|Aldred|1991|p=259}}

== Reign ==
=== Coregency with Amenhotep III ===

There is much controversy around whether Amenhotep IV succeeded to the throne on the death of his father Amenhotep III or whether there was a coregency, lasting perhaps as long as 12 years. Eric Cline, [[Nicholas Reeves]], [[Peter Dorman]], and other scholars have argued strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favor of either no coregency or a brief one lasting at most two years.{{sfn|Reeves|2019|p=77}} [[Donald Redford]], [[William J. Murnane|William Murnane]], [[Alan Gardiner]], and Lawrence Berman contested the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.{{sfn|Berman|2004|p=23}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2000|p=44}}

Most recently, in 2014, archeologists found both pharaohs' names inscribed on the wall of the [[Luxor]] tomb of vizier [[Amenhotep-Huy]]. The [[Ministry of Antiquities (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities]] called this "conclusive evidence" that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least eight years, based on the dating of the tomb.{{sfn|Martín Valentín|Bedman|2014}} This conclusion was called into question by other Egyptologists, according to whom the inscription only means that construction on Amenhotep-Huy's tomb commenced during Amenhotep III's reign and concluded under Akhenaten's, and Amenhotep-Huy thus simply wanted to pay his respects to both rulers.{{sfn|Brand|2020|pp=63–64}}

=== Early reign as Amenhotep IV ===

[[File:Akenatón Berlín 05.JPG|thumb|right|x300px|Wooden standing statue of Akhenaten. Currently in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin]].]]

Akhenaten took Egypt's throne as Amenhotep IV, most likely in 1353{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=45}} or 1351 BC.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=190}} It is unknown how old Amenhotep IV was when he did this; estimates range from 10 to 23.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=46}} He was most likely crowned in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], or perhaps [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] or [[Armant, Egypt|Armant]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=46}}

The beginning of Amenhotep IV's reign followed established pharaonic traditions. He did not immediately start redirecting worship toward the Aten and distancing himself from other gods. Egyptologist [[Donald B. Redford]] believed this implied that Amenhotep IV's eventual religious policies were not conceived of before his reign, and he did not follow a pre-established plan or program. Redford pointed to three pieces of evidence to support this. First, surving inscriptions show Amenhotep IV worshipping several different gods, including [[Atum]], [[Osiris]], [[Anubis]], [[Nekhbet]], [[Hathor]],{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=48}} and the [[Eye of Ra]], and texts from this era refer to "the gods" and "every god and every goddess." Moreover, the [[High Priest of Amun]] was still active in the fourth year of Amenhotep IV's reign.{{sfn|Aldred|1991|pp=259–268}} Second, even though he later moved his capital from Thebes to [[Amarna|Akhetaten]], his initial royal titulary honored Thebes (for example, his [[nomen (Ancient Egypt)|nomen]] was "Amenhotep, god-ruler of Thebes"), and recognizing its importance, he called Thebes "Southern Heliopolis, the first great (seat) of Re (or) the Disc." Third, while his initial building program sought to build new places of worship to the Aten, he did not yet destroy temples to the other gods.{{sfn|Redford|2013|pp=13–14}} Amenhotep IV continued his father's construction projects at [[Karnak]]'s [[Precinct of Amun-Re]]. For example, he decorated the walls of the precinct's [[Precinct of Amun-Re#Third Pylon|Third Pylon]] with images of himself worshipping [[Ra|Ra-Horakhty]], portrayed in the god's traditional form of a falcon-headed man.{{sfn|Dodson|2014|pp=156–160}}

Tombs built or completed early in Amenhotep IV's reign, such as those of [[TT192|Kheruef]], [[Ramose (TT55)|Ramose]], and [[Parennefer]], show the pharaoh in the traditional artistic style.{{sfn|Nims|1973|pp=186–187}} In Ramose's tomb, Amenhotep IV appears on the west wall, seated on a throne, with Ramose appearing before the pharaoh. On the other side of the doorway, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are shown in the window of appearances, with the Aten depicted as the sun disc. In Parennefer's tomb, Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti are seated on a throne with the sun disc depicted over the pharaoh and his queen.{{sfn|Nims|1973|pp=186–187}}

Early in his reign, Amenhotep IV ordered the construction of temples or shrines to the Aten in several cities across the country, such as [[Bubastis]], Tell el-Borg, [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], Memphis, [[Nekhen]], [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]], and [[Kerma]].{{sfn|Redford|2013|p=19}} Amenhotep IV also ordered the construction of a large temple complex dedicated to the Aten at Karnak in Thebes, northeast of the parts of the Karnak complex dedicated to Amun. The [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Aten temple complex]], collectively known as the Per Aten ("House of the Aten"), consisted of several temples whose names survive: the Gempaaten ("The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten"), the Hwt benben ("House or Temple of the [[Benben]]"), the Rud-menu ("Enduring of monuments for Aten forever"), the Teni-menu ("Exalted are the monuments of the Aten forever"), and the Sekhen Aten ("booth of Aten").{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|pp=98, 101, 105–106}}

Amenhotep IV organized a [[Sed festival]] around regnal year two or three. Sed festivals were ritual rejuvenations of an aging pharaoh. They usually took place for the first time around the thirtieth year of a pharaoh's reign, then after every three or so years. Egyptologists only speculate as to why Amenhotep IV organized a Sed festival when he was likely still in his early twenties. Some historians see it as evidence for Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV's coregency, and believe that Amenhotep IV's Sed festival coincided with one of his father's celebrations. Others speculate that Amenhotep IV chose to hold his festival three years after his father's death, aiming to proclaim his rule a continuation of his father's reign. Yet others believe that the festival was held to honor the Aten on whose behalf the pharaoh ruled Egypt, or, as Amenhotep III was considered to have become one with the Aten following his death, the Sed festival honored both the pharaoh and the god at the same time. It is also possible that the purpose of the ceremony was to figuratively fill Amenhotep IV with strength before his great enterprise: the introduction of the Aten cult and the founding of the new capital [[Amarna|Akhetaten]]. Regardless of the celebration's aim, Egyptologists concluded that during the festivities, Amenhotep IV only made offerings to the Aten rather than the many gods and goddesses, as customary.{{sfn|Aldred|1991|p=259}}{{sfn|Desroches-Noblecourt|1963|pp=144–145}}{{sfn|Gohary|1992|pp=29–39, 167–169}}

Among the discovered documents that refer to Akhenaten as Amenhotep IV the latest in his reign are two copies of a letter to the pharaoh from [[Ipy (noble)|Ipy]], the [[high steward (Ancient Egypt)|high steward]] of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. These letters, found in [[Abu Gorab|Gurob]] and informing the pharaoh that the royal estates in Memphis are "in good order" and the temple of [[Ptah]] is "prosperous and flourishing," are dated to regnal year five, day nineteen of the [[Season of the Emergence|growing season's]] [[Paremhat|third month]]. About a month later, day thirteen of the growing season's [[Parmouti|fourth month]], one of the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|boundary stela at Akhetaten]] already had the name Akhenaten carved on it, implying that Akhenaten changed his name between the two inscriptions.{{sfn|Murnane|1995|pp=50–51}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=83–85}}{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|p=166}}{{sfn|Murnane|Van Siclen III|2011|p=150}}

=== Name change ===

In regnal year five, Amenhotep IV decided to show his devotion to the Aten by changing his [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|royal titulary]]. No longer would he be known as Amenhotep IV and be associated with the god [[Amun]], but rather he would completely shift his focus to the Aten. Egyptologists debate the exact meaning of Akhenaten, his new [[nomen (Ancient Egypt)|personal name]]. The word "akh" ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜣḫ|ꜣḫ]]}}) could have different translations, such as "satisfied," "effective spirit," or "serviceable to," and thus Akhenaten's name could be translated to mean "Aten is satisfied," "Effective spirit of the Aten," or "Serviceable to the Aten," respectively.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=85–87}} Gertie Englund and [[Florence Friedman]] arrived at the translation "Effective for the Aten" by analyzing contemporary texts and inscriptions, in which Akhenaten often described himself as being "effective for" the sun disc. Englund and Friedman concluded that the frequency with which Akhenaten used this term likely means that his own name meant "Effective for the Aten."{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=85–87}}

Some historians, such as [[William F. Albright]], Edel Elmar, and Gerhard Fecht, proposed that Akhenaten's name is misspelled and mispronounced. These historians believe "Aten" should rather be "Jāti," thus rendering the pharaoh's name Akhenjāti or Aḫanjāti (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|ə|ˈ|n|j|ɑː|t|ɪ}}), as it could have been pronounced in Ancient Egypt.{{sfn|Fecht|1960|p=89}}{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=50}}

=== Founding Amarna ===

[[File:Amarna boundary stela U 01.JPG|thumb|One of the stele marking the boundary of the new capital Akhetaten.]]

{{main|Amarna}}

Around the same time he changed his royal titulary, on the thirteenth day of the [[Season of the Emergence|growing season's]] [[Parmouti|fourth month]], Akhenaten decreed that a new capital city be built: [[Amarna|Akhetaten]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜣḫt-jtn|ꜣḫt-jtn]]}}, meaning "Horizon of the Aten"), better known today as Amarna. The event Egyptologists know the most about during Akhenaten's life are connected with founding Akhetaten, as several so-called [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|boundary stelae]] were found around the city to mark its boundary.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=85}} The pharaoh chose a site about halfway between [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], the capital at the time, and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], on the east bank of the [[Nile]], where a [[Royal Wadi and tombs|wadi]] and a natural dip in the surrounding cliffs form a silhouette similar to the "[[Akhet (hieroglyph)|horizon]]" [[hieroglyph]]. Additionally, the site had previously been uninhabited. According to inscriptions on one boundary stela, the site was appropriate for Aten's city for "not being the property of a god, nor being the property of a goddess, nor being the property of a ruler, nor being the property of a female ruler, nor being the property of any people able to lay claim to it."{{sfn|Dodson|2014|pp=180–185}}

Historians do not know for certain why Akhenaten established a new capital and left Thebes, the old capital. The boundary stelae detailing Akhetaten's founding is damaged where it likely explained the pharaoh's motives for the move. Surviving parts claim what happened to Akhenaten was "worse than those that I heard" previously in his reign and worse than those "heard by any kings who assumed the [[Hedjet|White Crown]]," and alludes to "offensive" speech against the Aten. Egyptologists believe that Akhenaten could be referring to conflict with the priesthood and followers of [[Amun]], the [[tutelary deity|patron god]] of Thebes. The great temples of Amun, such as [[Karnak]], were all located in Thebes and the priests there achieved significant power earlier in the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], especially under [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], thanks to pharaohs offering large amounts of Egypt's growing wealth to the cult of Amun; historians, such as [[Donald B. Redford]], therefore posited that by moving to a new capital, Akhenaten may have been trying to break with Amun's priests and the god.{{sfn|Dodson|2014|pp=186–188}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=85–90}}{{sfn|Redford|2013|pp=9–10, 24–26}}

[[File:Gempaaten talatats.jpg|thumb|left|[[Talatat]] blocks from Akhenaten's Aten temple in [[Karnak]]]]

Akhetaten was a planned city with the [[Great Temple of the Aten]], [[Small Aten Temple]], royal residences, [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh|records office]], and government buildings in the city center. Some of these buildings, such as the Aten temples, were ordered to be built by Akhenaten on the boundary stela decreeing the city's founding.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=85–90}}{{sfn|Aldred|1991|pp=269–270}}{{sfn|Breasted|2001|pp=390–400}}

The city was built quickly, thanks to a new construction method that used substantially smaller building blocks than under previous pharaohs. These blocks, called [[talatat]]s, measured {{frac|1|2}} by {{frac|1|2}} by 1 [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|ancient Egyptian cubits]] ({{circa|27 by 27 by 54&nbsp;cm}}), and because of the smaller weight and standardized size, using them during constructions was more efficient than using heavy building blocks of varying sizes.{{sfn|Arnold|2003|p=238}}{{sfn|Shaw|2003|p=274}} By regnal year eight, Akhetaten reached a state where it could be occupied by the royal family. Only his most loyal subjects followed Akhenaten and his family to the new city. While the city continued to be built, in years five through eight, construction work began to stop in Thebes. The Theban Aten temples that had begun were abandoned, and a village of those working on [[Valley of the Kings]] tombs was relocated to the workers' village at Akhetaten. However, construction work continued in the rest of the country, as larger cult centers, such as [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] and Memphis, also had temples built for Aton.{{sfn|Aldred|1991|pp=269–273}}{{sfn|Shaw|2003|pp=293–297}}

{{further|Amarna letters}}

The [[Amarna letters]] have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. The letters are a cache of 382 diplomatic texts and literary and educational materials discovered between 1887 and 1979{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=xiii, xv}} and named after Amarna, the modern name for Akhenaten's capital Akhetaten. The diplomatic correspondence comprises [[clay tablet]] messages between Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun, various subjects through Egyptian military outposts, rulers of [[vassal state]]s, and the foreign rulers of [[Babylonia]], [[Assyria]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], [[Canaan]], [[Alashiya]], [[Arzawa]], [[Mitanni]], and the [[Hittites]].{{sfn|Moran|1992|p=xvi}}

The Amarna letters portray the international situation in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] that Akhenaten inherited from his predecessors. The kingdom's influence and military might increased greatly before starting to wane in the 200 years preceding Akhenaten's reign, following the expulsion of the [[Hyksos]] from [[Lower Egypt]] at the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period]]. Egypt's power reached new heights under [[Thutmose III]], who ruled approximately 100 years before Akhenaten and led several successful military campaigns into Nubia and Syria. Egypt's expansion led to confrontation with the Mitanni, but this rivalry ended with the two nations becoming allies. Amenhotep III aimed to maintain the balance of power through marriages{{snd}}such as his marriage to [[Tadukhipa]], daughter of the Mitanni king [[Tushratta]]{{snd}}and vassal states. Yet under Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, Egypt was unable or unwilling to oppose the rise of the Hittites around Syria. The pharaohs seemed to eschew military confrontation at a time when the balance of power between Egypt's neighbors and rivals was shifting, and the Hittites, a confrontational state, overtook the Mitanni in influence.{{sfn|Aldred|1991|loc=chpt. 11}}{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=87–89}}{{sfn|Drioton|Vandier|1952|pp=411–414}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=297, 314}}

Early in his reign, Akhenaten had conflicts with [[Tushratta]], the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price that Tushratta received for letting his daughter [[Tadukhepa]] marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten. An Amarna letter preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:

<blockquote>
I...asked your father [[Amenhotep III|Mimmureya]] for statues of solid cast gold, [...] and your father said, 'Don't talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.' Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. [...] But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. [...] May my brother send me much gold. [...] In my brother's country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honor me.{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=87—89}}
</blockquote>

While Akhenaten was certainly not a close friend of Tushratta, he was evidently concerned at the expanding power of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] Empire under its powerful ruler [[Suppiluliuma I]]. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in [[Canaan]], particularly in a struggle for power between [[Labaya]] of [[Shechem]] and [[Abdi-Heba]] of [[Jerusalem]], which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching [[Medjay]] troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal [[Rib-Hadda]] of [[Byblos]]—whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] under [[Abdi-Ashirta]] and later [[Aziru]], son of Abdi-Ashirta—despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: "You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124.{{sfn|Moran|1992|p=203}} What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire.{{sfn|Ross|1999|pp=30–35}} Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother [[Ili-Rapih|Ilirabih]] is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.{{sfn|Bryce|1998|p=186}}

Several Egyptologists in the late 19th and 20th centuries interpretated the Amarna letters to mean that Akhenaten neglected foreign policy and Egypt's foreign territories in favor of his internal reforms. For example, [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|Henry Hall]] believed Akhenaten "succeeded by his obstinate doctrinaire love of peace in causing far more misery in his world than half a dozen elderly militarists could have done,"{{sfn|Hall|1921|pp=42–43}} while [[James Henry Breasted]] said Akhenaten "was not ﬁt to cope with a situation demanding an aggressive man of affairs and a skilled military leader."{{sfn|Breasted|1909|p=355}} Others noted that the Amarna letters counter the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. For example, [[N. de Garis Davies|Norman de Garis Davies]] praised Akhenaten's emphasis on diplomacy over war, while [[James Baikie]] said that the fact "that there is no evidence of revolt within the borders of Egypt itself during the whole reign is surely ample proof that there was no such abandonment of his royal duties on the part of Akhenaten as has been assumed."{{sfn|Davies|1903–1908|loc=part II. p. 42}}{{sfn|Baikie|1926|p=269}} Indeed, several letters from Egyptian vassals notified the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions, implying that the pharaoh sent such instructions:

<blockquote>To the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky: Message of [[Yapahu]], the ruler of [[Gezer|Gazru]], your servant, the dirt at your feet. I indeed prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky, 7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back. I am indeed guarding the place of the king, my lord, the Sun of the sky, where I am, and all the things the king, my lord, has written me, I am indeed carrying out—everything! Who am I, a dog, and what is my house, and what is my [...], and what is anything I have, that the orders of the king, my lord, the Sun from the sky, should not obey constantly?{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=368–369}}</blockquote>

The Amarna letters also show that vassal states were told repeatedly to expect the arrival of the Egyptian military on their lands, and provide evidence that these troops were dispatched and arrived at their destination. Dozens of letters detail that Akhenaten{{snd}}and Amenhotep III{{snd}}sent Egyptian and Nubian troops, armies, archers, chariots, horses, and ships.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=316–317}}

Additionally, when Rib-Hadda was killed at the instigation of Aziru,{{sfn|Bryce|1998|p=186}} Akhenaten sent an angry letter to Aziru containing a barely veiled accusation of outright treachery on the latter's part.{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=248–250}} Akhenaten wrote:

<blockquote>
[Y]ou acted delinquently by taking [Rib-Hadda] whose brother had cast him away at the gate, from his city. He was residing in [[Sidon]] and, following your own judgment, you gave him to [some] mayors. Were you ignorant of the treacherousness of the men? If you really are the king's servant, why did you not denounce him before the king, your lord, saying, "This mayor has written to me saying, 'Take me to yourself and get me into my city'"? And if you did act loyally, still all the things you wrote were not true. In fact, the king has reflected on them as follows, "Everything you have said is not friendly."

Now the king has heard as follows, "You are at peace with the ruler of Qidsa ([[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]). The two of you take food and strong drink together." And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler whom the king is fighting? And even if you did act loyally, you considered your own judgment, and his judgment did not count. You have paid no attention to the things that you did earlier. What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? [...] [I]f you plot evil, treacherous things, then you, together with your entire family, shall die by the axe of the king. So perform your service for the king, your lord, and you will live. You yourself know that the king does not fail when he rages against all of Canaan. And when you wrote saying, 'May the king, my Lord, give me leave this year, and then I will go next year to the king, my Lord. If this is impossible, I will send my son in my place'—the king, your lord, let you off this year in accordance with what you said. Come yourself, or send your son [now], and you will see the king at whose sight all lands live.{{sfn|Moran|1992|pp=248–249}}
</blockquote>

This letter shows that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of his vassals in Canaan and Syria. Akhenaten commanded Aziru to come to Egypt and proceeded to detain him there for at least one year. In the end, Akhenaten was forced to release Aziru back to his homeland when the Hittites advanced southwards into [[Amqu|Amki]], thereby threatening Egypt's series of Asiatic vassal states, including Amurru.{{sfn|Bryce|1998|p=188}} Sometime after his return to Amurru, Aziru defected to the Hittite side with his kingdom.{{sfn|Bryce|1998|p=189}} While it is known from an Amarna letter by Rib-Hadda that the Hittites "seized all the countries that were vassals of the king of Mitanni."{{sfn|Moran|1992|p=145}} Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt's control over the core of her Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful Hittite Empire of [[Suppiluliuma I]]. Only the Egyptian border province of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] in Syria around the Orontes river was permanently lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites.

Only one military campaign is known for certain under Akhenaten's reign. In his second or twelfth year,{{sfn|Murnane|1995|pp=55–56}} Akhenaten ordered his [[Viceroy of Kush]] [[Tuthmose (Viceroy of Kush)|Tuthmose]] to lead a military expedition to quell a rebellion and raids on settlements on the Nile by Nubian nomadic tribes. The victory was commemorated on two stelae, one discovered at [[Amada]] and another at [[Buhen]]. Egyptologists differ on the size of the campaign: [[Wolfgang Helck]] considered it a small-scale police operation, while [[Alan Schulman]] considered it a "war of major proportions."{{sfn|Darnell|Manassa|2007|pp=118–119}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=323–324}}{{sfn|Schulman|1982}}

Other Egyptologists suggested that Akhenaten could have waged war in Syria or the [[Levant]], possibly against the Hittites. Cyril Aldred, based on Amarna letters describing Egyptian troop movements, proposed that Akhenaten launched an unsuccessful war around the city of [[Gezer]], while Marc Gabolde argued for an unsuccessful campaign around [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. Either of these could be the campaign referred to on Tutankhamun's Restoration Stela: "if an army was sent to [[Djahy]] [southern Canaan and Syria] to broaden the boundaries of Egypt, no success of their cause came to pass."{{sfn|Murnane|1995|p=99}}{{sfn|Aldred|1968|p=241}}{{sfn|Gabolde|1998|pp=195–205}} [[John Coleman Darnell]] and [[Colleen Darnell|Colleen Manassa]] also argued that Akhenaten fought with the Hittites for control of Kadesh, but was unsuccessful; the city was not recaptured until 60–70&nbsp;years later, under [[Seti I]].{{sfn|Darnell|Manassa|2007|pp=172–178}}

=== Later years ===

[[File:Foreign tributes.png|thumb|right|In regnal year twelve, Akhenaten received tributes and offerings from allied countries and vassal states at [[Amarna|Akhetaten]], as depicted in the [[tomb of Meryra II]].]]

Egyptologists know little about the last five years of Akhenaten's reign, beginning in {{circa|1341{{sfn|Britannica.com|2012}} or 1339&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|von Beckerath|1997|p=190}}}} These years are poorly attested and only a few pieces of contemporary evidence survive; the lack of clarity makes reconstructing the latter part of the pharaoh's reign "a daunting task" and a controversial and contested topic of discussion among Egyptologists.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=346}} Among the newest pieces of evidence is an inscription discovered in 2012 at a limestone quarry in [[Deir el-Bersha]], just north of Akhetaten, from the pharaoh's sixteenth regnal year. The text refers to a building project in Amarna and establishes that Akhenaten and Nefertiti were still a royal couple just a year before Akhenaten's death.{{sfn|Van der Perre|2012|pp=195–197}}{{sfn|Van der Perre|2014|pp=67–108}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=346–364}}

Before the 2012 discovery of the Deir el-Bersha inscription, the last known fixed-date event in Akhenaten's reign was a royal reception in regnal year twelve, in which the pharaoh and the royal family received tributes and offerings from allied countries and vassal states at Akhetaten. Inscriptions show tributes from [[Nubia]], the [[Land of Punt]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], the [[Hittites|Kingdom of Hattusa]], the islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]. Egyptologists, such as [[Aidan Dodson]], consider this year twelve celebration to be the [[zenith]] of Akhenaten's reign.{{sfn|Dodson|2009|pp=39–41}} Thanks to reliefs in the [[tomb of Meryra II|tomb]] of courtier [[Meryre II]], historians know that the royal family, Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their six daughters, were present at the royal reception in full.{{sfn|Dodson|2009|pp=39–41}} However, historians are uncertain about the reasons for the reception. Possibilities include the celebration of the marriage of future pharaoh [[Ay]] to [[Tey]], celebration of Akhenaten's twelve years on the throne, the summons of king [[Aziru]] of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] to Egypt, a military victory at [[Sumur (Levant)|Sumur]] in the [[Levant]], a successful military campaign in Nubia,{{sfn|Darnell|Manassa|2007|p=127}} Nefertiti's ascendancy to the throne as coregent, or the completion of the new capital city Akhetaten.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=141}}

Following year twelve, [[Donald B. Redford]] and other Egyptologists proposed that Egypt was struck by an [[epidemic]], most likely a [[Plague (disease)|plague]].{{sfn|Redford|1984|pp=185–192}} Contemporary evidence suggests that a plague ravaged through the Middle East around this time,{{sfn|Braverman|Redford|Mackowiak|2009|p=557}} and historians suggested that ambassadors and delegations arriving to Akhenaten's year twelve reception might have brought the disease to Egypt.{{sfn|Dodson|2009|p=49}} Alternatively, letters from the [[Hattians]] suggested that the epidemic originated in Egypt and was carried throughout the Middle East by Egyptian prisoners of war.{{sfn|Laroche|1971|p=378}} Regardless of its origin, the epidemic might account for several deaths in the royal family that occurred in the last five years of Akhenaten's reign, including those of his daughters [[Meketaten]], [[Neferneferure]], and [[Setepenre (princess)|Setepenre]].{{sfn|Gabolde|2011}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=354, 376}}

=== Coregency with Smenkhkare or Nefertiti ===

Akhenaten could have ruled together with [[Smenkhkare]] and [[Nefertiti]] for several years before his death.{{sfn|Dodson|2014|p=144}}{{sfn|Tyldesley|1998|pp=160–175}} Based on depictions and artifacts from the tombs of [[Meryre II]] and Tutankhamun, Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten's coregent by regnal year thirteen or fourteen, but died a year or two later. Nefertiti might not have assumed the role of coregent until after year sixteen, when a stela still mentions her as Akhenaten's [[Great Royal Wife]]. While Nefertiti's familial relationship with Akhenaten is known, whether Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were related by blood is unclear. Smenkhkare could have been Akhenaten's son or brother, as the son of [[Amenhotep III]] with [[Tiye]] or [[Sitamun]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=337, 345}} Archeological evidence makes it clear, however, that Smenkhkare was married to [[Meritaten]], Akhenaten's eldest daughter.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=252}} For another, the so-called [[Coregency Stela]], found in a tomb at Akhetaten, might show queen [[Nefertiti]] as Akhenaten's coregent, but this is uncertain as stela was recarved to show the names of [[Ankhesenpaaten]] and [[Neferneferuaten]].{{sfn|Allen|1988|pp=117–126}} Egyptologist [[Aidan Dodson]] proposed that both Smenkhkare and Neferiti were Akhenaten's coregents to ensure the Amarna family's continued rule when Egypt was confronted with an epidemic. Dodson suggested that the two were chosen to rule as Tutankhaten's coregent in case Akhenaten died and Tutankhaten took the throne at a young age, or rule in Tutankhaten's stead if the prince also died in the epidemic.{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=38–39}}

=== Death and burial ===

{{Further|Amarna succession|KV55}}
[[File:Sarcophage Akhénaton.JPG|thumb|left|Akhenaten's [[sarcophagus]] reconstituted from pieces discovered in his original tomb in [[Amarna]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]
[[File:KV55 sarcophagus (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|upright|The desecrated royal coffin found in Tomb KV55]]
Akhenaten died after seventeen years of rule and was initially buried in a [[Royal Tomb of Akhenaten|tomb]] in the [[Royal Wadi and tombs|Royal Wadi]] east of Akhetaten. The order to construct the tomb and to bury the pharaoh there was commemorated on one of the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|boundary stela]] delineating the capital's borders: "Let a tomb be made for me in the eastern mountain [of Akhetaten]. Let my burial be made in it, in the millions of jubilees which the Aten, my father, decreed for me."{{sfn|Kemp|2015|p=11}} In the years following the burial, Akhenaten's sarcophagus was destroyed and left in the Akhetaten necropolis; reconstructed in the 20th century, it is in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo as of 2019.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=365–371}} Despite leaving the sarcophagus behind, Akhenaten's mummy was removed from the royal tombs after Tutankhamun abandoned Akhetaten and returned to Thebes. It was most likely moved to tomb [[KV55]] in [[Valley of the Kings]] near Thebes.{{sfn|Dodson|2014|p=244}}{{sfn|Aldred|1968|pp=140–162}} This tomb was later desecrated, likely during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Ramesside period]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=411–412}}{{sfn|Dodson|2009|pp=144–145}}

Whether [[Smenkhkare]] also enjoyed a brief independent reign after Akhenaten is unclear.{{sfn|Allen|2009|pp=1–4}} If Smenkhkare outlived Akhenaten, and became sole pharaoh, he likely ruled Egypt for less than a year. The next successor was Nefertiti{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=251}} or Meritaten{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|pp=136–137}} ruling as [[Neferneferuaten]], reigning in Egypt for about two years.{{sfn|Hornung|Krauss|Warburton|2006|pp=207, 493}} She was, in turn, probably succeeded by Tutankhaten, with the country being administered by the [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] and future pharaoh [[Ay]].{{sfn|Ridley|2019}}

[[File:KV55 scull.jpg|thumb|upright|Profile view of the skull (thought to be Akhenaten) recovered from KV55]]
While Akhenaten{{snd}}along with Smenkhkare{{snd}}was most likely reburied in tomb KV55,{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=75–76}} the identification of the mummy found in that tomb as Akhenaten remains controversial to this day. The mummy has repeatedly been examined since its discovery in 1907. Most recently, Egyptologist [[Zahi Hawass]] led a team of researchers to examine the mummy using medical and [[Genetic testing|DNA analysis]], with the results published in 2010. In releasing their test results, Hawass' team identified the mummy as the father of [[Tutankhamun]] and thus "most probably" Akhenaten.{{sfn|Hawass|Gad|Somaia|Khairat|2010|p=644}} However, the study's [[validity (statistics)|validity]] has since been called into question.{{sfn|Strouhal|2010|pp=97–112}}{{sfn|Duhig|2010|p=114}}{{sfn|Marchant|2011|pp=404–06}}{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=16–17}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=409–411}} For instance, the discussion of the study results does not discuss that Tutankhamun's father and the father's siblings would share some [[genetic marker]]s; if Tutankhamun's father was Akhenaten, the DNA results could indicate that the mummy is a brother of Akhenaten, possibly Smenkhkare.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=409–411}}{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=17, 41}}

=== Legacy ===

With Akhenaten's death, the Aten cult he had founded fell out of favor: at first gradually, and then with decisive finality. Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign ({{circa|1332 BC}}) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten.{{sfn|Dodson|2014|pp=245–249}} Their successors then attempted to erase Akhenaten and his family from the historical record. During the reign of Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the first pharaoh after Akhenaten who was not related to Akhenaten's family, Egyptians started to destroy temples to the Aten and reuse the building blocks in new construction projects, including in temples for the newly restored god Amun. Horemheb's successor continued in this effort. [[Seti I]] restored monuments to Amun and had the god's name re-carved on inscriptions where it was removed by Akhenaten. Seti I also ordered that Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay be excised from official lists of pharaohs to make it appear that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. Under the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Ramessides]], who succeeded Seti I, Akhetaten was gradually destroyed and the building material reused across the country, such as in constructions at [[Hermopolis]]. The negative attitudes toward Akhenaten were illustrated by, for example,  inscriptions in the tomb of scribe [[Mose (scribe)|Mose]] (or Mes), where Akhenaten's reign is referred to as "the time of the enemy of Akhet-Aten."{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|pp=241–243}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=415}}{{sfn|Mark|2014}}

Some Egyptologists, such as [[Jacobus van Dijk]] and [[Jan Assmann]], believe that Akhenaten's reign and the Amarna period started a gradual decline in the Egyptian government's power and the pharaoh's standing in Egyptian's society and religious life.{{sfn|van Dijk|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=44}} Akhenaten's religious reforms subverted the relationship ordinary Egyptians had with their gods and their pharaoh, as well as the role the pharaoh played in the relationship between the people and the gods. Before the Amarna period, the pharaoh was the representative of the gods on Earth, the son of the god [[Ra]], and the living incarnation of the god [[Horus]], and maintained the [[Maat|divine order]] through rituals and offerings and by sustaining the temples of the gods.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=55}} Additionally, even though the pharaoh oversaw all religious activity, Egyptians could access their gods through [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Official rituals and festivals|regular public holidays, festivals, and processions]]. This led to a seemingly close connection between people and the gods, especially the [[tutelary deity|patron deity]] of their respective towns and cities.{{sfn|Reeves|2019|pp=139, 181}} Akhenaten, however, banned the worship of gods beside the Aten, including through festivals. He also declared himself to be the only one who could worship the Aten, and required that all religious devotion previously exhibited toward the gods be directed toward himself. After the Amarna period, during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] and [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasties]]{{snd}}{{circa|270 years}} following Akhenaten's death{{snd}}the relationship between the people, the pharaoh, and the gods did not simply revert to pre-Amarna practices and beliefs. The worship of all gods returned, but the relationship between the gods and the worshipers became more direct and personal,{{sfn|Breasted|1972|pp=344–370}} circumventing the pharaoh. Rather than acting through the pharaoh, Egyptians started to believe that the gods intervened directly in their lives, protecting the pious and punishing criminals.{{sfn|Ockinga|2001|pp=44–46}} The gods replaced the pharaoh as their own representatives on Earth. The god [[Amun]] once again became king among all gods.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2003|p=94}} According to van Dijk, "the king was no longer a god, but god himself had become king. Once Amun had been recognized as the true king, the political power of the earthly rulers could be reduced to a minimum."{{sfn|van Dijk|2003|p=307}} Consequently, the influence and power of the Amun priesthood continued to grow until the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]], {{circa|1077 BC}}, by which time the [[High Priest of Amun|High Priests of Amun]] effectively became rulers over parts of Egypt.{{sfn|van Dijk|2003|pp=303–307}}{{sfn|Assmann|2005|p=44}}{{sfn|Kitchen|1986|p=531}}

Akhenaten's reforms also had a longer-term impact on Ancient Egyptian language and hastened the spread of the spoken [[Late Egyptian language]] in official writings and speeches. Spoken and written Egyptian diverged early on in Egyptian history and stayed different over time.{{sfn|Baines|2007|p=156}} During the Amarna period, however, royal and religious texts and inscriptions, including the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|boundary stelae]] at Akhetaten or the [[Amarna letters]], started to regularly include more [[vernacular]] linguistic elements, such as the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] or a new [[possessive]] form. Even though they continued to diverge, these changes brought the spoken and written language closer to one another more systematically than under previous pharaohs of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. While Akhenaten's successors attempted to erase his religious, artistic, and even linguistic changes from history, the new linguistic elements remained a more common part of official texts following the Amarna years, starting with the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]].{{sfn|Goldwasser|1992|pp=448–450}}{{sfn|Gardiner|2015}}{{sfn|O'Connor|Silverman|1995|pp=77–79}}

Egyptians worshipped a sun god under several names, and solar worship had been growing in popularity even before Akhenaten, especially during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and the reign of Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=19}} During the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], the pharaoh started to be associated with the sun disc; for example, one inscriptions called the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] the "female [[Ra|Re]] shining like the Disc," while Amenhotep III was described as "he who rises over every foreign land, Nebmare, the dazzling disc."{{sfn|Sethe|1906–1909|pp=19, 332, 1569}} During the Eighteenth Dynasty, a religious hymn to the sun also appeared and became popular among Egyptians.{{sfn|Redford|2013|p=11}} However, Egyptologists question whether there is a causal relationship between the cult of the sun disc before Akhenaten and Akhenaten's religious policies.{{sfn|Redford|2013|p=11}}

=== Implementation and development ===

The implementation of Atenism can be traced through gradual changes in the [[Aten#Iconography|Aten's iconography]], and Egyptologist [[Donald B. Redford]] divided its development into three stages—earliest, intermediate, and final—in his studies of Akhenaten and Atenism. The earliest stage was associated with a growing number of depictions of the sun disc, though the disc is still seen resting on the head of the falcon-headed sun god [[Ra|Ra-Horakhty]], as the god was traditionally represented.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=33, 35}} The god was only "unique but not exclusive."{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=48}} The intermediate stage was marked by the elevation of the Aten above other gods and the appearance of [[cartouche]]s around his incribed name—cartouches traditionally indicating that the enclosed text is a royal name. The final stage had the Aten represented as a sun disc with sunrays like long arms terminating in human hands and the introduction of a new [[epithet]] for the god: "the great living Disc which is in jubilee, lord of heaven and earth."{{sfn|Redford|1976|pp=53–56}}

In the early years of his reign, Amenhotep IV lived at Thebes, the old capital city, and permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue. However, some signs already pointed to the growing importance of the Aten. For example, inscriptions in the Theban [[TT188|tomb of Parennefer]] from the early rule of Amenhotep IV state that "one measures the payments to every (other) god with a level measure, but for the Aten one measures so that it overflows," indicating a more favorable attitude to the cult of Aten than the other gods.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=48}} Additionally, near the [[Temple of Karnak]], Amun-Ra's great cult center, Amenhotep IV erected several massive buildings including temples to the [[Aten]]. The new Aten temples had no roof and the god was thus worshipped in the sunlight, under the open sky, rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=72–73}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=43}} The Theban buildings were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aton building here were revealed that preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.{{sfn|David|1998|p=125}}

One of the most important turning points in the early reign of Amenhotep IV is a speech given by the pharaoh at the beginning of his second regnal year. A copy of the speech survives on one of the [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] at the [[Karnak|Karnak Temple Complex]] near Thebes. Speaking to the royal court, scribes or the people, Amenhotep IV said that the gods were ineffective and had ceased their movements, and that their temples had collapsed. The pharaoh contrasted this with the only remaining god, the sun disc Aten, who continued to move and exist forever. Some Egyptologists, such as [[Donald B. Redford]], compared this speech to a proclamation or manifesto, which foreshadowed and explained the pharaoh's later religious reforms centered around the Aten.{{sfn|Aldred|1991|pp=261–262}}{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|pp=160–161}}{{sfn|Redford|2013|p=14}} In his speech, Akhenaten said:
<blockquote>The temples of the gods fallen to ruin, their bodies do not endure. Since the time of the ancestors, it is the wise man that knows these things. Behold, I, the king, am speaking so that I might inform you concerning the appearances of the gods. I know their temples, and I am versed in the writings, specficially, the inventory of their primeval bodies. And I have watched as they [the gods] have ceased their appearances, one after the other. All of them have stopped, except the god who gave birth to himself. And no one knows the mystery of how he performs his tasks. This god goes where he pleases and no one else knows his going. I approach him, the things which he has made. How exalted they are.{{sfn|Perry|2019|loc=03:59}}</blockquote>
[[File:Akhenaten as a Sphinx (Kestner Museum).jpg|thumb|left|Akhenaten depicted as a [[sphinx]] at [[Amarna]].]]

In Year Five of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt. The pharaoh "disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods{{nbsp}}... and diverted the income from these [other] cults to support the Aten." To emphasize his complete allegiance to the [[Aten]], the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:ꜣḫ-n-jtn|ꜣḫ-n-jtn]]}}, meaning "Effective for the [[Aten]]").{{sfn|David|1998|p=125}} Meanwhile, the Aten was becoming a king itself. Artists started to depict him with the trappings of pharaos, placing his name in [[cartouche]]s{{snd}}a rare, but not unique occurrence, as the names of Ra-Horakhty and Amun-Ra had also been found enclosed in cartouches{{snd}} and wearing a [[uraeus]], a symbol of kingship.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=34–36, 54}} The Aten may also have been the subject of Akhenaten's royal [[Sed festival]] early in the pharaoh's reign.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=39, 42, 54}} With Aten becoming a sole deity, Akhenaten started to proclaim himself as the only intermediary between Aten and his people and the subject of their personal worship and attention.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=55–57}}

By Year Nine of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=188}}{{sfn|Hart|2000|pp=42–46}} This emphasized the changes encouraged by the new regime, which included a ban on [[Cult image|images]], with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. All life on Earth depended on the Aten and the visible sunlight.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=55, 84}}{{sfn|Najovits|2004|p=125}} Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=211–213}} Aten's name was also written differently starting as early as Year Eight or as late as Year Fourteen, according to some historians.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=28, 173–174}} From "Living [[Ra#Relationship to other gods|Re-Horakhty]], who rejoices in the horizon in his name [[Shu (Egyptian god)|Shu]]-[[Ra|Re]] who is in Aten," the god's name changed to "Living Re, ruler of the horizon, who rejoices in his name of Re the father who has returned as Aten," removing the Aten's connection to Re-Horakhty and Shu, two other solar deities.{{sfn|Dodson|2009|p=38}} The Aten thus became an amalgamation that incorporated the attributes and beliefs around Re-Horakhty, universal sun god, and Shu, god of the sky and manifestation of the sunlight.{{sfn|Najovits|2004|pp=123–124}}

Akhenaten's Atenist beliefs are best distilled in the [[Great Hymn to the Aten]].{{sfn|Najovits|2004|p=128}} The hymn was discovered in the tomb of [[Ay]], one of Akhenaten's successors, though Egyptologists believe that it could have been composed by Akhenaten himself.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=129, 133}} The hymn celebrates the sun and daylight and recounts the dangers that abound when the sun sets. It tells of the Aten as a sole god and the creator of all life, who recreates life every day at sunrise, and on whom everything on Earth depends, including the natural world, people's lives, and even trade and commerce.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=128}} In one passage, the hymn declares: "O Sole God beside whom there is none! You made the earth as you wished, you alone."{{sfn|Najovits|2004|p=131}} The hymn also states that Akhenaten is the only intermediary between the god and Egyptians, and the only one who can understand the Aten: "You are in my heart, and there is none who knows you except your son."{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=128–129}}

=== Atenism and other gods ===

Some debate has focused on the extent to which Akhenaten forced his religious reforms on his people.{{sfn|Hornung|1992|p=47}} Certainly, as time drew on, he revised the names of the Aten, and other religious language, to increasingly exclude references to other gods; at some point, also, he embarked on the wide-scale erasure of traditional gods' names, especially those of [[Amun]].{{sfn|Allen|2005|pp=217–221}} Some of his court changed their names to remove them from the patronage of other gods and place them under that of Aten (or [[Ra]], with whom Akhenaten equated the Aten). Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose ("child of the moon god", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous [[Nefertiti Bust]] and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]] ("child of Thoth"). An overwhelmingly large number of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|pp=187–194}}

Archaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.{{sfn|Reeves|2019|pp=154–155}}

=== After Akhenaten ===

Following Akhenaten's death, Egypt gradually returned to its traditional [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, partly because of how closely associated the Aten became with Akhenaten.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=56}} Atenism likely stayed dominant through the reigns of Akhenaten's immediate successors, [[Smenkhkare]] and [[Neferneferuaten]], as well as early in the reign of [[Tutankhamun|Tutankhaten]].{{sfn|Dodson|2018|pp=47, 50}} For a period of time the worship of Aten and a resurgent worship of [[Amun]] coexisted.{{sfn|Redford|1984|p=207}}{{sfn|Silverman|Wegner|Wegner|2006|pp=165–166}}

Over time, however, Akhenaten's successors, starting with Tutankhaten, took steps to distance themselves from Atenism. Tutankhaten and his wife [[Ankhesenpaaten]] dropped the Aten from their names and changed them to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun, respectively. Amun was restored as the supreme deity. Tutankhamun reestablished the temples of the other gods, as the pharaoh propagated on his Restoration Stela: "He reorganized this land, restoring its customs to those of the time of Re. [...] He renewed the gods' mansions and fashioned all their images. [...] He raised up their temples and created their statues. [...] When he had sought out the gods' precincts which were in ruins in this land, he refounded them just as they had been since the time of the first primeval age."{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|pp=197, 239–242}} Additionally, Tutankhamun's building projects at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and [[Karnak]] used [[talatat]]'s from Akhenaten's buildings, which implies that Tutankhamun might have started to demolish temples dedicated to the Aten. Aten temples continued to be torn down under [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], Tutankhamun's successors and the last pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, too. Horemheb could also have ordered that Akhetaten, Akhenaten's capital city be demolished.{{sfn|van Dijk|2003|p=284}} To further underpin the break with Aten worship, Horemheb claimed to have been chosen to rule over Egypt by the god [[Horus]]. Finally, [[Seti I]], the first pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty, ordered that the name of Amun be restored on inscriptions on which it had been removed or replaced by the name of the Aten.{{sfn|Hoffmeier|2015|pp=239–242}}

== Artistic depictions ==
{{further|Amarna art}}
[[File:ReliefPortraitOfAkhenaten01.png|thumb|left|Akhenaten in the typical Amarna period style.]]

Styles of art that flourished during the reigns of Akhenaten and his immediate successors, known as [[Amarna art]], are markedly different from the [[art of ancient Egypt|traditional art of ancient Egypt]]. Representations are more [[realism (arts)|realistic]], [[expressionism|expressionistic]], and [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]],{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=43–44}}{{sfn|Najovits|2004|p=144}} especially in depictions of animals, plants and people, and convey more action and movement for both non-royal and royal individuals than the traditionally static representations. In traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility.{{sfn|Baptista|Santamarina|Conant|2017}}{{sfn|Arnold|1996|p=viii}}{{sfn|Hornung|2001|pp=42–47}}

The portrayals of Akhenaten himself greatly differ from the depictions of other pharaohs. Traditionally, the portrayal of pharaohs{{snd}}and the Egyptian ruling class{{snd}}was idealized, and they were shown in "stereotypically 'beautiful' fashion" as youthful and athletic.{{sfn|Sooke|2016}} However, Akhenaten's portrayals are unconventional and "unflattering" with a sagging stomach; broad hips; thin legs; thick thighs; large, "almost feminine breasts;" a thin, "exaggeratedly long face;" and thick lips.{{sfn|Takács|Cline|2015|pp=5–6}}

Based on Akhenaten's and his family's unusual artistic representations, including potential depictions of [[gynecomastia]] and [[androgyny]], some have argued that the pharaoh and his family have either suffered from [[aromatase excess syndrome]] and [[craniosynostosis|sagittal craniosynostosis syndrome]], or [[Antley–Bixler syndrome]].{{sfn|Braverman|Redford|Mackowiak|2009}} In 2010, results published from genetic studies on Akhenaten's purported mummy did not find signs of gynecomastia or Antley-Bixler syndrome,{{sfn|Hawass|Gad|Somaia|Khairat|2010}} although these results have since been questioned.{{sfn|Braverman|Mackowiak|2010}}

Arguing instead for a symbolic interpretation, [[Dominic Montserrat]] in ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt'' states that "there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten's physical portrayal... are not to be read literally".{{sfn|Montserrat|2003}}{{sfn|Reeves|2019|pp=154–155}} Because the god Aten was referred to as "the mother and father of all humankind," Montserrat and others suggest that Akhenaten was made to look [[androgynous]] in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten.{{sfn|Najovits|2004|p=145}} This required "a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself", which will "display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions".{{sfn|Montserrat|2003}} Akhenaten claimed the title "The Unique One of Re", and he may have directed his artists to contrast him with the common people through a radical departure from the idealized traditional pharaoh image.{{sfn|Montserrat|2003}}

Depictions of other members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are also exaggerated, stylized, and overall different from traditional art.{{sfn|Baptista|Santamarina|Conant|2017}} Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, the pharaoh's family life is depicted: the royal family is shown mid-action in relaxed, casual, and intimate situations, taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, such as holding hands and kissing.{{sfn|Aldred|1985|p=174}}{{sfn|Arnold|1996|p=114}}{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Najovits|2004|pp=146–147}}

[[File:Akhenaten with blue crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Small statue of Akhenaten wearing the Egyptian Blue Crown of War]]

Nefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone, or with her daughters, in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, such as "smiting the enemy," a traditional depiction of male pharaohs.{{sfn|Arnold|1996|p=85}} This suggests that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.{{sfn|Arnold|1996|pp=85–86}}

==Speculative theories==
[[File:Akhenaten trial piece.jpg|thumb|left|Sculptor's trial piece of Akhenaten.]]
Akhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much [[speculative reason|speculation]], ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic [[fringe science|fringe]] theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],{{sfn|Montserrat|2003|p=36}} as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but the Aten while expecting the people to worship not Aten but him.

===Akhenaten and monotheism in Abrahamic religions===
The idea that Akhenaten was the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became [[Judaism]] has been considered by various scholars.{{sfn|Freud|1939}}{{sfn|Stent|2002|pp=34–38}}{{sfn|Assmann|1997}}{{sfn|Shupak|1995}}{{sfn|Albright|1973}} One of the first to mention this was [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in his book ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]''.{{sfn|Freud|1939}} Basing his arguments on his belief that the Exodus story was historical, Freud argued that [[Moses]] had been an Atenist priest who was forced to leave Egypt with his followers after Akhenaten's death. Freud argued that Akhenaten was striving to promote monotheism, something that the biblical Moses was able to achieve.{{sfn|Freud|1939}} Following the publication of his book, the concept entered popular consciousness and serious research.{{sfn|Chaney|2006a|pp=62–69}}{{sfn|Chaney|2006b}}

Freud commented on the connection between [[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]], the Egyptian Aten and the Syrian divine name of [[Adonis]] as the primeval unity of languages between the factions;{{sfn|Freud|1939}} in this he was following the argument of Egyptologist [[Arthur Weigall]]. [[Jan Assmann]]'s opinion is that 'Aten' and 'Adonai' are not linguistically related.{{sfn|Assmann|1997|pp=23–24}}

It is widely accepted that there are strong stylistic similarities between Akhenaten's [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] and the [[Book of Psalms|Biblical Psalm]] [[Psalm 104|104]], though this form of writing was widespread in ancient Near Eastern hymnology both before and after the period.

Others have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, between [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and God, particularly interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than a henotheistic one. [[Donald B. Redford]] has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. "After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'."{{sfn|Redford|1987}} [[James Henry Breasted]] likened him to Jesus,{{sfn|Levenson|1994|p=60}} [[Arthur Weigall]] saw him as a failed precursor of Christ and [[Thomas Mann]] saw him "as right on the way and yet not the right one for the way".{{sfn|Hornung|2001|p=14}}

Redford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings had claimed the same relationship and priestly role for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis that he placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as being "thy son who came forth from thy limbs", "thy child", "the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc", and "thine only son that came forth from thy body". The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of "his father", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth, and as Akhenaten is king on earth, his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Because only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.{{sfn|Redford|1987}}

Redford concluded:
<blockquote>Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development—one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.{{sfn|Redford|Shanks|Meinhardt|1997}}</blockquote>

The unconventional portrayals of Akhenaten{{snd}}different from the traditional athletic norm in the portrayal of pharaohs{{snd}}have led Egyptologists in the 19th and 20th centuries to suppose that Akhenaten suffered some kind of genetic abnormality.{{sfn|Takács|Cline|2015|pp=5–6}} Various illnesses have been put forward, with [[adiposogenital dystrophy|Frölich's syndrome]] or [[Marfan syndrome]] being mentioned most commonly.{{sfn|Ridley|2019|p=87}}

[[Cyril Aldred]],{{sfn|Aldred|1991}} following up earlier arguments of [[Grafton Elliot Smith]]{{sfn|Smith|1923|pp=83–88}} and [[James Strachey]],{{sfn|Strachey|1939}} suggested that Akhenaten may have suffered from Frölich's syndrome on the basis of his long jaw and his feminine appearance. However, this is unlikely, because this disorder results in [[infertility|sterility]] and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. His children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence.{{sfn|Hawass|2010}}

Burridge{{sfn|Burridge|1995}} suggested that Akhenaten may have suffered from [[Marfan syndrome]], which, unlike Frölich's, does not result in mental impairment or sterility. Marfan sufferers tend towards tallness, with a long, thin face, elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves, symptoms that appear in some depictions of Akhenaten.{{sfn|Lorenz|2010}} Marfan syndrome is a dominant characteristic, which means sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children.{{sfn|National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|2017}} However, DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010 proved negative for Marfan syndrome.{{sfn|Schemm|2010}}

By the early 21st century, most Egyptologists argued that Akhenaten's portrayals are not the results of a genetic or medical condition, but rather should be interpreted through the lens of Atenism.{{sfn|Reeves|2019|pp=154–155}}{{sfn|Montserrat|2003}} Akhenaten was made to look androgynous in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the Aten.{{sfn|Montserrat|2003}}

The life of Akhenaten has inspired many fictional representations.

On page, [[Thomas Mann]] made Akhenaten the "dreaming pharaoh" of Joseph's story in the fictional biblical tetraology ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' from 1933–1943. Akhenaten appears in [[Mika Waltari]]'s ''[[The Egyptian]]'', first published in Finnish (''Sinuhe egyptiläinen'') in 1945, translated by [[Naomi Walford]]; [[David Stacton]]'s ''[[On a Balcony]]'' from 1958; [[Gwendolyn MacEwen]]'s ''[[King of Egypt, King of Dreams]]'' from 1971; [[Allen Drury]]'s ''[[A God Against the Gods]]'' from 1976 and ''[[Return to Thebes]]'' from 1976; [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s ''[[Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth]]'' from 1985; [[Andree Chedid]]'s ''Akhenaten and Nefertiti's Dream''; and [[Moyra Caldecott]]'s ''[[Akhenaten: Son of the Sun]]'' from 1989. Additionally, [[Pauline Gedge]]'s 1984 novel ''The Twelfth Transforming'' is set in the reign of Akhenaten, details the construction of Akhetaten and includes accounts of his personal relationships with Nefertiti, Tiye and successor [[Smenkhkare]]. Akhenaten inspired the poetry collection ''Akhenaten'' by [[Dorothy Porter]]. And in comic books, Akhenaten is the major antagonist in the 2008 comic book series (reprinted as a graphic novel) "[[Marvel: The End]]" by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Al Milgrom]]. In this series, Akhenaten gains unlimited power and, though his stated intentions are benevolent, is opposed by [[Thanos]] and essentially all of the other superheroes and supervillains in the Marvel comic book universe. Finally, Akhenaten provides much of the background in the comic book adventure story ''[[The Mystery of the Great Pyramid, Volume 1: Manetho's Papyrus|Blake et Mortimer: Le Mystère de la Grande Pyramide vol. 1+2]]'' by [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] from 1950.

On stage, the 1937 play ''[[Akhnaton (play)|Akhnaton]]'' by [[Agatha Christie]] explores the lives of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and Tutankhaten.{{sfn|Christie|1973}} He was portrayed in the Greek play ''Pharaoh Akhenaton'' ({{lang-gr|Φαραώ Αχενατόν}}) by Angelos Prokopiou.{{sfn|Prokopiou|1993}} The pharaoh also inspired the 1983 opera ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]'' by [[Philip Glass]].

In film, Akhenaten is played by [[Michael Wilding]] in ''[[The Egyptian (motion picture)|The Egyptian]]'' from 1954 and [[Amedeo Nazzari]] in ''[[Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile]]'' from 1961. In the 2007 animated film ''[[La Reine Soleil]],'' Akhenaten, Tutankhaten, Akhesa (Ankhesenepaten, later Ankhesenamun), Nefertiti, and Horemheb are depicted in a complex struggle pitting the priests of Amun against Atenism. Akhenaten also appears in several documentaries, including ''The Lost Pharaoh: The Search for Akhenaten,'' a 1980 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary based on Donald Redford's excavation of one Akhenaten's temples,{{sfn|Kendall|1980}} and episodes of ''[[Ancient Aliens]],'' which propose that Akhenaten may have been an [[list of alleged extraterrestrial beings|extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|History.com|2018}}

In video games, for example, Akhenaten is the enemy in the [[Assassin's Creed Origins]] [[Assassin's Creed Origins#The Curse of the Pharaohs|"The Curse of the Pharaohs"]] [[Downloadable content|DLC]], and must be defeated to remove his curse on [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].{{sfn|Assassin's Creed Origins|2018}} His afterlife takes the form of 'Aten', a location that draws heavily on the architecture of the city of [[Amarna]]. Additionally, a version of Akhenaten (incorporating elements of [[H. P. Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft's]] [[Nyarlathotep|Black Pharaoh]]) is the driving antagonist behind the Egypt chapters of [[The Secret World]], where the player must stop a modern-day incarnation of the [[Atenism|Atenist]] cult from unleashing the now-[[undead]] pharaoh and the influence of Aten (which is portrayed as a real and extremely powerful malevolent supernatural entity with the ability to strip followers of their free will) upon the world. He is explicitly stated to be the Pharaoh who opposed [[Moses]] in the [[Book of Exodus]], diverging from the traditional Exodus narrative in that he retaliates against Moses's [[Plagues of Egypt|10 Plagues]] with 10 plagues of his own before being sealed away by the combined forces of both Moses and [[Ptahmose (vizier)|Ptahmose]], the [[High Priest of Amun]]. He is also shown to have been an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] alliance with the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] cult of [[Sol Invictus]], who are strongly implied to be worshiping Aten under a different name.

In music, Akhenaten is the subject of several compositions, including the jazz album ''[[Akhenaten Suite]]'' by [[Roy Campbell, Jr.]],{{sfn|Roy Campbell|2012}} the symphony ''Akhenaten (Eidetic Images)'' by [[Gene Gutchë]], the progressive metal song ''Cursing Akhenaten'' by [[After the Burial]], and the technical death metal song ''Cast Down the Heretic'' by [[Nile (band)|Nile]].
