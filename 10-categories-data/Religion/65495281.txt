{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Fratelli tutti''''' (''All Brothers'') is the third [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]], subtitled "on [[Fraternity (philosophy)|fraternity]] and social friendship". In the document, Francis states that the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has proven the failure of global cooperation during this crisis<!-- AE; this particular crisis or crises in general? -->. The encyclical calls for more human fraternity and solidarity, and is a [[plea]] to reject wars.

The document was signed on 3 October 2020, on the occasion of Pope Francis's visit to the tomb of his namesake, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], and was published the following day on the saint's [[feast day]].

== Background ==
''Fratelli tutti'' is Pope Francis's third [[encyclical letter]], after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' and ''[[Laudato si']]''.<ref name=":92">{{Cite web|date=October 4, 2020|title='Fratelli tutti': Pope Francis calls for unity in new encyclical|url=https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2020/10/04/fratelli-tutti-pope-francis-calls-for-unity-in-new-encyclical-2/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Catholic World Report}}</ref> The document was first announced on 5 September 2020.<ref name="Une nouvelle encyclique sur la fraternité bientôt signée à Assise22">{{Cite web|last=Kubacki|first=Marie-Lucile|date=5 September 2020|title=Une nouvelle encyclique sur la fraternité bientôt signée à Assise|url=http://www.lavie.fr/religion/catholicisme/une-nouvelle-encyclique-sur-la-fraternite-bientot-signee-a-assise-05-09-2020-108549_16.php|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907095920/https://www.lavie.fr/religion/catholicisme/une-nouvelle-encyclique-sur-la-fraternite-bientot-signee-a-assise-05-09-2020-108549_16.php|archive-date=7 September 2020|access-date=5 September 2020|website=La Vie|language=fr|issn=0151-2323}}</ref>

The encyclical's title is taken from Francis of Assisi's ''[[Francis of Assisi#Main writings|Admonitions]]''. Pope Francis had alluded to the same quotation on 14 May 2020, when he celebrated [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] at the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] in Vatican City:<ref name="Une nouvelle encyclique sur la fraternité bientôt signée à Assise22" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Day of fraternity, day of penance and prayer (14 May 2020) {{!}} Francis|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/cotidie/2020/documents/papa-francesco-cotidie_20200514_giornodi-fratellanza-penitenza-preghiera.html|access-date=2020-10-04|website=w2.vatican.va}}</ref>

Before its publication, the encyclical's title was criticized by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Thomas J. Reese]], who found it to be discriminatory toward women, because the [[literal translation]] of the title is "Brothers all". However, the [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase has the common connotation of "all of humanity" and is, by default, inclusive.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Winfield|first=Nicole|date=Sep 17, 2020|title=What's in a name?

[[Phyllis Zagano]] also criticized the title, saying: "Too much is at stake. Too many women are being insulted. Too many female lives are at risk."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vondracek|first=Christopher|date=2 October 2020|others=<!---[Wikipedia editor note: The article incorrectly states "Fratelli tutti" is in Latin]--->|title=Pope’s latest encyclical draws ire of Catholic feminists|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/oct/2/popes-latest-encyclical-draws-ire-catholic-feminis/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Inspirations ==
In the encyclical, Pope Francis states that his February 2019 meeting in [[Abu Dhabi]] with [[Ahmad al-Tayyeb]], [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]], during which they signed the ''[[Document on Human Fraternity]],'' was an inspiration for the document.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Crowe|first=Gretchen R.|date=2020-10-04|title=In his new encyclical, Pope Francis challenges all people of good will to reconsider: 'Who is my brother?'|url=https://www.osvnews.com/2020/10/04/in-his-new-encyclical-pope-francis-challenges-all-people-of-good-will-to-reconsider-who-is-my-brother/|access-date=2020-10-04|website=[[Our Sunday Visitor]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Fratelli tutti (3 October 2020) {{!}} Francis|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html|access-date=2020-10-04|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> Besides Francis of Assisi, he also states that he has been inspired by numerous non-Catholics, including [[Martin Luther King]], [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

The notion of "neighbour" elaborated in the document is partly inspired by the interpretation of [[Paul Ricoeur]], whom the pope quotes twice in the encyclical; the pope also quotes one of Ricoeur's thought leaders, [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] philosopher [[Gabriel Marcel]].<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|last=Izoard|first=Antoine-Marie|date=2020-10-04|title=Fratelli tutti : une encyclique aux multiples références françaises|url=https://www.famillechretienne.fr/eglise/pape-et-vatican/fratelli-tutti-une-encyclique-aux-multiples-references-francaises-279018|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Famille Chretienne|language=fr}}</ref>

=== Racism ===

The encyclical criticises [[racism]], saying "[r]acism is a [[virus]] that quickly [[mutates]] and, instead of disappearing, goes into hiding, and lurks in waiting." It also condemns believers who continue to "support varieties of narrow and violent [[nationalism]], [[xenophobia]] and contempt, and even the mistreatment of those who are different".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Giangravé|first=Claire|date=2020-10-04|title=Pope Francis' new encyclical, Fratelli Tutti, enshrines familiar criticisms of racism and borders|url=https://religionnews.com/2020/10/04/pope-francis-new-encyclical-fratelli-tutti-enshrines-familiar-criticisms-of-racism-and-borders/|access-date=2020-10-04|website=[[Religion News Service]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Francis supports the cause of [[immigrants]], saying: "No one, then, can remain excluded because of his or her place of birth, much less because of privileges enjoyed by others who were born in lands of greater opportunity. The limits and borders of individual states cannot stand in the way of this", and adds: "Each country also belongs to the foreigner inasmuch as a territory's goods must not be denied to a needy person coming from elsewhere."<ref name=":0" /> He says that migrants should also benefit from love, and quoted the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|USCCB]]'s 2018 pastoral letter against racism, saying that there are [[Natural rights and legal rights#Catholic Church|some rights]] that "precede any society because they flow from the dignity granted to each person as created by God".<ref name=":92"/>

The Pope also calls for the establishment of the concept of "full citizenship" and the rejection of the discriminatory use of the expression "minorities". The pope insists that others who are different from us are a gift, and that the whole is more than the total of its single parts<!-- Should be rephrased; who's "us"? -->. He furthermore states that other cultures "are not 'enemies' from which we need to protect ourselves."<ref name=":11" />

=== Interreligious relations ===
{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism|Pope Francis: ecumenism and interreligious dialogue|Interfaith dialogue}}
{{See also|China–Holy See relations#2018 Holy See–China Agreement}}
[[File:Percent of Christians by Country–Pew Research 2011.svg|thumb|Percentage of Christians in the World according to a 2011 [[Pew Research]] study.]]
The encyclical is inspired by the [[Document on Human Fraternity|Abu Dhabi declaration]].<ref name=":0" /> In the encyclical, Pope Francis states the Abu Dhabi declaration "was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of [[Interfaith dialogue|dialogue]] and common commitment".<ref name=":2" /> ''Fratelli tutti'' says: "we, the believers of the [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|different religions]], know that our witness to God benefits our societies" and "We Christians ask that, in those countries where we are a minority, we be [[Freedom of religion|guaranteed freedom]], even as we ourselves promote that freedom for non-Christians in places where they are a minority"<ref name=":0" />

The Pope considers interreligious dialogue as a way to bring "friendship, peace and harmony", adding that without "openness to the [[God the Father|Father of all]]", fraternity cannot be achieved. Francis adds that the foundation of modern [[totalitarianism]] is the "denial of the [[Spirituality|transcendent]] dignity of the human person" and that violence "has no basis in religious convictions, but rather in their deformities". However, dialogue of any kind does not involve the "watering down or concealing of our deepest convictions." To Francis, sincere and humble adoration of God "bears fruit not in discrimination, hatred and violence, but in respect for the [[sacredness of life]]."<!-- The previous two sentences may need to refactored; starting to slip out of tone --><ref name=":11" />

=== Good Samaritan ===
{{See also|Theology of Pope Francis}}
Pope Francis reflects upon the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]], which is the [[theological]] core of the encyclical.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|last=Briscoe|first=Patrick|date=Oct 4, 2020|title=10 Things to know about the pope's newest encyclical letter|url=https://aleteia.org/2020/10/04/10-things-to-know-about-the-popes-newest-encyclical-letter/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Aleteia|language=en-US}}</ref> Pope Francis says this parable is an "ever new" call from [[Jesus]] to "rediscover our vocation as citizens of our respective nations and of the entire world, builders of a new social bond". It invites the reader to introspect their inner struggle between one's own [[security]] and personal sacrifices required by [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. The parable "speaks to us of an essential and often forgotten aspect of our common humanity: we were created for a fulfilment that can only be found in love." <!-- More "us" --> Pope Francis adds: "All of us have a responsibility for the wounded" and "We should not expect everything from those who govern us, for that would be childish. We have the space we need for co-responsibility in creating and putting into place new processes and changes."<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Briscoe|first=Patrick|date=2020-10-04|title=The theological heart of "Fratelli Tutti," and where to find hope|url=https://aleteia.org/2020/10/04/the-theological-heart-of-fratelli-tutti-and-where-to-find-hope/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Aleteia|language=en-US}}</ref> The Pope also urges people to "be Good Samaritans who bear the pain of other people's troubles rather than fomenting greater hatred and resentment"<ref name=":7" />

In the same section, Pope Francis also criticises those who believe that worshipping God is enough and are untrue to [[Religious law|what their faith demands of them]]. Also, Francis points at those who "manipulate and cheat society" and "live off" [[welfare]]. He also emphasizes the importance of recognising Jesus Christ in those who are abandoned or excluded and adds he "sometimes wonder[s]<!--the article given in reference has "wonders," but the original text has "I wonder"--> why it took so long for the Church [[Catholic Church and slavery|unequivocally to condemn slavery]] and various forms of violence."<ref name=":11" />

=== Universal fraternity ===
{{See also|Brotherly love (philosophy)|Workers of the world, unite!|Catholic Church and abortion}}{{Quote|text=It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and women. [...] Let us dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travellers sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all.|author=|title=|source=''Fratelli tutti'', §8}}
The Pope noted that {{as of|2020||lc=y}} the feeling of belonging to a "single human family is fading"<!-- "As of"? Article doesn't seem to mention a date -->, and that the quest for justice and peace "seems an outdated [[utopia]]" which is being replaced by a "globalized indifference."<!-- Really close paraphrasing --><ref name=":11" />

In ''Fratelli tutti'', Francis states that universal brotherhood is possible, but requires "a decisive commitment to devising effective means to this end" (§ 180). Furthermore, he states that [[isolationism]], [[nationalism]], a global economy that "promotes individual interests," a "loss of the [[Philosophy of history|sense of history]]," limitless consumption, [[wastefulness]], a [[throwaway culture]], and the lack of [[Environmentalism|concern for the environment]] are hindering this end.<!-- Not quoted but taken verbatim --><ref name=":1" /> Among other things, [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]], [[Religious views on euthanasia#Catholicism|euthanasia]], neglect of the elderly, [[discrimination against women]], and [[Slavery in the 21st century|slavery]] are included as part of this throwaway culture<!-- More close paraphrasing -->;<ref>{{Cite web|date=Oct 4, 2020|title='Fratelli tutti': Pope Francis calls for unity in new encyclical|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/fratelli-tutti-pope-francis-calls-for-unity-in-new-encyclical-19783|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en}}</ref> the word "abortion" is not present in the encyclical, but its condemnation is alluded.<ref name=":11" /> In the encyclical, Pope Francis says: "Social friendship and universal fraternity necessarily call for an acknowledgement of the worth of every human person, always and everywhere"; Francis warns that if the human dignity of [[disabled people]], of [[Poverty|poor people]], or of those who do not have access to education is menaced, then fraternity will be but a "vague [[Utopia|ideal]]"<ref name=":7" /> Francis states that [[individualism]] "does not make us more free, more equal, more fraternal"<!-- More "us" -->, and that what is needed is a "universal love" which promotes the dignity of every human being.<ref name=":92"/> He also notes that individualist [[consumerism]] can possibly "rapidly degenerate into a free-for-all" which would be "worse than any [[pandemic]]."<!-- Close paraphrasing --><ref name=":11" />

=== "Liberty, equality and fraternity" ===
{{See also|Liberté, égalité, fraternité}}
In the encyclical Francis uses the expression "liberty, equality, and fraternity" without explicitly referencing [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|the French motto]].<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":3" /> He explains that "[[Fraternity (philosophy)|[f]raternity]] is born not only of a climate of respect for [[individual liberties]], or even of a certain administratively guaranteed equality. Fraternity necessarily calls for something greater, which in turn enhances [[freedom]] and equality",<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Horan|first=Daniel P.|date=2020-10-04|title=Relationship leads us to peace: Three key Franciscan themes in 'Fratelli Tutti'|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/faith-seeking-understanding/relationship-leads-us-peace-three-key-franciscan-themes|access-date=2020-10-05|website=National Catholic Reporter|language=en}}</ref> and adds that liberty and equality are nothing without fraternity. Moreover, the Pope criticizes the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] for being abstract in essence, stating that equality cannot be attained by "an abstract proclamation that 'all men and women are equal'. Instead, it is the result of the conscious and careful cultivation of fraternity."<ref name=":10" />

=== Dignity of women ===
{{See also|Women in the Catholic Church}}
In the encyclical, Pope Francis strives to ensure the situation of women globally is taken more into account globally: "The organization of societies worldwide is still far from reflecting clearly that women possess the same dignity and identical rights as men."<!-- Cite source material? --><ref name=":0" />

=== Capital punishment ===
{{Main|Catholic Church and capital punishment|3 = Sanctity of life}}
{{See also|Capital punishment in the Bible|Religion and capital punishment}}
Pope Francis [[Catholic Church and capital punishment#Modification to the Catholic catechism (2018)|repeats]] that the [[death penalty]] is "inadmissible" and that "there can be no stepping back from this position."<!-- Close paraphrasing --><ref name=":11" /> He adds that the [[Catholic Church]] is committed to the worldwide abolition of the death penalty; he explains: "The firm rejection of the death penalty shows to what extent it is possible to recognize the inalienable dignity of every human being and to accept that he or she has a place in this universe."<ref name=":2" />

=== International politics ===
{{Main|Catholic Church and politics}}
In the encyclical, Pope Francis states that the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has proven the failure of the world to work together during this crisis.<!-- AE; that doesn't seem to be what the pope is saying --><ref name=":8">{{Cite news|last=Horowitz|first=Jason|date=2020-10-04|title=Pope Criticizes Lack of Unity in World's Response to Coronavirus|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/world/europe/pope-francis-coronavirus-response.html|access-date=2020-10-05|issn=0362-4331|quote=As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident.}}</ref> In the encyclical, he calls for the development of a mid- to long-term "form of [[global governance]]" which would have the means to provide "effective assistance for integrating migrants in their receiving countries, while also promoting the development of their countries of origin through policies inspired by solidarity, yet not linking assistance to ideological strategies and practices alien or contrary to the cultures of the peoples being assisted."<ref name=":2" />

Francis also calls for a reform of the [[United Nations]] to prevent it from being "delegitimized".<ref name=":2" />

Francis criticizes "certain [[populist]] political regimes" that [[Opposition to immigration|prevent migrants from entering their countries]] at all costs, and lead to "a [[xenophobic]] mentality." He defines good politics as politics that attempt to build communities and hear all opinions. To Francis, politics is not about "how many people endorsed me?" or "how many voted for me?", but rather about "how much love did I put into my work?" and "what real bonds did I create?" <!-- Tone is slipping --><ref name=":11" />

=== Economy ===
{{See also|Criticism of the Catholic Church#Financial corruption|Institute for the Works of Religion#Controversies}}
Francis warns against selfishness in the economy, and against [[Speculation|financial speculation]] which "continues to wreak havoc." For the Pope, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that "not everything can be resolved by [[Free market|market freedom]]" and that human dignity must be put "back at the center".<ref name=":11" /> The Pope considers that a good [[economic policy]] is one which creates jobs, not one which removes them.<ref name=":12" /> He denounces the "dogma" of [[neoliberalism]] that the [[Market (economics)|market]] by itself [[Market fundamentalism|can resolve any problem]], a dogma which repeatedly "resort[s] to the magic theories of '[[Spillover (economics)|spillover]]' or '[[Trickle-down economics|trickle]]{{' "}} to solve any societal problem.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|last=Poggioli|first=Sylvia|date=October 4, 2020|title=Pope Francis Laments Failures Of Market Capitalism In Blueprint For Post-COVID World|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/10/04/920053203/pope-francis-laments-failures-of-market-capitalism-in-blueprint-for-post-covid-w|access-date=2020-10-06|website=[[NPR]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Thorbecke|first=Catherine|date=5 October 2020|title=Pope Francis says trickle-down economic policies don't work amid the pandemic|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/pope-francis-trickle-economic-policies-work-amid-pandemic/story?id=73429394|access-date=2020-10-06|website=ABC News|language=en}}</ref>

=== Private property ===
{{See also|Universal destination of goods}}
''Fratelli tutti'' accepts the [[right to property]], but states that this right "can only be considered a secondary [[Natural rights and legal rights|natural right]]" when compared to [[Dignity|human dignity]]. Francis attempts to reorient the right to property as a responsibility for the care of the whole planet: "All this brings out the positive meaning of the right to property: I care for and cultivate something that I possess, in such a way that it can contribute to the [[Common good|good of all]]."<ref name=":0" /> He also urges that the "right to private property" be accompanied by the "prior principle" of "subordination of all private property to the [[Universal destination of goods|universal destination of the earth's goods]], and thus the right of all to their use".<ref name=":11" />

=== War ===
{{Quote|text=With the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, let us establish a global fund that can finally put an end to hunger and favour development in the most impoverished countries, so that their citizens will not resort to violent or illusory solutions, or have to leave their countries in order to seek a more dignified life.|author=|title=|source=''Fratelli tutti'', §262}}
Francis says that, {{as of|2020||lc=y}}, the risks of war exceed its supposed benefits.<ref name=":11" /> He believes that "it is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a '[[Just war theory|just war]]{{' "}};<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":11" /> Francis adds that [[Augustine of Hippo]], who "forged a concept of 'just war' that we no longer uphold in our own day, also said that 'it is a higher glory still to stay war itself with a word, than to slay men with the sword, and to procure or maintain peace by peace, not by war{{' "}}.<ref name=":2" /> Francis speaks of the right to defense by means of military force as a "potential right".<ref name=":3" /> [[War]], [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[terrorism]] are all denounced as misguided substitutes for dialogue and as means to primarily further national agendas.<ref name=":0" />

=== Conclusion prayers ===
The encyclical ends with two [[prayer]]s: one to the [[Creator deity|Creator]] that addresses God as [[God the Father|Father]], and an [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Christian prayer that addresses God as the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].<ref name=":2" />

== Reception ==

=== Journalists ===
''[[Our Sunday Visitor]]'' describes the encyclical as "a papal [[plea]] to care for our fellow man", in the same way the previous encyclical, ''[[Laudato si']]'', is "a papal plea to [[Environmentalism|care for our common home]]".<!-- "Our"? --><ref name=":1" />

[[John L. Allen Jr.]] of [[Crux (online newspaper)|''Crux'']] compares ''Fratelli tutti'' to [[Pius XI]]'s 1931 encyclical ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' based on similarities he sees between the political and economic contexts in which both encyclicals were released and the solutions they provided.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Allen Jr.|first=John L.|author-link=John L.

According to Eduardo Campos Lima of ''Crux'', many [[Brazilians]] were surprised and delighted by the use of Pope Francis of a quote from the song ''Samba da Benção'' of [[Vinicius de Moraes]] in the encyclical.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Campos Lima|first=Eduardo|date=Oct 8, 2020|title=Brazilians intrigued by papal encyclical’s use of song based on Afro-Brazilian religion|url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-americas/2020/10/brazilians-intrigued-by-papal-encyclicals-use-of-song-based-on-afro-brazilian-religion/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Crux}}</ref>

=== Catholic Church ===
The head of the Jesuit Institute School of Spirituality in South Africa, Catholic laywoman Dr Annemarie Paulin-Campbell,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-03-16|title=Our Team|url=https://www.jesuitinstitute.org.za/our-team/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Jesuit Institute South Africa|language=en-ZA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Annemarie Paulin-Campbell|url=https://www.catholicwomenpreach.org/preacher/annmarie-paulin-campbel|access-date=2020-10-05|website=Catholic Women Preach}}</ref> criticizes the content of the encyclical, its title which she believes made it difficult for woman to feel included (although, she says, {{" '}}Fratelli' is meant to communicate brothers and sisters or siblings"), and its frequent use of the word "fraternity" which she says "carries strongly masculine connotations". She stated that the encyclical addressed many social issues, but did not address problems which particularly concern women, such as "gender-based violence" and she said that the Catholic Church "does not accord women the same dignity and identical rights as men". Nevertheless, she said that despite her "critique of 'Fratelli Tutti' in relation to women, it is well worth reading because it gives a sense of the many areas in which we are struggling in contemporary society."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paulin-Campbell|first=Annemarie|date=2020-10-04|title='Fratelli Tutti' – Encyclical of love that misses the boat on women|url=https://spotlight.africa/2020/10/04/fratelli-tutti-encyclical-of-love-that-misses-the-boat-on-women/|access-date=2020-10-05|website=spotlight.africa|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Jesuit [[James Martin (priest, born 1960)|James Martin]] praises the encyclical for "ratif[ying] a change in [[Catholic moral theology|church teaching]]. In this case, on the death penalty."<!-- Necessary quoting? --><ref>{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=James|author-link=James Martin (priest, born 1960)|date=2020-10-04|title=Pope Francis closes the door on the death penalty in 'Fratelli Tutti'|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2020/10/04/pope-francis-closes-door-death-penalty-fratelli-tutti|access-date=2020-10-06|website=[[America Magazine]]|language=en}}</ref>

Thomas Petri, dean of the [[Pontifical Faculty of the Immaculate Conception]], considers that the [[Catholic Church and capital punishment#Modification to the Catholic catechism (2018)|2018 change of the Catechism]] and ''Fratelli tutti'' which both declare capital punishment "inadmissible" means that the death penalty is in itself admissible since the Pope did not qualify death penalty as "intrinsically evil". Petri believes that if a pope was to deny the admissibility in itself of death penalty, it would constitute a "rupture" with the previous teachings of the Catholic Church. He considers the change of stance is "a new understanding of punishment". He explains that historically capital punishment, from a Catholic point of view, is seen first as a means of [[Retributive justice|retribution]], and secondly, as a mean of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] of the criminal and of [[Incapacitation (penology)|protection of society]], but that [[John Paul II]] in ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' declares that the protection of society is the first objective of death penalty.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hadro|first=Matt|date=Oct 6, 2020|title=Does 'Fratelli tutti' change Church teaching on the death penalty?|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/does-fratelli-tutti-change-church-teaching-on-the-death-penalty-62241|access-date=2020-10-06|website=[[Catholic News Agency]]|language=en}}</ref>

[[José Horacio Gómez]], president of the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], says the encyclical proposes a challenge "to overcome the individualism in our culture and to serve our neighbors in love".<!-- "Our" --> [[Simone Campbell]] says the encyclical's message is: "We must move beyond continuous divisiveness and come together to build a world worthy of all God’s children".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lyons|first=Jack|date=Oct 12, 2020|title=Pope has ‘simple but jarring’ message for the world in encyclical|url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2020/10/pope-has-simple-but-jarring-message-for-the-world-in-encyclical/|access-date=2020-10-12|website=Crux}}</ref>

On 1 December 2020, the [[Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development]] (DPIHD), with the help of the [[Dicastery for Communication]], has released a section of the DPIHD's website dedicated to the encyclical.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-12-01|title=Vatican launches website dedicated to "Fratelli tutti" encyclical|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2020-12/fratelli-tutti-website-dicastery-human-development.html|access-date=2020-12-01|website=Vatican News|language=en}}</ref>

=== Other religions ===
[[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]] [[Ahmad al-Tayyeb]] says the encyclical "is an extension of the [[Document on Human Fraternity]], and reveals a global reality in which the vulnerable and marginalized pay the price for unstable positions and decisions. It is a message that is directed to people of good will, whose consciences are alive and restores to humanity consciousness."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Abu Zaid|first=Mohammed|date=6 Oct 2020|title=Grand Imam of Al-Azhar welcomes Pope Francis ‘Fratelli Tutti’ encyclical|url=https://www.arabnews.jp/en/middle-east/article_28291/,%20https://www.arabnews.jp/en/middle-east/article_28291/|access-date=2020-10-12|website=Arab News Japan|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-05|title=Grand Imam: 'Pope Francis restores to humanity its consciousness'|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2020-10/grand-imam-al-tayyeb-encyclical-fratelli-tutti-fraternity-pope.html|access-date=2020-10-12|website=Vatican News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-04|title=شيخ الأزهر: رسالة البابا تستعيد للبشرية وعيها|url=https://www.sawtbeirut.com/world-news/شيخ-الأزهر-رسالة-البابا-تستعيد-للبشري/|access-date=2020-10-12|website=[[Voice of Lebanon]]|language=ar}}</ref>

=== Freemasons ===
Through its communication organ ''El Oriente'', the {{Interlanguage link|Grand Lodge of Spain|lt=|es|Gran Logia de España|WD=}} praises the encyclical, saying that it shows "how far the current Catholic Church is from [[Christian attitudes towards Freemasonry#Catholic Church|its former position]]. In 'Fratelli Tutti', the Pope embraces Universal Fraternity, the great principle of modern [[Freemasonry|Masonry]]." The [[Masonic lodge|lodge]] also praises the fact that the Pope addresses "the disintegrating role of the digital world, whose operation favors [[Echo chamber (media)|closed circuits]] of people who think the same way and facilitate the spread of [[fake news]] that encourage prejudice and hatred."<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 October 2020|title=La Gran Logia de España se enorgullece de que el Papa Francisco abrace "la fraternidad universal", el gran principio fundacional de la masonería|url=https://latribunadelpaisvasco.com//art/13875/la-gran-logia-de-espana-se-enorgullece-de-que-el-papa-francisco-abrace-la-fraternidad-universal-el-gran-principio-fundacional-de-la-masoneria|access-date=2020-10-06|website=La Tribuna del País Vasco|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-05|title=La Gran Logia de España considera que Francisco abraza el concepto de fraternidad de la Masonería|url=https://www.infocatolica.com/?t=noticia&cod=38792|access-date=2020-10-07|website=InfoCatólica|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=El Papa abraza la Fraternidad Universal, el gran principio de la Masonería|url=https://us7.campaign-archive.com/?u=4406fe7d64e95e62cb07ce8d9&id=8893713190|access-date=2020-10-07|website=El Oriente – Gran Logia España}}</ref>

The [[Grand Orient of Italy]], through its official magazine ''Erasmo'', praises the encyclical, saying the "idea of universal brotherhood as a bond that unites all human beings, regardless of their faith, ideology, color, skin, social background, language, culture and nation" expressed in the encyclical "apertis verbis [in explicit words] in an absolutely new tone" is "a thought that is close to the ideals that have been the very foundations of [[Freemasonry]] from the very beginning".<!-- Unwieldy --><ref>{{Cite web|date=26 October 2020|title=Großorient von Italien erfreut über "Analogien" bei Papst Franziskus|url=https://katholisches.info/2020/10/26/grossorient-von-italien-erfreut-ueber-analogien-bei-papst-franziskus/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=Katholisches|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 2020|title=Un valore massonico|url=https://www.grandeoriente.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/erasmo-n.-9-ottobre-2020-web.pdf|journal=Erasmo|volume=9|pages=4–5|quote=Nella sua ultima enciclica "Fratelli tutti", pubblicata il 3 ottobre, Papa Francesco ha espresso apertis verbis in chiave assolutamente inedita un'idea di fratellanza universale, come legame che unisce tutti gli esseri umani, al di là della loro fede, ideologia, colore della pelle, estrazione sociale, lingua, cultura e nazione. Si tratta di un pensiero che è vicino agli ideali che costituiscono fin dalle origini le fondamenta stesse della Massoneria. Da oltre 300 anni il principio di Fratellanza è scritto in maniera indelebile nel trinomio massonico posto all’Oriente nei templi insieme a quelli di Libertà e Uguaglianza. E,la realizzazione di una Fratellanza universale, è dalle origini la grande missione e il grande sogno della Libera Muratoria. E lo hanno sottolineato nei loro commenti alcuni filosofi, giornalisti e anche qualche alto prelato di Santa Roma Chiesa, esprimendosi senza riserve nei confronti del messaggio venuto fuori dall’Enciclica Bergogliana|via=Grande Oriente d'Italia – Sito Ufficiale}}</ref>
