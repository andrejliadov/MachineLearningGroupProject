'''Indian religions''', sometimes also termed '''Dharmic religions''' or '''Indic religions''', are the religions that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]]; namely [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]].<ref group=web name = EB>Adams, C. J., [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38030/classification-of-religions Classification of religions: Geographical], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 2007. Accessed: 15 July 2010</ref>{{refn|group=note|Adams: "Indian religions, including early Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism, and sometimes also Theravāda Buddhism and the Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired religions of South and Southeast Asia".}} These [[religion]]s are also all classified as [[Eastern religions]]. Although Indian religions are connected through the [[history of India]], they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.<ref group=web name="EB"/>

Evidence attesting to [[prehistoric religion]] in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered [[Mesolithic]] rock paintings. The [[Harappa]]n people of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], which lasted from 3300 to 1300 BCE (mature period 2600–1900 BCE), had an early urbanized culture which predates the Vedic religion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rude Travel: Down The Sages|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch-stories/rude-travel-down-the-sages/article1-1121641.aspx  | newspaper =Hindustan Times |author= Vir Sanghvi }}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Vir Singhvi is a Journalist not a scholar.|date=February 2017}}

The documented history of Indian religions begins with the [[historical Vedic religion]], the religious practices of the early [[Indo-Iranians]], which were collected and later [[shakha|redacted]] into the ''[[Vedas]]''. The period of the composition, redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the [[Vedic period]], which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=33}} The philosophical portions of the Vedas were summarized{{weasel inline|date=August 2017}} in [[Upanishads]], which are commonly referred to as ''[[Vedānta]]'', variously interpreted to mean either the "last chapters, parts of the [[Vedas|Veda]]" or "the object, the highest purpose of the Veda".<ref>Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n93/mode/2up The Upanishads], Part 1, Oxford University Press, page LXXXVI footnote 1</ref> The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five{{refn|group=note|The pre-Buddhist Upanishads are: Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Kaushitaki, Aitareya, and Taittiriya Upanishads.<ref name=olivelleintro/>}} of the eleven [[principal Upanishads]] were composed in all likelihood before 6th century BCE,<ref name=olivelleintro>Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, pages 12–14</ref>{{sfn|King|1995|p=52}} and contain the earliest mentions of ''[[Yoga]]'' and [[Moksha]].{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxiii}}

The [[Śramaṇa|Shramanic Period]] between 800 and 200 BCE marks a "turning point between the Vedic Hinduism and Puranic Hinduism".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} The Shramana movement, an ancient Indian religious movement parallel to but separate from Vedic tradition, often defied many of the Vedic and Upanishadic concepts of soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). In 6th century BCE, the Shramnic movement matured into [[Jainism]]{{sfn|Jain|2008|p=210}} and [[Buddhism]]{{sfn|Svarghese|2008|p=259-60}} and was responsible for the schism of Indian religions into two main philosophical branches of astika, which venerates Veda (e.g., six orthodox schools of Hinduism) and [[Āstika and nāstika|nastika]] (e.g., Buddhism, Jainism, Charvaka, etc.). However, both branches shared the related concepts of [[Yoga]], ''[[saṃsāra]]'' (the cycle of birth and death) and ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation from that cycle).{{refn|group=note|The shared concepts include rebirth, samsara, karma, meditation, renunciation and moksha.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|pp=xx–xxiv}}}}{{refn|group=note|The Upanishadic, Buddhist and Jain renunciation traditions form parallel traditions, which share some common concepts and interests. While [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]]-[[Panchala]], at the central Ganges Plain, formed the center of the early Upanishadic tradition, [[Kosala]]-[[Magadha]] at the central Ganges Plain formed the center of the other [[shramanic]] traditions.{{sfn|Samuel|2010}}}}<ref>[[Buddhism and Hinduism#Similarities]]</ref>

The Puranic Period (200 BCE – 500 CE) and Early Medieval period (500–1100 CE) gave rise to new configurations of Hinduism, especially [[bhakti]] and [[Shaivism]], [[Shaktism]], [[Vaishnavism]], [[Smarta]], and smaller groups like the conservative [[Shrauta]].

The early Islamic period (1100–1500 CE) also gave rise to new movements. [[Sikhism]] was founded in the 15th century on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak]] and the nine successive [[Sikh Gurus]] in [[Northern India]].<ref group=web name="ADR">{{cite web |author=Adherents.com |url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/rel_by_adh_CSM.html |title=Religions by adherents |format=PHP |accessdate=9 February 2007}}</ref> The vast majority of its adherents originate in the [[Punjab region]].

With the [[British Raj|colonial dominance]] of the British a [[Neo-Vedanta|reinterpretation and synthesis of Hinduism]] arose, which aided the [[Indian independence movement]].

===Periodisation===
{{main|Periodisation of Hinduism}}
[[James Mill]] (1773–1836), in his [[The History of British India]] (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into "ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods", although this periodization has also received criticism.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19-20}}

[[Romila Thapar]] notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to "ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,"{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=19}} According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on "significant social and economic changes," which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers.{{sfn|Thapar|1978|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|See also Tanvir Anjum, ''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History Temporal Divides: A Critical Review of the Major Schemes of Periodization in Indian History]''.}}

Smart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the "ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:{{sfn|Michaels|2004}}
* Indian pre-history including [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]  (until c. 1750 BCE);
* Iron Age including [[Vedic period]]  (c. 1750–600 BCE);
* "Second Urbanisation" (c. 600–200 BCE);
* Classical period (c. 200 BCE-1200 CE);{{refn|group=note|Different periods are designated as "classical Hinduism": 
* Smart calls the period between 1000 BCE and 100 CE "pre-classical". It is the formative period for the Upanishads and Brahmanism{{refn|group=subnote|Smart distinguishes "Brahmanism" from the Vedic religion, connecting  "Brahmanism" with the Upanishads.{{sfn|Smart|2003|p=52, 83–86}}}} Jainism and Buddhism. For Smart, the "classical period" lasts from 100 to 1000 CE, and coincides with the flowering of "classical Hinduism" and the flowering and deterioration of Mahayana-buddhism in India.{{sfn|Smart|2003|p=52}} 
* For Michaels, the period between 500 BCE and 200 BCE is a time of "Ascetic reformism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=36}} whereas the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE is the time of "classical Hinduism", since there is "a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} 
* Muesse discerns a longer period of change, namely between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, which he calls the "Classical Period". According to Muesse, some of the fundamental concepts of Hinduism, namely karma, reincarnation and "personal enlightenment and transformation", which did not exist in the Vedic religion, developed in this time.{{sfn|Muesse|2003|p=14}}}}
:* Pre-Classical period (c. 200 BCE-320 CE);
:* "Golden Age" (Gupta Empire) (c. 320–650 CE);
:* Late-Classical period (c. 650–1200 CE);
* Medieval period (c. 1200–1500 CE);
* Early Modern (c. 1500–1850);
* Modern period (British Raj and independence) (from c. 1850).

===Prevedic religions (before c. 1750 BCE)===

====Prehistory====
[[Image:Mohenjo-daro Priesterkönig.jpeg|thumb|150px|"Priest King" of [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]]]
Evidence attesting to [[prehistoric religion]] in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered [[Mesolithic]] rock paintings such as at [[Bhimbetka]], depicting dances and rituals. [[Neolithic]] agriculturalists inhabiting the [[Indus River]] Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife and belief in magic.<ref name="Heehs_2002_39">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=39}}.</ref> Other [[South Asian Stone Age]] sites, such as the [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] in central [[Madhya Pradesh]] and the [[Kupgal petroglyphs]] of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music.<ref group=web>{{cite news |title=Ancient Indians made 'rock music' |work=[[BBC News]] |date=19 March 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3520384.stm |accessdate=7 August 2007}}</ref>

====Indus Valley civilisation====
{{further|Prehistoric religion}}
The religion and belief system of the Indus valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the [[Indus script]] remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective.{{sfn|keay|}}{{Sfn|Wright|2009|pp=281–282}} An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harrapan sites<ref name=ratnagarCA>{{Cite journal |last=Ratnagar |first=Shereen |date=April 2004 |title=Archaeology at the Heart of a Political Confrontation The Case of Ayodhya |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/5696/1/5696.pdf |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=239–259 |doi=10.1086/381044 |jstor=10.1086/381044|s2cid=149773944 }}</ref> was that of [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]], who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus ([[linga]]) and vulva ([[yoni]]); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=48–78}}{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–156}}

[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|thumb|150px|The so-called ''Pashupati seal'', showing a seated and possibly [[ithyphallic]] figure, surrounded by animals.]]
One Indus valley seal shows a seated, possibly [[ithyphallic]] and tricephalic, figure with a horned headdress, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god [[Shiva]] (or [[Rudra]]), who is associated with asceticism, [[yoga]], and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the [[Pashupati Seal]], after ''[[Pashupati]]'' (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=48–78}}{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–144}} While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]] Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|pp=180–181}} Herbert Sullivan and [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399–432}} Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–144}}  Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the [[Tirthankara]] [[Rishabha]] by Jains and Dr. Vilas Sangave<ref>{{cite book|author= Vilas Sangave|year=2001|title=''Facets of Jainology: Selected Research Papers on Jain Society, Religion, and Culture''|publisher=Popular Prakashan: Mumbai|isbn=978-81-7154-839-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2FGSGmP4jNcC}}</ref> or an early [[Buddha]] by Buddhists.<ref name=ratnagarCA/> Historians like [[Heinrich Zimmer]], [[Thomas McEvilley]] are of the opinion that there exists some link between first [[Jain]] Tirthankara Rishabha and Indus Valley civilisation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Philosophies of India|last = Zimmer|first = Heinrich|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1969|isbn = 978-0-691-01758-7|location = NY|pages = 60, 208–209|editor-first = Joseph|editor-last = Campbell}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas McEvilley]] (2002) ''The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies''. Allworth Communications, Inc. 816 pages; {{ISBN|1-58115-203-5}}</ref>

Marshall hypothesized the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of [[History of Shaktism|Shaktism]]. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be "terribly robust".{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–145}} Some of the [[Baetylus|baetyls]] interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise ''yoni'' were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated.{{sfn|Mcintosh|2008|pp=286–287}} Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric creations]]. One seal from Mohen-jodaro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian myth]] of such a monster created by goddess [[Ninhursag|Aruru]] to fight [[Gilgamesh]].{{sfn|Marshall|1931|p=67}}

In contrast to contemporary [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamian]] civilisations, Indus valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|p=18}}{{sfn|Thapar|2004|p=85}} This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the [[Great Bath]] at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification.{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141–145}}{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=275–277, 292}} The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation is marked by its diversity with evidence of supine burial; fractional burial in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment; and even cremation. {{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=152, 157–176}}{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|pp=293–299}}

===Vedic period (1750–800 BCE)===
{{Main|Vedic period|Historical Vedic religion}}
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
The documented history of Indian religions begins with the [[historical Vedic religion]], the religious practices of the early [[Indo-Aryans]], which were collected and later [[shakha|redacted]] into the ''[[Vedas|Samhitas]]'' (usually known as the Vedas), four canonical collections of hymns or [[mantra]]s composed in archaic [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]]. These texts are the central ''[[shruti]]'' (revealed) texts of [[Hinduism]]. The period of the composition, redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the [[Vedic period]], which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=33}}

The [[Vedic Period]] is most significant for the composition of the four Vedas, Brahmanas and the older Upanishads (both presented as discussions on the rituals, mantras and concepts found in the four Vedas), which today are some of the most important [[Sacred texts|canonical texts]] of Hinduism, and are the codification of much of what developed into the core beliefs of Hinduism.<ref name="Witzel">[[Stephanie W. Jamison]] and [[Michael Witzel]] in Arvind Sharma, editor, ''The Study of Hinduism.'' University of South Carolina Press, 2003, page 65</ref>

Some modern Hindu scholars use the "Vedic religion" synonymously with "Hinduism."<ref>History Of Ancient India (portraits Of A Nation), 1/e By Kamlesh Kapur</ref> According to Sundararajan, Hinduism is also known as the Vedic religion.<ref>P. 382 ''Hindu Spirituality: Vedas Through Vedanta, Volume 1'' edited by K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji</ref> Other authors state that the Vedas contain "the fundamental truths about Hindu Dharma"<ref>Ashim Kumar Bhattacharyya declares that Vedas contain the fundamental truths about Hindu Dharma; P. 6''Hindu Dharma: Introduction to Scriptures And Theology'' By Ashim Kumar Bhattacharyya</ref> which is called "the modern version of the ancient Vedic Dharma"<ref>P. 46 ''I Am Proud To Be A Hindu'' By J. Agarwal</ref> The [[Arya Samaj]]is recognize the Vedic religion as true Hinduism.<ref>P. 41 ''Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide'' By Roshen Dalal</ref> Nevertheless, according to Jamison and Witzel,
{{quote|... to call this period Vedic Hinduism is a contradiction in terms since Vedic religion is very different from what we generally call Hindu religion – at least as much as Old Hebrew religion is from medieval and modern Christian religion. However, Vedic religion is treatable as a predecessor of Hinduism."<ref name="Witzel" />{{refn|group=note|[[Richard E. King]] notes: "Consequently, it remains an anachronism to project the notion of "Hinduism" as it is commonly understood into pre-colonial history."{{sfn|King|1999|p=176}}}}}}

====Early Vedic period – early Vedic compositions (c. 1750–1200 BCE)====
{{Main|Vedas|Samhitas}}
The [[rishi]]s, the composers of the hymns of the [[Rigveda]], were considered inspired poets and seers.{{refn|group=note|In post-Vedic times understood as "hearers" of an eternally existing Veda, ''[[Śrauta]]'' means "what is heard"}}

The mode of worship was the performance of [[Yajna]], sacrifices which involved sacrifice and sublimation of the havana sámagri (herbal preparations){{citation needed|date=June 2013}} in the fire, accompanied by the singing of [[Samagana|Samans]] and 'mumbling' of [[Yajus]], the sacrificial mantras. The sublime meaning of the word yajna is derived from the Sanskrit verb yaj, which has a three-fold meaning of worship of deities (devapujana), unity (saògatikaraña) and charity (dána).<ref>Nigal, S.G. Axiological Approach to the Vedas. Northern Book Centre, 1986. P. 81. {{ISBN|81-85119-18-X}}.</ref> An essential element was the sacrificial fire – the divine [[Agni]] – into which oblations were poured, as everything offered into the fire was believed to reach God.

Central concepts in the Vedas are [[Satya]] and [[Rta]]. ''Satya'' is derived from [[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]], the present participle of the verbal root ''as'', "to be, to exist, to live".{{sfn|Zimmer|1989|p=166}} ''Sat'' means "that which really exists [...] the really existent truth; the Good",{{sfn|Zimmer|1989|p=166}} and ''Sat-ya'' means "is-ness".{{sfn|Zimmer|1989|p=167}} ''Rta'', "that which is properly joined; order, rule; truth", is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it.<ref>Holdrege (2004:215)</ref> "Satya (truth as being) and rita (truth as law) are the primary principles of Reality and its manifestation is the background of the canons of dharma, or a life of righteousness."{{sfn|Krishnananda|1994|p=17}} "Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute, rita is its application and function as the rule and order operating in the universe."{{sfn|Krishnananda|1994|p=24}} Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks:
{{quote|''Ṛta'' is the ultimate foundation of everything; it is "the supreme", although this is not to be understood in a static sense. [...] It is the expression of the primordial dynamism that is inherent in everything...."<ref>Panikkar 2001:350–351</ref>}}

The term rta is inherited from the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], the religion of the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian peoples]] prior to the earliest [[Vedas|Vedic]] (Indo-Aryan) and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] (Iranian) scriptures. "[[Asha]]" is the [[Avestan language]] term (corresponding to [[Vedic language]] [[ṛta]]) for a concept of cardinal importance<ref name="DG_1963_46">{{harvnb|Duchesne-Guillemin|1963|p=46}}.</ref> to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] theology and doctrine. The term "dharma" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of [[Rta]].<ref>Day, Terence P. (1982). ''The Conception of Punishment in Early Indian Literature''. Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. P. 42-45. {{ISBN|0-919812-15-5}}.</ref>

Major philosophers of this era were Rishis Narayana, Kanva, [[Rishabha (hindu sage)|Rishaba]], [[Vamadeva]], and [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]].<ref>P. 285 ''Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary'' By S. Devadas Pillai</ref>

====Middle Vedic period (c. 1200–850 BCE)====
{{See also|Painted Grey Ware culture}}
During the Middle Vedic period Rgveda X, the mantras of the Yajurveda and the older Brahmana texts were composed.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=34}} The [[Brahmans]] became powerful intermediairies.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=35}}

Historical roots of [[Jainism in India]] is traced back to 9th-century BC with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182-183}}

====Late Vedic period (from 850 BCE)====
The Vedic religion evolved into [[Hinduism]] and [[Vedanta]], a religious path considering itself the 'essence' of the Vedas, interpreting the Vedic pantheon as a unitary view of the universe with 'God' (Brahman) seen as immanent and transcendent in the forms of [[Ishvara]] and [[Brahman]]. This post-Vedic systems of thought, along with the [[Upanishads]] and later texts like epics (namely [[Gita]] of [[Mahabharat]]), is a major component of modern Hinduism. The ritualistic traditions of Vedic religion are preserved in the conservative [[Śrauta]] tradition.

===Sanskritization===
{{Main|Sanskritization}}
Since Vedic times, "people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms", a process sometimes called [[Sanskritization]].<ref name="EBHinbduism6">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/266312/Hinduism/8975/Other-sources-the-process-of-Sanskritization Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Other sources: the process of "Sanskritization"''.]</ref> It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts.<ref name="EBHinbduism6" />

{{Main|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism|Early Buddhism|Pre-sectarian Buddhism|History of Buddhism|History of Buddhism in India}}
Buddhism was historically founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], a [[Kshatriya]] prince-turned-ascetic, and was spread beyond India through missionaries. It later experienced a [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline]] in India, but survived in [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], and remains more widespread in [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asia]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who was called an "awakened one" ([[Buddhahood|Buddha]]), was born into the [[Shakya]] clan living at Kapilavastu and Lumbini in what is now southern Nepal. The Buddha was born at Lumbini, as emperor [[Ashoka]]'s Lumbini pillar records, just before the kingdom of [[Magadha]] (which traditionally is said to have lasted from c. 546–324 BCE) rose to power.  The Shakyas claimed [[Angiras (sage)|Angirasa]] and [[Gautama Maharishi]] lineage,<ref>''The Life of Buddha as Legend and History'', by [[Edward J. Thomas|Edward Joseph Thomas]]</ref> via descent from the royal lineage of Ayodhya.

Buddhism emphasises enlightenment (nibbana, nirvana) and liberation from the rounds of rebirth. This objective is pursued through two schools, Theravada, the Way of the Elders (practised in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, SE Asia, etc.) and Mahayana, the Greater Way (practised in Tibet, China, Japan etc.). There may be some differences in the practice between the two schools in reaching the objective.
In the Theravada practice this is pursued in seven stages of purification (visuddhi); viz. physical purification by taking precepts (sila visiddhi), mental purification by insight meditation (citta visuddhi), followed by purification of views and concepts (ditthi visuddhi), purification by overcoming of doubts (kinkha vitarana vishuddhi), purification by acquiring knowledge and wisdom of the right path (maggarmagga-nanadasana visuddhi), attaining knowledge and wisdom through the course of practice (patipada-nanadasana visuddhi), and purification by attaining knowledge and insight wisdom (nanadasana visuddhi).<ref>The Progress of Insight Visuddhinana katha.

Both Jainism and Buddhism spread throughout India during the period of the [[Magadha|Magadha empire]].

[[Buddhism]] in India spread during the reign of [[Ashoka]] of the [[Maurya Empire]], who patronised Buddhist teachings and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name="Heehs_2002_106">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> Jainism began its golden period during the reign of Emperor [[Kharavela]] of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] in the 2nd century BCE.

===Epic and Early Puranic Period (200 BCE – 500 CE)===
{{Main|Pala Empire|Gupta Empire}}

Flood and Muesse take the period between 200 BCE and 500 BCE as a separate period,{{sfn|Flood|1996}}{{sfn|Muesse|2011}} in which the epics and the first puranas were being written.{{sfn|Muesse|2011}} Michaels takes a greater timespan, namely the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} which saw the rise of so-called "Classical Hinduism",{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=38}} with its "golden age"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} during the Gupta Empire.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}}

[[File:Lalita statue.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A basalt statue of [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita]] flanked by [[Gaṇeśa]] and [[Kārttikeya]], Pala era.]]
According to [[Alf Hiltebeitel]], a period of consolidation in the development of Hinduism took place between the time of the late Vedic Upanishad (c. 500 BCE) and the period of the rise of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] (c. 320–467 CE), which he calls the "Hindus synthesis", "Brahmanic synthesis", or "orthodox synthesis".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=12}} It develops in interaction with other religions and peoples:
{{quote|The emerging self-definitions of Hinduism were forged in the context of continuous interaction with heterodox religions (Buddhists, Jains, Ajivikas) throughout this whole period, and with foreign people (Yavanas, or Greeks; Sakas, or Scythians; Pahlavas, or Parthians; and Kusanas, or Kushans) from the third phase on [between the Mauryan empire and the rise of the Guptas].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=13}}}}

The end of the Vedantic period around the 2nd century CE spawned a number of branches that furthered Vedantic philosophy, and which ended up being seminaries in their own right. Prominent amongst these developers were [[Yoga]], [[Dvaita]], [[Advaita]] and the medieval [[Bhakti]] movement.

====Smriti====
The ''smriti'' texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaim the authority of the Vedas, and "nonrejection of the Vedas comes to be one of the most important touchstones for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas."{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=14}} Of the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta "are rooted primarily in the Vedic ''sruti'' tradition and are sometimes called ''smarta'' schools in the sense that they develop ''smarta'' orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like ''smriti'', directly on ''sruti''."{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=18}} According to Hiltebeitel, "the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of ''bhakti''."{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=20}} It is the ''Bhagavadgita'' that seals this achievement. The result is a universal achievement that may be called ''[[Smarta Tradition|smarta]]''. It views Shiva and Vishnu as "complementary in their functions but ontologically identical".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2002|p=20}}

====Vedanta – Brahma sutras (200 BCE)====
{{Main|Vedanta}}
In earlier writings, [[Sanskrit]] 'Vedānta' simply referred to the [[Upanishad]]s, the most speculative and philosophical of the Vedic texts. However, in the medieval period of Hinduism, the word Vedānta came to mean the school of philosophy that interpreted the Upanishads. Traditional Vedānta considers scriptural evidence, or [[Testimony|shabda pramāna]], as the most authentic means of knowledge, while perception, or [[Perception|pratyaksa]], and logical inference, or [[Inference|anumana]], are considered to be subordinate (but valid).{{sfn|Puligandla|1997}}{{sfn|Raju|1992}}

The systematisation of Vedantic ideas into one coherent treatise was undertaken by [[Vyasa|Badarāyana]] in the [[Brahma Sutras]] which was composed around 200 BCE.<ref>{{Citation |first=S. |last=Rādhākrishnan |author-link=Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |title=Indian Philosophy, Volume II |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-563820-4 }}</ref> The cryptic aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras are open to a variety of interpretations. This resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own sub-commentaries.

====Indian philosophy====
{{Main|Indian philosophy}}
After 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Mimāṃsā]] and [[Advaita Vedanta]].<ref name="Radhaxviii-xxi">{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1967|p=xviii–xxi}}.</ref> Hinduism, otherwise a highly polytheistic, pantheistic or monotheistic religion, also tolerated [[atheism in Hinduism|atheistic schools]]. The thoroughly [[materialism|materialistic]] and anti-religious philosophical [[Cārvāka]] school that originated around the 6th century BCE is the most explicitly atheistic school of Indian philosophy. Cārvāka is classified as a ''[[Āstika and nāstika|nāstika]]'' ("heterodox") system; it is not included among the six schools of Hinduism generally regarded as orthodox. It is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref name="Radha227">{{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1967|pp=227–249}}.</ref> Our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and it is no longer a living tradition.<ref name="RChatterjee55">{{harvnb|Chatterjee|Datta|1984|p=55}}.</ref> Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include Samkhya and Mimāṃsā.

====Hindu literature====
[[Image:Sripuram Temple Full View.jpg|thumb|The Golden Temple of [[Mahalakshmi]] at [[Vellore]].]]
{{Main|Mahabharata|Ramayana|Puranas}}
Two of Hinduism's most revered ''epics'', the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]] were compositions of this period. Devotion to particular deities was reflected from the composition of texts composed to their worship. For example, the ''Ganapati Purana'' was written for devotion to Ganapati (or [[Ganesh]]). Popular deities of this era were [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], [[Durga]], [[Surya]], [[Murugan|Skanda]], and [[Ganesh]] (including the forms/incarnations of these deities).

In the latter Vedantic period, several texts were also composed as summaries/attachments to the Upanishads. These texts collectively called as [[Puranas]] allowed for a divine and mythical interpretation of the world, not unlike the ancient Hellenic or Roman religions. Legends and epics with a multitude of gods and goddesses with human-like characteristics were composed.

====Jainism and Buddhism====
{{main|Buddhism and Jainism|Decline of Buddhism in India}}
The Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimize their rule, but they also patronized [[Buddhism]], which continued to provide an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. Buddhism continued to have a significant presence in some regions of India until the 12th century.

There were several Buddhistic kings who [[Vaishnavism|worshiped Vishnu]], such as the [[Gupta Empire]], [[Pala Empire]], [[Malla (India)|Malla Empire]], [[Somavaṃśī dynasty|Somavanshi]], and [[Satavahana]].<ref>Durga Prasad, P. 116, ''History of the Andhras up to 1565 A. D.''</ref> Buddhism survived followed by Hindus.<ref>''National Geographic'' January 2008, VOL. 213, #1</ref>{{refn|group=note| edition reads, "The flow between faiths was such that for hundreds of years, almost all Buddhist temples, including the ones at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], were built under the rule and patronage of Hindu kings."}}

====Tantra====
{{Main|Tantra}}
Tantrism originated in the early centuries CE and developed into a fully articulated tradition by the end of the [[Gupta period]]. According to Michaels this was the "Golden Age of Hinduism"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40-41}} (c. 320–650 CE{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40-41}}), which flourished during the [[Gupta Empire]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} (320 to 550 CE) until the fall of the [[Harsha|Harsha Empire]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} (606 to 647 CE). During this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of far distance trade, standardizarion of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but the orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty.{{sfn|Nakamura|2004|p=687}} The position of the Brahmans was reinforced,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}} and the first Hindu temples emerged during the late Gupta age.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=40}}

===Medieval and Late Puranic Period (500–1500 CE)===

====Late-Classical Period (c. 650–1100 CE)====
:''See also [[History of India#Late Middle Kingdoms - The Late-Classical Age|Late-Classical Age]] and [[History of Hinduism#Middle Ages|Hinduism Middle Ages]]''
After the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with "countless vasal states".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|In the east the [[Pala Empire]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (770–1125 CE{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}), in the west and north the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (7th–10th century{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}), in the southwest the [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (752–973{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}), in the Dekkhan the [[Chalukya dynasty]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (7th–8th century{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}), and in the south the [[Pallava dynasty]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (7th–9th century{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}) and the [[Chola dynasty]]{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}} (9th century{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=41}}).}} The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. "The great king was remote, was exalted and deified",{{sfn|michaels|2004|p=41}} as reflected in the Tantric [[Mandala]], which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.{{sfn|White|2000|pp=25–28}}

The disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}{{refn|group=note|This resembles the development of [[Chinese Chán]] during the [[Chinese Chán#An Lu-shan rebellion|An Lu-shan rebellion]] and the [[Chinese Chán#Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)]], during which power became decentralised end new Chán-schools emerged.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}}} Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of "Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism"{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} was diminished.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Rural and devotional movements arose, along with [[Shaivism]], [[Vaisnavism]], [[Bhakti]] and Tantra,{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} though "sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development".{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}} Buddhism lost its position, and began to disappear in India.{{sfn|Michaels|2004|p=42}}

=====Vedanta=====
{{See also|Advaita Vedanta|Ajativada}}
In the same period [[Vedanta]] changed, incorporating Buddhist thought and its emphasis on consciousness and the working of the mind.{{sfn|Scheepers|2000}} Buddhism, which was supported by the ancient Indian urban civilisation lost influence to the traditional religions, which were rooted in the countryside.{{sfn|Scheepers|2000|p=127-129}} In Bengal, Buddhism was even prosecuted. But at the same time, Buddhism was incorporated into Hinduism, when Gaudapada used Buddhist philosophy to reinterpret the Upanishads.{{sfn|Scheepers|2000}} This also marked a shift from Atman and Brahman as a "living substance"{{sfn|Scheepers|2000|p=123}} to "maya-vada"{{refn|group=note|The term "maya-vada" is primarily being used by non-Advaitins.

=====Bhakti=====
{{Main|Bhakti movement|Alwars|Nayanars}}
The [[Bhakti movement]] began with the emphasis on the worship of God, regardless of one's status – whether priestly or laypeople, men or women, higher social status or lower social status. The movements were mainly centered on the forms of Vishnu ([[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]) and Shiva. There were however popular devotees of this era of [[Durga]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The best-known devotees are the [[Nayanars]] from southern India. The most popular Shaiva teacher of the south was [[Basava]], while of the north it was [[Gorakhnath]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Female saints include figures like [[Akka Mahadevi|Akkamadevi]], [[Lalleshvari]] and [[Molla (poet)|Molla]].

The "alwar" or "azhwars" ({{lang-ta|ஆழ்வார்கள்}}, ''āzvārkaḷ'' {{IPA-ta|aːɻʋaːr|}}, those immersed in god) were [[Tamil people|Tamil]] poet-saints of south India who lived between the 6th and 9th centuries CE and espoused "emotional devotion" or [[bhakti]] to Visnu-Krishna in their songs of longing, ecstasy and service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |title=The Alvars |author=Andrea Nippard |accessdate=20 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001609/http://www.mahavidya.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Nippard-Andrea-The-Alvars-Yes.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}</ref> The most popular Vaishnava teacher of the south was [[Ramanuja]], while of the north it was [[Ramananda]].

Several important icons were women. For example, within the Mahanubhava sect, the women outnumbered the men,<ref>Ramaswamy, P. 204 ''Walking Naked''</ref> and administration was many times composed mainly of women.<ref>Ramaswamy, P. 210 ''Walking Naked''</ref> Mirabai is the most popular female saint in India.

[[Vallabha|Sri Vallabha Acharya]] (1479–1531) is a very important figure from this era. He founded the [[Shuddhadvaita|Shuddha Advaita (''Pure Non-dualism'')]] school of [[Vedanta]] thought.

According to ''The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training'',
{{quote|Vaishanava bhakti literature was an all-India phenomenon, which started in the 6th–7th century A.D. in the [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-speaking region of South India, with twelve Alvar (one immersed in God) saint-poets, who wrote devotional songs.  The religion of [[Alvar]] poets, which included a woman poet, Andal, was devotion to God through love (bhakti), and in the ecstasy of such devotions they sang hundreds of songs which embodied both depth of feeling and felicity of expressions <ref group=web>[http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, ''Indian Literature Through the Ages''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515213735/http://ccrtindia.gov.in/literaryarts.htm |date=15 May 2013 }}</ref>}}

====Early Islamic rule (c. 1100–1500 CE)====
{{Main|Muslim conquest of India|Islamic Empires in India|Bahmani Sultanate|Deccan Sultanates|Delhi Sultanate|Sufism in India|Islam in India}}
In the 12th and 13th centuries, [[Turkic people|Turks]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] invaded parts of northern India and established the [[Delhi Sultanate]] in the former [[Rajput]] holdings.<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Seven.html Battuta's Travels: Delhi, capital of Muslim India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014415/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Seven.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref> The subsequent [[Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi)|Slave dynasty]] of [[Delhi]] managed to conquer large areas of northern India, approximately equal in extent to the ancient [[Gupta Empire]], while the [[Khalji dynasty]] conquered most of central India but were ultimately unsuccessful in conquering and uniting the subcontinent. The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting "Indo-Muslim" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing.

=====Bhakti movement=====
{{more citations needed|date=June 2013}}
During the 14th to 17th centuries, a great ''Bhakti'' movement swept through central and northern India, initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or ''[[Sant (religion)|Sant]]s''. [[Ramananda]], [[Ravidas]], [[Srimanta Sankardeva]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabha Acharya]], [[Sur (poet)|Sur]], [[Meera]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Namdev]], [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Tukaram]] and other mystics spearheaded the Bhakti movement in the North while [[Annamacharya]], [[Kancherla Gopanna|Bhadrachala Ramadas]], [[Tyagaraja]] among others propagated Bhakti in the South. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste, and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by a spate of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces.

=====Lingayatism=====
{{Main|Lingayatism}}
Lingayatism is a distinct Shaivite tradition in India, established in the 12th century by the philosopher and social reformer Basavanna.
The adherents of this tradition are known as Lingayats. The term is derived from Lingavantha in Kannada, meaning 'one who wears ''Ishtalinga'' on their body' (''Ishtalinga'' is the representation of the God). In Lingayat theology, ''Ishtalinga'' is an oval-shaped emblem symbolising Parasiva, the absolute reality. Contemporary Lingayatism follows a progressive reform–based theology propounded, which has great influence in South India, especially in the state of Karnataka.<ref>M. R.

According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and 16th century,
{{quote|... certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophival teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the "six systems" (''saddarsana'') of mainstream Hindu philosophy.{{sfn|Ncholson|2010|p=2}}}}

The tendency of "a blurring of philosophical distinctions"  has also been noted by Burley.{{sfn|Burley|2007|p=34}} Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus,{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=24-33}} and a process of "mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other",{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=27}} which started well before 1800.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=26-27}} Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term "Hinduism" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.{{sfn|Nicholson|2010|p=2}}

=====Sikhism (15th century)=====
{{main|Sikhism}}
{{see also|History of Sikhism|Sikhism and Jainism|Sikhism and Hinduism|Sikhism in India}}
[[Image:Golden Temple India.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Harmandir Sahib]] (''The Golden Temple'') is culturally the most significant place of worship for the [[Sikhs]].]]
Sikhism originated in 15th-century [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]], [[Delhi Sultanate]] (present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]) with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] and nine successive [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]]. The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]''— represented by the sacred symbol of ''[[Ek Onkar|ēk ōaṅkār]]'' [meaning one god]. Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctly associated with the history, society and culture of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Adherents of Sikhism are known as [[Sikhs]] (''students'' or ''disciples'') and number over 27 million across the world.

=====Hinduism=====
{{Main|Hindu reform movements|Neo-Vedanta|Hindutva|Communalism (South Asia)}}
In the 19th century, under influence of the colonial forces, a synthetic vision of Hinduism was formulated by [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]].{{sfn|King|1999}} These thinkers have tended to take an inclusive view of India's religious history, emphasising the similarities between the various Indian religions.{{sfn|King|1999}}

The modern era has given rise to dozens of Hindu saints with international influence.{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} For example, [[Brahma Baba]] established the Brahma Kumaris, one of the largest new Hindu religious movements which teaches the discipline of [[Raja Yoga]] to millions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Representing traditional [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], [[Prabhupada]] founded the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement, another organisation with a global reach. In late 18th-century India, [[Swaminarayan]] founded the [[Swaminarayan Sampraday]]. [[Anandamurti]], founder of the [[Ananda Marga]], has also influenced many worldwide. Through the international influence of all of these new Hindu denominations, many Hindu practices such as yoga, meditation, mantra, divination, and vegetarianism have been adopted by new converts.

=====Jainism=====
{{See also|Jainism and Hinduism}}
Jainism continues to be an influential religion and Jain communities live in Indian states [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].  Jains authored several classical books in different Indian languages for a considerable period of time.

==Similarities and differences==
[[File:Abraham Dharma.png|thumb|right|Map showing the prevalence of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] (pink) and Indian religions (yellow) in each country]]
According to Tilak, the religions of India can be interpreted "differentially" or "integrally",{{sfn|Sharma|2008|p=239}} that is by either highlighting the differences or the similarities.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|p=239}} According to Sherma and Sarma, western Indologists have tended to emphasise the differences, while Indian Indologists have tended to emphasise the similarities.{{sfn|Sherma|2008|p=239}}

=== Similarities ===
[[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]] share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals.{{sfn|Sherma|2008|p=239}} Until the 19th century, adherents of those various religions did not tend to label themselves as in opposition to each other, but "perceived themselves as belonging to the same extended cultural family."{{sfn|Lipner|1998|p=12}}

The spectrum of these religions are called Dharmic religions because of their overlap over the core concept of [[Dharma]]. It has various meanings depending on the context. For example it could mean duty, righteousness, spiritual teachings, conduct etc.

==== Soteriology ====
Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism share the concept of [[moksha]], liberation from the cycle of rebirth.{{sfn|Tiwari|1983|p=210}} They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation.{{sfn|Tiwari|1983|p=210}}

==== Ritual ====
[[File:Bengali marriage.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional bengali marriage ceremony. The bride (bodhu) and groom (bor) are wearing bengali traditional attire.]]
Common traits can also be observed in ritual. The head-anointing ritual of ''[[abhiseka]]'' is of importance in three of these distinct traditions, excluding Sikhism (in Buddhism it is found within [[Vajrayana]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other noteworthy rituals are the cremation of the dead, the wearing of vermilion on the head by married women, and various marital rituals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In literature, many classical narratives and purana have Hindu, Buddhist or Jain versions.<ref group=web>c.f. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], s.v. "Jainism > Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism"</ref> All four traditions have notions of ''[[karma]]'', ''[[dharma]]'', ''[[samsara]]'', ''[[moksha]]'' and various ''forms of [[Yoga]]''.

==== Mythology ====
[[Rama]] is a heroic figure in all of these religions. In Hinduism he is the God-incarnate in the form of a princely king; in Buddhism, he is a [[Bodhisattva]]-incarnate; in Jainism, he is the perfect human being. Among the Buddhist [[Ramayana]]s are: ''Vessantarajataka'',<ref>Pollock, P. 661 ''Literary Cultures in History:''</ref> [[Reamker]], [[Ramakien]], [[Phra Lak Phra Lam]], [[Hikayat Seri Rama]] etc.  There also exists the ''Khamti Ramayana'' among the Khamti tribe of Asom wherein Rama is an [[Avatar]] of a Bodhisattva who incarnates to punish the demon king Ravana (B.Datta 1993). The ''Tai Ramayana'' is another book retelling the divine story in Asom.

=== Differences ===
Critics point out that there exist vast differences between and even within the various Indian religions.{{sfn|Larson|2012|pp=313–314}}{{sfn|Yelle|2012|pp=338–339}} All major religions are composed of innumerable sects and subsects.{{sfn|Rodriques|2008|p=14}}

==== Mythology ====
Indian mythology also reflects the competition between the various Indian religions. A popular story tells how [[Vajrapani]] kills Mahesvara, a manifestation of Shiva depicted as an evil being.{{sfn|Davidson|2004|pp=148–153}}{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=220}} The story occurs in several scriptures, most notably the ''Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha'' and the ''Vajrapany-abhiseka-mahatantra''.{{sfn|Davidson|2004|p=148}}{{refn|group=note|The story begins with the transformation of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra into Vajrapani by Vairocana, the cosmic Buddha, receiving a [[vajra]] and the name "Vajrapani".{{sfn|Davidson|2004|pp=148–150}} Vairocana then requests Vajrapani to generate his adamantine family, to establish a [[mandala]]. Vajrapani refuses, because Mahesvara (Shiva) "is deluding beings with his deceitfull religious doctrines and engaging in all kinds of violent criminal conduct".{{sfn|Davidson|2004|p=150}} Mahesvara and his entourage are dragged to [[Mount Sumeru]], and all but Mahesvara submit. Vajrapani and Mahesvara engage in a magical combat, which is won by Vajrapani. Mahesvara's retinue become part of Vairocana's mandala, except for Mahesvara, who is killed, and his life transferred to another realm where he becomes a buddha named Bhasmesvara-nirghosa, the "Soundless Lord of Ashes".{{sfn|Davidson|2004|p=151}}}} According to Kalupahana, the story "echoes" the story of the conversion of Ambattha.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=220}} It is to be understood in the context of the competition between Buddhist institutions and [[Shaivism]].{{sfn|Davidson|2004|p=152}}

==''Āstika'' and ''nāstika'' categorisation==
{{main|Āstika and nāstika|Hindu philosophy|Buddhism and Hinduism}}
{{see also|Adi Shankara|Charvaka}}
''Āstika'' and ''nāstika'' are variously defined terms sometimes used to categorise Indian religions. The traditional definition, followed by [[Adi Shankara]], classifies religions and persons as ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' according to whether they accept the authority of the main Hindu texts, the Vedas, as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]] are classified as ''āstika'' schools, while [[Charvaka]] is classified as a ''nāstika'' school. Buddhism and Jainism are also thus classified as ''nāstika'' religions since they do not accept the authority of the Vedas.

Another set of definitions—notably distinct from the usage of Hindu philosophy—loosely characterise ''āstika'' as "[[theist]]" and ''nāstika'' as "[[atheist]]". By these definitions, ''Sāṃkhya'' can be considered a ''nāstika'' philosophy, though it is traditionally classed among the Vedic ''āstika'' schools. From this point of view, Buddhism and Jainism remain ''nāstika'' religions.

Buddhists and Jains have disagreed that they are nastika and have redefined the phrases āstika and nāstika in their own view. Jains assign the term nastika to one who is ignorant of the meaning of the religious texts,<ref>Page i, ''Forms of Indian Philosophical Literature and Other Papers'' by V.S. Kambi</ref> or those who deny the existence of the soul was well known to the Jainas.<ref>P. 163 ''Mahāvīra: His Life and Teachings'' by Bimala Churn Law</ref>

=="Dharmic religions"==

{{See also|Saffronization}}
Frawley and Malhotra use the term "Dharmic traditions" to highlight the similarities between the various Indian religions.{{sfn|Frawley|1990|p=27}}{{sfn|Malhotra|2011}}{{refn|group=note|Occasionally the term is also being used by other authors. David Westerlund: "...may provide some possibilities for co-operation with Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists, who like Hindus are regarded as adherents of 'dharmic' religions."<ref>Westerlund, David ''Questioning the Secular State: The Worldwide Resurgence of Religion in Politics'' page 16</ref>}} According to Frawley, "all religions in India have been called the Dharma",{{sfn|Frawley|1990|p=27}} and can be
{{quote|...put under the greater umbrella of "Dharmic traditions" which we can see as Hinduism or the spiritual traditions of India in the broadest sense.{{sfn|Frawley|1990|p=27}}}}

According to Paul Hacker, as described by Halbfass, the term "dharma"
{{quote|...assumed a fundamentally new meaning and function in modern Indian thought, beginning with [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay|Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] in the nineteenth century. This process, in which ''dharma'' was presented as an equivalent of, but also a response to, the western notion of "religion", reflects a fundamental change in the Hindu sense of identity and in the attitude toward other religious and cultural traditions. The foreign tools of "religion" and "nation" became tools of self-definition, and a new and precarious sense of the "unity of Hinduism" and of national as well as religious identity took root.{{sfn|Halbfass|1995|p=10}}}}

The emphasis on the similarities and integral unity of the dharmic faiths has been criticised for neglecting the vast differences between and even within the various Indian religions and traditions.{{sfn|Larson|2012|pp=313–314}}{{sfn|Yelle|2012|pp=338–339}} According to [[Richard E. King]] it is typical of the "inclusivist appropriation of other traditions"{{sfn|King|1999}} of [[Neo-Vedanta]]:
{{quote|The inclusivist appropriation of other traditions, so characteristic of neo-Vedanta ideology, appears on three basic levels. First, it is apparent in the suggestion that the (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy of Sankara (c. eighth century CE) constitutes the central philosophy of Hinduism. Second, in an Indian context, neo-Vedanta philosophy subsumes Buddhist philosophies in terms of its own Vedantic ideology. The Buddha becomes a member of the Vedanta tradition, merely attempting to reform it from within. Finally, at a global level, neo-Vedanta colonizes the religious traditions of the world by arguing for the centrality of a non-dualistic position as the ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'' underlying all cultural differences.{{sfn|King|1999}}}}

The "Council of Dharmic Faiths" (UK) regards [[Zoroastrianism]], whilst not originating in the Indian subcontinent, also as a Dharmic religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://councilofdharmicfaithsuk.com/the-dharmic-faiths.php|title=Council of Dharmic Faiths UK|website=councilofdharmicfaithsuk.com|access-date=27 May 2017}}</ref>

==Status of non-Hindus in the Republic of India==
{{main|Religion in India}}
{{See also|Legal status of Jainism as a distinct religion in India}}
The inclusion of Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs within Hinduism is part of the Indian legal system. The 1955 Hindu Marriage Act "[defines] as Hindus all Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and anyone who is not a Christian, Muslim, Parsee ([[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]) or Jew".{{sfn|Cavanaugh|2009|p=88}} And the Indian Constitution says that "reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion".{{sfn|Cavanaugh|2009|p=88}}

In a judicial reminder, the Indian Supreme Court observed Sikhism and Jainism to be sub-sects or ''special'' faiths within the larger Hindu fold,<ref group=web name="Supreme Court">[http://www.judis.nic.in/supremecourt/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=27098 Supreme Court of India, in the judgement of Bal Patil vs. Union of India, Dec 2005]</ref>{{refn|group=note|In various codified customary laws like Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and other laws of pre and post-Constitution period, the definition of 'Hindu' included all sects and sub-sects of Hindu religions including Sikhs and Jains<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />}} and that Jainism is a denomination within the Hindu fold.<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />{{refn|group=note|The Supreme Court observed in a judgment pertaining to case of Bal Patil vs. Union of India: "Thus, 'Hinduism' can be called a general religion and common faith of India whereas 'Jainism' is a special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion. Jainism places greater emphasis on non-violence ('Ahimsa') and compassion ('Karuna'). Their only difference from Hindus is that Jains do not believe in any creator like God but worship only the perfect human-being whom they called Tirathankar."<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />}} Although the government of British India counted Jains in India as a major religious community right from the first Census conducted in 1873, after independence in 1947 Sikhs and Jains were not treated as national minorities.<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />{{refn|group=note|The so-called minority communities like Sikhs and Jains were not treated as national minorities at the time of framing the Constitution.<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />}} In 2005 the [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to issue a [[writ of Mandamus]] granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India. The Court however left it to the respective [[States and territories of India|states]] to decide on the minority status of Jain religion.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051125/edit.htm#4 |title=Minority rights are indivisible|author=Syed Shahabuddin }}</ref><ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />{{refn|group=note|In an extra-judicial observation not forming part of the judgment the court observed :"Thus, 'Hinduism' can be called a general religion and common faith of India whereas 'Jainism' is a special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion.

Their only difference from Hindus is that Jains do not believe in any creator like God but worship only the perfect human-being whom they called Tirathankar."<ref group=web name="Supreme Court" />}}

However, some individual states have over the past few decades differed on whether Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs are religious minorities or not, by either pronouncing judgments or passing legislation. One example is the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in 2006, in a case pertaining to the state of Uttar Pradesh, which declared Jainism to be indisputably distinct from Hinduism, but mentioned that, "The question as to whether the Jains are part of the Hindu religion is open to debate.<ref name="judis_basic_shiksha">(para 25, Committee of Management Kanya Junior High School Bal Vidya Mandir, Etah, U.P. v. Sachiv, U.P.

Another example is the [[Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill]], that is an amendment to a legislation that sought to define Jains and Buddhists as denominations within Hinduism.<ref group=web>[http://209.85.175.104/search?q=cache:-4pb9oO2u_YJ:www.aiccindia.org/newsite/0804061910/resources/pdf/Gujarat%2520Freedom%2520of%2520Religion%2520Act%2520-%2520text%2520only.pdf+Gujarat+Freedom+of+religions+bill&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=20 Gujarat Freedom of religions Act, 2003]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Ultimately on 31 July 2007, finding it not in conformity with the concept of freedom of religion as embodied in Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, [[Governor of Gujarat|Governor]] [[Naval Kishore Sharma]] returned the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006 citing the widespread protests by the Jains<ref group=web>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story/207905.html |title=Religious freedom Bill returned |newspaper=The Indian Express |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2007}}</ref> as well as Supreme Court's extrajudicial observation that Jainism is a "special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion by the Supreme Court".<ref group=web>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Gujarat_govt_revokes_conversion_amendment/articleshow/2853456.cms The Times of India, 11 Mar, 2008] In his letter dated 27 July 2007 he had said Jainism has been regarded as "special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion by the Supreme Court".</ref>
