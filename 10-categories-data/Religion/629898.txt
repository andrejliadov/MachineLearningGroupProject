'''Babaaláwo''' or '''Babalawo ''' ('''Babalao''' or '''Babalaô''' in [[Latin America]]; literally meaning 'father of the mysteries'  in the [[Yoruba language]]) is a spiritual title that denotes a [[priest]] of the [[Ifá]] [[oracle]]. Ifá is a [[divination]] system that represents the teachings of the [[Orisha|Òrìṣà]] [[Ọrunmila]], the Òrìṣà of Wisdom, who in turn serves as the oracular representative of [[Olodumare]]. A Babalawo's female counterpart is known as an ''[[Iyalawo|Iyaláwo]]'' or ''Ìyánífá''.

==Functions in society==
The Babalawos are believed to ascertain the future of their clients through communication with Ifá. This is done through the interpretation of either the patterns of the [[divination|divining]] chain known as ''[[Opele]]'', or the sacred palm nuts called ''Ikin'', on the traditionally wooden divination tray called ''[[Opon Ifá]]''.

In addition to this, some of them also perform divination services on behalf of the [[king]]s and [[paramount chief]]s of the [[Yoruba people]]. These figures, holders of [[chieftaincy]] titles like '''Araba''' and '''Oluwo Ifa''' in their own right, are members of the recognised [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracies]] of the various Yoruba [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]].

People can visit Babalawos for spiritual consultations, which is known as ''Dafa''. The religious system as a whole has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a “[[Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]."
