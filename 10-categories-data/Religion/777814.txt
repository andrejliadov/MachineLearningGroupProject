'''Elyon''' ([[Biblical Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|עליון}}; [[Masoretic]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|ʿElyōn}}'') is an [[epithet]] of the [[God]] of the [[Israelites]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. ''{{lang|he-Latn|[[El (deity)|ʾĒl]] ʿElyōn}}'' is usually rendered in English as "God Most High", and similarly in the [[Septuagint]] as {{lang|grc|ὁ Θεός ὁ ὕψιστος}} ("God the highest").

The term also has mundane uses, such as "[[wikt:upper|upper]]" (where the ending in both roots is a [[locative case|locative]], not [[superlative]] or [[comparative]]), "top", or "uppermost", referring simply to the position of objects (e.g.  applied to a basket in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 40.17 or to a chamber in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 42.5).

===The compound ''ʼĒl ʻElyōn''===
The compound name ʼĒl ʻElyōn 'God Most High' occurs in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18–20 as the God whose priest was [[Melchizedek]], king of Salem. The form appears again almost immediately in verse 22, used by [[Abraham]] in an oath to the king of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. In this verse the name of God also occurs in apposition to ʼĒl ʻElyōn in the [[Masoretic Text]] but is absent in the Samaritan version, in the Septuagint translation, and in [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Its occurrence here was one foundation of a theory first espoused by [[Julius Wellhausen]] that ʼĒl ʻElyōn was an ancient god of Salem (for other reasons understood here to mean [[Jerusalem]]), later equated with God.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The only other occurrence of the compound expression is in {{Bibleref2|Psalms|78:35|9}}: "And they remembered that God [ʼĒlōhīm] ''was'' their rock, and the high God [ʼĒl ʻElyōn] their redeemer."

The name is repeated later in the chapter, but with a variation: verse fifty-six says ʼElohim ʻElyōn.

It has been suggested that the reference to {{"-}}ʼĒl ʻElyōn, maker of [[heaven]] and earth" in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:19 and 22 reflects a Canaanite background. The phrasing in Genesis resembles a retelling of Canaanite religious traditions in [[Philo of Byblos]]'s account of [[Phoenicia]]n history, in which ʻElyōn was the progenitor of [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]] ("Sky") and [[Gaia]] ("Earth").<ref name="Day2010">{{cite book|author=John Day|title=Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xadCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|date=2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-0-567-53783-6|page=21}}</ref>

===''ʽElyōn'' standing alone===
The name ''ʽElyōn'' 'Most High' standing alone is found in many poetic passages, especially in the Psalms.

It appears in [[Balaam]]'s verse oracle in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 24:16 as a separate name parallel to Ēl.

It appears in [[Moses]]' final song in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 32:8 (a much discussed verse). A translation of the Masoretic text:
{{poemquote|When the Most High (''ʽElyōn'') divided nations,
he separated the sons of man (''Ādām'');
he set the bounds of the masses
according to the number of the [[Israelites|sons of Israel]]}}
Many Septuagint manuscripts have in place of "sons of Israel", ''angelōn theou'' 'angels of God' and a few have ''huiōn theou'' 'sons of God'. The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] fragment 4QDeut<sup>j</sup> reads ''bny ’lwhm'' '[[sons of God]]' ('sons of ’Elohim'). The [[New Revised Standard Version]] translates this as "he fixed the boundaries&nbsp;... according to the number of the gods".<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=+Deuteronomy+32.8&version=NRSV Deuteronomy 32:8 (NRSV)] at Bible Gateway. Retrieved 2019-09.21.</ref>

This passage appears to identify ʽElyōn with ’Elohim, but not ''necessarily'' with [[Yahweh]]. It can be read to mean that ʽElyōn separated mankind into 70 nations according to his [[Generations of Noah|70 sons]] (the 70 sons of Ēl being mentioned in the [[Ugaritic]] texts), each of these sons to be the [[tutelary deity]] over one of the 70 nations, one of them being the god of Israel, Yahweh. Alternatively, it may mean that ʽElyōn, having given the other nations to his sons, now takes Israel for himself under the name of the [[Tetragrammaton]]. Both interpretations have supporters.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:13–14 ʽElyōn is used in a very mystical context in the passage providing the basis for later speculation on the fall of [[Satan]] where the rebellious prince of [[Babylon]] is pictured as boasting:
{{poemquote|I shall be enthroned in the mount of the council in the farthest north [or ''farthest Zaphon'']
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
I will be like the Most High.}}

But ’Elyōn is in other places firmly identified with Yahweh, as in [[Books of Samuel|2&nbsp;Samuel]] 22:14:
{{poemquote|The Lord [YHWH] thundered from [[heaven]],
and the Most High [ʽElyōn] uttered his voice.}}

Also Psalm 97:9: "For you, Lord [YHWH], are Most High [ʽelyōn] over all the earth; you are raised high over all the gods."

==Non-biblical use==

===Sfire I Treaty===
{{main|Sefire steles}}
Outside of the Biblical texts the term "Most High" occurs seldom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The most controversial is in the earliest of three Aramaic treaty inscriptions found at [[al-Safirah]] {{convert|16|miles}} southeast of [[Aleppo]].<ref>''The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures,'' p305. James B. Pritchard, Daniel E. (FRW) Fleming - 2010 "The block of basalt on which the portion of the treaty designated Sfire I is inscribed was broken horizontally into two parts, with the loss of a few lines in between. In addition to the text inscribed upon the front and the back of the "</ref>

The "Sefire I" inscription (''KAI.'' 222.I.A.8–12; ''ANET'' p.&nbsp;659), which dates to about 750 BCE, lists the major patron deities of each side, all of them in pairs coupled by "and", in each case a male god and the god's spouse when the names are known. Then, after a gap comes ''’l wʽlyn''
* This possibly means "’Ēl and ʽElyōn", seemingly also two separate gods, followed by further pairs of deities.
* It is possible also that these indicate two aspects of the same god.
* It might be a single divine name. The [[Ugaritic]] texts contain divine names like ''[[Kothar-wa-Khasis|Kothar waḪasis]]'' "Skillful-and-Clever", ''Mot waShar'' "Death-and-Prince" (or possibly "Death-and-Destruction'), ''Nikkal-and-Ib'', which is in origin the name of the [[Mesopotamian myths|Sumerian]] goddess [[Ningal]] combined with an element of unknown meaning. Therefore, ''Ēl waʽElyōn'' might be a single name 'God-and-Highest' identical in meaning with Biblical ''ʼĒl ʽElyōn'', even though this would be unique.

[[Frank Moore Cross]] (1973) accepts all three interpretations as possibilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Sanchuniathon===
In [[Eusebius]]' account of [[Philo of Byblos]] (c. 64–141 CE) record of [[Sanchuniathon]]'s euhemeristic account of the Phoenician deities, ''Elioun'', whom he calls ''[[Hypsistos]]'' 'the highest' and who is therefore possibly ʿElyōn, is quite separate from his Elus/[[Cronus]] who is the supreme god Ēl.{{Original research inline|date=May 2011}} Sanchuniathon tells only:
<blockquote>In their time is born a certain Elioun called "the Most High," and a female named [[Berith (god)|Beruth]], and these dwelt in the neighbourhood of [[Byblos]].

And from them is born [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|Epigeius]] or Autochthon, whom they afterwards called Sky; so that from him they named the element above us Sky because of the excellence of its beauty. And he has a sister born of the aforesaid parents, who was called Earth, and from her, he says, because of her beauty, they called the earth by the same name. And their father, the Most High, died in an encounter with wild beasts, and was deified, and his children offered to him libations and sacrifices.</blockquote>
According to Sanchuniathon it is from Sky and Earth that Ēl and various other deities are born, though ancient texts refer to Ēl as creator of heaven and earth. The [[Hittites|Hittite]] theogony knows of a primal god named [[Alalu]] who fathered Sky (and possibly Earth) and who was overthrown by his son Sky, who was in turn overthrown by his son [[Kumarbi]]. A similar tradition seems to be at the basis of Sanchuniathon's account.

As to Beruth who is here ʿElyōn's wife, a relationship with Hebrew ''b<sup>ə</sup>rīt'' 'covenant' or with the city of [[Beirut]] have both been suggested.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
