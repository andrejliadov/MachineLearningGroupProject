'''Criticism of Christianity''' has a long history stretching back to the initial formation of the religion during the [[Roman Empire]]. Critics have challenged Christian beliefs and teachings as well as Christian actions, from the [[Crusades]] to [[Christian terrorism|modern terrorism]]. The intellectual arguments against Christianity include the suppositions that it is a faith of violence, corruption, superstition, polytheism, bigotry, pontification, and sectarianism. 

In the [[Early history of Christianity|early years of Christianity]], the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] emerged as one of the major critics with his book ''Against the Christians''. Porphyry argued that Christianity was based on false prophecies that had not yet materialized.<ref>[[Le Roy Froom]], ''Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers '', Vol. I, Washington D.C. Review & Herald 1946, p. 328.</ref> Following the adoption of [[Christianity]] under the Roman Empire, dissenting religious voices were gradually suppressed by both governments and ecclesiastical authorities.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=3–4}} A millennium later, the [[Protestant Reformation]] led to a fundamental split in European Christianity and rekindled critical voices about the Christian faith, both internally and externally. With the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Christianity was criticized by major thinkers and philosophers, such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], [[Thomas Paine]], and the [[Baron d'Holbach]].{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=4}} The central theme of these critiques sought to negate the [[Historicity of the Gospels|historical accuracy of the Christian Bible]] and focused on the perceived corruption of Christian religious authorities.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=4}} Other thinkers, like [[Immanuel Kant]], launched systematic and comprehensive critiques of [[Christian theology]] by attempting to refute [[Existence of God|arguments for theism]].<ref>Kant, Immanuel. ''Critique of Pure Reason'', pp. 553–69</ref>

In modern times, Christianity has faced substantial criticism from a wide array of political movements and ideologies. In the late eighteenth century, the [[French Revolution]] saw a number of politicians and philosophers criticizing traditional Christian doctrines, precipitating a wave of secularism in which hundreds of churches were closed down and thousands of priests were deported.<ref>Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 388–92.</ref> Following the French Revolution, prominent philosophers of [[liberalism]] and [[communism]], such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]], criticized Christian doctrine on the grounds that it was conservative and anti-democratic. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote that Christianity fostered a kind of slave morality that suppressed the desires contained in the human will.<ref>Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton, ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), p.630.</ref> The [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]], and several other modern revolutionary movements have also led to the criticism of Christian ideas.

The formal response of Christians to such criticisms is described as [[Christian apologetics]]. Philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] have been some of the most prominent defenders of the Christian religion since its foundation.

===Biblical criticism===
{{Main|Biblical criticism}}

Biblical criticism, in particular higher criticism, covers a variety of methods used since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in the early 18th century as scholars began to apply to biblical documents the same methods and perspectives which had already been applied to other literary and philosophical texts.<ref>Browning, W.R.F. "[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O94-biblicalcriticism.html Biblical criticism.]" ''A Dictionary of the Bible.'' 1997 ''Encyclopedia.com.'' 8 Apr. 2010</ref> It is an umbrella term covering various techniques used mainly by mainline and liberal Christian theologians to study the meaning of biblical passages. It uses general historical principles, and is based primarily on reason rather than revelation or faith. There are four primary types of biblical criticism:<ref name="RobinsonCriticism">Robinson, B.A. ''[http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_hcri.htm Biblical Criticism, including Form Criticism, Tradition Criticism, Higher Criticism, etc.]'' Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, 2008. Web: 8 Apr 2010.</ref>

* ''Form criticism:'' an analysis of literary documents, particularly the Bible, to discover earlier oral traditions (stories, legends, myths, etc.) upon which they were based.
* ''Tradition criticism:'' an analysis of the Bible, concentrating on how religious traditions grew and changed over the time span during which the text was written.
* ''Higher criticism:'' the study of the sources and literary methods employed by the biblical authors.<ref name=RobinsonCriticism /><ref name="Mather">Mather, G.A. & L.A. Nichols, ''Dictionary of Cults, Sects, Religions and the Occult,'' Zondervan (1993) (quoted in Robinson, ''Biblical Criticism''</ref>
*''Lower criticism:'' the discipline and study of the actual wording of the Bible; a quest for textual purity and understanding.<ref name="Mather" />

====Textual criticism====
{{See also|Textual criticism}}
Within the abundance of biblical manuscripts exist a number of textual variants. The vast majority of these textual variants are the inconsequential misspelling of words, word order variations<ref>[[Bruce Metzger]], cited in ''The Case for Christ'', Lee Strobel</ref> and the mistranscription of abbreviations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |author-link=Bart D.

In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as probably not original. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses being left out or marked as not original. These possible later additions include the following:<ref>{{cite book |last = Ehrman |first = Bart D. |title = Whose Word Is It? |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn = 978-0-8264-9129-9 |page = 166 }}</ref><ref name="Metzger1994">[[Bruce Metzger]] "A Textual Commentary on the New Testament", Second Edition, 1994, German Bible Society</ref>
* The ending of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|16}}
* The story in [[Gospel of John|John]] of the woman taken in adultery, the [[Pericope Adulterae]]
* An explicit reference to the [[Trinity]] in [[1 John]], the [[Johannine Comma]]

In ''The Text Of The New Testament'', [[Kurt Aland|Kurt]] and [[Barbara Aland]] compare the total number of variant-free verses, and the number of variants per page (excluding [[orthography|orthographic]] errors), among the seven major editions of the Greek NT ([[Constantin von Tischendorf#Works|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]], [[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden|von Soden]], Vogels, Merk, Bover and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]]) concluding 62.9%, or 4999/7947, agreement.<ref name="Aland">K. Aland and B. Aland, "''The Text Of The New Testament: An Introduction To The Critical Editions & To The Theory & Practice Of Modern Text Criticism''", 1995, op. cit., pp.&nbsp;29-30.</ref> They concluded, "Thus in nearly two-thirds of the New Testament text, the seven editions of the Greek New Testament which we have reviewed are in complete accord, with no differences other than in orthographical details (e.g., the spelling of names, etc.). Verses in which any one of the seven editions differs by a single word are not counted. This result is quite amazing, demonstrating a far greater agreement among the Greek texts of the New Testament during the past century than [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] would have suspected… In the [[Gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] the agreement is less, while in the [[Epistles|letters]] it is much greater."<ref name="Aland" />

With the discovery of the Hebrew Bible texts among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], questions have been raised about the textual accuracy of the [[Masoretic text]]. That is, whether the Masoretic text which forms the basis of the Protestant [[Old Testament]], or other translations such as the [[Septuagint]], [[Syriac Peshitta]], and [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] are more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Internal consistency===
{{See also|The Bible and History|Internal consistency and the Bible}}

Inconsistencies have been pointed out by critics and skeptics,<ref>See for example the [http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/contra/by_name.html list of alleged contradictions] from ''The Skeptic's Annotated Bible'' and [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]'s article [http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/robert_ingersoll/inspiration_of_bible.html ''Inspiration Of Bible''].</ref> presenting as difficulties the different numbers and names for the same feature and different sequences for what is supposed to be the same event. Responses to these criticisms include the modern [[documentary hypothesis]], [[two-source hypothesis]] (in various guises), and assertions that the [[Pastoral Epistles]] are pseudonymous. Contrasting with these critical stances are positions supported by traditionalists, considering the texts to be consistent, with the [[Torah]] written by a single source,<ref name="Phelan">M.W.J. Phelan. ''The Inspiration of the Pentateuch'', Two-edged Sword Publications (March 9, 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-9547205-6-8}}</ref><ref>Ronald D. Witherup, ''Biblical Fundamentalism: What Every Catholic Should Know'', Liturgical Press (2001), page 26.</ref> but the Gospels by four independent witnesses,<ref name="France2">France, R.T., [[Tyndale New Testament Commentaries]]: Matthew, Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester, England (1985), pg. 17.</ref> and all of the Pauline Epistles, except possibly the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], as having been written by [[Paul the Apostle]].

While consideration of the context is necessary when studying the Bible, some find the accounts of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] within the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, difficult to reconcile. [[E. P. Sanders]] concludes that the inconsistencies make the possibility of a deliberate fraud unlikely: "A plot to foster belief in the Resurrection would probably have resulted in a more consistent story. Instead, there seems to have been a competition: 'I saw him,' 'So did I,' 'The women saw him first,' 'No, I did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on."<ref>Britannica Encyclopedia, ''Jesus Christ'', p.17</ref>

[[Harold Lindsell]] points out that it is a "gross distortion" to state that people who believe in [[biblical inerrancy]] suppose every statement made in the Bible is true (opposed to accurate).<ref name="Lindsell">[[Harold Lindsell|Lindsell, Harold]]. "The Battle for the Bible", Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA (1976), pg. 38.</ref> He indicates there are expressly false statements in the Bible which are reported accurately<ref name="Lindsell" /> (for example, Satan is a liar whose lies are accurately reported as to what he actually said).<ref name="Lindsell" /> Proponents of biblical inerrancy generally do not teach that the Bible was dictated directly by God, but that God used the "distinctive personalities and literary styles of the writers" of scripture and that [[Biblical inspiration|God's inspiration]] guided them to flawlessly project his message through their own language and personality.<ref name="Chicago">{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/chicago1.html|title=Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy}}</ref>{{rp|Art. VIII}}

Those who believe in the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]] of scripture teach that it is [[biblical infallibility|infallible]] (or inerrant), that is, free from error in the truths it expresses by its character as the word of God.<ref>As in {{Bibleref2|2Timothy|3:16|9;31|2 Timothy 3:16}}, discussed by {{Cite book

}}</ref> However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors.<ref name="inerrancy">{{citation |author=Norman L. Geisler |author2=William E. Nix |title=From God To Us Revised and Expanded: How We Got Our Bible |publisher=Moody Publishers |year=2012 |isbn=978-0802483928 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2sP5Ws0yj48C&pg=PT45 |page=PT45}} "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2sP5Ws0yj48C&pg=PT98#v=onepage&q=%22faith%20and%20practice%22&f=false faith and practice]"</ref> Other scholars take stronger views,<ref>See notably Grudem, representative of recent scholarship with this emphasis ({{Cite book|last=Grudem|first=Wayne|year=1994|title=Systematic Theology|url=https://archive.org/details/systematictheolo00grud|url-access=limited|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|location=Nottingham|isbn=978-0-85110-652-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/systematictheolo00grud/page/n717 90]–105}}).</ref> but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of ''[[clarity of scripture|perspicuity]]'', attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).

Infallibility refers to the original texts of the Bible, and all mainstream scholars acknowledge the potential for human error in transmission and translation; yet, through use of [[textual criticism]] modern (critical) copies are considered to "faithfully represent the original",<ref name="Chicago" />{{rp|Art. X}} and our understanding of the original language sufficiently well for accurate translation. The opposing view is that there is too much corruption, or translation too difficult, to agree with modern texts.

===Unfulfilled prophecy===
{{see also|Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions}}

[[File:Abrahamthreeangels.jpg|thumb|right|God reveals himself to [[Abraham]] in scripture and he is seen here with three angels. By [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].]]

Hundreds of years before the time of Jesus, Jewish prophets promised that a [[Jewish Messiah|messiah]] would come. [[Judaism]] claims that Jesus did not fulfill these prophecies. Other skeptics usually claim that the prophecies are either vague or unfulfilled,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/farrell_till/prophecy.html |title=Prophecies: Imaginary and Unfulfilled |accessdate=2007-01-16 |last=Till |first=Farrell |author-link=Farrell Till |year=1991 |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] }}</ref> or that the Old Testament writings influenced the composition of New Testament narratives.<ref>{{cite book |editor=W.

Stoner, ''Science Speaks'', Moody Pr, 1958, {{ISBN|0-8024-7630-9}}</ref> Many Christians anticipate the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus, when he will fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]], such as the [[Last Judgment]], the [[resurrection of the dead|general resurrection]], establishment of the [[Kingdom of God]], and the [[Messianic Age]] (see the article on [[Preterism]] for contrasting Christian views).

The [[New Testament]] traces Jesus' line to that of David; however, according to [[Stephen L. Harris]]:<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Stephen L. |author-link=Stephen L. Harris |title=Understanding the Bible |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ |edition=6 |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill College |isbn=9780767429160 |pages=376–377}} (Further snippets of quote: [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&q=%22deliver+the+covenant+people%22 B] [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&q=%22very+political+powers%22 C] [https://books.google.com/books?id=13MbAQAAMAAJ&q=%22did+not+foresee%22 D])</ref>

: Jesus did not accomplish what Israel's prophets said the Messiah was commissioned to do: He did not deliver the covenant people from their Gentile enemies, reassemble those scattered in the Diaspora, restore the Davidic kingdom, or establish universal peace (cf. {{bibleref2|Isaiah.9:6-7;11:7-12:16||9|Isa. 9:6–7; 11:7–12:16}}, etc.). Instead of freeing Jews from oppressors and thereby fulfilling God's ancient promises—for land, nationhood, kingship, and blessing—Jesus died a "shameful" death, defeated by the very political powers the Messiah was prophesied to overcome. Indeed, the Hebrew prophets did not foresee that Israel's savior would be executed as a common criminal by Gentiles, making Jesus' crucifixion a "stumbling block" to scripturally literate Jews. ({{Bibleref2|1Cor|1:23|niv|1 Cor.1:23}})

Christian preachers reply to this argument by stating that these prophecies will be fulfilled by Jesus in the [[Millennialism|Millennial Reign]] after the [[Great Tribulation]], according to [[New Testament]] prophecies, especially in the [[Book of Revelation]].

The 16th-century [[Judaism|Jewish]] theologian [[Isaac b. Abraham of Troki|Isaac ben Abraham]], who lived in [[Trakai|Trakai, Lithuania]], penned a work called ''Chizzuk Emunah'' (''Faith Strengthened'') that attempted to refute the ideas that [[Jesus]] was the [[Messiah]] prophesied in the [[Old Testament]] and that Christianity was the "[[New Covenant]]" of [[God]]. He systematically identified a number of inconsistencies in the [[New Testament]], contradictions between the New Testament and the [[Old Testament]], and Old Testament prophesies which remained unfulfilled in Jesus' lifetime. In addition, he questioned a number of Christian practices, such as [[Sunday Sabbath]].<ref name="trokibio">{{cite web|url=http://faithstrengthened.org/FS_Biography.html |title=Biography of Isaac ben Abraham of Troki |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141601/http://www.faithstrengthened.org/FS_Biography.html |archive-date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> Written originally for [[Jews]] to persuade them not to convert to [[Christianity]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torahlab.org/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=475|title=TorahLab - Store}}</ref> the work was eventually read by Christians. While the well-known Christian Hebraist [[Johann Christoph Wagenseil]] attempted an elaborate refutation of Abraham's arguments, Wagenseil's [[Latin]] translation of it only increased interest in the work and inspired later Christian [[freethinkers]]. ''Chizzuk Emunah'' was praised as a masterpiece by [[Voltaire]].<ref name="trokibio" />

On the other hand, [[Blaise Pascal]] believed that "[t]he prophecies are the strongest proof of Jesus Christ". He wrote that Jesus was foretold, and that the prophecies came from a succession of people over a span of four thousand years.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Pascal | first = Blaise | title = Pensees |others=Translator W.

He says that even the timing of the [[Messiah]] in years and in relation to events is predicted, and that the Jewish [[Talmud]] (not accepting Jesus as the Messiah, see also [[Rejection of Jesus]]) laments that the Messiah had not appeared despite the scepter being taken away from Judah.<ref>{{Cite book| last = McDowell | first = Josh | author-link =Josh McDowell | chapter = chapter 8 | title = The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict | publisher =Thomas Nelson | year =1999 | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=65qYPwAACAAJ | isbn =9781850785521 }}</ref>

====Prophecy of the Nazarene====
Another example is [[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]] in {{bibleref2|Matthew|2:23|9}}: "And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was <u>spoken</u> by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." The website for [[Jews for Judaism]] claims that "Since a Nazarene is a resident of the city of Nazareth and this city did not exist during the time period of the Jewish Bible, it is impossible to find this quotation in the Hebrew Scriptures. It was fabricated."<ref name="jfj">{{Cite web|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/handbook_english.1.pdf|title=English Handbook Page 34 999KB|access-date=2013-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112134127/http://jewsforjudaism.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/handbook_english.1.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-12|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>See also [http://www.messiahtruth.com/notchristian.html "Given the New Testament a Chance?"] from the Messiah Truth website</ref> However, one common suggestion is that the New Testament verse is based on a passage relating to ''[[Nazirite]]s'', either because this was a misunderstanding common at the time, or through deliberate re-reading of the term by the early Christians. Another suggestion is "that Matthew was playing on the similarity of the Hebrew word ''nezer'' (translated 'Branch' or 'shoot' in {{bibleref2|Isaiah|11:1}} and {{bibleref2|Jeremiah|23:5}}) with the Greek ''nazoraios,'' here translated 'Nazarene.'"<ref name="Sper 1997">David Sper, Managing Editor, [http://www.livingvinechurch.org/ds/q1208/q1208.html "Questions Skeptics Ask About Messianic Prophecies,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120155247/http://www.livingvinechurch.org/ds/q1208/q1208.html |date=2008-11-20 }} RBC Ministries, Grand Rapids, MI, 1997</ref> Christians also suggest that by using an indirect quotation and the plural term prophets, "Matthew was only saying that by living in Nazareth, Jesus was fulfilling the many Old Testament prophecies that He would be despised and rejected."<ref>See {{bibleref2|Ps|22:6-8 || Psalms 22:6-8}},{{bibleref2-nb|Ps|22:13}}; {{bibleref2-nb|Ps|69:8}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Ps|69:20-21}}; {{bibleref2|Isaiah|11:1}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|49:7}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|53:2-3}},{{bibleref2-nb|Isaiah|53:8}}; {{bibleref2|Daniel|9:26}}</ref> The background for this is illustrated by Philip's initial response in {{bibleref2|John|1:46}} to the idea that Jesus might be the Messiah: "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?"<ref name="Sper 1997" />

=== Virgin Birth and descent of Jesus ===
{{See also|Almah|Virgin birth of Jesus|Isaiah 7:14}}

A fundamental principle of the Christian faith is that Jesus was born of Mary, a virgin.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=10-12 & 105}} Both Matthew and Luke trace the genealogy of Joseph back to David. According to Jewish tradition, the Messiah must be a descendant of David, but if Jesus was born of a virgin, he cannot be a descendant of David through Joseph.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=111}} [[Michael Lou Martin|Michael Martin]] asserts that Mary's virginity is a later addition to Christianity as indicated through Paul's letters.{{sfn|Martin|1991|p=112}}  Further, Martin notes that early Christian communities did not seem to have widely believed in the virgin birth. The confusion surrounding the virginity of Mary may result from [[Septuagint]] translation of both {{lang-he|עַלְמָה|almah}} "young girl" and {{lang-he|בְּתוּלָה|bethulah}}, "virgin" into {{lang-el|παρθένος|parthenos}}, which usually means virgin. Relying on this translation, Matthew tried to show that Jesus's virgin birth was foretold in Isaiah 7:14—which refers to an ''almah'' in Hebrew. {{sfn|Martin|1991|p=121}}<ref>[http://www.foreignword.com/Tools/dictsrch_aff.asp?menu=N&query=parthenos&src=CQ&go=Translate&trg=BP The NAS New Testament Greek Lexicon]</ref><ref name="ODCC">Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''Virgin Birth of Christ''</ref>

===Selective interpretation===
{{Main|Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
{{See also|Cafeteria Christianity}}

Critics argue that the selective invocation of portions of the Old Testament is hypocritical, particularly when those portions endorse hostility towards women and homosexuals, when other portions are considered obsolete. The entire Mosaic Law is described in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:24-25}} as a tutor which is no longer necessary, according to some interpretations, see also [[Antinomianism#Antinomianism in the New Testament|Antinomianism in the New Testament]].

On the other hand, many of the [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|Old Testament laws are seen as specifically abrogated]] by the [[New Testament]], such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]],<ref>See, for example, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] described in {{bibleref2|Acts|15}}</ref> though this may simply be a parallel to Jewish [[Noahide Laws]]. See also [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]]. On the other hand, other passages are pro-Law, such as Romans 3:31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law." See also [[Antinomianism#Pauline passages opposing antinomianism|Pauline passages opposing antinomianism]].

===Mistranslation===
{{See also|Bible errata|Bible translations|English translations of the Bible}}

Translation has given rise to a number of issues, as the original languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. While the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]]<ref name="Chicago" /> states that [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] applies only to the original [[language]]s, some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the [[King-James-Only Movement]]. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because some of the words in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.

Criticisms are also sometimes raised because of inconsistencies arising between different English translations of the Hebrew or Greek text. Some Christian interpretations are criticized for reflecting specific doctrinal bias<ref name="jfj" /> or a variant reading between the Masoretic Hebrew and Septuagint Greek manuscripts often quoted in the New Testament.

==Criticism of historical behavior==
Certain interpretations of some moral decisions in the Bible are considered [[ethics|ethically]] questionable by many modern groups.{{who|date=September 2018}} Some of the passages most commonly criticized include [[Christianity and colonialism|colonialism]], the [[Women in Christianity|subjugation of women]], [[religious intolerance]], [[Christianity and homosexuality|condemnation of homosexuality]], and [[Christianity and slavery|support for the institution of slavery]] in both Old and New Testaments.

[[Christianity and colonialism]] are often closely associated because Catholicism and Protestantism were the religions of the European colonial powers<ref>{{cite book |title=Colonialism: an international, social, cultural, and political encyclopedia, Volume 1 |page=496 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |quote=Of all religions, Christianity has been most associated with colonialism because several of its forms (Catholicism and Protestantism) were the religions of the European powers engaged in colonial enterprise on a global scale. |author=Melvin E.

Andrews argues that although Christian missionaries were initially portrayed as "visible saints, exemplars of ideal piety in a sea of persistent savagery", by the time the colonial era drew to a close in the last half of the twentieth century missionaries became viewed as “ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them.” <ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward |last=Andrews |journal=Journal of Church & State |title=Christian Missions and Colonial Empires Reconsidered: A Black Evangelist in West Africa, 1766–1816 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=663–691 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/jcs/csp090 |url=http://jcs.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/03/04/jcs.csp090 |quote=Historians have traditionally looked at Christian missionaries in one of two ways. The first church historians to catalogue missionary history provided hagiographic descriptions of their trials, successes, and sometimes even martyrdom. Missionaries were thus visible saints, exemplars of ideal piety in a sea of persistent savagery. However, by the middle of the twentieth century, an era marked by civil rights movements, anti-colonialism, and growing secularization, missionaries were viewed quite differently. Instead of godly martyrs, historians now described missionaries as arrogant and rapacious imperialists. Christianity became not a saving grace but a monolithic and aggressive force that missionaries imposed upon defiant natives. Indeed, missionaries were now understood as important agents in the ever-expanding nation-state, or “ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them.}}</ref>

Christianity is targeted by critics of colonialism because the tenets of the religion were used to justify the actions of the colonists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jake |last=Meador |title=Cosmetic Christianity and the Problem of Colonialism – Responding to Brian McLaren |url=http://notesfromasmallplace.wordpress.com/2010/09/17/cosmetic-christianity-and-the-problem-of-colonialism-responding-to-brian-mclaren/ |accessdate=17 November 2010 |quote=According to Jake Meador, "some Christians have tried to make sense of post-colonial Christianity by renouncing practically everything about the Christianity of the colonizers.

===Slavery===
{{Main|Christianity and slavery}}
[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|300px|Catholic monks redeeming Christian slaves from North African slaveholders. 17th c.]]
[[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] perspectives of slavery were formed in the contexts of [[Jewish Christianity|Christianity's roots in Judaism]], and as part of the wider culture of the [[Roman Empire]]. Both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s recognize that the institution of slavery existed, with the former sanctioning it within certain limits (Leviticus 25:39-46, Exodus 21:2-21).

[[Saint Paul]] the Apostle in addressing slavery in Ephesians 6:-8{{bibleref2c|Eph.|6:5-8}} neither condemns slavery nor condones it. Nothing in the passage affirms slavery as a naturally valid or divinely mandated institution. Rather, Paul's discussion of the duties of Christian slaves and the responsibilities of Christian masters transforms the institution, even if it falls short of calling for outright abolition. St. Augustine thought slavery was a result of sin, but was part of the fallen world and so should be tolerated. However, others opposed it: John Chrysostom explicitly argued that slavery itself was a sin, but he did not advocate for its abolition; Origen called for the practice of [[manumission]] after six years as found in the Old Testament; others, such as Gregory of Nyssa, Acacius of Amida, and St. Patrick, called for the complete abolition of slavery.<ref>Glenn Sunshine, “Christianity and Slavery,” in True Reason: Confronting the Irrationality of the New Atheism, ed. Tom Gilson and Carson Weitnauer (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel Publications, 2013), 292–293.</ref> On the other hand, others claim that Orthodox Christianity justified slavery on the ground that it was part of the divinely ordained hierarchical order. Not only there are passages in the Bible enjoining slaves to be submissive (Paul to Ephesians: "''slaves, obey your masters with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as you obey Christ; not only while being watched, and in order to please them, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.'' and to Colossians "''Slaves, obey your earthly masters [kyrioi] according to the flesh in everything, not only while being watched and in order to please them, but wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord [kyrios]''"){{sfn|Glancy|2002|p=141-145}} but more to that, St. John Chrysostom wrote ''"The slave should be resigned to his lot, in obeying his master he is obeying God"'' while St. Augustine wrote: ''"...slavery is now penal in character and planned by that law which commands the preservation of the natural order and forbids disturbance"''.{{sfn|Ellerbe|1995|p=90-92 }}

According to one view, today and from a human rights perspective, it is difficult to understand why early Christians did not object to the social institution of slavery. It is uncertain whether one can go so far as to criticise Early Christians, including Paul and other authors of Biblical texts, for their active or passive acceptance of slavery.<ref>[http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1015-87582016000200005 P.G. Kirchschlaeger, "Slavery and Early Christianity - A reflection from a human rights perspective", ''Acta theologica''. vol.36  suppl.23 Bloemfontein  2016, paragraph 4.3. http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/actat.v23i1s.4]</ref> Peter Gruszka attributed the view of early Christian Fathers on slavery to their social environment. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the most prominent fathers such as Clement, Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen and others emerged in Africa and Egypt, where slavery did not exist on large scale. Different was the social environment in Eastern Mediterranean, Syria, Palestine and especially Asia Minor, where slavery was a strong presence and therefore attracted the attention of the Cappadocian fathers of the 4th century.<ref>[https://books.google.gr/books?id=p24Z2Nz4bGsC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false  Youval Rotman, Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 131, 132.

According to [[Jennifer Glancy]], sexual exploitation of slaves in Roman Empire, was helped by Christian morality. Jesus urged his followers to act like slaves, implementing a [[Master–slave morality|slave morality]].  The early Christian theologians were unconcerned about slave morals.<ref name="Brandeis University">{{cite web | title=Habits of Slavery in Early Christianity | website=Brandeis University | url=https://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/conferences/beyond-slavery/videos/jennifer-glancy.html | language=br | access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>

In the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine), a shift in the view of slavery is noticed, which by the 10th century transformed gradually a slave-object into a slave-subject.<ref>Youval Rotman, "Byzantine Slavery and the Mediterranean World", transl. by Jane Marie Todd, Cambridge, Massachusetts – London, Harvard University Press 2009.

Since the Middle Ages, the Christian understanding of slavery has been subjected to significant internal conflict and has endured dramatic change. Nearly all Christian leaders before the late 17th century recognised slavery, within specific biblical limitations, as consistent with Christian [[theology]]. The key verse used to justify slavery was Genesis 9:25-27: "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers. He also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem." which was interpreted to mean that Africans were the descendants of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], cursed with "the mark of Ham" to be servants to the descendants of [[Japheth]] (Europeans) and [[Shem]] (Asians).<ref name="Robinson">{{Cite web| title =Christianity and slavery | first =B.

The "''[[Curse of Ham]]''" along with Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, VI, 5-7 helped American slave owners to balance their beliefs with slavery. There are plenty other pro-slavery verses in the Old Testament that were often quoted{{Which|date=February 2019}}. The New Testament was ignored except in reminding that Jesus never condemned slavery and the ''[[Epistle to Philemon]]'' in which a runaway slave was returned to his owner.<ref name="Rae 2018">{{cite web | last=Rae | first=Noel | title=How Christian Slaveholders Used the Bible to Justify Slavery | website=Time | date=February 23, 2018 | url=http://time.com/5171819/christianity-slavery-book-excerpt/ | access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>

Criticisms from the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]], [[Mennonite]]s, and the [[Amish]] followed suit. Prominent among these Christian abolitionists were [[William Wilberforce]] and [[John Woolman]]. [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote her famous book, ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', according to her Christian beliefs in 1852. Earlier, in Britain and America, [[Quakers]] were active in abolitionism. A group of Quakers founded the first English abolitionist organization<!-- "in 1873" cannot be correct -->, and a Quaker petition brought the issue before government that same year. The Quakers continued to be influential throughout the lifetime of the movement, in many ways leading the way for the campaign. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], was instrumental in starting abolitionism as a popular movement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Abolitionist Movement |encyclopedia=MSN Encyclopedia Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570452_2/Abolitionist_Movement.html |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2007-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029115409/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570452_2/Abolitionist_Movement.html |archive-date=2009-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Many modern [[Christians]] are united in the condemnation of [[slavery]] as wrong and contrary to [[God]]'s will. Only peripheral groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other so-called Christian [[hate group]]s on the racist fringes of the [[Christian Reconstructionism|Christian Reconstructionist]] and [[Christian Identity]] movements advocate the reinstitution of slavery.<ref name="Robinson" /> Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Christians]].<ref name="Martin1996a">Martin, William. 1996.

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] scholar [[Karen Leigh King|Karen King]] writes that more of the many women who contributed to the formation of Christianity in its earliest years are becoming known. Further, she concludes that for centuries in [[Western Christianity]], Mary Magdalene has been wrongly identified as the adulteress and repentant prostitute presented in {{Bibleref2|John|8}}—a connection supposed by tradition but nowhere claimed in the New Testament. According to King, the [[Gospel of Mary]] shows that she was an influential figure, a prominent disciple and leader of one wing of the early Christian movement that promoted women's leadership.

King claims that every sect within [[early Christianity]] which had advocated women's prominence in ancient Christianity was eventually declared [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]], and evidence of women's early leadership roles was erased or suppressed.<ref name="King" />

Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] and [[New Testament]] scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] in their jointly authored book, ''Woman in the World of Jesus,'' document very unfavorable attitudes toward women that prevailed in the world into which Jesus came. They assert that there is no recorded instance where Jesus disgraces, belittles, reproaches, or stereotypes a woman. They interpret the recorded treatment and attitude Jesus showed to women as evidence that the Founder of Christianity treated women with great dignity and respect.<ref>Stagg, Evelyn and Frank.

===Christianity and violence===
{{Main|Christianity and violence}}
Many critics of Christianity have cited the violent acts of Christian nations as a reason to denounce the religion. Science-fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] said that he could not forgive religions for the atrocities and wars over time.<ref>Clarke, Arthur C. & Watts, Alan (January), “At the Interface: Technology and Mysticism”, Playboy (Chicago, Ill.: HMH Publishing) 19 (1): 94, ISSN 0032-1478, OCLC 3534353</ref> [[Richard Dawkins]] makes a similar case in his book, ''[[The God Delusion]]''. In the counterargument book ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]],'' [[Alister McGrath]] responds to Dawkins by suggesting that, far from endorsing "out-group hostility", [[Jesus]] commanded an ethic of "out-group affirmation". McGrath agrees that it is necessary to critique religion, but says that Dawkins seems unaware that it possesses internal means of reform and renewal. While Christians may certainly be accused of failing to live up to Jesus' standard of acceptance, it is there at the heart of the Christian ethic.<ref>[[Alister McGrath]] and Joanna Collicutt McGrath, ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]],'' [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-281-05927-0}}</ref>

Peace, compassion and forgiveness of wrongs done by others are key elements of Christian teaching.<ref>{{bibleref2|Luke|6|9}}</ref> However, Christians have struggled since the days of the [[Church fathers]] with the question of when the use of force is justified.<ref name="Right Reason">{{cite web|last1=Peoples, Dr.|first1=Glenn Andrew|title=Whittling down the pacifist narrative: Did early Christians serve in the army? |url=http://www.rightreason.org/2012/did-early-christians-serve-in-the-army/ |website=www.rightreason.org|accessdate=7 August 2014|date=2012-11-06}}</ref> Such debates have led to concepts such as [[just war theory]].

Denny Weaver adds, "warrior popes, support for [[capital punishment]], [[corporal punishment]] under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child', justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men". Weaver employs a broader definition of violence that extends the meaning of the word to cover "harm or damage", not just physical violence per se. Thus, under his definition, Christian violence includes "forms of systemic violence such as poverty, racism, and sexism".<ref name=Weaver>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1 |title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001 |author=J.

"Nonviolence" also covers a spectrum of attitudes and actions, from the classic Mennonite idea of passive nonresistance through active nonviolence and nonviolent resistance that would include various kinds of social action, confrontations and posing of alternatives that do not do bodily harm or injury.}}</ref>

Christians have also engaged in violence against those that they classify as heretics and non-believers. In ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', critic of religion [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] writes that "...faith inspires violence in at least two ways. First, people often kill other human beings because they believe that the creator of the universe wants them to do it... Second, far greater numbers of people fall into conflict with one another because they define their moral community on the basis of their religious affiliation..."<ref name=SHarris>{{Cite book|title=Letter to a Christian Nation|author=Sam Harris|publisher=Alfred A.

Christian theologians point to a strong [[doctrinal]] and historical imperative within Christianity against violence, particularly Jesus' [[Sermon on the Mount]], which taught nonviolence and love of enemies. Weaver says that Jesus' pacifism was "preserved in the justifiable war doctrine that declares all war as sin even when declaring it occasionally a necessary evil, and in the prohibition of fighting by monastics and clergy as well as in a persistent tradition of [[Christian pacifism]]".<ref name="Weaver2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/weaver0701.htm#TEXT1|title=Violence in Christian Theology|accessdate=2010-10-27|publisher=Cross Currents|year=2001|author=J.

Historically, prohibitions on fighting by monastics and clerics have often been discarded; the notion of military monasticism emerged in the 12th century, in large part because of the advocacy of [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]]. Bernard - and, once the papacy gave sanction to the idea, the entire Catholic Church - believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church's ends in war were inadequate, and that a group of dedicated warrior monks could achieve spiritual merit by waging war, rather than despite it. In this view, war against heretics justified means of waging war that fell outside the bounds of [[just war]]; for example, the [[Teutonic Order]], which received papal sanction, made frequent use of massacres and [[forced conversion|violence to compel conversion]] during the [[Baltic Crusades]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

During the 19th century an interpretive model of the relationship between religion and science known today as the [[conflict theory]] developed, according to which interaction between religion and science almost inevitably leads to hostility and conflict. A popular example was the misconception that people from the [[Science in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]] believed that the [[Myth of the Flat Earth|Earth was flat]], and that only science, freed from religious dogma, had shown that it was spherical. This thesis was a popular [[historiography|historiographical]] approach during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most contemporary [[history of science|historians of science]] now reject it.<ref>Quotation: "The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science."

The astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], mentioned the dispute between the astronomical systems of [[Ptolemy]] (who thought that the sun and planets revolved around the earth) and [[Copernicus]] (who thought the earth and planets revolved around the sun).

==Ethics==
The [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was a notable critic of the ethics of Christianity. See [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche#Christianity and morality]].

===Ethics in the Bible===
{{Main article|Ethics in the Bible}}

The ethics of the Bible have been criticized with some calling it [[Immorality|immoral]] in some of its teachings. [[Slavery]], [[genocide]], [[supersessionism]], the [[death penalty]], [[violence]], [[patriarchy]], sexual intolerance, [[colonialism]], and the [[problem of evil]] and a good God, are examples of criticisms of ethics in the Bible.

The ethics in the Bible  have been criticized, such as the commands in the Old Testament by God to commit [[genocide]], and to spare no one among enemy peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morriston|first1=Wes|title=Ethical Criticism of the Bible: The Case of Divinely Mandated Genocide|journal=Sophia|date=2 August 2011|volume=51|issue=1|pages=117–135|doi=10.1007/s11841-011-0261-5|s2cid=159560414}}</ref> The existence of evil has been argued as evidence of no [[omnipotent]], omnibenevolent being, however skeptical theism suggests that humans do not have the understanding of the big picture to make an adequate assessment. However, a counter argument by Stephen Maitzen suggests that the ethical inconsistency in the bible that is not followed by most Christians or Jews today, such as the execution of homosexuals, blasphemers, disobedient children, or the punishment for mixing linen and cloth, ultimately undermines the skeptical theism argument.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maitzen|first1=Stephen|title=Skeptical Theism and God's Commands|journal=Sophia|date=1 November 2007|volume=46|issue=3|pages=237–243|doi=10.1007/s11841-007-0032-5|s2cid=170737294}}</ref>  Christian ethics have also been criticized for breeding intolerance (such as antisemitic views), and for having a repressive nature. Criticism has also been aimed at the core of Christian ethics, the threat of [[Hell]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=A Companion to Ethics|date=1991|location=Blackwell Oxford|pages=91–105}}</ref>

Some [[left-wing politics|leftists]] and [[libertarianism|libertarians]], including Christians who disavow the [[Christian right|Religious Right]], use the term ''Christian fascism'' or ''[[Christofascism]]'' to describe what some see as an emerging [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] proto-fascism or [[religious nationalism|Evangelical nationalism]] and possible [[theocracy|theocratic]] sentiment in the United States.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp01132005.html Everybody's Talkin' About Christian Fascism] by Gary Leupp.</ref>

====Christian right====
[[Christian right|Conservative Christians]] are often accused of being intolerant by [[secular humanists]] and [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], claiming that they oppose science that seems to contradict scripture ([[Creationism]], use of [[birth control]], [[climate change denial]], [[abortion]], research into [[embryonic stem cell]]s, etc.), [[liberal democracy]] ([[separation of church and state]]), and progressive social policies (rights of people of other races and religions, of women, and of people with different sexual orientations).<ref name="berlet1998">Chip Berlet, "Following the Threads," in Ansell, Amy E.

===Role of women===
There are three major viewpoints within modern Christianity over the role of women. They are known respectively as [[Christian feminism]], [[Christian egalitarianism]] and [[complementarianism]].

* ''Christian feminists'' take a feminist position from a Christian perspective.<ref>See {{cite web|title=About the Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus |url=http://www.eewc.com/About.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710172712/http://www.eewc.com/About.htm |archive-date=July 10, 2011 }}</ref>
* ''Christian egalitarians'' advocate ability-based, rather than gender-based, ministry of Christians of all ages, ethnicities and socio-economic classes.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cbeinternational.org |title=Home - Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE)}}</ref> Egalitarians support the [[ordination of women]] and [[Christian views on marriage#Egalitarian view|equal roles]] in marriage, but are theologically and morally more conservative than Christian feminists and prefer to avoid the label "feminist". A limited notion of gender complementarity is held by some, known as "complementarity without hierarchy".<ref name="DBE">{{cite book |title = Discovering Biblical Equality: Complementarity without Hierarchy |editor1-first = Ronald W. |editor1-last = Pierce |editor2-first = Rebecca Merrill |editor2-last = Groothuis |publisher=IVP |year = 2004 |page = 17 }}</ref>
* ''Complementarians'' support both equality and beneficial differences between men and women.<ref name="Grudem">[[Wayne Grudem|Grudem, Wayne A.]] "Should We Move Beyond the New Testament to a Better Ethic?" ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' (''JETS''), '''47/2''' (June 2004) 299–346</ref> They maintain that men and women have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, therefore must work together to improve on their strengths and help each other in times of weakness.

Some Christians argue that the idea of God as a man is based less on gender but rather on the dominant Patriarchal society of the time in which men acted as leaders and caretakers of the Family.<ref>Eck, Diana L. ''Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras.'' (2003) p. 98</ref> Thus, the idea of God being "The Father" is with regards to his relationship with what are "his children", Christians.

Most mainline Christians claim that the doctrine of the Trinity implies that God should be called Father and not called Mother, in the same way that Jesus was a man and was not a woman.<ref name=Brumley>Brumley, Mark. "[http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/NotMother.htm Why God is Father and not Mother]". ''The Catholic Faith Magazine''. July/August 1999.  Accessed 25 Feb 2013</ref> Jesus tells His followers to address God as Father.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|6:9-13}} He tells his disciples to be merciful as their heavenly Father is merciful.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|6:36}} He says the Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|11:13}} and that the Spirit of their Father will speak through them in times of persecution.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|10:20}} On Easter Sunday, he directs Mary Magdalene to tell the other disciples, "I am going to my Father and your Father...."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|20:17}} Mark Brumley points out that behind New Testament language of Divine Adoption and regeneration is the idea that God is our Father because He is the "source" or "origin" of our new life in Christ. He has saved us through Christ and sanctified us in the Spirit. Brumley claims this is clearly more than a metaphor; the analogy with earthly fatherhood is obvious. God is not merely like a father for Christ's followers; he is really their Father. Among Christians who hold to this idea, there is a distinct sense that Jesus' treatment of women should imply equality in leadership and marital roles every bit as strongly as the definite male gender of Jesus should imply a name of Father for God. Rather than as antifeminist, they characterize alternative naming as unnecessary and unsupported by the words found in the Bible.<ref name=Brumley/>

In 2000, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] voted to revise its "Baptist Faith and Message" (Statement of Faith),<ref name=BFM>"[http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp Baptist Faith and Message] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303000119/http://www.sbc.net/bfm/bfm2000.asp |date=2009-03-03 }}"</ref> opposing women as pastors. While this decision is not binding and would not prevent women from serving as pastors, the revision itself has been criticized by some from within the convention. In the same document, the Southern Baptist Convention took a strong position of the subordinating view of woman in marriage: "A wife is to submit herself ''graciously'' to the servant leadership of her husband. She has the God-given responsibility to respect her husband and to serve as his helper in managing the household and nurturing the next generation."<ref name=BFM/> (Emphasis added)

The Eastern Orthodox Church does not allow female clergy. The Chaldean Catholic Church on the other hand continues to maintain a large number of deaconesses serving alongside male deacons during mass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldaya.net/2008/DailyNews/08/Aug16_08_A1_MaryAssumptions.html|title=الاحتفال بعيد انتقال العذراء مريم في سان دييكو}}</ref>

In some evangelical churches, it is forbidden for women to become pastors, deacons or church elders. In support of such prohibitions, the verse {{Bibleref2|1tim|2:12|KJV|1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:12}} is often cited:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theologicalstudies.citymax.com/page/page/1572472.htm |title=The 9 Most Important Issues Facing the Evangelical Church<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094837/http://www.theologicalstudies.citymax.com/page/page/1572472.htm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Miracles===
{{See also|Miracle|Faith healing}}
[[File:David Hume 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[David Hume]]'s work ''[[Of Miracles]]'' argues against the existence of miracles.]]
Philosopher [[David Hume]] argued against the plausibility of miracles:<ref>{{cite book |last=Hume |first=David |author-link=David Hume |editor=Tom L. Beauchamp |chapter=Chapter 10. Of Religion |title=An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: A Critical Edition |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6d35Aei0KoC&pg=PA86 |work=Volume 3 of The Clarendon edition of the works of David Hume |accessdate=1 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198250609 |page=86}}</ref>

<blockquote><poem>
1) A miracle is a violation of the known laws of nature;
2) We know these laws through repeated and constant experience;
3) The testimony of those who report miracles contradicts the operation of known scientific laws;
4) Consequently no one can rationally believe in miracles.
</poem></blockquote>

The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church reject Hume's argument against miracles outright with the teachings of St. Gregory Palamas, who postulated that Reason alone was not sufficient to understand God's energies (activities such as miracles) and essence, but faith was.<ref>*''Homilies of Saint Gregory Palamas'', Vol. 1 ({{ISBN|1-878997-67-X}}) ''Homilies of Saint Gregory Palamas'', Vol. 2 ({{ISBN|187899767X}})</ref>  Of course, when no one would hear anything classified as Christianity but for the communications of other human beings, the question of just where faith has been placed arises.

Miraculous healings through prayers, often involving the "[[laying on of hands]]", have been reported. However, reliance on [[faith healing]] alone can indirectly contribute to serious harm and even death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sram.org/0802/faith-healing.html |title=Inherent Dangers of Faith-Healing Studies |publisher=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |year=2004 |author=Bruce L.

===Incarnation===
{{Main|Incarnation (Christianity)}}
[[Celsus]] found it hard to reconcile Christian human God who was born and matured with his Jewish God who was supposed to be one and unchanging. He asked "if God wanted to reform humanity, why did he choose to descend and live on earth? How his brief presence in Jerusalem could benefit all the millions of people who lived elsewhere in the world or who had lived and died before his incarnation?"<ref>[[Howard W. Clarke]], The Gospel of Matthew and Its Readers, Indiana University Press, 2003, p. 12</ref>

One classical response is [[Lewis's trilemma]], a [[syllogism]] popularised by [[C. S. Lewis]] that intended to demonstrate the logical inconsistency of both holding [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to be a "great moral teacher" while also denying his divinity. The logical soundness of this trilemma has been widely questioned.<ref>William Lane Craig, ''Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics'', Crossway Books (1994) pages 38-39.</ref>

===Hell and damnation===
{{See also|Problem of Hell|Hell in Christianity}}

[[File:Adamandevesin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adam and Eve]] being driven from Eden due to original sin, portrayed by [[Gustave Doré]].]]

Christianity has been criticized as seeking to persuade people into accepting its authority through simple fear of punishment or, conversely, through hope of reward after death, rather than through rational argumentation or [[empirical evidence]].<ref>"Let no cultured person draw near, none wise and none sensible, for all that kind of thing we count evil; but if any man is ignorant, if any man is wanting in sense and culture, if anybody is a fool, let him come boldly [to become a Christian]. [[Celsus]], AD178</ref> Traditional Christian doctrine dictates that, without faith in Jesus Christ or in the Christian faith in general, one is subject to eternal punishment in [[Hell]].<ref>"Since we all inherit Adam's sin, we all deserve eternal damnation. All who die unbaptized, even infants, will go to hell and suffer unending torment. We have no reason to complain of this, since we are all wicked. (In the Confessions, the Saint enumerates the crimes of which he was guilty in the cradle.) But by God's free grace certain people, among those who have been baptized, are chosen to go to heaven; these are the elect. They do not go to heaven because they are good; we are all totally depraved, except insofar as God's grace, which is only bestowed on the elect, enables us to be otherwise. No reason can be given why some are saved and the rest damned; this is due to God's unmotivated choice. Damnation proves God's justice; salvation His mercy. Both equally display His goodness." ''A history of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell'', Simon & Schuster, 1945</ref>

Critics regard the eternal punishment of those who fail to adopt Christian faith as morally objectionable, and consider it an abhorrent picture of the nature of the world. On a similar theme objections are made against the perceived injustice of punishing a person for all eternity for a temporal crime. Some Christians agree (see [[Annihilationism]] and [[Christian Universalism]]). These beliefs have been considered especially repugnant<ref>Bible Teaching and Religious Practice essay: "Europe and Elsewhere," [[Mark Twain]], 1923)</ref> when the claimed omnipotent God makes, or allows a person to come into existence, with a nature that desires that which God finds objectionable.<ref>[[Albert Einstein]], ''Out of My Later Years (New York: Philosophical Library'', 1950), p. 27</ref>

In the Abrahamic religions, [[Hell]] has traditionally been regarded as a [[punishment]] for wrongdoing or [[sin]] in this life, as a manifestation of divine justice. As in the [[problem of evil]], some apologists argue that the torments of Hell are attributable not to a defect in God's benevolence, but in human [[free will]]. Although a benevolent God would prefer to see everyone saved, he would also allow humans to control their own destinies. This view opens the possibility of seeing Hell not as retributive punishment, but rather as an option that God allows, so that people who do not wish to be with God are not forced to be. [[C. S. Lewis]] most famously proposed this view in his book ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', saying: "There are only two kinds of people in the end: those who say to God, 'Thy will be done,' and those to whom God says, in the end, 'Thy will be done.'"

[[Hell]] is not seen as strictly a matter of retributive justice even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] see it as a condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020901031115/http://home.it.net.au/~jgrapsas/pages/afterdeath.htm |archive-date=2002-09-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that hell is a place of punishment<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1035, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}},1994-the revised version issued 1997 has no changes in this section</ref> brought about by a person's self-exclusion from communion with God.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1033, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, {{ISBN|0-89243-565-8}},1994</ref> In some ancient Eastern Orthodox traditions, Hell and Heaven are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a person to God's love.

Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as [[Marilyn McCord Adams]]) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as humans the awesome responsibility of their eternal destinies.<ref>Richard Beck. "[http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2007/03/christ-and-horrors-part-3-horror-defeat.html Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation]". ''Experimental Theology.'' March 19, 2007.</ref> [[Jonathan Kvanvig]], in his book, ''The Problem of Hell'', agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances. For instance, one should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while [[depression (mood)|depressed]] or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated.<ref>[[Jonathan Kvanvig]], ''The Problem of Hell'', New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-508487-0}}, 1993</ref>

===Idolatry===

Christian have sometimes been accused of idolatry, especially in regards in the [[iconoclastic controversy]].<ref>"The Works of Thomas Manton", by [[Thomas Manton]], p. 99</ref>  However, Orthodox and Roman Catholic Christian forbid worship of icons and relics as divine in themselves, while honouring those represented by them is accepted and philosophically justified by the [[Second Council of Constantinople]].

===Limbo===
The Roman Catholic Church teaches that [[baptism]] is a necessity. In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] [[Augustine of Hippo#Sacramental theology|concluded]] that infants who die without baptism were consigned to hell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg-e.org/maclehose/maw02.html|title="A Tender Age": Chapter 2}}</ref> By the 13th century, theologians referred to the "[[limbo]] of infants" as a place where unbaptized babies were deprived of the vision of God, but did not suffer because they did not know of that which they were deprived, and moreover enjoyed perfect natural happiness. The 1983 Code of Canon Law (1183 §2) specifies that ''"Children whose parents had intended to have them baptized but who died before baptism, may be allowed church funeral rites by the local ordinary"''.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/236788/Code-of-Canon-Law-1983?from_related_doc=1 Canon Law 1983]</ref> In 2007, the 30-member International Theological Commission revisited the concept of limbo.<ref name="catholicnews.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-22 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070508193238/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702216.htm |archive-date=2007-05-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[[n:Vatican abolishes Limbo]]</ref> However, the commission also said that hopefulness was not the same as certainty about the destiny of such infants.<ref name="catholicnews.com" /> Rather, as stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1257, "God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism, but he himself is not bound by his sacraments."<ref>{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|year=1994|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-47967-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/catechismofcatho00cath/page/845 845]|url=https://archive.org/details/catechismofcatho00cath/page/845}}</ref> Hope in the mercy of God is not the same as certainty through the sacraments, but it is not without result, as demonstrated in Jesus' statement to the thief on the cross in Luke 23:42-43.

===Atonement===
The idea of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for [[sin]] is criticized by [[Richard Dawkins]] on the grounds that the image of God as requiring the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0774118/quotes|title=Root of All Evil?|date=9 January 2006|via=IMDb}}</ref> Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is "ignorant" of [[Christian theology]], and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God.<ref>{{Cite book |last=McGrath |first=Alister |author-link=Alister McGrath |title=Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, England |isbn=978-1-4051-2538-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dawkinsgodgenesm0000mcgr/page/81 81] |url=https://archive.org/details/dawkinsgodgenesm0000mcgr/page/81 }}</ref> Responding to the criticism that he is "ignorant" of theology, Dawkins asks, "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in [[leprechaun]]s?"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articleComments,1647,Do-you-have-to-read-up-on-leprechology-before-disbelieving-in-them,Richard-Dawkins-The-Independent,page27 |title=Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in them? |accessdate=2007-11-14 |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=September 17, 2007 |publisher=RichardDawkins.net }}</ref> and "[y]es, I have, of course, met this point before.

''[[Science & Theology News]]'', 2005–04–25.</ref> [[Dinesh D'Souza]] says that Dawkins' criticism "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy."<ref>[[Dinesh D'Souza]], ''What's So Great About Christianity'', Regnery Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59698-517-8}} (2007)</ref> Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.<ref>Andrew Wilson, ''Deluded by Dawkins?'', Kingsway Publications, {{ISBN|978-1-84291-355-0}} (2007)</ref>

[[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Green Ingersoll]] suggests that the concept of the atonement is simply an extension of the Mosaic tradition of blood sacrifice and "is the enemy of morality".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/herman_kittredge/bio_ingersoll/chapter_11.html|title=Ingersoll Biography: Chapter XI}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Brandt | first = Eric T., and Timothy Larsen | title = The Old Atheism Revisited: Robert G.

The prominent Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]], in ''More Than A Carpenter'', addresses the issue through an analogy of a real-life judge in California who was forced to fine his daughter $100 for speeding, but then came down, took off his robe, and paid the fine for her from his billfold,<ref>''More Than A Carpenter'', Tyndale House, Wheaton, Illinois, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-8423-4552-1}}</ref> though as in this and other cases, illustrations are only cautiously intended to describe certain aspects of the atonement.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=978-1-84474-178-6|year=2007|last1=Jeffery|first1=Steve

===Second Coming===
{{Main|Second Coming}}
Several verses in the [[New Testament]] contain [[Jesus]]' predictions that the [[Second Coming]] would take place within a century following his death.<ref>Most notably, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:22-23}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|16:27-28}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|23:36}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|24:29-34}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Matt.|26:62-64}}; {{bibleref2|Mark|9:1}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Mark|14:24-30}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Mark|14:60-62}}; and {{bibleref2|Luke|9:27}}</ref> Jesus appears to promise for his followers the second coming to happen before the generation he is preaching to vanishes. This is seen as an essential failure in the teachings of Christ by many critics such as [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>In his famous essay [[Why I Am Not a Christian]]</ref>

However, [[Preterist]]s argue that Jesus did not mean his second coming{{bibleref2c|Matt.|16:28}} but speaks about demonstrations of his might, formulating this as "coming in his kingdom", especially the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple 70 AD, which he foretold, and by which time not all of his disciples were still living.<ref>Dr. Knox Chamblin, Professor of New Testament Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary: [http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/kno_chamblin/NT.Chamblin.Matt.16.21-28.pdf Commentary on Matthew 16:21-28] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304065934/http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/kno_chamblin/NT.Chamblin.Matt.16.21-28.pdf |date=2012-03-04 }} - see last 4 paragraphs</ref> According to this view {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:23|31}} should be understood in the same way.<ref>Theodor Zahn, F.F. Bruce, J. Barton Payne, etc. hold this opinion [http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/668-what-is-the-meaning-of-matthew-10-23 - What is the meaning of Matthew 10:23?]</ref>

===Inconsistency with Old Testament conception of the afterlife===
{{See also|Afterlife#Christianity}}

Most Christian traditions teach belief in life after death as a central and indispensable tenet of their faith. Critics argue that the Christian conception of the afterlife is inconsistent with that described in the [[Old Testament]]. George E. Mendenhall believes there is no concept of immortality or life after death in the Old Testament.<ref name="autogenerated1">''From Witchcraft to Justice: Death and Afterlife in the Old Testament,'' George E. Mendenhall.</ref> The presumption is that the deceased are inert, lifeless, and engaging in no activity.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

The idea of [[Sheol]] ("שׁאול") or a state of nothingness was shared among [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] and Israelite beliefs. "[[Sheol]], as it was called by the ancient Israelites, is the land of no return, lying below the cosmic ocean, to which all, the mighty and the weak, travel in the ghostly form they assume after death, known as [[Rephaim]]. There the dead have no experience of either joy or pain, perceiving no light, feeling no movement."<ref name="multiply">Hiroshi Obayashi, ''Death and Afterlife: Perspectives of World Religions. See Introduction.</ref> Obayashi alludes that the Israelites were satisfied with such a shadowy realm of afterlife because they were more deeply concerned with survival.<ref name="multiply" />

Before Christianity began in the 1st century, the belief in an afterlife was already prevalent in [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish thinking]]{{NoteTag|See [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|ewish eschatology § Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come]]}} among the [[Pharisees]]<ref>{{bibleref2|Acts|23:6-8|9}}</ref>{{NoteTag|See [[Pharisees#Pharisaic principles and values|Pharisees  § Pharisaic principles and values]]}} and [[Essenes]]{{NoteTag|See [[Essenes#Rules, customs, theology and beliefs|Essenes § Rules, customs, theology and beliefs]]}}. The themes of unity and [[Sheol]] which largely shaped the ancient tradition of Judaism had been undermined when only the most pious of Jews were being massacred during the [[Maccabean]] revolt.

==Criticism of Christians==

===Hypocrisy===
[[File:Proper hands.jpg|thumb|right|20th century flyer distributed by the Ku Klux Klan (then Protestant Christian-dominated), hinting at violence toward Jews and Catholics. Illustration by Rev. [[Branford Clarke]] from ''[[Heroes of the Fiery Cross]]'' (1928) by Bishop [[Alma White]], published by the [[Pillar of Fire Church]] in [[Zarephath, New Jersey]].]]
''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' claims that the example of Christians may be a contributory factor to [[atheism]], writing, "…believers can have more than a little to do with the birth of atheism. To the extent that they neglect their own training in the faith, or teach erroneous doctrine, or are deficient in their religious, moral, or social life, they must be said to conceal rather than reveal the authentic face of God and religion."<ref>''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', 19</ref>

Secular and religious critics have accused many Christians of being hypocritical.<ref name="The Evangelical Scandal">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/32.70.html|title=The Evangelical Scandal}}</ref> Tom Whiteman, a Philadelphia psychologist found that the primary reasons for Christian divorce include adultery, abuse (including substance, physical and verbal abuse), and abandonment whereas the number one reason cited for divorce in the general population was incompatibility.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.christian-parents.net/marriage/M103_Reality_of_Divorce.htm |title=Marriage 103: The Raw Reality of Divorce and its Terrible Results<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327224719/http://www.christian-parents.net/marriage/M103_Reality_of_Divorce.htm |archive-date=2008-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Sectarianism===
{{Main|Sectarianism|Christian denomination}}

Some have argued that Christianity is undermined by the inability of Christians to agree on matters of faith and church governance, and the tendency for the content of their faith to be determined by regional or political factors. [[Schopenhauer]] sarcastically suggested:

: To the South German ecclesiastic the truth of the Catholic dogma is quite obvious, to the North German, the Protestant. If then, these convictions are based on objective reasons, the reasons must be climatic, and thrive, like plants, some only here, some only there. The convictions of those who are thus locally convinced are taken on trust and believed by the masses everywhere.<ref name="multiple29">{{Cite book| last=Schopenhauer | first=Arthur | author-link=Schopenhauer | title=The Essays of Arthur Schopenhauer |author2=trans. T. Bailey Saunders | chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10833/10833-h/10833-h.htm#RULE4_2 | chapter=Religion: A Dialogue}}</ref>

Christians respond that [[Ecumenism]] has helped bring together such communities, where in the past mistranslations of Christological Greek terms may have resulted in seemingly different views. [[Non-denominational Christianity]] represents another approach towards reducing the divisions within Christianity, although many Christian groups claiming to be non-denominational wind up with similar problems.

===Persecution by Christians===
{{Main|Christian debate on persecution and toleration|Christianity and violence}}

Individuals and groups throughout history have been persecuted by certain Christians (and Christian groups) based upon sex, sexual orientation, race, and religion (even within the bounds of Christianity itself). Many of the persecutors attempted to justify their actions with particular scriptural interpretations. During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], important Christian theologians advocated [[religious persecution]] to varying degrees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed a turning point in the Christian debate on persecution and toleration. Nowadays all significant [[Christian denomination]]s embrace [[religious toleration]], and "look back on centuries of persecution with a mixture of revulsion and incomprehension".<ref>see e.g.: John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p. 206.</ref>

[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were themselves persecuted during that time]]. After [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I converted to Christianity]], it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century AD also the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|ancient pagan religions were actively suppressed]]. In the view of many historians, the [[Constantinian shift]] turned Christianity from a persecuted into a persecuting religion.<ref>see e.g.: John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration on Protestant England 1558-1689'', 2000, p.22</ref>

After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the further [[Christianization]] of Europe was to a large extent peaceful.<ref>*Lutz E. von Padberg (1998), ''Die Christianisierung Europas im Mitterlalter'', Reclam {{in lang|de}}, p. 183</ref> However, encounters between [[Christianity and Paganism|Christians and Pagans]] were sometimes confrontational, and some Christian [[king]]s ([[Charlemagne]], [[Olaf I of Norway]]) were known for their violence against pagans. In the late Middle Ages, the appearance of the [[Cathar]]s and [[Bogomils]] in Europe laid the stage for the later [[witch-hunts]]. These (probably [[gnostic]]-influenced) sects were seen as [[heretics]] by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was established to counter them. In the case of the Cathars, the [[Albigensian Crusade]] violently suppressed them. In the Baltic countries, [[Northern Crusades|pagans were killed, subjugated or forcibly baptized]].

From the start of Christian rule in Europe, Jews were increasingly discriminated against, at times rising to outright persecution. This sometimes took the form of events like the [[Rhineland massacres]], and the [[Blood libel]] was often the source (falsely claiming Jews ritually murdered Christian children). Jews were also expelled from a number of countries, including from [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] and later [[Alhambra Decree|Spain]]. In the latter case, if converted they could remain. However, as most did so only under duress, Judaism continued to be [[Crypto-Judaism|practiced in secret]] by many. As a result, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] was formed to root them out, along with the [[Crypto-Islam|secret Muslims]] there. In the [[First Crusade]], after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]], all Jews and Muslims within the city were massacred by the Crusaders.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], the devastation caused by the partly religiously motivated wars ([[Thirty Years' War]], [[English Civil War]], [[French Wars of Religion]]) in Europe in the 17th century gave rise to the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]].

Nazism aimed to transform the subjective consciousness of the German people—their attitudes, values and mentalities—into a single-minded, obedient "national community". The Nazis believed they would therefore have to replace class, religious and regional allegiances.<ref>Ian Kershaw; ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000"; pp. 173–74</ref>  Under the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process, Hitler attempted to create a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] from Germany's 28 existing Protestant churches. The plan failed, and was resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]. Persecution of the [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholic Church in Germany]] followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate [[political catholicism]]. Amid harassment of the Church, the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, and promised to respect Church autonomy. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns, and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years.<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013">Encyclopedia Britannica Online: ''Fascism - Identification with Christianity''; 2013. Web. 14 Apr. 2013</ref>

Hitler was supportive of Christianity in public, yet hostile to it in private. Anti-clericalists like [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Martin Bormann]] saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/> Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an [[anticlerical]] father, but after leaving home Hitler never again attended [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or received the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]]. According to biographer Alan Bullock, Hitler retained some regard for the organisational power of Catholicism but held private contempt for its central teachings, which he said, if taken to their conclusion, "would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure.":<ref name="Hitler p219">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler: A Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>

Joseph Goebbels, the [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]], used his position to widely publicise trials of clergy and nuns in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. In 1928, soon after his election to the Reichstag, Goebbels wrote in his diary that National Socialism was a "religion" that needed a genius to uproot "outmoded religious practices" and put new ones in their place: "One day soon National Socialism will be the religion of all Germans. My Party is my church, and I believe I serve the Lord best if I do his will, and liberate my oppressed people from the fetters of slavery. That is my gospel."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goebbels/filmmore/pt.html|title=American Experience . The Man Behind Hitler . Transcript - PBS}}</ref> As the war progressed, on the "Church Question", he wrote "after the war it has to be generally solved... There is, namely, an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view".<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382"/>

Hitler's chosen deputy and private secretary, [[Martin Bormann]], was a rigid guardian of National Socialist orthodoxy and saw Christianity and Nazism as "incompatible" (mainly because of its Jewish origins),<ref name="Encyclopedia Britannica Online 2013"/><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74248/Martin-Bormann Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Martin Bormann'']; web 25 April 2013</ref> as did the official Nazi philosopher, [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. In his "[[Myth of the Twentieth Century]]" (1930), Rosenberg wrote that the main enemies of the Germans were the "Russian Tartars" and "Semites" - with "Semites" including Christians, especially the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/509892/Alfred-Rosenberg Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Alfred Rosenberg'']; web 25 April 2013.</ref>

According to [[Alan Bullock|Bullock]], Hitler considered the Protestant clergy to be "insignificant" and "submissive" and lacking in a religion to be taken seriously.<ref>Alan Bullock; [[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219"</ref> Hitler attempted to create a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] from 28 separate regional churches through ''[[Gleichschaltung]]''. His bid to create a unified Reich Church ultimately failed, and Hitler became disinterested in supporting the so-called "[[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]]" Nazi aligned movement. Hitler initially lent support to [[Ludwig Muller]], a Nazi and former naval chaplain, to serve as Reich Bishop, but his heretical views against Paul the Apostle and the Semitic origins of Christ and the Bible (see [[Positive Christianity]]) quickly alienated sections of the Protestant church. Lutheran Pastor [[Martin Neimoller]] created the [[Confessing Church]] movement to oppose the Nazification of Protestant churches.<ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London; p.295-297</ref> Neimoller was arrested by the Gestapo in 1937, and sent to the concentration camps.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/414633/Martin-Niemoller Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Martin Niemöller'']; web 24 April 2013</ref> The Confessing Church seminary was prohibited that same year.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/73037/Dietrich-Bonhoeffer Encyclopedia Britannica Online - ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'']; web 25 April 2013</ref>

=== Christian persecution complex ===

[[Christian persecution complex]] is the notion that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoover|2015|p=23}}: According to  Hoover Linda "''...Castelli (2007) believed the reluctance to self-disclose could be the “Christian persecution complex” (p. 156), an ideology that Christian values are unfavorably targeted by social and governmental opposition...''"</ref> According to [[Elizabeth Castelli]], some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century while others point to the 1990s. After the [[September 11 attacks]], it accelerated.<ref>{{harvnb|Årsheim|2016|p=7}}:According to Elizabeth Castelli, this engagement can be ascribed to a ‘Christian persecution complex’ that gathered pace throughout the 1990s, with the adoption of the US International Religious Freedom Act in 1998 as a significant milestone, and with the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as an accelerating factor (Castelli 2007: 173). This complex ''“…mobilizes the language of [[religious persecution]] to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority.”'' (Castelli 2007: 154).</ref> The concept that Christianity is being oppressed is popular among conservative politicians in contemporary politics in the United States, and they utilize this idea to address issues concerning [[LGBT|LGBT people]] or the [[Contraceptive mandate|ACA's Contraceptives Mandate]], which they perceive  as an attack on Christianity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ben-Asher|2017|p=22}}: «...The notion that Christianity is under attack is prevalent in contemporary arguments for religious exemptions. Conservative legislatures, politicians and the media frequently characterize issues such as same-sex marriage and the ACA’s Contraceptives Mandate as attacks on Christians or Christianity....</ref>

Others (like professor [[Candida Moss]] and lecturer Paul Cavill) point out that this mentality of being persecuted roots back to the earliest times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/moss-candida.aspx|title=Professor Candida Moss|website=birmingham.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-21}}</ref> It appeared during the era of [[early Christianity]] due to internal Christian identity politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Janes|Houen|2014|p=24}}: Indeed, a recent study by Candida Moss, ''[[The Myth of Persecution]]'' has suggested that Christian "persecution complex" was the result of internal Christian identity politics''</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/pc504@cam.ac.uk|title=Dr Paul Cavill

The New Testament teaches that persecution is the inevitable by-product of effective Christianity</ref>

==Criticism by other religions==

===Hinduism===
[[Ram Mohan Roy]] criticized Christian doctrines, and asserted that how "unreasonable" and "self-contradictory" they are.<ref>"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness. Page 166, by Abidullah Al-Ansari Ghazi, year = 2010</ref> He further adds that people, even from India were embracing Christianity due to the economic hardship and weakness, just like European Jews were pressured to embrace Christianity, by both encouragement and force.<ref>"Raja Rammohun Roy: Encounter with Islam and Christianity and the Articulation of Hindu Self-Consciousness.

Philosopher [[Dayanand Saraswati]], regarded Christianity as "barbarous religion, and a 'false religion' religion believed only by fools and by the people in a state of barbarism,"<ref>"Gandhi on Pluralism and Communalism", by P.

In 1956 the [[Niyogi Committee Report On Christian Missionary Activities]] was published by the Government of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This influential report on controversial missionary activities in India recommended that suitable controls on conversions brought about through illegal means should be implemented.<ref name=ch6>Chapter 6 Hindutva, Secular India and the Report of the Christian Missionary Activities Enquiry Committee: 1954-57 Sebastian C.H. Kim,  in Nationalism and Hindutva: A Christian Response: Papers from the 10th CMS Consultation, Mark T. B. Laing, 2005 {{ISBN|9788172148386}}</ref> Also in the 1950s, [[K.M. Panikkar]]'s work "Asia and Western Dominance" was published and was one of the first post-Independence Indian critiques of Christian missions. It argued that the attempt to convert Asia has definitely failed, and that this failure was due to the missionaries' claim of a monopoly of truth which was alien to the Asian mind; their association with imperialism and the attitude of moral and [[racial superiority]] of the [[Christian West]].<ref name=ch6/>

The Indian writer and philosopher [[Ram Swarup]] was "most responsible for reviving and re-popularizing" the [[Hindu]] critique of [[Christian missionary]] practices in the 1980s.<ref name="ReferenceA">Pentecostals, Proselytization, and Anti-Christian Violence in Contemporary India by Chad M. Bauman, Oxford University Press, 2015</ref> He insisted that monotheistic religions like Christianity "nurtured among their adherents a lack of respect for other religions".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Other important writers who criticized Christianity from an Indian and Hindu perspective include [[Sita Ram Goel]] and Arun Shourie.<ref name="Sangh Parivar 2005 pp. 224- 237">The Debate on Conversion Initiated by the Sangh Parivar, 1998-1999 Author: Sebastian Kim, Source: Transformation, Vol. 22, No. 4, Christianity and Religions (October 2005), pp. 224- 237</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/> [[Arun Shourie]] urged Hindus to be "alert to the fact that missionaries have but one goal - that of harvesting us for the church"; and he wrote that they have "developed a very well-knit, powerful, extremely well-endowned organizational framework" for attaining that goal.<ref name="Sangh Parivar 2005 pp. 224- 237"/> In his "widely read and cited" book ''Missionaries in India'', Shourie tried to build a case that Christian evangelistic methods were cynically calculating and materialistic, and to Shourie, missionary strategizing "sounded more like the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]], if not the Pentagon, than like Jesus".<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>Dr. Timothy Hembrom.

Indian philosopher [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], wrote: {{quotation|Unfortunately Christian religion inherited the Semitic creed of the ‘jealous God’ in the view of Christ as ‘the only begotten son of God’ so could not brook any rival near the throne. When Europe accepted the Christian religion, in spite of its own broad humanism, it accepted the fierce intolerance which is the natural result of belief in 'the truth once for all delivered to the saints.'<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cDdpTcyJtxMC&pg=PA641 |title = The Philosophy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan |first = Paul Arthur |last = Schilpp |page = 641 |via = [[Google Books]] |isbn = 9788120807921 |year = 1992 }}</ref>}}

===Judaism===
{{see also|Christianity and Judaism}}
[[Shlomo ben Aderet]] called Christianity a lesser form of monotheism that lacks the unified deity of Judaism.<ref>"Judaism and Other Religions", p. 88, publisher = Palgrave Macmillan</ref>

[[David Flusser]] viewed Christianity as "cheaper Judaism" and highly [[anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]]. He also regarded the "failure of Christianity to convert the Jewish people to the new message" as "precisely the reason for the strong anti-Jewish trend in Christianity."<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kin7Y5xcAuIC&pg=PA41 Anti-Judaism and Early Christian Identity: A Critique of the Scholarly Consensus]'', by Miriam S. Taylor, p. 41</ref>

[[Stephen Samuel Wise]] criticized the Christian community for its failure to rescue Jews from Europe during Nazi rule. He wrote that: {{quotation|A Christian world that will permit millions of Jews to be slain without moving heaven by prayer and earth in every human way to save its Jews has lost its capacity for moral and spiritual survival.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/1943/02/19/archive/wise-criticizes-christian-world-for-failure-to-rescue-jews-in-nazi-europe Wise Criticizes Christian World for Failure to Rescue Jews in Nazi Europe] 19 February 1943</ref>}}

===Islam===
{{see also|Christianity and Islam}}
Muslim scholars have criticized Christianity, usually for its [[trinity]] concept. They argue that this doctrine is an invention, distortion of the idea about God, and presentation of the idea that there are three gods, a form of [[shirk (Islam)|shirk]], or polytheism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v26doW8jIyYC ''Christianity: An Introduction''], p. 125, by Alister E. McGrath</ref> According to the Qu'ran, [[At-Tawba]] 31, Christians should follow one God, but they have made multiple.

{{quotation|They have taken as lords beside Allah their rabbis and their monks and the Messiah son of Mary, when they were bidden to worship only One God.<ref>{{cite web |title = At-Tawba, Al Qu'ran |url = http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/nora/html/9-31.html |publisher=University of Leeds |access-date=5 February 2017 }}</ref>}}

==Origins==
{{See also|Historicity of Jesus|Christ myth theory|Christianity and Paganism}}

Some have argued that Christianity is not founded on a historical Jesus, but rather on a [[Jesus-Myth|mythical creation]].<ref>Examples of authors who argue the [[Jesus myth theory]]: [[Thomas L. Thompson]] ''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David '' (Jonathan Cape, Publisher, 2006); [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], ''The Case Against Christianity'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1991), 36–72; [[J.M. Robertson|John Mackinnon Robertson]]</ref> This view proposes that the idea of Jesus was the Jewish manifestation of Hellenistic mystery cults that acknowledged the non-historic nature of their deity using it instead as a teaching device.<ref>Freke, Timothy and Gandy, Peter (1999) The Jesus Mysteries. London: Thorsons (Harper Collins)</ref> However, the position that Jesus was not a historical figure is essentially without support among [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] and [[Classical history|classical historians]].<ref>
<!-- CONSOLIDATION OF CITATIONS UNDER ONE "ref" tag -->Historian [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] stated, "To sum up, modern critical methods fail to support the Christ myth theory. It has 'again and again been answered and annihilated by first rank scholars.' In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary." &mdash;Michael Grant, ''Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels'' (Scribner, 1995).
* "There are those who argue that Jesus is a figment of the Church’s imagination, that there never was a Jesus at all. I have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that any more." &mdash;Burridge, R & Gould, G, ''Jesus Now and Then'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2004, p.34.
* Michael James McClymond, ''Familiar Stranger: An Introduction to Jesus of Nazareth'', Eerdrmans (2004), page 24: "most scholars regard the argument for Jesus' non-existence as unworthy of any response".

Scholars and historians such as [[James H. Charlesworth]] caution against using parallels with [[life-death-rebirth deity|life-death-rebirth gods]] in the widespread [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s prevalent in the [[Hellenistic]] culture to conclude that Jesus is a purely legendary figure. Charlesworth argues that "it would be foolish to continue to foster the illusion that the Gospels are merely fictional stories like the legends of [[Hercules]] and [[Asclepius]]. The theologies in the New Testament are grounded on interpretations of real historical events…"<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Charlesworth |editor-first=James H. |editor-link = James H.
