'''King of Kings''' ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''šar šarrāni'';'''{{sfn|Handy|1994|p=112}}''' [[Old Persian]]: ''Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm'';'''''{{sfn|King of kings in Media and Urartu|p=}}''''' [[Middle Persian]]: ''šāhān šāh'';'''''{{sfn|Yücel|2017|pp=331–344}}''''' [[Modern Persian]]: شاهنشاه, ''Šâhanšâh''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων, ''Basileùs Basiléōn'';'''''{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|p=165}}''''' [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: արքայից արքա, ''ark'ayits ark'a''; [[Georgian language|Georgian]]: მეფეთ მეფე, ''Mepet mepe'';{{sfn|Pinkerton|1811|p=124}} [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: ንጉሠ ነገሥት, ''Nəgusä Nägäst''{{sfn|Dejene|2007|p=539}}) was a ruling title employed primarily by monarchs based in the [[Middle East]]. Though most commonly associated with [[History of Iran|Iran]] (historically known as [[name of Iran|Persia]] in [[Western world|the West]]<ref name="yarshater1">Yarshater, Ehsan [http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm Persia or Iran, Persian or Farsi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033230/http://www.iran-heritage.org/interestgroups/language-article5.htm|date=2010-10-24}}, ''Iranian Studies'', vol. XXII no. 1 (1989)</ref>), especially the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]s, the title was originally introduced during the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] by king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (reigned 1233–1197 BC) and was subsequently used in a number of different kingdoms and empires, including the aforementioned Persia, various Hellenic kingdoms, [[History of Armenia|Armenia]], [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[History of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]].

The title is commonly seen as equivalent to that of [[Emperor]], both titles outranking that of [[king]] in prestige, stemming from the medieval [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] who saw the ''[[Shahanshah]]s'' of the Sasanian Empire as their equals. The last reigning monarchs to use the title of ''Shahanshah'', those of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] in [[Iran]] (1925–1979), also equated the title with "Emperor". The rulers of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] used the title of ''Nəgusä Nägäst'' (literally "King of Kings"), which was officially translated into "Emperor". The female variant of the title, as used by the Ethiopian [[Zewditu]], was '''Queen of Kings''' (Ge'ez: ''Nəgəstä Nägäst''). In the Sasanian Empire, the female variant used was '''Queen of Queens''' (Middle Persian: ''bānbishnān bānbishn'').

In Judaism, Melech Malchei HaMelachim ("the King of Kings of Kings") came to be used as a name of God. "King of Kings" (βασιλεὺς τῶν βασιλευόντων) is also used in reference to [[Jesus Christ]] several times in the Bible, notably in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]] and twice in the [[Book of Revelation]]. In Islam, both the terms King of Kings and as the Persian variant Shahanshah are condemned, particularly in Sunni [[hadith]].

==== Assyria and Babylon ====
[[File:Sculpted reliefs depicting Ashurbanipal, the last great Assyrian king, hunting lions, gypsum hall relief from the North Palace of Nineveh (Irak), c. 645-635 BC, British Museum (16722368932).jpg|left|thumb|''King of Kings'' was among the many titles used by King [[Ashurbanipal]] of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (depicted strangling and stabbing a lion).]]
The title King of Kings was first introduced by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (who reigned between 1233 and 1197 BC) as ''šar šarrāni''. The title carried a literal meaning in that a ''šar'' was traditionally simply the ruler of a [[city-state]]. With the formation of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], the Assyrian rulers installed themselves as kings over an already present system of kingship in these city-states, becoming literal "kings of kings".{{sfn|Handy|1994|p=112}} Following Tukulti-Ninurta's reign, the title was occasionally used by monarchs of Assyria and [[Babylon]].'''''{{sfn|King of kings in Media and Urartu|p=}}''''' Later Assyrian rulers to use ''šar šarrāni'' include [[Esarhaddon]] (r. 681–669 BC) and [[Ashurbanipal]] (r. 669–627 BC).{{sfn|Karlsson|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Karlsson|2017|p=10}} "King of Kings", as ''šar šarrāni'', was among the many titles of the last [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] king, [[Nabonidus]] (r. 556–539 BC).{{sfn|Oshima|2017|p=655}}

Boastful titles claiming ownership of various things were common throughout ancient Mesopotamian history. For instance, Ashurbanipal's great-grandfather [[Sargon II]] used the full titulature of ''[[Great King]]'', ''Mighty King'', ''[[King of the Universe]]'', ''[[King of Assyria]]'', ''[[King of Babylon]]'', ''[[King of Sumer and Akkad]]''.'''''{{sfn|Levin|2002|p=362}}'''''

==== Urartu and Media ====
The title of King of Kings occasionally appears in inscriptions of kings of [[Urartu]].'''''{{sfn|King of kings in Media and Urartu|p=}}''''' Although no evidence exists, it is possible that the title was also used by the rulers of the [[Median empire|Median Empire]], since its rulers borrowed much of their royal symbolism and protocol from Urartu and elsewhere in Mesopotamia. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] Persian variant of the title, ''Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm'', is Median in form which suggests that the Achaemenids may have taken it from the Medes rather than from the Mesopotamians.'''''{{sfn|King of kings in Media and Urartu|p=}}'''''

An Assyrian-language inscription on a fortification near the fortress of [[Tushpa|Tušpa]] mentions King [[Sarduri I]] of Urartu as a builder of a wall and a holder of the title ''King of Kings'';'''''{{sfn|Tušpa (Van)|p=}}'''''{{Quote|text=This is the inscription of king Sarduri, son of the great king Lutipri, the powerful king who does not fear to fight, the amazing shepherd, the king who ruled the rebels.

==== Achaemenid usage ====
[[File:National_Meusem_Darafsh_37.JPG|alt=|thumb|[[Xerxes the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] referred to himself as ''the great king, the king of kings, the king of the provinces with many tongues, the king of this great earth far and near, son of king Darius the Achaemenian''.]]
The Achaemenid Empire, established in 550 BC after the fall of the Median Empire, rapidly expanded over the course of the sixth century BC. [[Asia-Minor|Asia Minor]] and the [[Lydian Kingdom|Lydian kingdom]] was conquered in 546 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC, [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in 525 BC and the [[Indus region]] in 513 BC. The Achaemenids employed satrapal administration, which became a guarantee of success due to its flexibility and the tolerance of the Achaemenid kings for the more-or-less autonomous vassals. The system also had its problems; though some regions became nearly completely autonomous without any fighting (such as Lycia and Cilicia), other regions saw repeated attempts at rebellion and secession.'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=20}}''''' Egypt was a particularly prominent example, frequently rebelling against Achaemenid authority and attempting to crown their own [[Pharaoh]]s. Though it was eventually defeated, the [[Great Satraps' Revolt]] of 366–360 BC showed the growing structural problems within the Empire.'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=21}}'''''

The Achaemenid Kings used a variety of different titles, prominently [[Great King]] and [[King of Countries]], but perhaps the most prominent title was that of King of Kings (rendered ''Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm'' in [[Old Persian]])'''''{{sfn|King of kings in Media and Urartu|p=}}''''', recorded for every Achaemenid king. The full titulature of the king [[Darius the Great|Darius I]] was "great king, king of kings, king in [[Fars Province|Persia]], king of the countries, [[Hystaspes (father of Darius I)|Hystaspes]]’ son, [[Arsames]]’ grandson, an Achaemenid".'''''{{sfn|DARIUS iv. Darius II|p=}}{{sfn|Achaemenid Dynasty|p=}}''''' An inscription in the Armenian city of Van by [[Xerxes I]] reads;'''''{{sfn|Tushpa|p=}}'''''{{Quote|text=I am Xerxes, the great king, the king of kings, the king of the provinces with many tongues, the king of this great earth far and near, son of king Darius the Achaemenian.|sign=Xerxes I of Persia|source=}}

==== Parthian and Sasanian usage ====
[[File:MithridatesIParthiaCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mithridates I of Parthia]] (r. 171–132 BC) was the first post-Achaemenid Iranian king to use the title of ''King of Kings''. Beginning with the reign of his nephew [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]] (r. 124–88 BC), the title remained in consistent usage until the fall of the [[Sasanian Empire]] in 651 AD.]]
The standard royal title of the Arsacid ([[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]) kings while in Babylon was ''Aršaka šarru'' ("Arsacid king"), ''King of Kings'' (recorded as ''šar šarrāni'' by contemporary Babylonians)'''''{{sfn|Simonetta|1966|p=18}}''''' was adopted first by [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] (r. 171–132 BC), though he used it infrequently.{{sfn|Daryaee|2012|p=179}}{{sfn|Schippmann|1986|pp=525–536}} The title first began being consistently used by Mithridates I's nephew, [[Mithridates II of Parthia|Mithridates II]], who after adopting it in 111 BC used it extensively, even including it in his coinage (as the Greek BAΣIΛEΥΣ BAΣIΛEΩN)'''''{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|p=165}}''''' until 91 BC.'''''{{sfn|Shayegan|2011|p=43}}''''' It is possible that Mithridates II's, and his successors', use of the title was not a revival of the old Achaemenid imperial title (since it was not used until almost a decade after Mithridates II's own conquest of Mesopotamia) but actually stemmed from Babylonian scribes who accorded the imperial title of their own ancestors onto the Parthian kings.'''''{{sfn|Shayegan|2011|p=44}}''''' Regardless of how he came to acquire the title, Mithridates II did undertake conscious steps to be seen as an heir to and restorer of Achaemenid traditions, introducing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] as the customary headgear on Parthian coins and undertaking several campaigns westwards into former Achaemenid lands.'''''{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|p=165}}'''''

The title was rendered as ''šāhān šāh'' in [[Middle Persian]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]] and remained in consistent use until the ruling Arsacids were supplanted by the [[Sasanian dynasty]] of [[Ardashir I]], creating the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Ardashir himself used a new variant of the title, introducing "Shahanshah of the Iranians" (Middle Persian: ''šāhān šāh ī ērān''). Ardashir's successor Shapur I introduced another variant; "Shahanshah of the Iranians and non-Iranians" (Middle Persian: ''šāhān šāh ī ērān ud anērān''), possibly only assumed after Shapur's victories against the [[Roman Empire]] (which resulted in the incorporation of new non-Iranian lands into the empire). This variant, ''Shahanshah of Iranians and non-Iranians'', appear on the coinage of all later Sasanian kings.'''''{{sfn|Yücel|2017|pp=331–344}}''''' The final Shahanshah of the Sasanian Empire was [[Yazdegerd III]] (r. 632–651 AD). His reign ended with the defeat and conquest of Persia by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], ending the last pre-Islamic Iranian Empire.{{sfn|Kia|2016|pp=284–285}} The defeat of Yazdegerd and the fall of the Sasanian Empire was a blow to the national sentiment of the Iranians, which was slow to recover. Although attempts were made at restoring the Sasanian Empire, even with [[Tang dynasty|Chinese]] help, these attempts failed and the descendants of Yazdegerd faded into obscurity.'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=84}}''''' The title Shahanshah was criticized by later Muslims, associating it with the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] faith and referring to it as "impious".'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=397}}'''''

The female variant of the title in the Sasanian Empire, as attested for [[Shapur I]]'s (r. 240–270 AD) daughter Adur-Anahid, was the matching ''bānbishnān bānbishn'' ("Queen of Queens"). The similar title ''shahr banbishn'' ("Queen of the empire") is attested for Shapur I's wife [[Khwarranzem]].{{sfn|Sundermann|1988|pp=678–679}}

==== Buyid revival ====
[[File:Adud al-Dawla medallion.jpg|thumb|Panāh Khusraw, better known by his [[laqab]] [['Adud al-Dawla|''<nowiki/>'Adud al-Dawla'']], revived the title of ''Shahanshah'' in Iran in the year 978 AD, more than three centuries after the fall of the [[Sasanian Empire]].]]Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire, Iran was ruled by a series of relatively short-lived Muslim Iranian dynasties; including the [[Samanid Empire|Samanids]] and [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]]. Although Iranian resentment against the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphs]] was common, the resentment materialized as religious and political movements combining old Iranian traditions with new Arabic ones rather than as full-scale revolts. The new dynasties do not appear to have had any interest in re-establishing the empire of the old Shahanshahs, they at no point seriously questioned the suzerainty of the Caliphs and actively promoted Arabic culture. Though the Samanids and the Saffarids also actively promoted the revival of the Persian language, the Samanids remained loyal supporters of the Abbasids and the Saffarids, despite at times being in open rebellion, did not revive any of the old Iranian political structures.'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=85}}'''''

The [[shiite]] [[Buyid dynasty]], of Iranian [[Daylamites|Daylamite]] origin, came to power in 934 AD through most of the old Iranian heartland. In contrast to earlier dynasties, ruled by [[Emir]]s and wanting to appease the powerful ruling [[Caliphs]], the Buyids consciously revived old symbols and practices of the Sasanian Empire.'''''{{sfn|Goldschmidt|2002|p=87}}''''' The region of [[Daylam]] had resisted the Caliphate since the fall of the Sasanian Empire, attempts at restoring a native Iranian rule built on Iranian traditions had been many, though unsuccessful. [[Asfar ibn Shiruya]], a Zoroastrian and Iranian nationalist, rebelled against the Samanids in 928 AD, intending to put a crown on himself, set up a throne of gold and make war on the Caliph. More prominently, [[Mardavij]], who founded the [[Ziyarid dynasty|Ziyarid Dynasty]], was also Zoroastrian and actively aspired to restore the old empire. He was quoted as promising to destroy the empire of the Arabs and restore the Iranian empire and had a crown identical to the one worn by the Sasanian [[Khosrow I]] made for himself.'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=86}}''''' At the time he was murdered by his own Turkic troops, Mardavij was planning a campaign towards [[Baghdad]], the Abbasid capital. Subsequent Ziyarid rulers were Muslim and made no similar attempts.'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=87}}'''''
[['Adud al-Dawla|''<nowiki/>'']]
After the death of Mardavij, many of his troops entered into the service of the founder of the Buyid dynasty, [[Imad al-Dawla]].'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=87}}''''' Finally, the Buyid Emir Panāh Khusraw, better known by his laqab (honorific name) of [['Adud al-Dawla|''<nowiki/>'Adud al-Dawla'']] proclaimed himself ''Shahanshah'' after defeating rebellious relatives and becoming the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty in 978 AD.''{{refn|Though the title being revived by 'Adud al-Dawla is the most common view, some scant evidence suggests that it may have been assumed by Buyid rulers even earlier, possibly by Dawla's father [[Rukn al-Dawla]] or uncle [[Imad al-Dawla]].{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=85}}|group="n"}}'' Those of his successors that likewise exercised full control over all the Buyid emirates would also style themselves as ''Shahanshah''.'''''{{sfn|Clawson|Rubin|p=19|2005}}{{sfn|Kabir|1964|p=240}}'''''
[['Adud al-Dawla|''<nowiki/>'']][['Adud al-Dawla|''<nowiki/>'']]

During times of Buyid infighting, the title became a matter of importance. When a significant portion of Firuz Khusrau's (laqab ''[[Jalal al-Dawla]]'') army rebelled in the 1040s and wished to enthrone the other Buyid Emir [[Abu Kalijar]] as ruler over the lands of the entire dynasty, they minted coins in his name with one side bearing the name of the ruling Caliph ([[Al-Qa'im (Abbasid caliph at Baghdad)|Al-Qa'im]]) and the other side bearing the inscription "''al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah''".'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=395}}''''' When discussing peace terms, Abu Kalijar in turn addressed Jalal in a letter with the title ''Shahanshah''.'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=396}}'''''

When the struggle between Abu Kalijar and Jalal al-Dawla resumed, Jalal, wanting to assert his superiority over Kalijar, made a formal application to Caliph Al-Qa'im for the usage of the title ''Shahanshah'', the first Buyid ruler to do so. It can be assumed that the Caliph agreed (since the title was later used), but its usage by Jalal in a mosque caused outcry at its impious character.'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=397}}''''' Following this, the matter was raised to a body of jurists assembled by the Caliph. Though some dissented, the body as a whole ruled that the usage of ''al-Malik al-Adil Shahanshah'' was lawful.'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=398}}'''''

=== Hellenic usage ===
[[File:Houghton 1235 Timarchus.jpg|left|thumb|Although the Hellenic [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rulers frequently assumed old Persian titles and honors, the usurper [[Timarchus]] is one of few concrete examples of a Seleucid ruler using the title "King of Kings".]]
[[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests ended the Achaemenid Empire and the subsequent division of Alexander's own empire resulted in the [[Seleucid dynasty]] inherting the lands formerly associated with the Achaemenid dynasty. Although Alexander himself did not employ any of the old Persian royal titles, instead using his own new title "King of Asia" (βασιλεὺς τῆς Ἀσίας)'''''{{sfn|Fredricksmeyer|2000|pp=136–166}}''''', the monarchs of the [[Seleucid Empire]] more and more aligned themselves to the Persian political system. The official title of most of the Seleucid kings was "Great King", which like "King of Kings", a title of Assyrian origin, was frequently used by the Achaemenid rulers and was intended to demonstrate the supremacy of its holder over other rulers. "Great King" is prominently attested for both [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus I]] (r. 281–261 BC) in the Borsippa Cylinder and for [[Antiochus III the Great]] (r. 222–187 BC) throughout his rule.'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=27}}'''''

In the late Seleucid Empire, "King of Kings" even saw a revival, despite the fact that the territory controlled by the Empire was significantly smaller than it had been during the reigns of the early Seleucid kings. The title was evidently quite well known to be associated with the Seleucid king, the usurper [[Timarchus]] (active 163–160 BC) called himself "King of Kings" and the title was discussed in sources from outside the empire as well.'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=28}}''''' Some non-Seleucid rulers even assumed the title for themselves, notably in [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] (especially prominently used under [[Mithridates VI Eupator]]).'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=28}}{{sfn|Kotansky|1994|p=181}}'''''

It is possible that the Seleucid usage indicates that the title no longer implied complete vassalization of other kings but instead a recognition of suzerainty (since the Seleucids were rapidly losing the loyalty of their vassals at the time).'''''{{sfn|Engels|2011|p=28}}'''''

=== Armenia and Georgia ===
[[Image:Tigranes four Kings.jpg|280px|thumb|right|The King of Kings [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Great Armenia|Armenia]] with four vassal Kings surrounding him]]
After the Parthian Empire under Mithridates II defeated [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] in 105 BC, the heir to the Armenian throne, [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes]], was taken hostage and kept at the Parthian court until he bought his freedom in 95 BC (by handing over "seventy valleys" in [[Atropatene]]) and assumed the Armenian throne.'''''{{sfn|Strabo, Geography|p=}}''''' Tigranes ruled, for a short time in the first century BC, the strongest empire in the Middle East which he had built himself. After conquering Syria in 83 BC, Tigranes assumed the title ''King of Kings''.'''''{{sfn|Olbrycht|2009|p=178}}''''' The Armenian kings of the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] from the reign of [[Ashot III of Armenia|Ashot III]] 953–977 AD to the dynasty's end in 1064 AD revived the title, rendering it as the Persian ''Shahanshah''.'''''{{sfn|Greenwood|2011|p=52}}'''''

''King of Kings'' was revived in the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] by King [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] (r. 1089–1125 AD), rendered as ''[[Style of the Georgian sovereign|mepet mepe]]'' in [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. All subsequent Georgian monarchs, such as [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]], used the title to describe their rule over all Georgian principalities, vassals and tributaries. Their use of the title probably derived from the ancient Persian title.'''''{{sfn|Dzagnidze|2018|p=}}{{sfn|Vashalomidze|2007|p=151}}'''''

=== Palmyra ===
After a successful campaign against the Sasanian Empire in 262 AD, which restored Roman control to territories that had been lost to the ''Shahanshah'' [[Shapur I]], the ruler of the city of Palmyra, [[Odaenathus]], founded the Palmyrene kingdom. Though a Roman vassal, Odaenathus assumed the title ''Mlk Mlk dy Mdnh'' (King of Kings and Corrector of the East). Odaenathus son, [[Hairan I|Herodianus]] (Hairan I) was acclaimed as his co-monarch, also given the title King of Kings.{{sfn|Hartmann|2001|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BdcHK8Ll1jMC&pg=PA149 149], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BdcHK8Ll1jMC&pg=PA176 176], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BdcHK8Ll1jMC&pg=PA178 178]}}{{sfn|Andrade|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y6IaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA333 333]}} Usage of the title was probably justified through proclaiming the Palmyrene kingdom as the legitimate successor state of the Hellenic Seleucid empire, which had controlled roughly the same territories near its end. Herodianus was crowned at [[Antioch]], which had been the final Seleucid capital.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y6IaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA333 333]}}

Though the same title was used by Odaenathus second son and successor following the deaths of both Odaenathus and Herodianus, [[Vaballathus]] and his mother [[Zenobia]] soon relinquished it, instead opting for the Roman ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' ("Emperor") and ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' ("Empress") respectively.{{sfn|Ando|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G9qqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA210 210]}}

=== Ethiopia ===
The title King of Kings was used by [[List of kings of Axum|the rulers]] of the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Kingdom]] since the reign [[Sembrouthes]] c. 250 AD.{{sfn|Kobishchanov|1979|p=195}} The rulers of the [[Ethiopian Empire]], which existed from 1270 to 1974 AD, also used the title of ''Nəgusä Nägäst'', sometimes translated to "King of the Kingdom", but most often equated to "King of Kings" and officially translated to Emperor. Though the Ethiopian Emperors had been literal "Kings of Kings" for the duration of the Empire's history, with regional lords using the title of ''Nəgus'' ("king"), this practice was ended by [[Haile Selassie]] (r. 1930–1974 AD), who somewhat paradoxically still retained the use of ''Nəgusä Nägäst''.{{sfn|Dejene|2007|p=539}} Empress [[Zewditu]] (r. 1916–1930 AD), the only female monarch of the Ethiopian Empire, assumed the variant "Queen of Kings" (''Nəgəstä Nägäst'').{{sfn|Kiunguyu|2018|p=}}{{sfn|Tesfu|2008|p=}}

And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS." |sign=|source=Book of Revelation 19:11–12, 16}}Some Christian realms ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Ethiopia]]) employed the title and it was part of the motto of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperors]] of the [[Palaiologan period]], Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων Βασιλεύων Βασιλευόντων (''Basileus Basileōn, Basileuōn Basileuontōn'', literally "King of Kings, ruling over those who rule").{{sfn|Atlagić|1997|p=2}} In the Byzantine Empire the word Βασιλεὺς (Basileus), which had meant "king" in ancient times had taken up the meaning of "emperor" instead. Byzantine rulers translated "Basileus" into "Imperator" when using Latin and called other kings ''rēx'' or ''rēgas'', hellenized forms of the Latin title ''[[Rex (title)|rex]]''.'''''{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=264}}{{sfn|Morrisson|2013|p=72}}''''' As such, Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων in the Byzantine Empire would have meant "Emperor of Emperors". The Byzantine rulers only accorded the title of Basileus onto two foreign rulers they considered to be their equals, the [[Kings of Axum]] and the ''Shahanshahs'' of the Sasanian Empire, leading to "King of Kings" being equated to the rank of "Emperor" in the view of the West.'''''{{sfn|Chrysos|1978|p=42}}'''''

=== Islam ===
Following the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651 AD, the title of ''Shahanshah'' was sternly criticized in the Muslim world. It was problematic enough that the adoption of ''Shahanshah'' by the Muslim Buyid dynasty in Persia required a body of jurists to agree on its lawfulness'''''{{sfn|Amedroz|1905|p=398}}''''' and the title itself (both as "king of kings" and as the Persian variant ''Shahanshah'') is condemned in Sunni [[hadith]], a prominent example being [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] Book 73 Hadiths 224 and 225;'''''{{sfn|Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadith 224|p=}}{{sfn|Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadith 225|p=}}'''''
{{Quote|text=Allah's Apostle said, "The most awful name in Allah's sight on the Day of Resurrection, will be (that of) a man calling himself Malik Al-Amlak (the king of kings)."|sign=|source=Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadith 224}}{{Quote|text=The Prophet said, "The most awful (meanest) name in Allah's sight." Sufyan said more than once, "The most awful (meanest) name in Allah's sight is (that of) a man calling himself king of kings." Sufyan said, "Somebody else (i.e. other than Abu Az-Zinad, a sub-narrator) says: What is meant by 'The king of kings' is 'Shahan Shah.,"|sign=|source=Sahih al-Bukhari Book 73 Hadith 225}}The condemnation of the title within the Islamic world may stem from that the concept of God alone being king had been prominent in early Islam. Opposing worldly kingship, the use of "King of Kings" was obnoxious and blasphemous.'''''{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=84}}'''''

== Modern usage ==
===Iran===
[[File:Mohammad-reza-shah.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (r. 1941–1979) was the last [[List of monarchs of Persia|monarch]] of [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and the last Iranian ruler to take the title ''Shahanshah''.]]
After the end of the [[Buyid dynasty]] in 1062 AD, the title of ''Shahanshah'' wouldn't be adopted by another Iranian ruler until [[Ismail I]], the founder of the [[Safavid dynasty]]. Upon his capture of [[Tabriz]] in 1501 AD, more than four hundred years after the end of the Buyid dynasty, Ismail proclaimed himself the Shāh of [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] and the Shahanshah of Iran.'''''{{sfn|Lenczowski|1978|p=79}}''''' The term ''šāhanšāh-e Irān,'' King of Kings of Iran, is richly attested for the Safavid period and for the preceding [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] period (when it was not in use).'''''{{sfn|Iranian Identity|p=}}''''' [[Nader Shah]], founder of the later [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid Dynasty]], assumed the title ''šāhanšāh'' in 1739 to emphasize his superiority over [[Muhammad Shah]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] in India.'''''{{sfn|NĀDER SHAH|p=}}'''''

The title ''Shahanshah'' is also attested for [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]] (r. 1797–1834). Fath-Ali's reign was noted for its pomp and elaborate court protocol.'''''{{sfn|The Court of Fath 'Ali Shah at the Nowrooz Salaam Ceremony|p=}}''''' An 1813/1814 portrait of Fath-Ali contains a poem with the title; "Is this a portrait of a shahanshah, inhabitant of the skies / Or is it the rising of the sun and the image of the moon?".'''''{{sfn|Portrait of Fath Ali Shah Seated|p=}}'''''

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown in 1925, replaced by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. Both reigning members of this dynasty, [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]] (r. 1925–1941) and [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] (r. 1941–1979), before they too were overthrown as part of the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian revolution]] in 1979, used the title of ''Shahanshah''.'''''{{sfn|Saikal|Schnabel|p=9|2003}}''''' Although Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had reigned as ''Shah'' for twenty-six years by then, he only took the title of ''Shahanshah'' on 26 October 1967 in a lavish [[coronation ceremony]] held in [[Tehran]]. He said that he chose to wait until this moment to assume the title because in his own opinion he "did not deserve it" up until then; he is also recorded as saying that there was "no honour in being Emperor of a poor country" (which he viewed Iran as being until that time).'''''{{sfn|National Geographic Magazine|p=9|}}''''' The current head of the exiled house of Pahlavi, [[Reza Pahlavi II]], symbolically declared himself ''Shahanshah'' at the age of 21 after the death of his father in 1980.'''''{{sfn|Goodspeed|2010|p=}}'''''

===Muammar Gaddafi===
In 2008, the [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] claimed the title of "King of Kings" after a gathering of more than 200 African [[tribal king]]s and chiefs endorsed his use of the title on 28 August that year, stating that "We have decided to recognise our brotherly leader as the 'king of kings, sultans, princes, sheikhs and mayors of Africa". At the meeting, held in the city of [[Benghazi]], Gaddafi was given gifts including a throne, an 18th-century [[Quran|Qur'an]], traditional outfits and [[ostrich egg]]s. At the same meeting, Gaddafi urged his guests to put pressure on their own governments and speed the process of moving towards a unified African continent. Gaddafi told those that attended the meeting that "We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa".'''''{{sfn|Gaddafi named 'king of kings'|p=}}{{sfn|Gaddafi: Africa's 'king of kings'|p=}}''''' The meeting was later referred to as a "bizarre ceremony" in international media.'''''{{sfn|Adebajo|2011|p=}}'''''
