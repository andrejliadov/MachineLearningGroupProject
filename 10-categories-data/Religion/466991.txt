'''Mirzā Ghulām Ahmad''' (13 February 1835 – 26 May 1908) was an Indian religious leader and the founder of the [[Ahmadiyya]] movement in [[Islam]]. He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]]—which is the metaphorical second-coming of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] (''mathīl-iʿIsā''),<ref>Yohanan Friedmann. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rv8EAAAACAAJ&dq=Prophecy+Continuous&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y ''Prophecy Continuous: Aspects of Ahmadi Religious Thought and its Medieval Background''] Oxford University Press, 2003 p 121 "The affinity between the two can also be shown in the framework of Ghulām Aḥmad's prophetology. Muḥammad and Moses were similar to each other because they initiated the two prophetic chains; Jesus and Ghulām Aḥmad complete the divine scheme of things by terminating them. They must therefore also be similar. They resemble each other both in the circumstances of their appearance and in the nature of their prophetic mission. Both appeared when their respective communities were subject to foreign rule: the Jews under the Romans, and the Indian Muslims under the British. The religious conditions prevailing in their communities were also similar. The Jews were described in the [[Quran]] (1:7) as "those who earned [divine] wrath" (''al-maghḍūb 'alayhim'') by their lack of religiosity and by rejecting the message of Jesus. Most Muslims of Ghulām Aḥmad's time can be described in similar terms: their spirituality is lost, and only rituals remain of their religion. Furthermore, they rejected Ghulām Aḥmad in the same way that the Jews had rejected Jesus. In addition to these similar circumstances, Ghulām Aḥmad's message resembles that of Jesus in two important characteristics: he does not advocate ''jihād'', and does not bring a new law, but strives rather to implement the ''sharī'a'' promulgated by his predecessor in the prophetic office. And to make the affinity between the two chains total, Ghulām Aḥmad is spiritually greater than Jesus in the same way that Muḥammad was greater than Moses"</ref><ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Essence-4.pdf The Essence of Islam, Vol. IV, p. 33<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in fulfillment of Islam's latter day prophecies, as well as the [[Mujaddid]] (centennial reviver) of the 14th [[Islamic calendar|Islamic century]].<ref>Adil Hussain Khan.

Born in 1835 to a [[Rais]] family in [[Qadian]], Ghulam Ahmad emerged as a writer and debater for Islam.

The family were all known as Mughals within the British governmental records of India probably due to the high positions it occupied within the Mughal empire and their courts.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was born on 13 February 1835 in [[Qadian]], Punjab,<ref name="fndrahmd_1">{{cite web |url=http://theartofmisinformation.wordpress.com/2011/09/13/age-of-the-imam-mahdi-as/|title=Refutation: Age of the Imam Mahdi (as)|work=Jihad of the Pen}}</ref> the surviving child of twins born to an affluent Mughal family. He was born in the [[Sikh Empire]] under [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]. He learned to read the Arabic text of the [[Qur'an]] and studied basic Arabic grammar and the Persian language from a teacher named Fazil-e-Illahi. At the age of 10, he learned from a teacher named Fazl Ahmad. Again at the age of 17 or 18, he learnt from a teacher named Gul Ali Shah.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hadhrat Ahmad|year=1998|publisher=Islam International Publications|location=Athens, Ohio|oclc=45764230|page=15|url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Hadhrat-Ahmad-20080514MN.pdf}}</ref> In addition, he also studied some works on medicine from his father, Mirza Ghulam Murtaza, who was a physician.

From 1864 to 1868, upon his father's wishes, Ghulam Ahmad worked as a clerk in [[Sialkot]], where he would come into contact with Christian missionaries with whom he frequently engaged in debate. After 1868, he returned to Qadian, as per his father's wishes, where he was entrusted to look after some estate affairs. During all this time, Ahmad was known as a social recluse because he would spend most of his time in seclusion studying religious books and praying in the local mosque. As time passed, he began to engage more with the Christian missionaries, particularly in defending Islam against their criticism. He would often confront them in public debates, especially the ones based in the town of [[Batala]].<ref>http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf</ref>

In 1886, certain leaders of the [[Arya Samaj]] held discussion and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam and asked for a sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to [[Hoshiarpur]] upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as [[chilla-nashini]]. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave without speaking to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for [[Jumu'ah]] (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/guidedone/?page=91 Ahmad, the Guided One], p. 91.</ref><ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000177.html Musleh Mau'ood, Khalifatul Masih II, in the Eyes of Non-Ahmadies], The Ahmadiyya Gazette, February 1997</ref>

===Taking of the ''Bay'ah''===

[[File:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad group.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (seated centre) with some of his companions at [[Qadian]] c.1899]]

Ghulam Ahmad claimed divine appointment as a reformer as early as 1882 but did not take any pledge of allegiance or initiation. In December 1888, Ahmad announced that God had ordained that his followers should enter into a [[bay'ah]] with him and pledge their allegiance to him. In January 1889, he published a pamphlet in which he laid out ten conditions or issues to which the initiate would abide by for the rest of his life.<ref name="alislam.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/10.html |title=Ten Conditions of Baiat |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> On 23 March 1889, he founded the Ahmadiyya community by taking a pledge from forty followers.<ref name="alislam.org"/> The formal method of joining the Ahmadiyya movement included joining hands and reciting a pledge, although physical contact was not always necessary. This method of allegiance continued for the rest of his life and after his death by his [[Khalifatul Masih|successors]].<ref name="history_10">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/10.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam – Founding of Ahmadiyya Jamaat |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

===His claim===
Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed that he was the [[Messiah|Promised Messiah]] and Mahdi. He claimed to be the fulfilment of various prophecies found in world religions regarding the second coming of their founders. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's followers say that he never claimed to be the same physical Jesus who lived nineteen centuries earlier. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed that Jesus died a natural death, in contradiction to the traditional Muslim view of Jesus' physical ascension to heaven and the traditional Christian belief of Jesus' crucifixion.<ref name="tadhkirah">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Tadhkirah.pdf |title=Tadhkirah |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> He claimed in his books that there was a general decay of Islamic life and a dire need of a messiah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/victoryofislam/VICTORY%20OF%20ISLAM.pdf |title=Fatah-Islam (1890) |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102194813/http://www.alislam.org/books/victoryofislam/VICTORY%20OF%20ISLAM.pdf |archive-date=2 November 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UNvF3JcnK0C&q=elucidation+of+objectives |title=Tawdhi-i-Marām (1891) |accessdate=20 May 2013|isbn=9781853727429 |last1=Ahmad |first1=Hazrat Mirza Ghulam |year=2004 }}</ref><ref>Izāla-i-Auhām (1891)</ref> He argued that, just as Jesus had appeared in the 14th century after [[Moses]], the promised messiah, i.e. the Mahdi, must also appear in the 14th century after Muhammad.

In ''Tazkiratush-Shahadatain'', he wrote about the fulfillment of various prophecies. In it, he enumerated a variety of prophecies and descriptions from both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] relating to the advent of the Mahdi and the descriptions of his age, which he ascribed to himself and his age. These include assertions that he was physically described in the Hadith and manifested various other signs; some of them being wider in scope, such as focusing on world events coming to certain points, certain conditions within the Muslim community, and varied social, political, economic, and physical conditions.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/claim.html Tazkiratush-Shahadatain], p. 38–39.</ref>

===Post-claim===
In time, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claim of being the [[Mujaddid]] (reformer) of his era became more explicit.<ref name="founder_ch4">[http://www.ahmadiyya.org/books/f-ahm-mv/ch4.htm "The Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement"], by Maulana Muhammad Ali, Chapter 4: Mahdi and Messiah</ref> In one of his most well-known and praised<ref name="critical_study">[http://www.irshad.org/brochures/criticalstudy.php "Qadianism – A Critical Study"], by Abul Hasan Ali Nadw</ref> works, ''[[Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya]]'', a voluminous work, he claimed to be the Messiah of Islam.<ref name="founder_ch4"/> Muslims have maintained that Jesus will return in the flesh during the last age.<ref>[http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm Islamic View of the Coming/Return of Jesus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923170110/http://www.islamicperspectives.com/ReturnOfJesus.htm |date=23 September 2015 }}, by Dr. Ahmad Shafaat, 2003, Islamic Perspectives</ref> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, by contrast, asserted that Jesus had in fact survived crucifixion and died of old age much later in [[Kashmir]], where he had migrated. According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a military leader in the person of Jesus Christ as is believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he also rejected the idea of armed [[Jihad (Ahmadiyya)|Jihad]] and argued that the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and tongue but not with the sword.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/articles/Jihad-Brochure.pdf |title=Jihad Brochure |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named "Tuhfa e qaisariah" and "Sitara e Qaisaria" in which he invited Queen Victoria to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.

===Reaction of religious scholars===
Some [[Ulema|religious scholars]] turned against him, and he was often branded as a heretic, but many [[Ulema|religious scholars]] praised him like [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]] among many others who praised him for his defense of [[Islam]]. After his death, opponents accused him of working for the British Government due to the termination of armed [[Jihad]], since his claims of being the Mahdi were made around the same time as the Mahdi of Sudan ([[Muhammad Ahmad]]).

Following his claim to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, one of his adversaries prepared a [[Fatwa]] (decree) of disbelief against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declaring him a [[Kafir]] (disbeliever), a deceiver, and a liar. The decree permitted killing him and his followers. It was taken all around India and was signed by some two hundred religious scholars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/invitation/arg7.html |title=Argument 7: Defeat of Enemies |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

Some years later, a prominent Muslim leader and scholar, [[Ahmed Raza Khan]], was to travel to the [[Hejaz]] to collect the opinions of the religious scholars of Mecca and Madina. He compiled these opinions in his work ''Hussam ul Harmain'' (The sword of two sanctuaries ''on the slaughter-point of blasphemy and falsehood'');<ref>[http://www.alahazratnetwork.org/english/Hussam_ul_Harmain.pdf Hussam ul Harmain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127221039/http://www.alahazratnetwork.org/english/Hussam_ul_Harmain.pdf |date=27 November 2007 }}</ref> in it, Ghulam Ahmad was again labelled an apostate. The unanimous consensus of about thirty-four religious scholars was that Ghulam Ahmad's beliefs were blasphemous and tantamount to apostasy and that he must be punished by imprisonment and, if necessary, by execution.

===Journey to Delhi===
[[File:Jama Masjid, Delhi, watercolour, 1852.jpg|thumb|Jama Masjid, Delhi, 1852, [[William Carpenter (painter)|William Carpenter]]]]

Ghulam Ahmad went to [[Delhi]], which was at the time considered a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding the life and death of [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] (Jesus), particularly Maulana [[Syed Nazeer Husain]] (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and that the debate should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.

Eventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad travelled to the [[Jama Masjid Delhi]] (main mosque) of Delhi accompanied by twelve of his followers, where some 5,000&nbsp;people were gathered. Before the debate started, there was a discussion on the conditions, which led to the conclusion that the debate should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was considered by many to be living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.

Upon this, there was a clamour among the crowds, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was informed that the other party alleged that he was at odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs on a piece of paper and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of [[Bhopal]], which was later published.

Ghulam Ahmad is known to have travelled extensively across Northern India during this period of his life and to have held various debates with influential religious leaders.<ref name="life_of_ahmad">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Life-of-Ahmad-20080411MN.pdf |title=Life of Ahmad, Founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

Ghulam Ahmad published a book called ''The Heavenly Decree'', in which he challenged his opponents to a "spiritual duel" in which the question of whether someone was a Muslim or not would be settled by God based on the four criteria laid out in the Qur'an, namely, that a perfect believer will frequently receive glad tidings from God, that he will be given awareness about hidden matters and events of the future from God, that most of his prayers will be fulfilled and that he will exceed others in understanding novel finer points, subtleties and deeper meanings of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/TheHeavenlyDecree.pdf |title=The Heavenly Decree |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

===The sun and moon eclipse===
After announcing his claim to be the Messiah and Mahdi, his opponents demanded that he should produce the "heavenly sign" detailed in the tradition attributed to the 7th-century Imam [[Muhammad al-Baqir]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/15.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam – Sign of the Eclipses |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> also known as Muhammad bin Ali, in which a certain sign is stated about the appearance of the [[Mahdi]]:

{{Quote|For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.|Dar Qutni Vol. 1, page 188<ref>{{cite web |title=Hadith on Imam Mahdi|url=https://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000202.html|website=alislam.org|accessdate=20 March 2015|quote=In Dar Qutni, the sign of the appearance of the Imam Mahdi is given in the following Hadith: 'For our Mahdi, there are two signs which have never happened since the earth and the heavens were created, i.e., the moon will be eclipsed on the first of the possible nights in the month of Ramadhan and the sun will be eclipsed in the middle of the possible days of the month of Ramadhan.'}}</ref>}}

Ahmadis maintain that this prophecy was fulfilled in 1894 and again in 1895, about three years after Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed himself to be the Promised Mahdi and Messiah, with the lunar and solar eclipse during the month of Ramadhan, according to the Ahmadiyya interpretation of the prophecy. Ghulam Ahmad declared that this was a sign of his truth and was in fulfillment of the tradition or prophecy.<ref name="eclipses">{{cite web |url=https://www.alislam.org/library/articles/new/TruthAboutEclipses.html |title=The Truth About Eclipses|date=1999|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The eclipses being a sign of the Mahdi are also mentioned specifically in the Letters of Rabbani by [[Ahmad Sirhindi]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Lawsuit===
In 1897, a Christian missionary, [[Henry Martyn Clark]], filed a lawsuit of attempted murder against Ahmad at the court of District [[Magistrate]] Captain [[Montagu William Douglas]] in the city of [[Ludhiana]]. The charge laid against him was that he hired a man by the name of Abdul Hameed to assassinate Clark. However, he was not detained by the police and was declared innocent by the then-magistrate Captain Douglas.<ref name="murder">{{cite book |title=Ahmad the Guided One |author=Ian Adamson |publisher=Islam International Publications Ltd |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/guidedone/index.htm?page=177#top |pages=177–193 |isbn=1-85372-597-8}}</ref><ref name="lawsuit">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/18.html |title=Lawsuit by Dr.Clark |accessdate=25 January 2011 |publisher=Al Islam}}</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2018}}

===The Revealed Sermon===
{{Main|The Revealed Sermon}}
In 1900, on the occasion of the festival of [[Eid ul-Adha]], he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the ''Khutba Ilhamiyya'', the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if in a [[trance]], in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into [[Sujud#Sajdah of thankfulness|prostration]], followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000005.html Miraculous Knowledge of Arabic], The Review of Religions, July 1993</ref>

Ahmad wrote later:
{{Quote|It was like a hidden fountain gushing forth and I did not know whether it was I who was speaking or an angel was speaking through my tongue.

===Challenge to John Alexander Dowie===
[[File:John Alexander Dowie in his robes as Elijah the Restorer.jpg|thumb|[[John Alexander Dowie|Alexander Dowie]] in his robes as "Elijah the restorer"]]

In 1899, Scottish-born American clergyman [[John Alexander Dowie]] laid claim to be the forerunner of the second coming of Christ. Ghulam Ahmad exchanged a series of letters with him between 1903 and 1907. Ghulam Ahmad challenged him to a prayer duel, where both would call upon God to expose the other as a false prophet. Ghulam Ahmad stated:
{{Quote|The best way to determine whether Dowie's God is true or ours, is that Mr. Dowie should stop making prophecies about the destruction of all Muslims. Instead he should keep me alone in his mind and pray that if one of us is fabricating a lie, he should die before the other.|Ghulam Ahmad|<ref name="history_30">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/30.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam: Death of Dr. Dowie |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=2013-05-20}}</ref>}}

Dowie declined the challenge,<ref>S.R. Valentine, Islam and Ahmadiyya Jama'at, Foundation Books, 2008, p. 50.</ref> calling Mirza Ghulam Ahmad the "silly Mohammedan Messiah".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}Ghulam Ahmad prophesied:
{{Quote|Though he may try hard as he can to fly from death which awaits him, yet his flight from such a contest will be nothing less than death to him; and calamity will certainly overtake his Zion, for he must bear the consequences either of the acceptance of the challenge or its refusal. He will depart this life with great sorrow and torment during my lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}}}

The challenge of "prayer duel" was made by Mirza in September 1902. The ''Dictionary of American Biography'' states that after having been deposed during a revolt in which his own family was involved, Dowie endeavoured to recover his authority via the law courts without success and that he may have been a victim of some form of mania, as he suffered from hallucinations during his last illness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogD.html#dowie1 |title=Dictionary of Australian Biography: John Alexander Dowie |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Dowie died before Mirza, in March 1907.

===Encounter with the Agapemonites===
In September 1902 the Rev. [[John Hugh Smyth-Pigott]] (1852-1927) proclaimed himself the Messiah and also claimed to be God while preaching in the Church known as "The Ark of the Covenant" in [[Upper Clapton|Clapton]] in London. This church was originally built by the [[Agapemonites]], a religious movement founded by the Anglican priest [[Henry James Prince]].<ref name="claptonpond">[https://web.archive.org/web/20030722112805/http://claptonpond.ground-level.org/messiah The Clapton Messiah]</ref>

When the news of his claim reached India, [[Mufti Muhammad Sadiq]], a disciple of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, learned of it and wrote to Pigott informing him of the claim of Ahmad and requesting more information about his own claim.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rehanqayoom.weebly.com/ |title="God Breathed & They Were Scattered": New Light on Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad & the Agapemonites, (March 2012). |access-date=9 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815045920/https://rehanqayoom.weebly.com/ |archive-date=15 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pigott did not reply directly, but a letter was received from his secretary along with two advertisements, one carrying the title "The Ark of Noah".<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote to Pigott informing him that such a blasphemous proposition did not behove man, and that in the future he should abstain from making such claims, or he would be destroyed. This message was sent in November 1902.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Newspapers in America and Europe published Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's notification.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
Joshua Schwieso, a sociologist, says:

{{Quote |We can see traces of Agapemone activities in India in 1902 ... in this very year another claimer to messiahship in India, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, chief of Qadian, Punjab, published an announcement in which Pigott was given a warning that ... if he did not abstain from his claim to godship then he would immediately be destroyed/turned to dust and bones.|Dr Joshua Schwieso|''Deluded Inmates, Frantic Ravers and Communists: A sociological Study of the Agapemone, a sect of Victorian Apocalyptic Milleniars'', pg. 171
}}

''Tadhkirah'', a book comprising a collection of the verbal revelations, dreams and visions vouchsafed to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, contains a prophecy regarding Pigott:

"November, 20 (Thursday)
Upon prayer with concentration concerning Pigott, the Promised Messiah(as) saw in a dream some books on which it was written three times: Tasbeeh, Tasbeeh, Tasbeeh [Holiness belongs to Allah], and then received a revelation:
{{Quote|Allah is severe in retribution. They are not acting righteously.|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|''Tazkirah'', pg. 531
}}

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad then explained this revelation:

{{Quote|This revelation indicated that the present condition of Pigott is not good or that he would not repent in future. It can also mean that he would not believe in God or that what he has done by telling such a lie against God and planning against him, is not good. The part "Allah is severe in retribution" shows that his end will be doomed and he will be afflicted with God's chastisement. Indeed, it is a very daring thing to claim to be God."|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|''Tazkirah'', pg. 567
}}

Those who heard Pigott's claim initially immediately reacted with anger and violence, making it impossible for him to remain in London. Pigott then moved to [[Spaxton]], in [[Somerset]].

Researchers have commented that after the move to Spaxton; {{Quote
|the flamboyant Messiah of Clapton became the quiet, gentle pastor at Spaxton|Donald McCormick |The Temple of Love, 1962, p. 97, The Citadel Press, New York
}}
and that:

{{Quote
|Smyth-Pigott had learned his lesson at Clapton, that the opinion of the outside world still counted and he had no desire to face in Somersetshire the kind of demonstrations he had endured in London ... When (he) drove through the village he adopted the worldly role of a benign squire rather than that of the Messiah.|Donald McCormick |The Temple of Love, 1962, p. 95, The Citadel Press, New York
}}

A plaque inscribed in Latin which was found amongst his personal possessions read: ''Homo Sum. Humani Nihil A Me Alienum Puto''. The translation of this text recorded at the back of the pendulum reads: "I am a Man. Nothing akin to Humanity do I consider alien to me."

Smyth-Piggot (who died in 1927) never again claimed Godship during the life of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.

===Last journey===
Towards the end of 1907 and early 1908, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to have received numerous revelations informing him of his imminent death. In April 1908, he travelled to Lahore with his family and companions. Here, he gave many lectures. A banquet was arranged for dignitaries where Ghulam Ahmad, upon request, spoke for some two hours explaining his claims, teachings and speaking in refutation of objections raised against his person; here, he preached reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims. He completed writing his last work, entitled ''Message of Peace'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Message-of-Peace.pdf |title=A Message of Reconciliation |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> a day before his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/31.html |title=A Brief History of Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam – His Last Journey |publisher=Alislam.org |date=27 April 1908 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

===Death===
Ahmad was in Lahore at the home of Dr. Syed Muhammad Hussain (who was also his physician), when, on 26 May 1908, he died as a result of old age and weakness.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000082.html |title=Re-Institution of Khilafat |publisher=Alislam.org |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> His body was subsequently taken to Qadian and buried there;<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/links/amritsar.html A Spiritual Challenge], alislam.org</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/library/history/ahmadiyya/27.html |title=His Last Testament |accessdate=25 January 2011 |publisher=Al Islam}}</ref> he had previously claimed that an [[angel]] had told him that he would be buried there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat: History, Belief, Practice |author=Valentine, Simon Ross |pages=41}}</ref>

==Marriages and children==
[[File:Mirza Ghulam Ahmad with son.jpg|thumb|Mirza Ghulam Ahmad with his son, Mirza Sharif Ahmad]]

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad married twice. His first wife was his paternal cousin Hurmat Bibi. Later, they separated and lived separately for a long time. At the time of his second marriage, Hurmat Bibi gave him the permission to live with the second wife and decided against a divorce.

===Children===
With his first wife, Hurmat Bibi, he had two sons:
#Mirza Sultan Ahmad (1853–1931) (became Ahmadi)
#Mirza Fazal Ahmad (1855–1904) (died at the age of 49 years and did not become Ahmadi)

With his second wife, [[Nusrat Jahan Begum]], he had ten children:

Five children died young:
#Ismat (1886–1891)
#Bashir (1887–1888)
#Shaukat (1891–1892)
#Mubarik (1899–1907)
#Amtul Naseer (1903–1903)

Although Mirza Ghulam Ahmad aroused much opposition particularly from Muslim leaders owing to his messianic claims, opinion of him was not entirely negative. Many leading Muslim scholars, theologians and prominent journalists who were his contemporaries or had come into contact with him, had, despite differing with him in matters of belief, praised his personal character and acclaimed his works in the cause of Islam and the manner of his argumentation against proclaimants of other religions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tributes to Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|url=http://www.muslim.org/sa-case/evidence/s20.htm|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Majestic Writings of the Promised Messiah in View of Some Renowned Muslim Scholars|url=https://www.alislam.org/library/books/Majestic-Writings-of-Promised-Messiah.pdf|publisher=Al Islam|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Immaculate Character Of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad|url=http://kashifmd.com/2015/01/13/the-immaculate-character-of-mirza-ghulam-ahmad-as/|accessdate=1 May 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514063234/http://kashifmd.com/2015/01/13/the-immaculate-character-of-mirza-ghulam-ahmad-as/|archive-date=14 May 2016}}</ref> The teachings that Jesus survived crucifixion, migrating towards the east in search of the Israelite tribes that had settled there and that he [[Jesus in Ahmadiyya Islam|died a natural death]] upon earth, as propounded by Ghulam Ahmad, have been a source of ongoing friction with the Christian church since they challenge the core beliefs of Christianity and would nullify the doctrines of [[vicarious atonement]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], the two principal tenets of Christianity.

One of the main sources of dispute during his lifetime and continuing since then is Ghulam Ahmad's use of the terms ''[[Prophets of Islam|nabi]]'' ("prophet") and ''rasool'' (messenger) when referring to himself. Most non-Ahmadi Muslims consider [[Muhammad]] to be the last of the prophets<ref>[http://www.islam101.com/dawah/pillars.html "Five Pillars of Islam"], Islam 101</ref> and believe that Ghulam Ahmad's use of these terms is a violation of the concept of the [[Finality of Prophethood]].<ref>"[http://muslim-canada.org/oxford.html Further Similarities and Differences: (between esoteric, exoteric & Sunni/Shia) and (between Islam/Christianity/Judaism)]", Exploring World Religions, 2001, Oxford University Press Canada</ref> His followers fall into two factions in this regards. The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], which comprises by far the majority of Ahmadis, believes that Ghulam Ahmad's prophetic status does not in any way infringe the finality of Muhammad's prophethood – to which it is wholly subservient and from which it is inseparable – and is in accordance with scriptural prophecies concerning the advent of the Messiah in Islam.<ref name="Ahmadiyya Muslim Community">{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/finality.html|title=Finality of Prophethood - Hadhrat Muhammad (PUBH) the Last Prophet|publisher=[[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/promisedmessiah/index.htm?page=37 The Question of Finality of Prophethood], The Promised Messiah and Mahdi, by Dr. Aziz Ahmad Chaudhry, Islam International Publications Limited</ref> This group is currently headed by Ghulam Ahmad's fifth caliph, or successor, carrying the title of [[Khalifatul Masih]], an institution believed to have been established soon after his death.
