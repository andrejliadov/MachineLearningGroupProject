==Terminology==
After the Al-Qaeda September 11 attacks, US president [[George W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] repeatedly stated that the war against terrorism had nothing to do with Islam, but was a war against evil.<ref name="Bar">{{cite web |last1=Bar |first1=Shmuel |title=The Religious Sources of Islamic Terrorism |url=https://www.hoover.org/research/religious-sources-islamic-terrorism |website=Hoover Institute |access-date=12 August 2019 |date=1 June 2004}}</ref>
Former US president Barack Obama explained why he used the term "terrorism" rather than "Islamic terrorism" in a 2016 townhall meeting saying, 
<blockquote>"There is no doubt, ... terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL – They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death ...

==History==
Some Muslim scholars assert that extremism within Islam goes back to the [[Khawarij|Kharijites]] who existed in the 7th century. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to ''[[takfir]]'', whereby they declared that other Muslims were unbelievers and therefore worthy of death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/ |title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}</ref>

=== 1960s–1970s ===
After failed post-colonial attempts at state formation and the creation of Israel, a series of Marxist and anti-Western transformations and movements swept throughout the Arab and Islamic world. These movements were nationalist and revolutionary not Islamic but their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as [[Fatah|Al Fatah]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the [[Arab world]] was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from [[revolutionary movement]]s in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia and Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from [[guerrilla warfare]] towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature but their international organization served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide.<ref name=":4" />
 
Religiously motivated groups grew after the failure of Arab nationalism in the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel. In the Middle East, Islamic movements came into conflict with secular nationalism. Islamic groups were supported by Saudi Arabia, to counter nationalist ideology.<ref name=":4" />

According to [[Bruce Hoffman]] of [[RAND Corporation|RAND]], in 1980 two out of 64 terrorist groups were categorized as having religious motivation, in 1995 almost half (26 out of 56) were religiously motivated with the majority having Islam as their guiding force.<ref name="Hoffman-1999-V">{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Bruce |title=Countering the New Terrorism |date=1999 |publisher=Rand Corporation |page=V |chapter-url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/www/external/congress/terrorism/phase1/countering.pdf |access-date=12 August 2019 |chapter=Two: Terrorism Trends and Prospects}}</ref><ref name=":4" />

=== 1980s–1990s ===
The [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and the subsequent anti-Soviet mujahedin war, lasting from 1979 to 1989, started the rise and expansion of terrorist groups. Since their beginning in 1994, the Pakistani-supported [[Taliban]] militia in Afghanistan has gained several characteristics traditionally associated with [[state sponsors of terrorism|state-sponsors of terrorism]], providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Since 1989 the increasing willingness of religious extremists to strike targets outside immediate country or regional areas highlights the global nature of contemporary terrorism. The [[1993 bombing of the World Trade Center]], and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, are representative of this trend.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/modern.html| title=The Evolution of Islamic Terrorism: an Overview|author=John Moore|publisher=PBS Frontline}}</ref>

=== 2000s–2010s ===
According to research by the German newspaper ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'', there were 31,221 Islamist terrorism attacks, which killed at least 146,811 people, between 11 September 2001 and 21 April 2019. Many of the victims were Muslims, including most of the victims who were killed in attacks involving 12 or more deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pasteboard.co/IgC7ac6.jpg|title=18 Jahre Terror|date=2019-04-28|website=www.welt.de|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/international/ECE11350481/naesten-150000-har-mistet-livet-i-islamistiske-angreb/|title=Næsten 150.000 har mistet livet i islamistiske angreb|date=2019-05-01|website=jyllands-posten.dk|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/danmark/naesten-150000-har-mistet-livet-i-islamistiske-angreb|title=Næsten 150.000 har mistet livet i islamistiske angreb|date=2019-05-01|website=www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk|access-date=2019-06-18}}</ref>

The motivation of Islamic terrorists has been hotly disputed. Some (such as James L.

===Religious motivation===
[[Daniel Benjamin]] and [[Steven Simon]], in their book, ''The Age of Sacred Terror'', argue that Islamic terrorist attacks are purely religious. They are seen as "a sacrament ... intended to restore to the universe a moral order that had been corrupted by the enemies of Islam." It is neither political or strategic but an "act of redemption" meant to "humiliate and slaughter those who defied the hegemony of God".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Age of Sacred Terror|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofsacredterro00benj|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/ageofsacredterro00benj/page/40 40]|author=Daniel Benjamin|author2=Steven Simon|year=2002|isbn=978-0756767518|publisher=Random House}}</ref>

One of the Kouachi brothers responsible for the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] called a French journalist, saying, "We are the defenders of Prophet Mohammed."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/13/opinion/bergen-islam-terrorism/index.html | title=Does Islam fuel terrorism? | publisher=CNN | date=13 January 2015 | access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>

According to Indonesian Islamic leader Yahya Cholil Staquf in a 2017 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] interview, within the classical Islamic tradition the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims is assumed to be one of segregation and enmity. In his view extremism and terrorism are linked with orthodox Islam and that radical Islamic movements are nothing new. He also added that Western politicians should stop pretending that extremism is not linked to Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4930742/islam-terrorism-islamophobia-violence/|title=Orthodox Islam and Violence 'Linked' Says Top Muslim Scholar|website=Time|access-date=2017-12-27|quote=Western politicians should stop pretending that extremism and terrorism have nothing to do with Islam. There is a clear relationship between fundamentalism, terrorism, and the basic assumptions of Islamic orthodoxy. So long as we lack consensus regarding this matter, we cannot gain victory over fundamentalist violence within Islam. Radical Islamic movements are nothing new. They've appeared again and again throughout our own history in Indonesia. The West must stop ascribing any and all discussion of these issues to "Islamophobia."

However, two studies of the background of Muslim terrorists in Europe—one of the UK and one of France—found little connection between religious piety and terrorism. The "restricted" UK report of hundreds of case studies by the domestic counter-intelligence agency [[MI5]] found that

<blockquote>[f]ar from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could actually be regarded as religious novices. Very few have been brought up in strongly religious households, and there is a higher than average proportion of converts. Some are involved in drug-taking, drinking alcohol and visiting prostitutes. MI5 says there is evidence that a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation.<ref name=Travis-20-8-2008>{{cite news|last1=Travis|first1=Alan|title=MI5 report challenges views on terrorism in Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/20/uksecurity.terrorism1|access-date=6 November 2015|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=20 August 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

A 2015 "general portrait" of "the conditions and circumstances" under which people living in France become "Islamic radicals" (terrorists or would-be terrorists) by Olivier Roy (see above) found radicalisation was not an "uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts".<ref name=roy-inside>{{cite magazine |last=Roy |first=Olivier |date=18 December 2015 |title=What is the driving force behind jihadist terrorism? |url=http://insidestory.org.au/what-is-the-driving-force-behind-jihadist-terrorism |access-date=25 February 2016 |magazine=Inside Story |issn=1837-0497 }}</ref>

Roy believes terrorism/radicalism is "expressed in religious terms" because

# most of the radicals have a Muslim background, which makes them open to a process of re-Islamisation ("almost none of them having been pious before entering the process of radicalisation"), and<ref name=roy-inside/>
# jihad is "the only cause on the global market". If you kill in silence, it will be reported by the local newspaper; "if you kill yelling 'Allahu Akbar', you are sure to make the national headlines". Other extreme causes—ultra-left or radical ecology are "too bourgeois and intellectual" for the radicals.<ref name=roy-inside/>

David Shariatmadari argued that if the cause of Islamic terrorism is Islam, why is the history of jihadi terrorism so very short: it is emphatically a late 20th and early 21st-century phenomenon, yet Islam has been around since the seventh century, implying that the cause of Islamic terrorism is more political than religious.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shariatmadari|first=David|date=2017-03-27|title=Should we blame Islam for terrorism? {{!}} David Shariatmadari|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/27/should-blame-islam-terrorism|access-date=2020-10-23|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

====Interpretations of the Qur'an and Hadith====
{{see also|Quran and violence}}

Donald Holbrook, a Research Fellow at the [[Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence]], analyzes a sample of 30 works by jihadist propagandists and finds several passages of the Quran exploited and distorted to suit the objectives of violent jihad.<ref name=holbrook1/> [[An-Nisa]] (4:74–75) is quoted most frequently; other popular passages are [[At-Taubah]] (9:13–15, 38–39, 111) and [[Al-Baqarah]] (2:190–191, 216). Consider [[Sword Verse|Surah 9:5]]:

{{quote|But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfill their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.}}

Holbrook notes they cherry-picked the first part "slay the idolaters" but fail to quote and discuss limiting factors at the end of the [[ayat]], "but if they repent …" This, Holbrook argues, is how violent jihadists are "shamelessly selective in order to serve their propaganda objectives."<ref name=holbrook1/> Peter Bergen notes that bin Laden cited this verse in 1998 when making a formal declaration of war.<ref name=bergen150113>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/opinion/bergen-islam-terrorism/|title=Does Islam fuel terrorism?|author=Peter Bergen|work=CNN|date=13 Jan 2015|access-date=28 Jun 2016|author-link=Peter Bergen}}</ref>

Supporters of bin Laden have also pointed to reports according to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad attacked towns at night or with catapults, and argued that he must have condoned incidental harm to noncombatants, since it would have been impossible to distinguish them from combatants during such attacks.<ref name="peters-cook">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title=Jihād |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001/acref-9780199739356-e-0263 |last=Peters |first=Rudolph |first2=David|last2=Cook |url-access=subscription |isbn=9780199739356}}</ref> These arguments were not widely accepted by Muslims.<ref name=peters-cook/>

The [[Princeton University]] Middle Eastern scholar [[Bernard Lewis]] states that classical [[Islamic jurisprudence]] does not allow terrorism, and the "classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered [jihad] the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations".<ref>Lewis, Bernard, 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2009). pp. 53, 145–50</ref> In 2001, Professor Lewis noted:<ref>{{cite web|author=Bernard Lewis |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1001547201928681240 |title=Jihad vs. Crusade |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=27 September 2001 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>

<blockquote>Being a religious obligation, jihad is elaborately regulated in sharia law, which discusses in minute detail such matters as the opening, conduct, interruption and cessation of hostilities, the treatment of prisoners and noncombatants, the use of weapons, etc.<ref>Bukhari 50:891</ref>... Similarly, the laws of Jihad categorically preclude wanton and indiscriminate slaughter.<ref>Quran (8:12)</ref> The warriors in the holy war are urged not to harm non-combatants, women and children, "unless they attack you first". ... A point on which they insist is the need for a clear declaration of war before beginning hostilities, and for proper warning before resuming hostilities after a truce. What the classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered is the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations that we saw in New York two weeks ago. For this there is no precedent and no authority in Islam.</blockquote>

While techniques of war are restricted by classical Islamic jurisprudence, the scope is not. Lewis states that Jihad is an unlimited offensive to bring the whole world under Islamic rule and law.<ref>Lewis, Bernard, ''The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years'', pp. 233–34</ref> [[Fiqh#Diagram of early scholars|Classical Islamic jurisprudence]] imposes, without limit of time or space, the duty to subjugate non-Muslims, according to Lewis.<ref>Lewis, Bernard, ''The Political Language of Islam'', p. 73</ref> [[Wael Hallaq]] writes that in the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbOtAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA335|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|page=335|author=Wael B. Hallaq|isbn=978-1107394124}}</ref> While modernists view jihad as defensive and compatible with modern standards of warfare, some Islamists go beyond the classical theory to insist that the purpose of jihad is the fight against oppressive regimes and conversion of non-Muslims to Islam.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbOtAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA338|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|pages=338–39|author=Wael B.

Former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst [[Michael Scheuer]] argues that terrorist attacks (specifically [[al-Qaeda]] attacks on targets in the United States) are ''not'' motivated by a religiously inspired hatred of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] or religion, demonstrating a basic misunderstanding of Islamic dogma, but by the belief that [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]] has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East,<ref name="Scheuer 2004 9">Scheuer (2004), p. 9<br />

===Societal motivations===
[[Scott Atran]] has found the greatest predictors of suicide bombings to be not religion but group dynamics:
While personal humiliation does not turn out to be a motivation for those attempting to kill civilians, the perception that others with whom one feels a common bond are being humiliated can be a powerful driver for action. "Small-group dynamics involving friends and family that form the [[diaspora]] cell of [[fraternity|brotherhood]] and [[camaraderie]] on which the rising tide of martyrdom actions is based".<ref>[http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623022648/http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf |date=2015-06-23 }} pp. 138, 144</ref> Terrorists, according to Atran, are social beings influenced by social connections and values.

===Ideology===
{{Jihadism sidebar}}

One ideology that plays a role in terrorism by using the name of Islam, is [[Wahabism]].<ref name="School2015">{{cite book|author=Naval Postgraduate Naval Postgraduate School|title=Wahhabism: Is It a Factor in the Spread of Global Terrorism?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=25JPrgEACAAJ|date=19 March 2015 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=978-1508936138}}</ref><ref name="Allen2009">{{cite book|author=Charles Allen |author-link=Charles Allen (writer)|title=God's Terrorists: The Wahhabi Cult and the Hidden Roots of Modern Jihad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKK0_bM-4n8C|date=1 March 2009|publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0786733002}}</ref><ref name="DeLong-Bas2007">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwX_UJ-p2rsC&pg=PA4|title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2007|isbn=978-1845113223|pages=4–|author=Natana J.

Transnational [[Islamism|Islamist]] ideology, specifically of the militant Islamists, assert that Western policies and society are actively anti-Islamic, or as it is sometimes described, waging a "[[war against Islam]]". Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being "[[fard]] al-ayn", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than "fard al-kifaya", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.

Many of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as "International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.

According to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, "ideology", rather than any individual or group, is the "center of gravity" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a "collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]".<ref name="eikmeier"/> He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:
* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to "pure Islam" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].
* The path to "pure Islam" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.
* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.
* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.<ref name="eikmeier"/>

The historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.

In addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his "Letter to America", he answered the question, "What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?" with

<blockquote>We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed 24 May 2007</ref></blockquote>

Given their perceived [[piety]], ''[[The Times]]'' noted the irony when an investigation discovered that Jihadists were seeking anonymity through some of the same networks used to distribute [[child pornography]]. The paper praised the raid's ability to "improve understanding of the mindsets of both types of criminals".<ref name="Times">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4958674.ece Dangerous and depraved: paedophiles unite with terrorists online], Richard Kerbaj, Dominic Kennedy, Richard Owen and Graham Keeley, ''[[The Times]]'', 17 October 2008.

In 2006, Britain's then head of [[MI5]] [[Eliza Manningham-Buller]] said of Al-Qaeda that it "has developed an ideology which claims that Islam is under attack, and needs to be defended". "This," she said "is a powerful narrative that weaves together conflicts from across the globe, presenting the West's response to varied and complex issues, from long-standing disputes such as Israel/Palestine and Kashmir to more recent events as evidence of an across-the-board determination to undermine and humiliate Islam worldwide."<ref name="EM-B">{{cite web|first=Eliza|last=Manningham-Buller|author-link=Eliza Manningham-Buller|url=http://www.icjs-online.org/index.php?article=1121|title=Transcript of speech: The International Terrorist Threat to the UK|publisher=ICJS Research |date=10 November 2006|access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref> She said that the video wills of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslim]] suicide bombers made it clear to her that they were motivated by perceived global injustices against Muslims; an extreme and minority interpretation of Islam promoted by extremist preachers and other individuals of influence; their interpretation of British foreign policy as anti-Muslim, in particular the UK's involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan."<ref name="EM-B"/> She also cautioned how difficult it was to gain a proper perspective, saying that although there are more important dangers we face daily without feeling so threatened by them, such as climate change and road deaths, and though terrorist deaths were few, the intelligence services had prevented some potentially large threats and that vigilance was needed.<ref name="EM-B"/>

Colonel Eikmeier points out the "questionable religious credentials" of many Islamist theorists, or "Qutbists", which can be a "means to discredit them and their message":

<blockquote>With the exception of [[Abul Ala Maududi]] and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], none of Qutbism's main theoreticians trained at Islam's recognized centers of learning. Although a devout Muslim, [[Hassan al-Banna]] was a teacher and community activist. [[Sayyid Qutb]] was a literary critic. [[Mohammed Abdul-Salam Farag]] was an electrician. Ayman al-Zawahiri is a physician. Osama bin Laden trained to be a businessman.<ref name="eikmeier">{{cite journal|last=Eikmeier|first=Dale C.|date=Spring 2007|title=Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism|url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm|journal=[[Parameters (journal)|Parameters]]|volume=XXXVII|issue=1|pages=85–98|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609120804/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |archive-date=9 June 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

===Identity-based frameworks for analyzing Islamist-based terrorism===
Islamist-based fundamentalist terrorism against Western nations and the U.S. in particular, has numerous motivations and takes place the larger context of a complex and tense relationship between the 'West' and the Arab and Muslim 'world,'<ref>"The Muslim world and the West: the roots of conflict". 2005. Web. 16 April 2010.</ref> which is highlighted in the previous section on motivations and Islamic terrorism. Identity-based theoretical frameworks, including theories of [[social identity]], social categorization theory, and [[psychodynamics]] are used to explain the reasons terrorism occurs.<ref>"Perspectives on Terrorism – Explaining Terrorism: A Psychosocial Approach". Web. 16 April 2010.</ref>

[[Social identity]] is explained by Karina Korostelina as a "feeling of belonging to a social group, as a strong connection with social category, and as an important part of our mind that affects our social perceptions and behavior"<ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007">Korostelina, K. (2007). Social Identity and Conflict: Structures, Dynamics and Implications. New York: Palgrave Macmillan</ref> This definition can be applied to the case of [[Osama bin Laden]], who, according to this theory, had a highly salient perception of his social identity as a Muslim, a strong connection to the social category of the Muslim [[Ummah]] or 'community,' which affect his social perceptions and behaviors.<ref>"Osama bin Laden's growing anxiety". ''The Christian Science Monitor'' – CSMonitor.com. Web. 16 April 2010</ref> Bin Laden's ideology and interpretation of Islam led to the creation of al-Qaeda in response to perceived threats against the Muslim community by the Soviet Union, the U.S. in particular due to its troop presence in Saudi Arabia, and American support for Israel.<ref name="Israel National News 2010">"[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/133413 Al-Qaeda Blames 9/11 on US Support for Israel – Defense/Middle East – Israel National News.]" Web. 16 April 2010.</ref> The Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda has a group identity, which includes "shared experiences, attitudes, beliefs, and interests of in-group members", and is "described through the achievement of a collective aim for which this group has been created",<ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007"/> which in this case is to achieve "a complete break from the foreign influences in [[Muslim countries]], and the creation of a new Islamic [[caliphate]]".

Social categorization theory has been discussed as a three-stage process of identification, where "individuals define themselves as members of a [[social group]], learn the stereotypes and norms of the group, and group categories influence the perception and understanding of all situations in a particular context"<ref name="Korostelina, K. 2007"/> This definition can be applied to the US-led [[war on terror]], in which conflict features such as the phenomenon of [[Anti-Americanism]]<ref>"Understanding Arab anti-Americanism". Lee Smith ''Slate''. Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> and the phenomenon of non-Arab countries like [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]] lending support to Islamist-based terrorism by funding or harboring terrorist groups such as Hezbollah<ref>"Hizballah (Party of God)". Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> and al-Qaeda<ref>"Analysis Of Al Qaeda In Afghanistan and Pakistan". ''Eurasia Review''. Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> against Western nations, particularly [[Israel]]<ref>"Hezbollah and its Goals". Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> and the [[United States]]<ref>"Al-Qaida". Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> are, according to social categorization theory, influenced by a three-stage process of identification. In this three-stage process of identification, the Arab and Muslim world(s) are the social group(s), in which their members learn [[stereotype]]s and [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which categorize their social group vis-à-vis [[Western world|the West]].<ref>"Global Connections. Stereotypes". PBS. Web. 30 April 2010.</ref> This social categorization process creates feelings of high-level in-group support and allegiance among Arabs and Muslims and the particular context within which members of the Arab and Muslim world(s) social group(s) understand all situations that involve the West. Social categorization theory as a framework for analysis indicates causal relationships between group identification processes and features of conflict situations.<ref>Korostelina, K.

==Profiles of terrorists==

According to [[Scott Atran]], a [[NATO]] researcher studying suicide terrorism, the available evidence contradicts a number of simplistic explanations for the motivations of terrorists, including mental instability, poverty, and feelings of humiliation.<ref name="burke" />

Forensic psychiatrist and former foreign service officer [[Marc Sageman]] made an "intensive study of biographical data on 172 participants in the jihad", in his book ''Understanding Terror Networks''.<ref>Sageman (2004)</ref> He concluded [[social network]]s, the "tight bonds of family and friendship", rather than [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] of "poverty, trauma, madness, [or] ignorance", inspired [[Social alienation|alienated]] young Muslims to join the jihad and kill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14036.html |title=Understanding Terror Networks |author=Marc Sageman|publisher=Upenn.edu |date=11 September 2001 |access-date=25 April 2010|author-link=Marc Sageman}}</ref>

Author [[Lawrence Wright]] described the characteristic of "[[displacement (psychology)|displacement]]" of members of the most famous Islamic terrorist group, al-Qaeda:

<blockquote>What the recruits tended to have in common—besides their urbanity, their [[cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] backgrounds, their education, their facility with languages, and their computer skills—was displacement. Most who joined the jihad did so in a country other than the one in which they were reared. They were Algerians living in [[expatriate]] enclaves in France, [[Moroccans]] in Spain, or [[Yemen]]is in Saudi Arabia. Despite their accomplishments, they had little standing in the host societies where they lived.<ref>Wright, ''Loming Tower'' (2006), p. 304</ref></blockquote>

Scholar [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] describes the background of the hundreds of ''global'' (as opposed to local) terrorists who were incarcerated or killed and for whom authorities have records, as being surprising for their Westernized background; for the lack of [[Palestinians]], [[Iraqis]], [[Afghanistan|Afghans]] "coming to avenge what is going on in their country"; their lack of religiosity before being "born again" in a foreign country; the high percentage of converts to Islam among them; their "de-territorialized backgrounds"—"For instance, they may be born in a country, then educated in another country, then go to fight in a third country and take refuge in a fourth country"; their nontraditional belief that jihad is permanent, global, and "not linked with a specific territory."<ref>{{cite web |title=Olivier Roy Interview (2007): Conversations with History |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people7/Roy/roy07-con5.html |publisher=Institute of International Studies, UC Berkeley |date=3 May 2007 |access-date=25 April 2010}}</ref>

This profile differs from that found among recent local (as opposed to global) Islamist suicide bombers in Afghanistan, according to a 2007 study of 110 suicide bombers by Afghan pathologist Dr. Yusef Yadgari. Yadgari found that 80% of the attackers studied had some kind of physical or mental disability. The bombers were also "not celebrated like their counterparts in other Muslim nations.

Studying 300 cases of people charged with jihadist terrorism in the United States since September 11, 2001, author [[Peter Bergen]] found the perpetrators were "generally motivated by a mix of factors", including "militant Islamist ideology; dislike of American foreign policy in the Muslim world; a need to attach themselves to an ideology or organization that gave them a sense of purpose"; and a "cognitive opening" to militant Islam that often was "precipitated by personal disappointment, like the death of a parent".<ref name="Bergen-15-6-2016">{{cite news|last1=Bergen|first1=Peter|title=Why Do Terrorists Commit Terrorism?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/opinion/why-do-terrorists-commit-terrorism.html?_r=0|access-date=16 June 2016|agency=New York Times|date=15 June 2016}}</ref>

==Muslim attitudes toward terrorism==
{{Main|Muslim attitudes towards terrorism}}

Muslim popular opinion on the subject of attacks on civilians by Islamist groups varies. [[Fred Halliday]], a British academic specialist on the Middle East, argues that most Muslims consider these acts to be egregious violations of Islam's laws.<ref>Halliday, Fred: ''Islam and the Myth of Confrontation: Religion and Politics in the Middle East'' (New York: I.B. Tauris, 2003), 107</ref> [[Michael Sells]] and Jane I.

===Views of modern Islamic scholars===

[[Charles Kurzman]] and other authors have collected statements by prominent Muslim figures and organizations condemning terrorism.<ref name=kurzman/>

Although Islamic terrorism is commonly associated with the [[Salafi]]s (or "[[Wahhabi]]s"), the scholars of the group have constantly attributed this association to ignorance, misunderstanding and sometimes insincere research and deliberate misleading by rival groups.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021337/http://www.salafimanhaj.com/pdf/SalafiManhaj_NYPD.pdf "The Book, "Is Salafiyyah a cause of Terrorism"]"</ref> Following the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made an official statement that "the Islamic Sharee'ah (legislation) does not sanction" such actions.<ref>"[http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/CAF020015.pdf "The Mufti of Saudi Arabia on the New York Attacks]"</ref> A Salafi "Committee of Major Scholars" in Saudi Arabia has declared that "Islamic" terrorism, such as the May 2003 [[Riyadh compound bombings|bombing in Riyadh]], are in violation of [[Sharia]] law and aiding the enemies of Islam.<ref>"[http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/CAF020016.pdf "The Major Scholars on the Salafi Position Towards the Suicide Bombings by the Khawaarij in Riyadh]"</ref>

[[Timothy Winter]] wrote that the proclamations of bin Laden and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] "ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship", and that if they "followed the norms of their religion, they would have had to acknowledge that no school of mainstream Islam allows the targeting of civilians."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamfortoday.com/murad04.htm|title=Abdal-Hakim Murad, Bin Laden's Violence is a Heresy Against Islam|publisher=Islamfortoday.com|access-date=25 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103130922/http://islamfortoday.com/murad04.htm|archive-date=3 January 2010}}</ref>

[[Ali Gomaa]], former [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt, stated not only for Islam but in general: "Terrorism cannot be born of religion.

In reference to suicide attacks, Hannah Stuart notes there is a "significant debate among contemporary clerics over which circumstance permit such attacks." Qatar-based theologian, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], criticized the 9/11 attacks but previously justified suicide bombings in Israel on the grounds of necessity and justified such attacks in 2004 against American military and civilian personnel in Iraq. According to Stuart, 61 contemporary Islamic leaders have issued fatawa permitting suicide attacks, 32 with respect to Israel. Stuart points out that all of these contemporary rulings are contrary to classical [[Islamic jurisprudence]].<ref name="Stuart1">{{cite book|title=Countering Radicalization and Violent Extremism Among Youth to Prevent Terrorism|publisher=IOS Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1614994695|pages=74–76|author=Hannah Stuart|editor=Marco Lombardi}}</ref>

===Opinion surveys===
* [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] conducted tens of thousands of hour-long, face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries between 2001 and 2007. It found that more than 90% of respondents condemned the killing of non-combatants on religious and humanitarian grounds.<ref name="australia.to">{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/al-qaida-today-the-fate-of-a-movement|title=Al-Qaida today: a movement at the crossroads|work=openDemocracy|author=Fawaz A.

He also found that those Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Excerpt: 'Who Speaks for Islam?' |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87860378 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=2008-03-04}}</ref>
* A subsequent Gallup poll released in 2011 suggested "that one's religious identity and level of devotion have little to do with one's views about targeting civilians... it is human development and governance—not piety or culture—that are the strongest factors in explaining differences in how the public perceives this type of violence." The same poll concluded that populations of countries in the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] were slightly more likely to reject attacks on civilians in all cases, both military and individual, than those in non-member countries.<ref name="views">{{cite web|title=Views of Violence|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx|publisher=Gallup|access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref>
* Another poll conducted, in 2005 by the [[Fafo Foundation]] in the Palestinian Authority, found that 65% of respondents supported the September 11 attacks.<ref>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/95535#.UFBe5NWgSSo 65% of Palestinians Applaud Terror Attacks on US and Europe] IsraelNationalNews.com</ref>
* In Pakistan, despite the recent rise in the Taliban's influence, a poll conducted by Terror Free Tomorrow in Pakistan in January 2008 tested support for al-Qaeda, the Taliban, other militant Islamist groups and Osama bin Laden himself, and found a recent drop by half. In August 2007, 33% of Pakistanis expressed support for al-Qaeda; 38% supported the Taliban. By January 2008, al-Qaeda's support had dropped to 18%, the Taliban's to 19%. When asked if they would vote for al-Qaeda, just 1% of Pakistanis polled answered in the affirmative. The Taliban had the support of 3% of those polled.<ref name="australia.to"/>
* Pew Research surveys in 2008, show that in a range of countries—Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh—there have been substantial declines in the percentages saying suicide-bombings and other forms of violence against civilian targets can be justified to defend Islam against its enemies. Wide majorities say such attacks are, at most, rarely acceptable. The shift of attitudes against terror has been especially dramatic in Jordan, where 29% of Jordanians were recorded as viewing suicide-attacks as often or sometimes justified (down from 57% in May 2005). In the largest majority-Muslim nation, Indonesia, 74% of respondents agree that terrorist attacks are "never justified" (a substantial increase from the 41% level to which support had risen in March 2004); in Pakistan, that figure is 86%; in Bangladesh, 81%; and in Iran, 80%.<ref name="australia.to"/>
* A poll conducted in Osama bin Laden's home country of Saudi Arabia in December 2008 shows that his compatriots have dramatically turned against him, his organisation, Saudi volunteers in Iraq, and terrorism in general.

==Tactics==
{{Main|Tactics of terrorism}}

===Suicide attacks===
{{see also|Suicide attack}}

[[Hezbollah]] were the first to use suicide bombers in the Middle East.<ref name=":4" /> An increasingly popular tactic used by terrorists is suicide bombing.<ref>{{cite web|title= The_MIPT_Terrorism_Annual|url=http://www.tkb.org/documents/Downloads/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf|publisher=tkb.org|access-date=6 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129192403/http://www.tkb.org/documents/Downloads/2006-MIPT-Terrorism-Annual.pdf |archive-date=29 November 2007}}</ref> This tactic is used against civilians, soldiers, and government officials of the regimes the terrorists oppose. A recent clerical ruling declares terrorism and suicide bombing as forbidden by Islam.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8544531.stm | work=BBC News | first=Dominic | last=Casciani | title=Muslim scholar condemns terrorism | date=2 March 2010}}</ref> However, groups who support its use often refer to such attacks as "[[Istishhad|martyrdom operations]]" and the suicide-bombers who commit them as "[[martyr]]s" (Arabic: shuhada, plural of "shahid"). The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.

===Hijackings===
Islamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|"9/11"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].

===Kidnappings and executions===
{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}
{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}

Along with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran–Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.

[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shay |first1=Shaul |title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations |date=December 2013 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |isbn=978-1845196110}}</ref>

[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant "political and diplomatic" payoff. Rubin writes that Islamist kidnappers have the additional, "ideological goals" of using hostages both to "shock the outside world" and to "appeal to their own constituency", and that the public humiliation of hostages is a specific Islamist goal. He also deems hostage-taking as an effective technique for cowing a population by making governments appear weak and by inspiring fear of opposing the Islamists. He does not regard kidnapping as an effective recruitment technique.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Michael|title=How to Deal with Kidnappings in Iraq|journal=Middle East Quarterly |issue=December 2005 |url=http://www.meforum.org/793/how-to-deal-with-kidnappings-in-iraq |access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref>

In his 2007 book, ''Islamic Terror Abductions in the Middle East'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shay |first1=Shaul |title=Islamic Terror Abductions in the Middle East |date=2007 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845191672}}</ref> military historian [[Shaul Shay]] argued in 2014 that Islamists consider hostage taking as a strategic tool that can effectively gain concessions from targeted governments.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Caschetta |first=A.J. |title=Review of Islamic Terror Abductions in the Middle East by Shaul Shay |journal=Middle East Quarterly |date=1 March 2008 |url=http://www.meforum.org/1909/islamic-terror-abductions-in-the-middle-east |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>

====Kidnapping as political tactic====
In September 2014, the German Foreign Ministry reported that the Islamist militant group [[Abu Sayyaf]] had kidnapped two German nationals and was threatening to kill them unless the German government withdraw its support for the war against [[ISIS]] and also pay a large ransom.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Andrea |title=Germany Confirms Kidnapping of Two Citizens by Islamist Group in Philippines |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/germany-confirms-kidnapping-of-two-citizens-by-islamist-terror-group-1411564496|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=24 September 2014 |access-date=7 October 2014 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> In September 2014 an Islamist militant group kidnapped a French national in Algeria and threatened to kill the hostage unless the government of France withdrew its support for the war against ISIS.<ref>{{cite news|last=Willsher|first=Kim|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/22/algerian-islamists-threaten-to-execute-french-hostage-unless-france-halts-isis-attacks |title=Algerian Islamists threaten to execute hostage unless France halts Isis attacks|newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 September 2014 |access-date=4 August 2016}}</ref>

=====Islamist self-justifications=====
According to the ''[[International Business Times]]'', in October 2014 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)]] released a five-point justification of its right to take non-Muslims hostage, and decapitate, ransom or enslave them.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnlee|first1=Varghese|title=ISIS Lists Out 5 Islamic Reasons to Justify Beheading Alan Henning and other Captives|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-lists-out-5-islamic-reasons-justify-beheading-alan-henning-other-captives-610585|access-date=13 October 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=6 October 2014}}</ref>

====Kidnapping as revenue====
[[Nasir al-Wuhayshi]] leader of the [[Islamist]] militant group [[Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]] describes kidnapped hostages as "an easy spoil... which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure."<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|last1=Callimachi|first1=Rukmini Maria|title=Paying Ransoms, Europe Bankrolls Qaeda Terror|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/world/africa/ransoming-citizens-europe-becomes-al-qaedas-patron.html|access-date=4 September 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 July 2014}}</ref>

A 2014 investigation, by journalist [[Rukmini Maria Callimachi]] published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' demonstrated that between 2008 and 2014, Al Qaeda and groups directly affiliated with al-Qaeda took in over US$125 million from kidnapping, with $66 million of that total paid in 2013 alone. The article showed that from a somewhat haphazard beginning in 2003, kidnapping grew into the group's main fundraising strategy, with targeted, professional kidnapping of civilians from wealthy European countries—principally France, Spain and Switzerland—willing to pay huge ransoms. US and UK nationals are less commonly targeted since these governments have shown an unwillingness to pay ransom.<ref name="nytimes1"/>

===Internet recruiting===
{{Main|Terrorism and social media}}
In the beginning of the 21st century, emerged a worldwide network of hundreds of web sites that inspire, train, educate and recruit young Muslims to engage in jihad against the United States and other Western countries, taking less prominent roles in mosques and community centers that are under scrutiny.

Some prominent Islamic terror groups and incidents include the following:

=== Africa ===
In the 1990s, a distinct pattern of jihadist attacks in East Africa emerged. In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) defeated [[Somali warlords]] which resulted in an armed jihadist movement controlling a territory of their own. The ICU was later militarily defeated and al-Shabaab was formed from its remnants. Al-Shabaab would later ally itself with al-Qaeda. In 2017, the [[European Union Institute for Security Studies|EUISS]] noted an increased frequency of jihadist violence in an arc extending across borders from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=African futures: Horizon 2025|last=Arnould, Valérie|others=Strazzari, Francesco,, Institute for Security Studies (Paris, France)|isbn=9789291986316|location=Paris|pages=47|oclc=1006747525}}</ref>

====Algeria====
The [[Armed Islamic Group]], active in Algeria between 1992 and 1998, was one of the most violent Islamic terrorist groups, and is thought to have [[takfir]]ed the Muslim population of Algeria. Its campaign to overthrow the Algerian government included [[List of Algerian massacres of the 1990s|civilian massacres]], sometimes wiping out entire villages in its area of operation. It also targeted foreigners living in Algeria, killing more than 100 expatriates in the country. In recent years it has been eclipsed by a splinter group, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), now called [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2008/06/sec-080627-cfr01.htm|title=Backgrounder: Armed Islamic Group (Algeria, Islamists) (a.k.a.

The majority of the perpetrators directly and indirectly involved in the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] were Moroccans. In the aftermath of that attack, Morocco became a focus of attention for anti-terrorist authorities in [[#Spain|Spain]].<ref name="ispi2018" />

While Morocco is generally seen as a secure destination for tourists as the last terrorist attack happened in [[2011 Marrakesh bombing|2011 where 17 people were killed by bomb at a restaurant in Marrakesh]], over 1600 people have travelled from Morocco to join the Islamic State in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Moroccan authorities initially ignored the people who joined ISIS but later on realised they could return to commit terrorist offences in Morocco. As a result, the ''Bureau Central d'Investigations Judiciaires'' (BCIJ) was formed.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/premium/indblik/Indland/ECE11086519/mindst-1600-marokkanere-sluttede-sig-til-is-nu-har-marokko-et-problem-med-hellige-krigere/|title=Hundreder af tikkende bomber i landet, som Islamisk Stat styrede udenom i syv år|date=2018-12-20|website=jyllands-posten.dk|access-date=2018-12-23}}</ref>

In the 2013–2017 period anti-terrorist authorities in Morocco, in cooperation with their counterparts in Spain, conducted up to eleven joint operations against jihadist cells and networks.<ref name="ispi2018" />

In 2016, the government developed a strategy to further adherence to the [[Maliki]] Islamic school of thought. The authorities removed Quranic passages that were deemed too violent from religious education textbooks. As a result, the textbooks were reduced to 24 lessons from the 50 lessons they had before.<ref name="ispi2018" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20161213-focus-morocco-school-reform-religious-education-islam-fight-extremism|title=FOCUS – Morocco reforms religious education to fight extremism|date=2016-12-13|website=France 24|language=en|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>

In 2017 it was estimated that {{Val|1623}} Moroccans and 2000 Moroccan-Europeans had travelled to join the Islamic State caliphate in the [[Syrian Civil War]], which along with other fighters from MENA countries contributed a significant force to ISIS.<ref name="ispi2018" />

According to a researcher at the [[Danish Institute for International Studies]], Moroccan authorities appear to have a good grip on the jihadist situation and cooperates with European and US authorities. Moroccans are overrepresented in "diaspora terrorism", that is terrorism which takes place outside the borders of Morocco. For example, two Moroccans were behind the [[2017 London Bridge attack]] and a Moroccan killed people by driving his van into pedestrians in [[La Rambla, Barcelona|La Rambla]] in the [[2017 Barcelona attacks|2017 Barcelona terrorist attacks]].<ref name=":03" />

Lethal attacks on civilians in Europe which have been credited to Islamist terrorism include the [[2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid]], where 191 people were killed, the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], also of public transport, which killed 52 commuters, and the 2015 [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], in [[Paris]], where 12 people were killed in response to the satirical weekly newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' depicting cartoons of [[Muhammad]]. On November 13, 2015 the French capital suffered [[November 2015 Paris attacks|a series of coordinated attacks]], claimed by [[ISIS]], that killed 129 people in restaurants, the [[Bataclan theatre]] and the [[Stade de France]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dearden|first1=Lizzie|title=Paris attack: Isis warns 'This is just the beginning' after killing at least 127 people in French capital|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/paris-attacks-this-is-just-the-beginning-isis-vows-after-killing-at-least-127-people-in-french-a6734546.html|access-date=17 November 2015|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 November 2015}}</ref>

Out of 1,009 arrests for terrorism in 2008, 187 were in relation to Islamist terrorism. The report showed that the majority of Islamist terror suspects were second or third generation immigrants.<ref name="Europol-2009a">{{cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/tesat2009_1.pdf|title=EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report TE-SAT 2009|year=2009|publisher=[[Europol]]|page=21|access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, a [[Europol]] report showed that more than 99% of terrorist attacks in Europe over the last three years were, carried out by non-Muslims.<ref name="Europol-2009a" />{{Page needed|date=December 2018}} Swedish economist [[Tino Sanandaji]] has criticised the use of statistics where the number of attacks are counted instead of the number of killed, since 79% of terrorist deaths 2001–2011 in Europe were due to Islamic terrorism. Therefore, statistics focusing on the number of attacks instead of the number killed are exploited by those who wish to trivialise the phenomenon.<ref name=":1t">{{Cite news|title=Islamists caused overwhelming majority of terrorist deaths in Europe during last decade|url=http://tino.us/2011/02/islamists-caused-overwhelming-majority-of-terrorist-deaths-in-europe-during-last-decade/|work=Tino Sanandaji blog|date=20 February 2011}}</ref> The great difference in the number of attacks versus the number of killed is that separatist attacks in Spain, typically involve vandalism and not killing. So in statistics, the global terrorist plot leading to the 9/11 attack and a party headquarters being vandalised and painted with slogans by domestic terrorists each count as one terrorist attack.<ref name=":1t" /> According to a report by [[Europol]] on terrorism in the [[European Union]], in 2016 "nearly all reported fatalities and most of the casualties were the result of jihadist terrorist attacks." A majority of about two-thirds of all terrorist-related arrests in the EU were also jihadist-related.<ref name="Europol17">{{Cite book|title=EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report (TE-SAT) 2017|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/eu-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-te-sat-2017|journal=EU Terrorism Situation & Trend Report (Te-Sat)|publisher=Europol|year=2017|page=10|isbn=978-9295200791}}</ref>

The pattern of jihadist attacks in 2017 led Europol to conclude that terrorists preferred to attack people rather than causing property damage or loss of capital.<ref name="Europol18">{{cite book|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|title=European Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 2018 (TE SAT 2018)|date=2018|publisher=[[Europol]]|isbn=978-92-95200-91-3|pages=5–9, 22–25, 35–36|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620144052/https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/tesat_2018.pdf|archive-date=20 June 2018}}</ref>

According to [[Susanne Schröter]], the 2017 attacks in European countries showed that the military defeat of the Islamic State did not mean the end of Islamist violence. Schröter also wrote that the events in Europe looked like a delayed implementation of jihadist strategy formulated by [[Abu Musab al Suri|Abu Musab al-Suri]] in 2005, where an intensification of terror should destabilise societies and encourage Muslim youth to revolt. The expected civil war never materialised Europe, but did occur in other regions such as North Africa and the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.normativeorders.net/de/presse/medienecho/40-presse/presse-echo/5606-dschihadisten-als-elitetruppe-des-islams-eine-klare-ablehnung-dieser-position-durch-islamische-verbaende-in-deutschland-fehlt-von-susanne-schroeter|title=Dschihadisten als Elitetruppe des Islams.

The deadly attacks in 2015 in France changed the issue of Islamist radicalization from a security threat to also constitute a social problem. Prime minister [[François Hollande]] and prime minister [[Manuel Valls]] saw the fundamental values of the French republic being challenged and called them attacks against secular, enlightenment and democratic values along with "what makes us who we are".<ref name="ispi2018" />

Although jihadists in the 2015-onward timeframe legitimized their attacks with a narrative of reprisal for France's participation in the international coalition fighting the Islamic State, Islamic terrorism in France has other, deeper and older causes. The main reasons France suffers frequent attacks are, in no particular order:<ref name=":7" />

* France's secular domestic policies (''[[Laïcité]]'') which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam. Also, France's status as an officially secular nation and jihadists label France as "the flagship of disbelief".<ref name=":7" />
*France has a strong cultural tradition in comics, which in the context Muhammad cartoons is a question of freedom of expression.<ref name="expressen20201104">{{Cite web|title=Därför är Frankrike så hårt terrordrabbat|url=https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/darfor-ar-frankrike-sa-hart-terrordrabbat/|access-date=2020-11-04|website=www.expressen.se|language=sv}}</ref>
*France has a large Muslim minority<ref name="expressen20201104"/>
*France's foreign policy towards Muslim countries and jihadist fronts. France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France's former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example, that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Bindner|first=Laurence|date=2018|title=Jihadists' Grievance Narratives against France|url=https://icct.nl/publication/jihadists-grievance-narratives-against-france/|journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies|pages=4–8|doi=10.19165/2018.2.01|doi-access=free}}</ref>
* Jihadists consider France as a strong proponent of disbelief. For instance, [[Marianne]], the national emblem of France, is considered as "a false idol" by jihadists and the French to be "idol worshippers". France also has no law against blasphemy and an [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom. The French nation state is also perceived as an obstacle towards establishing a caliphate.<ref name=":7" />

==== Germany ====
In the 2015–2020 time span, there were 9 [[Islamic terrorism in Europe|Islamic terrorist attacks]] and thwarted terrorist plots where at least one of the perpetrators had entered Germany as an asylum seeker during the [[European migrant crisis]]. The Islamic terrorists entered Germany either without identity documents or with falsified documents. The number of discovered plots began to decline in 2017. In 2020 German authorities noted that the majority of the asylum seekers entered Germany without identification papers during the crisis and security agencies considered unregulated immigration as problematic from a security aspect.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-20|title=Terroristen "kein Massenphänomen" in der Flüchtlingskrise|url=https://www.merkur.de/politik/terroristen-kein-massenphaenomen-in-fluechtlingskrise-zr-13837730.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=Merkur.de|language=de}}</ref>

====Italy====
{{See also|Terrorism in Italy#Islamic terrorism}}
Despite its proximity to the Middle East and North Africa, relatively porous borders, and a large influx of migrants from Muslim majority countries, Italy has not experienced the same surge in radicalization as other European countries. Just 125 individuals with ties to Italy left to join jihadist groups, compared with Belgium's 470 and Sweden's 300 such individuals in the same period from their much smaller populations. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, there have been a small number of plots either thwarted or failed. Two individuals born in Italy have been involved in terrorist attacks, Youssef Zaghba one of the trio of attackers in the June [[2017 London Bridge attack]] while ISIS sympathizer Tomasso Hosni attacked soldiers at [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan's Central station]] in May 2017.<ref name="ispi2018"/>

Deportation (expulsion) of suspects who are foreign nationals has been the cornerstone of Italy's preventive counter-terrorism strategy against jihadists.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ispionline.it/en/pubblicazione/measure-expulsions-extremism-21804|title=The measure of expulsions for extremism|last=ispisito|date=2018-12-14|website=ISPI|language=en|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Deportees are prohibited from re-entering Italy and the entire Schengen Area for at least five years. This measure is particularly effective because in Italy, unlike in other Western European countries, many radicalized Muslims are first-generation immigrants without [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizenship]]. As elsewhere in Europe, prison inmates show signs of radicalization while incarcerated. In 2018, 41 individuals were deported upon release.<ref name=":2" /> Of the 147 people deported from 2015 to 2017, all were related to Islamist radicalization and 12 were imams.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Marone|first=Dr Francesco|date=2017-03-13|title=The Use of Deportation in Counter-Terrorism: Insights from the Italian Case|url=https://icct.nl/publication/the-use-of-deportation-in-counter-terrorism-insights-from-the-italian-case/|language=en-US}}</ref> From January 2015 to April 2018, 300 individuals were expelled from Italian soil.<ref name="ispi2018" /> The vast majority of the deportees come from [[North Africa]], with most of the deportees come from [[Moroccans in Italy|Morocco]], [[Tunisian people in Italy|Tunisia]] and [[Egyptians in Italy|Egypt]].

====Russia====
[[File:Beslan school no 1 victim photos.jpg|thumb|[[Beslan school siege|Beslan school]] victim photos]]
Politically and religiously motivated attacks on civilians in Russia have been traced to separatist sentiment among the largely Muslim population of its [[North Caucasus]] region, particularly in [[Chechnya]], where the central government of the Russian Federation has waged two bloody wars against the local [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|secular separatist government]] since 1994. In the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in October 2002, three Chechen separatist groups took an estimated 850 people hostage in the Russian capital; at least 129 hostages died during the storming by Russian special forces, all but one killed by the chemicals used to subdue the attackers (whether this attack would more properly be called a [[nationalism|nationalist]] rather than an Islamist attack is in question). In the September 2004 [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] more than 1,000 people were taken hostage after a school in the [[Republics of Russia|Russian republic]] of [[North Ossetia–Alania]] was seized by a pro-Chechen multi-ethnic group aligned to [[Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs]]; hundreds of people died during the storming by Russian forces.<ref>''Foreign Affairs'', January/February 2008, p. 74, "The Myth of the Authoritarian Model"</ref>

Since 2000, Russia has also experienced [[Suicide attacks in the North Caucasus conflict|a string of suicide bombings]] that killed hundreds of people in the Caucasian republics of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]], as well as in Russia proper including Moscow. Responsibility for most of these attacks was claimed by either [[Shamil Basayev]]'s Islamic-nationalist rebel faction or, later, by [[Dokka Umarov]]'s pan-Islamist movement [[Caucasus Emirate]] which is aiming to unite most of Russia's North Caucasus as an [[emirate]] since its creation in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/40b2b7e8-3e84-11df-a706-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1QqDmL2UZ|title=Changing face of terror in Russia|work=Financial Times|access-date=7 January 2015}}</ref> Since the creation of the Caucasus Emirate, the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of Salafist-takfiri Jihadism<ref>Darion Rhodes, [http://www.ict.org.il/Article/132/Salafist-Takfiri%20Jihadism%20the%20Ideology%20of%20the%20Caucasus%20Emirate Salafist-Takfiri Jihadism: the Ideology of the Caucasus Emirate], International Institute for Counter-terrorism, March 2014</ref> which seeks to advance the cause of Allah on the earth by waging war against the Russian government and non-Muslims in the North Caucasus, such as the local [[Sufi]] Muslim population, whom they view as [[mushrikeen]] (polytheists) who do not adhere to true Islamic teachings.

According to investigations by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the bombing would likely have killed between 30 and 40 people had it succeeded, and it is thought that al-Abdaly operated with a network.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/bomben-skulle-ha-dodat-40-personer|title=Bomben skulle ha dödat 40 personer|date=5 December 2011|work=Svenska Dagbladet|language=sv}}</ref>

Historians have said that militant Islamism first gained ground among Kurds before its appeal grew among ethnic Turks and that the two most important radical Islamist organizsations have been an outgrowth of Kurdish Islamism rather than Turkish Islamism.<ref name="ReferenceA">*German Jihad: On the Internationalisation of Islamist Terrorism by Guido Steinberg. Columbia University Press, 2013</ref> The Turkish or Kurdish Hizbullah is a primarily Kurdish group has its roots in the predominantly Kurdish southeast of Turkey and among Kurds who migrated to the cities in Western Turkey.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The members of the IBDA-C were predominantly Kurds, most members if not all are ethnic Kurds like its founder, as in the Hizbullah. The IBDA-C stressed its Kurdish roots, and is fighting Turkish secularism, and is also anti-Christian. The Hizbula reestablished in 2003 in southeastern Turkey and "today its ideology might be more widespread than ever among Kurds there".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The influence of these groups confirms "the continuing Kurdish domination of Turkish islamism". Notable Kurdish Islamists include also<ref>Mamdouh Mahmud Salim</ref>(an Iraqi Kurd born in Sudan) co-founder of the Islamist terrorist network al-Qaeda. There is a strong Kurdish element in Turkish radical Islamism.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Kurdish and Turkish Islamists have also co-operated together, one example being the 2003 Istanbul bombings, and this co-operation has also been observed in Germany, as in the case of the Sauerland terror cell. Political scientist Guido Steinberg stated that many top leaders of Islamist organizations in Turkey fled to Germany in the 2000s, and that the Turkish Hizbullah has also "left an imprint on Turkish Kurds in Germany".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Also many Kurds from Iraq (there are about 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi Kurds in Germany) financially supported Kurdish-Islamist groups like Ansar al Islam.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Many Islamists in Germany are ethnic Kurds (Iraqi and Turkish Kurds) or Turks. Before 2006, the German Islamist scene was dominated by Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, but since 2006 Kurds and Turks from Turkey are dominant.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]] is a Palestinian Islamist group based in the [[Syria]]n capital, [[Damascus]], and dedicated to waging jihad to eliminate the state of Israel. It was formed by Palestinian Fathi Shaqaqi in the Gaza Strip following the [[Iranian Revolution]] which inspired its members. From 1983 onward, it engaged in "a succession of violent, high-profile attacks" on Israeli targets. The Intifada which "it eventually sparked" was quickly taken over by the much larger [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and Hamas.<ref>p. 122, ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam'' by Gilles Kepel</ref> Beginning in September 2000, it started a campaign of suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians. The PIJ's armed wing, the Al-Quds brigades, has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks in Israel, including suicide bombings. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by several Western countries.

[[Popular Resistance Committees]] is a coalition of a number of armed Palestinian groups opposed to what they regard as the conciliatory approach of the [[Palestinian Authority]] and [[Fatah]] towards Israel. The PRC is especially active in the [[Gaza Strip]], through its military wing, the [[Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades]].<ref>Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (September 15, 2009).
