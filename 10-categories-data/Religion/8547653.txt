The '''Middle Belt''' (also spelt '''Middle-Belt''' or Central Nigeria) is a term used in [[human geography]] to designate a belt region stretching across central [[Nigeria]] longitudinally and forming a transition zone between [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Nigeria. It is characterised by its lack of a clear majority ethnic group, and is the location of Nigeria's [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]]. The eminence of manifold minority groups, to some degree, constitutes an [[ethno-linguistic]] barrier in the country and draws a separation between the principally [[Muslim]] North and the mainly [[Christians|Christian]] south.<ref>{{aut|Johannes Harnischfeger}}, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftfXThvfQHkC&pg=PA38 Democratization and Islamic Law: The Sharia Conflict in Nigeria]'' (Frankfurt am Main 2008) p. 38. Campus Verlag. {{ISBN|3593382563}}</ref> The region is a convergence of these cultural domains and maintains a tremendous degree of ethno-linguistic diversity. [[Afro-Asiatic]], [[Nilo-Saharan]], and [[Niger–Congo]] languages are all spoken, which are three of the primary [[African language]] families.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Languages of Africa|url=https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/zflt/eng/zjfz/fzzl/t619829.htm|website=www.fmprc.gov.cn|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref> In the 1920s, it was described by Melzian (1928:496) as the "Middle Zone".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Melzian |first=H. |date=1928 |title=Review: [Untitled] |journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=495-496 |access-date=December 16, 2020 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1155920}}</ref>

== Overview ==
As to what the Middle-Belt entails, three top members of the Middle-Beltern struggle had this to say as presented in the pan-Middle-Beltern magazine, ''New Vision'' in December, 2000:
{{quote| "The Middle-Belt true to its name, is located in central Nigeria, and interacting with both the North and the South with large population of both Northern and Southern peoples, the Middle-Belt is always in the best position to interpret the North to the South, and the South to the North... What the Middle-Belt seeks therefore, is to advance its former stand as been addressed as North Central Zone to self identification as Middle-Belt region, and widen the scope of the informal sector which to this day cements the platform of our national unity, so that our elite in the Middle-Belt behave in the spirit of national unity, as adequately and persistently demonstrated by the grassroot people over the years."

- ''Chief Fidelis B. D. Seri, a member of the Editorial Board of the New Vision.''<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Seri |first=Fidelis |date=2000 |title=MIDDLE-BELT: AN AGENDA FOR THE 21ST CENTURY |journal=New Vision |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages= 10-11 }}</ref>}}

The veteran journalist, Chief Bayo Joseph, Media Consultant and Chairman, Editorial Board of the New Vision, on his own part said: {{quote| "Since amalgamation of 1914, the people of the Middle-Belt have been held under dehumanizing conditions, they are treated as third rated citizen, little or no regard is accorded their culture and tradition, while their so-called masters wallowed in affluence enjoying the best of everything to the detriment of the Middle-Belter... Accordingly, these people from the Middle-Belt have the right to discontinue their association with those who enslave them and hold their destiny in their hands."

- Bayo Joseph<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Joseph |first=Bayo |date=2000 |title=THOUGHTS OF A VETERAN |journal=New Vision |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages= 7-9 }}</ref>}}

On another flash, Onesimus Enesi added that: {{quote| "The people of the Middle-Belt are  not in the North and cannot therefore be northerners...Since it pleases God to distinguish the people he created along geographic, racial, national, ethnic and language divide, it is equally good to identify and call them as such and this is the wisdom behind the struggle for a separate identity for the people of the Middle-Belt."

- Onesimus Enesi<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Enesi |first=Onesimus |date=2000 |title=OPC VERSUS HAUSA/FULANI |journal=New Vision |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages= 13-18 }}</ref>}}

States of Nigeria which are generally referred to as belonging to the Middle Belt are: [[Benue State|Benue]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], [[Taraba State|Taraba]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Kogi State|Kogi]], [[Nassarawa State|Nassarwa]], [[Kwara State|Kwara]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]], the [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]] alongside [[Southern Kaduna]], Southern [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], Southern [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]], Southern [[Gombe State|Gombe]], Southern [[Yobe State]] and Southern [[Borno State|Borno]].<ref name=MB> {{Cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/28/nigeria-rising-toll-middle-belt-violence |title=Nigeria: Rising Toll of Middle-Belt Violence |date=June 28, 2018 |access-date=July 13, 2020 }}</ref>

The definition of the Middle Belt areas are subject to great debate due to the presence of significant number of ethnic [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] groups .{{Citation Needed|date=May 2020}} In addition, the Yoruba who are the predominant ethnic group in [[Kwara State|Kwara]] and [[Kogi State|Kogi]] have a strong affinity with the larger Yoruba body and frequently prefer not to be associated with the Middle Belt identity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The population of the middle belt is estimated to be over 35 million or more who are predominantly [[Christians]] and some few [[Muslims]] converts.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2020}} The area also has a very large significant number of the Hausa-Fulanis who are roughly 20% percent of the population.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2020}}

The Christians make about 70-75% of the population while the Muslims constitute 25-30% of the population.{{Citation Needed|date=May 2020}}

== Ethnic groups ==
Minorities in Nigeria tend to be dominated by the three largest ethnic groups, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] of the North, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of the Southwest and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of the Southeast. Surrounded by divergent religious, economic, and cultural histories, the middle belt has been the melting pot where small and large ethno-religious groups in Nigeria have long coexisted, but where they have also increasingly collided over land, resources, identity and political power.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/nigeria/07812.pdf|title = The Jos Crisis: A Recurrent Nigerian Tragedy|last = Higazi|first = Adam|date = January 2011|journal = Working Paper|access-date = 19 October 2015|issue = 2|publisher = Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|pages = 3–6}}</ref>

The result is a mixture of recurring conflicts and occasional political unity and solidarity amongst these highly differentiated peoples. An example for the latter was the [[United Middle Belt Congress]] that emerged following Nigeria's independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1960.

In particular, [[Jos]] city in [[Plateau State]] has been a centre for ethno-religious disputes and violence since the 1990s. The [[The Jos Forum Inter-communal Dialogue Process|Jos Forum Inter-Communal Dialogue process]] spanned 16 months from August 2013 - December 2014, and refers to a peace process undertaken by communities living in Jos that concluded in a “Declaration of Commitment to Peace”.

In 2018 violence escalated, with battles for scarce resources leading to over 500 deaths and 50 towns being destroyed. The clashes were largely between Muslim [[Fulani]] [[pastoralists]] and Christian [[Berom people|Berom]] farmers.  Over 300,000 people have been displaced by the violence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/africa/nigeria-herders-farmers.html?module=WatchingPortal&region=c-column-middle-span-region&pgType=Homepage&action=click&mediaId=thumb_square&state=standard&contentPlacement=9&version=internal&contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&contentId=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/africa/nigeria-herders-farmers.html&eventName=Watching-article-click|title=Nigeria’s Farmers and Herders Fight a Deadly Battle for Scarce Resources|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}</ref>
