A '''holy place''' is a place that people consider [[holy]] and/or a [[religion]] considers to be of special religious significance. A holy place may be visited by visitors, known as [[pilgrim]]s.

==Baháʼí Faith==
Located in [[Bahji]] near [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Israel]], the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] is the most holy place for followers of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] and their [[Qiblih]], or direction of prayer. It contains the remains of [[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the Baháʼí Faith and is near the spot where he died in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]]. The second holiest site is the [[Shrine of the Báb]] in [[Haifa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/misc/adh_holy.html|title=Holy Places of the World|work=adherents.com}}</ref>

In [[Iran]], the Baháʼís possessed several important holy sites, including the [[Baháʼí pilgrimage|House of the Bab]] in [[Shiraz]]; the [[Baháʼí pilgrimage|House of Baha]]' [[Allah]]'s father in [[Tehran]]; the shrine and grave of [[Quddús|Quddus]]. Since the Revolution, all these places have been demolished, and a mosque has been built on the site of the Bab's house.

[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] is said to have identified four sites most worthy of pilgrimage for [[Buddhists]], saying that they would produce a feeling of spiritual urgency. These are:<ref>The Buddha mentions these four pilgrimage sites in the [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta]]. See, for instance, Thanissaro (1998)[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.5-6.than.html#pilgrim] and Vajira & Story (1998)[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html#t-42].</ref>
*[[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]], is the most important religious site and place of pilgrimage, the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] houses what is believed to be the [[Bodhi Tree]] where the Buddha realized enlightenment and Buddhahood.
*[[Kushinagar]], India, is where the Buddha attained Parinirvana after his death.
*[[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]], is where [[Queen Maya]] gave birth to Prince Siddhartha Gautama.
*[[Sarnath]], India, is the deer park where the Buddha first taught the Dhamma after realizing enlightenment.

In the later commentarial tradition, four more sites were added to make Eight Great Places, places where a miraculous event is reported to have occurred:
*[[Sravasti]]: Place of the Twin Miracle, showing his supernatural abilities in performance of miracles. Sravasti is also the place where Buddha spent the largest amount of time, being a major city in ancient India.
*[[Rajgir]]: Place of the subduing of Nalagiri, the angry elephant, through friendliness. Rajgir was another major city of ancient India.
*[[Sankassa]]: Place of the descending to earth from [[Tusita]] heaven (after a stay of 3 months teaching his mother the [[Abhidhamma]]).
*[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]]: Place of receiving an offering of honey from a monkey. Vaishali was the capital of the Vajjian Republic of ancient India.

There are various other locations in India and Nepal associated with the Buddha, and there are holy sites located throughout Asia for each Buddhist tradition, for instance in Afghanistan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Thailand. [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] contains many culturally significant [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] sites such as the [[Potala Palace]], [[Jokhang]] temple and [[Norbulingka]] palaces.

==Christianity==

{{see also|List of Christian holy places in the Holy Land|Jerusalem in Christianity|Christian pilgrimage}}

In [[Christianity]], the primary holy places are significant because they are connected to the main events in the life of [[Jesus]], the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]] or [[Messiah]] to Christianity. Further, there are holy sites associated with events from the [[Old Testament]], or with the lives of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[John the Baptist]], and the [[Apostles]], with endless more associated with later Christian saints, holy men and women, and local traditions.

The most important Christian holy sites are the place of [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus' birth]], the major ones of his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], and those of his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]: 
* [[Jerusalem]] is believed to be the site of some of [[Jesus]]'s teaching, the [[Last Supper]], the subsequent institution of the [[Holy Eucharist]] as well as his entombment; Christians believe he was crucified on a nearby hill, Golgotha or [[Calvary]]. Jerusalem contains the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfFLc33_B_E|title=A Video Tour inside the church of the Holy Sepulchre}}</ref> [[Via Dolorosa]], [[Mount Zion]], the [[Mount of Olives]] and the [[Garden of Gethsemane]].
* [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of Jesus; see the [[Church of the Nativity]]
* [[Nazareth]] is Jesus's hometown and the scriptural place of the [[Annunciation]], venerated at the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Grotto of the Annunciation]] and the apocryphal [[Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation|site]] at [[Mary's Well]]
* The [[Jordan River]], and specifically the traditional site of the [[Baptism of Jesus]], known as [[Al-Maghtas]] on the East Bank in [[Jordan]] and extending onto the [[West Bank]] at [[Qasr al-Yahud]]

There is a wide range of places which have been proposed, forgotten, (re)discovered, etc., which are of different degrees of importance as holy, or pilgrimage sites, some based on local tradition, some recognised only by certain branches and sects of the Christian Church, some venerated only in a particular period, and some proposed by archaeologists. For those please see [[List of Christian holy places in the Holy Land]].

==Islam==
{{see also|Al-Aqsa Mosque|Jerusalem in Islam}}
[[File:Kaaba at night.jpg|thumbnail|150px|[[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] at night]]
The three holiest sites in [[Islam]] are the [[Masjid al-Haram]], or [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]], (in [[Mecca]]) ; the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]], or [[Prophet's Mosque]], (in [[Medina]]) and [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Every year millions of Muslims from all over the world visit [[Masjid al-Haram]] and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] to perform Hajj.

Muslims are also required, if able, to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca ([[Hajj]]) ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|dʒ}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hajj "Hajj"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{lang-ar|حَجّ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥaǧǧ}}'' "[[wikt:pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]") at least once in one's life:<ref>{{cite book|author=Juan Eduardo Campo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2696-8|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=OZbyz_Hr–eIC&pg=PA281 281]}}</ref>

==Judaism==
[[File:-Western Wall.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Western Wall]] by night.|alt=Jews praying at the Western Wall in the evening]]
{{see also|Temple Mount|Jerusalem in Judaism}}
In [[Jewish]] tradition, the [[Temple Mount]] is regarded as the place where [[Yahweh|God]] chose the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] to rest. Jewish tradition regards the Mount, or the [[Foundation Stone]], as the location of a number of important events mentioned in the Bible, including the location from which the world expanded into its present form, Abraham's [[binding of Isaac]], [[Jacob]]'s dream,<ref>[[Toledot]] 25:21</ref> the threshing floor which King [[David]] purchased from [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],<ref>[[2 Samuel]] 24:18–25</ref> and the location of the two Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]]. Jewish texts record that the Mount will be the site of the [[Third Temple]], which will be rebuilt with the coming of the messiah.

The Temple Mount is the holiest site in [[Judaism]] and is the place to which Jews turn during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the [[Holy of Holies]] stood. The Temple is mentioned extensively in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish services|services]]. [[Conservative Judaism]] mentions the Temple and its restoration, but not its [[korban|sacrifices]]. The destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]], and is remembered on a number of occasions such as in the breaking of a glass at the end of a wedding ceremony. Due to religious restrictions on entering the most sacred areas of the Temple Mount (see following section), the [[Western Wall]], a retaining wall of the Temple Mount and remnant of the [[Second Temple]] structure, is considered by some rabbinical authorities the holiest accessible site for Jews to pray.

Jerusalem itself is also the holiest city in Judaism, and the spiritual center of the Jewish people since the 10th century BCE.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=256076 Why Do Jews Love Jerusalem?] by Yeruchem Eilfort.  Chabad.org/ Ideas & Beliefs/Questions & Answers/Mitzvot & Jewish Customs</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2013}} The [[Four Holy Cities]] in [[Jews|Jewish]] tradition are the cities of [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Tiberias]], and [[Safed]]: The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] in 1906 noted: "Since the sixteenth century the [[Holiness of Palestine]], especially for burial, has been almost wholly transferred to four cities—Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias, and Safed."<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=32&letter=P#176 Palestine, Holiness Of] by Joseph Jacobs, Judah David Eisenstein.

Guru Arjan continued the infrastructure building effort of his father. The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan, financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The pool area grew into a temple complex with the [[gurdwara]] [[Harmandir Sahib]] near the pool.
