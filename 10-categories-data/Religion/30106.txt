'''Theodicy''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|i}}) means vindication of God. It is to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]], thus resolving the issue of the [[problem of evil]]. Some theodicies also address the [[evidential problem of evil]] by attempting "to make the existence of an [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omnibenevolence|all-good or omnibenevolent]] God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world."<ref>Philip A. Pecorino, ''An Introduction to Philosophy: An Online Textbook'' (2000), Chapter 3: ‘Philosophy of Religion’, Section 11: Problem of Evil, online at http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%203%20Religion/Problem_of_Evil.htm. Retrieved September 26, 2015.</ref> Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that [[existence of God|God's existence]] is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.<ref>A defence is “an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction between the existence of God... and the existence of evil.” Michael Rea and Louis B. Pojman, eds., ''Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology'' (Cengage Learning, 2015, 7th ed.), 229.</ref> The German philosopher and mathematician [[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work ''[[Théodicée]]'', though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher [[John Hick]] traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, ''Evil and the God of Love'', identifying three major traditions:
# the Plotinian theodicy, named after [[Plotinus]]
# the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which Hick based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]
# the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which Hick developed, based on the thinking of St. [[Irenaeus]]

The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.<ref>Richard Swedberg, Ola Agevall, ''The Max Weber Dictionary: Key Words and Central Concepts'' (Stanford University Press, 2005), 274.</ref> Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it.<ref>Peter L. Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (Doubleday, 1st ed, 1967), 55.</ref>  Following the [[Holocaust]], a number of [[Jewish theology|Jewish theologians]] developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's [[Alvin Plantinga's free-will defense|version of the free-will defence]] argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.{{Citation needed lead|date=October 2016}}

Similar to a theodicy, a [[#Cosmodicy and anthropodicy|cosmodicy]] attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.

==Definition and etymology==
As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the "answer to the question of why God permits evil".<ref>Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom, and Evil'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 10.</ref> Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] that seems inconsistent with the existence of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] deity.<ref>http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theodicy and {{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=1}}</ref> Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word ''theodicy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words Θεός ''Τheos'' and δίκη ''dikē''. ''Theos'' is translated "God" and ''dikē'' can be translated as either "trial" or "judgement".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=di/kh "δίκη"]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.</ref> Thus, theodicy literally means "justifying God".<ref>''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', s. v. [http://0-www.britannica.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/EBchecked/topic/590596/theodicy "theodicy"], accessed October 20, 2013.</ref>

In the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Nick Trakakis]] proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:
* Common sense views of the world
* Widely held historical and scientific opinion
* Plausible moral principles<ref name=IEP>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H4 |title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |encyclopedia=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |author=Trakakis, Nick}}</ref>

As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists.<ref>Bunnin & Tsui-James 2002, p. 481</ref> A theodicy is often based on a prior [[natural theology]], which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen.<ref>Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61</ref> Defenses propose solutions to the [[logical problem of evil]], while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.<ref name=IEP/>

{{quote|"It is important to note that there are at least two concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad concept picks out any bad state of affairs...

Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral evils.

{{quote|Most theorists writing about evil believe that evil action requires a certain sort of motivation... the desire to cause harm, or to do wrong,...pleasure (Steiner 2002), the desire to annihilate all being (Eagleton 2010), or the destruction of others for its own sake (Cole 2006).

==Reasons for theodicy==
The German philosopher [[Max Weber]] interpreted theodicy as a social problem<ref>Swedberg 2005, pp. 273–74</ref> and viewed theodicy as a "problem of meaning". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly [[rationality|rational]], the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a "meaningful cosmos". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated.<ref>Scott 2009, p. 2</ref> He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.<ref>Swedberg 2005, p. 275</ref> For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—[[predestination]], [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and [[karma]]—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.<ref>Scott 2009, p. 4</ref>

The sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary.<ref>Scott 2009, pp. 5–7</ref> Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.<ref>Woodhead 2001, p. 74</ref>

The philosopher Richard Swinburne says "most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God."<ref name="Richard Swinburne"/>{{rp|2}}

==History==
The term ''theodicy'' was coined by the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work, written in French, ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil'').<ref>Leibniz 1734</ref> Leibniz's ''Théodicée'' was a response to [[skepticism|skeptical]] Protestant philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], who wrote in his work ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the [[Bible]] asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ | title=Pierre Bayle | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=January 22, 2012 | author=Lennon, Thomas}}</ref>

French philosopher [[Voltaire]] criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (''Poem on the Lisbon disaster''), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon earthquake]] demonstrated that God was not providing the "best of all possible worlds".<ref>Voltaire, [[Candide]] and ''Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne''</ref> Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel ''Candide''.<ref>Mason (1992), p. 10</ref>

In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil "theodicies", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of [[natural theology]], meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm | title=Theodicy | publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia | year=2012 | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Kempf, Constantine}}</ref>

In 1966, British philosopher [[John Hick]] published ''Evil and the God of Love'', in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own.<ref>Cheetham 2003, p. 40</ref> In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, [[Augustinian theodicy|Augustinian]], which had dominated [[Western Christianity]] for many centuries, and [[Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean]], which was developed by the Eastern [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.<ref>Hall 2003, p. 132</ref>

In his dialogue "Is God a Taoist?",<ref>Smullyan 1977, p. 86</ref> published in 1977 in his book ''[[The Tao is Silent]]'', [[Raymond Smullyan]] claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing "evil", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce "evil", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ancient religions===
“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.”<ref>Birnbaum, David (1989). ''God and Evil''. Hoboken: Ktav Pub. House. p. 4</ref> In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.<ref>Assman, Jan (2001). ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'' trans. David Lorton. Cornell University Press. 169</ref>

Philip Irving Mitchell of the [[Dallas Baptist University]] notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy.htm | title=Theodicy: An Overview | publisher=Dallas Baptist University | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Mitchell, Philip Irving}}</ref> [[Sarah Iles Johnston]] argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held [[polytheistic]] beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many [[deity|gods]] and [[goddess]]es who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued [[human]]ity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.<ref>Johnston 2004, pp. 531–47</ref>

The "[[Epicurean trilemma]]" however was already raised {{circa|300&nbsp;BC}} by [[Epicurus]]. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.

====Biblical theodicy====
{{Main|Theodicy and the Bible}}
The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the [[Book of Job]] is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.<ref>''The Old Testament''. Modern Library Edition, Introduction, authored by George Steiner.</ref><ref name="Grace Ko">{{cite book|title=Theodicy in Habakkuk|last1=Ko|first1=Grace|date=2014|publisher=Paternoster|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

{{Quote|text=The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice... beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty... The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control.|sign=|source=}}

It is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy.<ref>Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil By Mark S. M. Scott</ref>{{rp|21,28}} There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil.... Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].... It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."<ref>Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil, By Mark S.

M.|title=Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil|date=2015|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-6470-2}}</ref>{{rp|27}}

This is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation.<ref name="Grace Ko" />{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}} Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as "the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.<ref name="Grace Ko" />{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

Sweeney]] says "...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront...

Theodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. "The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end—"the soul that sins shall die"—and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations." It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blenkinsopp|first1=Joseph|title=Ezekiel|date=1990|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-8042-3118-4}}</ref>{{rp|82}}

It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope.<ref name="Grace Ko" />{{rp|Intro, Chapter 3}} Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.<ref name="Paul L.

Psalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked.

For the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God.<ref>John M. Frame and Joseph E. Torres, Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&R Publishing, 2015), 184.</ref> "Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human free will, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm.... the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils."<ref name="Richard Swinburne" />{{rp|Intro.,51}}

This is somewhat illustrated in the [[Book of Exodus]] when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.<ref>Apologetics, Frame 178–79.</ref>

===Augustinian theodicy===
{{Main|Augustinian theodicy}}
The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] reading of [[Augustinian theodicy]], as promoted primarily by [[John Hick]], is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=24 March 2000; substantive revision 12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}</ref> The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a [[privation]]—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil.<ref>Menn 2002, p. 170</ref> Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this [[original sin]].<ref>Corey 2000, pp. 177–78</ref> The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist.<ref>Green 2011, p. 779</ref> It maintains that God remains blameless and good.<ref>Geivett 1995, p. 19</ref>

In the [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]] reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the issue of [[just war]] as developed in his book [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause.<ref>[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09).

Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.<ref>[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

===Irenaean theodicy===
{{Main|Irenaean theodicy}}
[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents.<ref name="Encountering evil">
Davis 2001, pp. 40-42</ref> In the twentieth century, [[John Hick]] collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a "vale of soul-making" (a phrase that he drew from [[John Keats]]), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.<ref>Stump 1999, pp. 222–27</ref>

===Origenian theodicy===
In direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither [[Augustine of Hippo]] nor [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the [[Church Fathers]] who articulated a theory of ''[[apokatastasis]]'' (or [[universal reconciliation]]), [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.<ref>Scott, Mark (2012). ''Origen and the Problem of Evil'', Oxford University Press.</ref>

===Relatively minor theodicies===
[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.<ref>Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 436–54.</ref>
:* The [[Finite God]] Theodicy maintains that God is all-good ([[omnibenevolent]]) but not all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]).
:* The [[Best of all possible worlds|Best of all Possible Worlds]] Theodicy, a traditional theology, argues that the creation is the best of all possible worlds.
:* The [[Original Sin]] Theodicy holds that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin.
:* The Ultimate Harmony Theodicy justifies evil as leading to “good long-range consequences”.
:* The Degree of Desirability of a Conscious State Theodicy has been reckoned a “complex theodicy.”<ref>Ramblings of a Thomist, Blog of March 27, 2008 http://thomisticramblings.blogspot.com/2008/03/minor-theodicies-and.html. Accessed September 25, 2015.</ref> It argues that a person’s state is deemed evil only when it is undesirable to the person. However, because God is unable to make a person’s state desirable to the person, the theodic problem does not exist.<ref>Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 444–45. Martin finds this theodicy in George Schlesinger, ''Religion and Scientific Method'' (Springer Science & Business Media, 2012) and judges it unsatisfactory.</ref>
:* The [[Reincarnation]] Theodicy believes that people suffer evil because of their wrong-doing in a previous life.
:* The Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
:* The Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

=== Islamic world ===
[[Mu'tazila]] theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of [[moral realism]], according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts.<ref name=shihadeh>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ayman Shihadeh|title=Suffering|editor=Josef W.

Most Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] standpoint.<ref name=shihadeh/> [[Ash'ari]] theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions.<ref name=shihadeh/> Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (''khalq'') from acquisition (''kasb'') of actions.<ref name=roy>{{cite book|title=What is Islamic Philosophy?|author=Roy Jackson|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|pages=32–33|isbn=9781317814047|date=2014-02-05}}</ref> They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of [[Al-Shahrastani]] (1086–1153):<ref name=roy/>

{{quote|God creates, in man, the power, ability, choice, and will to perform an act, and man, endowed with this derived power, chooses freely one of the alternatives and intends or wills to do the action, and, corresponding to this intention, God creates and completes the action.}}

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|url-access=subscription |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=roy/>

[[Ibn Sina]], the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, [[neoplatonic]] standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world.<ref name=shihadeh/> Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.<ref name=shihadeh/>

Philosophical Sufi theologians such as [[Ibn Arabi]] were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of [[Ibn Sina]].<ref name=shihadeh/> [[Al-Ghazali]] anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum "There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Religious Diversity, Evil, and a Variety of Theodicies |author=Michael L.

The [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]], whose writings became influential in [[Wahhabism]], argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts.<ref name=hoover>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Jon|last=Hoover|title=Ḥanbalī Theology|editor=Sabine Schmidtke|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199696703-e-014|url-access=subscription |page=642}}</ref> He held that divine creation is good from a causal standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes.<ref name=hoover/> Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist.<ref name=hoover/> This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].<ref name=hoover/>

===Jewish anti-theodicy===
{{Main|Holocaust theology}}
In 1998, Jewish theologian [[Zachary Braiterman]] coined the term anti-theodicy in his book ''(God) After Auschwitz'' to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to [[Job (religious figure)|Job's]] protests in the [[Book of Job]].<ref>Marty & Taliaferro 2010, p. 17</ref> Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.<ref>Gibbs & Wolfson 2002, p. 38</ref>

The [[Holocaust]] prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] circles.<ref>Pinnock 2002, p. 8</ref> French Jewish philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]], who had himself been a [[prisoner of war]] in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be "blasphemous", arguing that it is the "source of all immorality", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.<ref>Patterson & Roth 2005, pp. 189–90</ref>

Professor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'', supports the "theology of protest", which he saw as presented in the play, ''[[The Trial of God]]''. He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the [[book of Job]], in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice.<ref>Blumenthal 1993, pp. 250–51</ref> Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book ''The Cunning of History''.<ref>Rubinstein, Richard L. ''The Cunning of History''.</ref>

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, ''emunah'') in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of "holy protest" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham ([[Vayeira|Genesis 18]]) and Moses ([[Ki Tissa|Exodus 33]]), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: "Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy,<ref>''Über das Misslingen aller philosophischen Versuche in der Theodizee'' http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf</ref> a viable practical theodicy is identified with [[Chabad messianism|messianism]]. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to [[Elie Wiesel]].<ref>http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/ The original letter in Yiddish is found in R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ''Likutei Siḥot'', Vol. 33 (New York: Kehot, 1962–2001), pp. 255–60.</ref>

===Christian alternatives to theodicy===
A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”.<ref>Todd Billings, "Theodicy as a 'Lived Question': Moving Beyond a Theoretical Approach to Theodicy", http://www.luthersem.edu/ctrf/JCTR/Vol05/billings.htm Accessed September 25, 2013. About the author: http://www.westernsem.edu/about/faculty-staff/.</ref> In the same vein, [[Nick Trakakis]] observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.”<ref>Nick Trakakis, “Theodicy: The Solution to the Problem of Evil, or Part of the Problem?”, [https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11841-008-0063-6 Springerlink.com], accessed December 19, 2009.</ref> As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil.<ref>Donald W. Musser and [[Joseph L. Price]], eds., ''A New Handbook of Christian Theology'' (Abingdon Press, 1992), s.v. “Tragedy.”</ref> For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”.<ref>Wendy Farley, ''Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: a Contemporary Theodicy'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1990) 12, 23.</ref> Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.<ref>Sarah Katherine Pinnock, ''Beyond Theodicy'' (SUNY Press, 2002), 135, 141.</ref>

[[Karl Barth]] viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of [[divine providence]]”.<ref>Karl Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'' (T & T Clark, 1957), IV-1, 246.</ref> Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes "the idea of the goodness of God".<ref>Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', III-1, 368.</ref> For Barth, only the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers.<ref>Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 165.</ref> This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic.<ref>Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 246.</ref> Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion:<ref>Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 223.</ref> the [[Justification (theology)|justification of sinful humanity]] and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.<ref>Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 564.</ref>

[[Christian Science]] offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists.<ref>Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil", 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."</ref><ref>Whale, J. S. The Christian answer to the problem of evil. 1948</ref> [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Mark Twain]] had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by [[Stephen Gottschalk]].<ref>"Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism" (Indiana University Press, 2006) 83, 123, etc.</ref>

===Free-will defense===
{{see also|Theodicy and the Bible#Bible and free-will theodicy}}
As an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] offers [[Alvin Plantinga's free-will defense|a free-will defense]] which argues that human [[free will]] sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible.<ref>McGrath 1995, p. 193</ref> He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent.<ref>Plantinga & Sennett 1998, pp. 22–24</ref> Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.<ref name="Ehrman2009">{{cite book|author=Bart D.

===Cosmodicy and anthropodicy<!--'Anthropodicy' redirects here-->===
A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the [[universe]] in the face of [[evil]], and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of [[human nature]] in the face of the evils produced by humans.<ref>Carsten Meiner, Kristin Veel, eds., ''The Cultural Life of Catastrophes and Crises'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2012), 243.</ref>

Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma.<ref>Van der Ven 1989, p. 205</ref> Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as "a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts".<ref>Devenish 1992, pp. 5–23</ref> Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:
{{quote|In classical terms, this is to broach the problem of theodicy: how to think about God in the face of the presence of suffering in God's creation. After God's dethronement as the subject of history, the question rebounds to the new subject of history: the human being. As a consequence, theodicy becomes anthropodicy – justifications of our faith in humanity as the subject of history, in the face of the suffering that is so inextricably woven into the history that humanity makes.<ref>Ashley 2010, pp. 870–902</ref>}}

==== Essential kenosis ====
Essential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as "open theism") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence|publisher = IVP Academic|date = 2015-12-06|isbn = 9780830840847|language = English|first = Thomas Jay|last = Oord}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Love: A Theology|url = https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Love-Dr-Thomas-Oord-ebook/dp/B003UD7QQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447257773&sr=1-1&keywords=nature+of+love+oord|publisher = Chalice Press|date = 2010-04-10|language = English|first = Thomas|last = Oord}}</ref>

Gijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a "metaphysical dualism", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls "the power of love" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.<ref name="Gijsbert van den Brink">{{cite book| last=van den Brink| first=Gijsbert| title=Almighty God: A Study on the Doctrine of Divine Omnipotence| publisher=Kok Pharos publishing House| location=Kampen, the Netherlands|year=1993|pages=263–73}}</ref>
