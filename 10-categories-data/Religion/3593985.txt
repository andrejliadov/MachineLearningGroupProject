'''Pralaya''' ({{lang-sa|प्रलय||destruction}}), in [[Hindu cosmology]], is an [[kalpa (aeon)|aeonic]] term for ''dissolution''.

A ''Pralaya'' specifies different periods of time during which a non-activity situation persists, as per different formats or contexts. The word ''Mahapralaya'' stands for "Great Dissolution". During each pralaya, the lower ten realms ([[loka]]) are destroyed,<ref name=shivp>{{cite book |title=Shiv Purana|author=B. K. Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|year=2004|isbn=8171827217 |page=124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bchgql0em9YC&q=Swargaloka&pg=PA124 }}</ref> while the higher four realms, including [[Satya-loka]], Tapa-loka, Jana-loka, and Mahar-loka, are preserved. During each Mahapralaya, all 14 realms are destroyed.

In the [[Samkhya]] philosophy, one of the six schools of classical [[Indian philosophy]], ''pralaya'' means "non-existence", a state of matter achieved when the three gunas (principles of matter) are in perfect balance. The word ''pralaya'' comes from Sanskrit meaning "dissolution" or by extension "reabsorption, destruction, annihilation or death".
