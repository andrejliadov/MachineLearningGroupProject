==Parish==
The parish was established in October 1879, under the supervision of [[the Rev.]] (later [[Monsignor]]) James W. Power, a native of Ireland, who was its first [[pastor]].<ref name=Lafort>Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA309 The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.]''. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p. 309.</ref> The parish was originally intended for the neighborhood's Irish immigrants. As the neighborhood has changed, the parish today is predominantly African-American and Nigerian.<ref name=organ/> It is currently staffed by the [[Franciscan]] Friars.

==Building==
All Saints is known as the "St. Patrick's of Harlem"<ref name=fromatoz /> because of its size and design, the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], or alternatively [[Venetian Gothic]], brick church with terracotta trimming was dedicated in 1893.<ref name=organ/> The design is festooned with rose windows in the clerestory and a prominent bell tower. "The vaulted interior is also rich in details, including comfortable hand-carved pews, murals and stained glass."<ref name=organ/>

==School==
The parish school was built by Power soon after the church, and was initially run by the [[Christian Brothers of Ireland]], who were brought by him to educate the children of Irish immigrants, and the [[Sisters of Charity of New York]]. The school's enrollment in its early years reached almost 2,000 students, mostly girls. Within the parish, the Sisters also operated All Saints Academy, which taught 120 high school students, and the Brothers operated All Hallows Collegiate Institute for boys. Additionally, a Home for Working Girls was run by the Franciscan Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart.<ref name=Lafort />

All Saints School was among 27 schools closed by Archbishop Dolan in the [[Archdiocese of New York]] on 11 January 2011.<ref>McQuillan, Alice "[http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/New-York-Archdiocese-to-Close-27-Schools-113316029.html New York Archdiocese to Close 27 Schools]," ''[[NBC New York]]'', 11 January 2011 (Accessed 7 February 2011)</ref><ref>[[Archdiocese of New York]], "[http://www.archny.org/news-events/news-press-releases/index.cfm?i=18750 Reconfiguration Committee Recommendations Regarding “At-Risk” Schools Accepted By Archdiocese Of New York] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117051434/http://www.archny.org/news-events/news-press-releases/index.cfm?i=18750 |date=2011-01-17 }}," Official Press Release, 11 January 2011 (Accessed 7 February 2011)</ref>{{clear left}}
