The '''Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life''' is a [[research centre]] on the [[University of Alberta]]'s [[Augustana University College|Augustana Campus]] in [[Camrose, Alberta]]. It is the first such centre in a public university in Canada to focus on the intersection of religion and public life.

==Background==
The Ronning Centre is named in for [[Chester Alvin Ronning]], Canadian diplomat and principal of Camrose Lutheran College from 1927 to 1942. The Chester Ronning Centre for the Study of Religion and Public Life grew from the merger of [[Augustana University College]] with the [[University of Alberta]] in 2004. The Centre's activities involve a diversity of communities. It seeks to enhance debate on contested issues through lively discussion.<ref>https://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/research/centres/ronningcentre/aboutus/ University of Alberta, Augustana Campus,
