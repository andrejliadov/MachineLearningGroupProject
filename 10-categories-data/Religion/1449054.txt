The concept behind the ''10/40 Window'' highlights these three elements (as of data available in 1990): an area of the world with great poverty and low quality of life, combined with lack of access to Christian resources and unreached non-Christians. The Window forms a band encompassing [[Sahara]]n and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[animist]], [[Jewish]], or [[atheist]]. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.<ref name=wfb/><ref name=ow/><ref name=wce/>

==Origin==
This region of the world was previously known to Christians as the "resistant belt", as noted by [[Luis Bush]] at the 1989 [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne II Conference in Manila]]. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based [[GIS]] software.<ref>Atlas GIS, produced by Strategic Mapping Inc., was the first PC Geographic Information System.{{cite news|url=http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php |title=ESRI Retires ArcCAD and Atlas GIS| accessdate= September 21, 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070925180632/http://www.gismonitor.com/news/newsletter/archive/040501.php| archivedate= September 25, 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the ''10/40 box''. A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the ''10/40 Window'', stating that this region ought to be seen as a "window of opportunity".{{citation needed |date= September 2007}} The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase ''10/40 Window region''.

Before being called the "resistant belt", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the "unoccupied fields" by [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer|Samuel Zwemer]], in his book by that same title, published in 1911.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zwemer|first=Samuel M. |title=The Unoccupied Mission Fields of Africa and Asia|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924023021417|location=New York|publisher=Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions|page=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924023021417/page/n339 260]|year=1911}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Some<ref>Verbal and online discussions, no documentation available outside of Wikipedia itself.</ref> have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.

The 1990 research data states:
* this part of the world was home to the largest populations living in deep poverty and lowest [[quality of life]];<ref name=wfb/><ref name=mappoor/><ref name=mapqual/>
* this part of the world did have least access to Christian resources. Note the emphasis on ''access'' not ''percent Christian''. The West has ubiquitous access to such resources; this area of the world did and does not.<ref name=ow/><ref name=wce/>

This research deals in overall population characteristics. The ''10/40 Window'' is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:
* The 10/40 Window article refers to the "poorest of the poor" living in that region (based on late-1980s per-capita [[GNP]] under US$500).<ref name=wfb/><ref name=ow/> Of the three billion people living in such poverty-stricken nations, 82% lived in the 10/40 Window. Yet the 10/40 Window also includes nations such as [[South Korea]] and Japan. In the late 20th century, Japan boasted the world's third largest economy, and South Korea the eleventh. Such nations were strong throughout the late 20th century.
* Geographically, the 10/40 Window includes the [[Philippines]] and [[Portugal]], which both have a Roman Catholic Christian majority; [[Greece]], where almost 98% of the population belonged to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]; and South Korea, which is home to the largest single congregation church in the world<ref>The largest congregation is in Seoul ([[Yoido Full Gospel Church]]) {{cite news |url=http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html |title=The Top 10 Churches in the World (by size)| accessdate= August 20, 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162953/http://mondaymorninginsight.typepad.com/monday_morning_insight_we/2005/05/the_top_10_chur.html| archivedate= September 27, 2007 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> and is also the second largest missionary-sending nation in the world.<ref name=misinc>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html |title=Missions Incredible|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107083606/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2006/march/16.28.html|archivedate=November 7, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> The 10/40 Window does not encompass [[Indonesia]] or Sri Lanka, nations that had very little access to Christian resources.<ref name=ow/>

==Analysis==
The original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):
*82% of the poorest of the world's poor (per capita GNP less than US$500 per year),<ref name=mappoor>{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The Poorest Countries & The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}</ref>
*84% of those with lowest quality of life (life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy),<ref name=mapqual>{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Quality of Life & The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}</ref>
*the hub of the world's major non-Christian religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.,)<ref name=maprel>{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Three Religious Blocks & The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}</ref><ref name=mapislam>{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=Islam &  & The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}</ref>

*The least Christian resource investment<ref>Well below 10 percent in any of the study populations. Each of the cited maps provides side data on population, Christian involvement, etc in the various study populations (poor, low quality of life, non-Christian, etc)</ref> and least sharing of the Christian message<ref name=mapleast>{{cite map|publisher=AD2000|title=The 55 Least Evangelized Countries & The 10/40 Window|edition=August 1, 1990|cartography=GMI/GRDB}}</ref>

The GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World<ref name=ow/> almanac, the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]],<ref name=wce/> and the [[World Factbook]].<ref name=wfb/>

===Non-Christians in the 10/40 Window by religion===
The first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:
* 28 Muslim countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 2 Hindu countries, 1.1 billion population est. (2000)
* 8 Buddhist countries, 237 million population est. (2000)

[http://home.snu.edu/~hculbert/1040.htm Later updates] have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of "[[unreached]]" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:
*865 million Muslims
*550 million Hindus
*275 million Buddhists
*140 million in 2550 tribal groups (mainly animist)
*17 million Jews<ref>Note that this number is higher than the census-based world total of 14 million. However, even authoritative [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html Jewish sources] state that many Jews do not identify themselves in population censuses.</ref>

===Nations in the 10/40 Window===
The 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the [[Joshua Project]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/resources/articles/10_40_window |title=What is the 10/40 Window? |publisher=joshuaproject.net |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>

These were all [[Old World]] nations (mostly in the [[eastern hemisphere]]) with at least 50 percent of their land area falling within 10 to 40 degrees latitude as of 1990. (The list also included [[Gibraltar]] and [[Macau]], which are not independent nations.) See the [http://www.ad2000.org/1040coun.htm list of nations] in the original study.
