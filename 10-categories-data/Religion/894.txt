The English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the word ''agnostic'' in 1869, and said "It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe."
Earlier thinkers, however, had written works that promoted agnostic points of view, such as [[Sanjaya Belatthaputta]], a 5th-century BCE [[Ancient Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] who expressed agnosticism about any [[afterlife]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |title=Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life |others=a part of the Digha Nikaya translated in 1997 by Thanissaro Bhikkhu |quote=If you ask me if there exists another world (after death),&nbsp;...

==Defining agnosticism ==

{{quote|Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern. It simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.

Consequently, agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of popular theology, but also the greater part of anti-theology. On the whole, the "bosh" of [[heterodoxy]] is more offensive to me than that of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason and science, and orthodoxy does not.<ref>Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html "Agnosticism: A Symposium"], ''The Agnostic Annual.'' 1884</ref>|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|That which Agnostics deny and repudiate, as immoral, is the contrary doctrine, that there are propositions which men ought to believe, without logically satisfactory evidence; and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions.<ref>Thomas Huxley, [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn-X.html "Agnosticism and Christianity"], ''Collected Essays V'', 1899</ref>|Thomas Henry Huxley}}

{{quote|Agnosticism, in fact, is not a creed, but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle&nbsp;...

Being a scientist, above all else, [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] presented agnosticism as a form of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting, objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. [[Karl Popper]] would also describe himself as an agnostic.<ref name="Edward Zerin 1998">Edward Zerin: Karl Popper On God: The Lost Interview. ''Skeptic'' '''6''':2 (1998)</ref> According to philosopher [[William L. Rowe]], in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.<ref name=RoweRoutledge/>

[[George H. Smith]], while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word,<ref>George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 9</ref> and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word,<ref>George H. Smith, Atheism: The Case Against God, pg. 12</ref> promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic. Smith rejects agnosticism as a third alternative to [[theism]] and [[atheism]] and promotes terms such as [[agnostic atheism]] (the view of those who do not hold a belief in the existence of any [[deity]], but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable) and [[agnostic theism]] (the view of those who believe in the existence of a deity(s), but claim that the existence of a deity is unknown or inherently unknowable).<ref name=Smith1979>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FI7ZAAAAMAAJ&q=agnostic+theist |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H |last=Smith |authorlink=George H.

Theism and atheism refer to the presence or absence of belief in a god; agnosticism refers to the impossibility of knowledge with regard to a god or supernatural being. The term ''agnostic'' does not, in itself, indicate whether or not one believes in a god. Agnosticism can be either theistic or atheistic. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-87975-124-1 }}

===Etymology===
''Agnostic'' ({{ety|grc|ἀ- (a-)|without||[[wikt:γνῶσις|γνῶσις]] (gnōsis)|knowledge}}) was used by Thomas Henry Huxley in a speech at a meeting of the [[Metaphysical Society]] in 1869 to describe his philosophy, which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Dixon| first = Thomas| title = Science and Religion: A Very Short Introduction| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 2008| location = Oxford| page = 63| isbn = 978-0-19-929551-7}}

Early [[Christianity|Christian]] church leaders used the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[gnosis]]'' (knowledge) to describe "spiritual knowledge". Agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of [[Gnosticism]] in particular; Huxley used the term in a broader, more abstract sense.<ref name="nknxjx">{{cite web|title=ag·nos·tic|website=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2011|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=agnostic&submit.x=20&submit.y=28|accessdate= November 15, 2013}}

Huxley identified agnosticism not as a creed but rather as a method of [[Skepticism|skeptical]], evidence-based inquiry.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97DaE6BzKTsC&pg=PA41 |title=Aphorisms and Reflections |first=Henrietta A.| last=Huxley|publisher=Kessinger Publishing |year=2004|edition=reprint |pages=41–42|isbn=978-1-4191-0730-6}}</ref>

===Qualifying agnosticism===
[[Scottish Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt. He asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where a statement is true by definition (e.g. [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] such as "all bachelors are unmarried" or "all triangles have three corners").<ref>Hume, David, "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748)</ref>

===Types===
;Strong agnosticism (also called "hard", "closed", "strict", or "permanent agnosticism"): The view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of a deity or deities, and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience.

;Weak agnosticism (also called "soft", "open", "empirical", or "temporal agnosticism"): The view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable; therefore, one will withhold judgment until evidence, if any, becomes available.

;Apathetic agnosticism: The view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans.

{{quote|Let us call this unknown something: God. It is nothing more than a name we assign to it. The idea of demonstrating that this unknown something (God) exists, could scarcely suggest itself to Reason. For if God does not exist it would of course be impossible to prove it; and if he does exist it would be folly to attempt it. For at the very outset, in beginning my proof, I would have presupposed it, not as doubtful but as certain (a presupposition is never doubtful, for the very reason that it is a presupposition), since otherwise I would not begin, readily understanding that the whole would be impossible if he did not exist.

{{quote|The first time that M. Hume found himself at the table of the Baron, he was seated beside him. I don't know for what purpose the English philosopher took it into his head to remark to the Baron that he did not believe in atheists, that he had never seen any.

Raised in a religious environment, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) studied to be an Anglican clergyman.

====Thomas Henry Huxley====

Agnostic views are as old as [[philosophical skepticism]], but the terms agnostic and agnosticism were created by [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] (1825-1895) to sum up his thoughts on contemporary developments of metaphysics about the "unconditioned" ([[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]) and the "unknowable" ([[Herbert Spencer]]). Though Huxley began to use the term "agnostic" in 1869, his opinions had taken shape some time before that date. In a letter of September 23, 1860, to [[Charles Kingsley]], Huxley discussed his views extensively:<ref name="Huxley1997">{{cite book|author=Thomas Henry Huxley|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=The Major Prose of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://archive.org/details/majorproseofthom00huxl|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-1864-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/majorproseofthom00huxl/page/357 357]–}}

{{quote|I neither affirm nor deny the immortality of man. I see no reason for believing it, but, on the other hand, I have no means of disproving it. I have no ''a priori'' objections to the doctrine. No man who has to deal daily and hourly with nature can trouble himself about ''a priori'' difficulties. Give me such evidence as would justify me in believing in anything else, and I will believe that. Why should I not? It is not half so wonderful as the conservation of force or the indestructibility of matter&nbsp;...

It is no use to talk to me of analogies and probabilities. I know what I mean when I say I believe in the law of the inverse squares, and I will not rest my life and my hopes upon weaker convictions&nbsp;...

That my personality is the surest thing I know may be true. But the attempt to conceive what it is leads me into mere verbal subtleties. I have champed up all that chaff about the ego and the non-ego, noumena and phenomena, and all the rest of it, too often not to know that in attempting even to think of these questions, the human intellect flounders at once out of its depth.}}

And again, to the same correspondent, May 6, 1863:<ref name="HuxleyHuxley2011">{{cite book|author1=Leonard Huxley|author2=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-azeZXAf6MMC&pg=PA347|date=December 22, 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-04045-7|pages=347–}}</ref>
{{quote|I have never had the least sympathy with the ''a priori'' reasons against orthodoxy, and I have by nature and disposition the greatest possible antipathy to all the atheistic and infidel school.

I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce to believe in the immortality of what we call Matter and Force, and in a very unmistakable present state of rewards and punishments for our deeds—have to these doctrines? Give me a scintilla of evidence, and I am ready to jump at them.}}

Of the origin of the name agnostic to describe this attitude, Huxley gave the following account:<ref>{{cite book| title=Collected Essays, Vol. V: Science and Christian Tradition| first=Thomas| last=Huxley| isbn= 1-85506-922-9| publisher=Macmillan and Co 1893| pages=237–239}}</ref>
{{quote|When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. They were quite sure they had attained a certain "gnosis"–had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. And, with Hume and Kant on my side, I could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion&nbsp;...

So I took thought, and invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of "agnostic". It came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the "gnostic" of Church history, who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was ignorant.&nbsp;... To my great satisfaction the term took.}}

In 1889, Huxley wrote:<blockquote>Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.<ref>{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Thomas Henry|authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley|title=Essays Upon Some Controverted Questions|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b7aAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA364|year=1892|publisher=Macmillan|page=364|chapter=Agnosticism And Christianity|quote=Agnosticism And Christianity: Therefore, although it be, as I believe, demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the authorship, or of the date of composition of the Gospels, as they have come down to us, and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject.

He calls upon his readers to "stand on their own two feet and look fair and square at the world with a fearless attitude and a free intelligence".<ref name="Russell1992" />

In 1939, Russell gave a lecture on ''The existence and nature of God'', in which he characterized himself as an atheist. He said:<ref>{{cite book| last=Russell| first= Bertrand| title=Collected Papers, Vol 10|page=255}}</ref>
{{quote|The existence and nature of God is a subject of which I can discuss only half. If one arrives at a negative conclusion concerning the first part of the question, the second part of the question does not arise; and my position, as you may have gathered, is a negative one on this matter.}}

However, later in the same lecture, discussing modern non-anthropomorphic concepts of God, Russell states:<ref>''Collected Papers, Vol. 10'', p.258</ref>
{{quote|That sort of God is, I think, not one that can actually be disproved, as I think the omnipotent and benevolent creator can.}}

In Russell's 1947 pamphlet, ''Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic?'' (subtitled ''A Plea For Tolerance in the Face of New Dogmas''), he ruminates on the problem of what to call himself:<ref name="Russell1997">

{{quote|As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one can prove that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist, because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God, I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods.}}

In his 1953 essay, ''What Is An Agnostic?'' Russell states:<ref name="Russell2009">{{cite book|author=Bertrand Russell|title=The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm58AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA557|date=March 2, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-02867-2|pages=557–}}

{{quote|An agnostic thinks it impossible to know the truth in matters such as God and the future life with which Christianity and other religions are concerned. Or, if not impossible, at least impossible at the present time.

Are Agnostics Atheists?

No. An atheist, like a Christian, holds that we can know whether or not there is a God. The Christian holds that we can know there is a God; the atheist, that we can know there is not. The Agnostic suspends judgment, saying that there are not sufficient grounds either for affirmation or for denial.}}

Later in the essay, Russell adds:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_5.php |title='What Is an agnostic?' by Bertrand Russell |publisher=Scepsis.net |accessdate=February 2, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822181953/http://scepsis.net/eng/articles/id_5.php |archivedate=August 22, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>

I believe that with infinite arms Nature embraces the all—that there is no interference—no chance—that behind every event are the necessary and countless causes, and that beyond every event will be and must be the necessary and countless effects.

Is there a God? I do not know. Is man immortal? I do not know. One thing I do know, and that is, that neither hope, nor fear, belief, nor denial, can change the fact. It is as it is, and it will be as it must be.}}

{{quote|We can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.}}

==== Bernard Iddings Bell ====
Canon [[Bernard Iddings Bell]] (1886-1958), a popular cultural commentator, Episcopal priest, and author, lauded the necessity of agnosticism in ''Beyond Agnosticism: A Book for Tired Mechanists'', calling it the foundation of "all intelligent Christianity."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://anglicanhistory.org/usa/bibell/goodnews/02.html|title=The Good News, by Bernard Iddings Bell (1921)|website=anglicanhistory.org|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Agnosticism was a temporary mindset in which one rigorously questioned the truths of the age, including the way in which one believed God.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The religious roots of postmodernism in American culture: an analysis of the postmodern theory of Bernard Iddings Bell and its continued relevance to contemporary postmodern theory and literary criticism.|last=Brauer|first=Kristen D.|publisher=University of Glasgow|year=2007|isbn=|location=Glasgow, Scotland|pages=32}}</ref> His view of [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] and [[Thomas Paine]] was that they were not denouncing true Christianity but rather "a gross perversion of it."<ref name=":0" /> Part of the misunderstanding stemmed from ignorance of the concepts of God and religion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=20}}</ref> Historically, a god was any real, perceivable force that ruled the lives of humans and inspired admiration, love, fear, and homage; religion was the practice of it. Ancient peoples worshiped gods with real counterparts, such as [[Mammon]] (money and material things), [[Nabu]] (rationality), or [[Baal|Ba'al]] (violent weather); Bell argued that modern peoples were still paying homage—with their lives and their children's lives—to these old gods of wealth, physical appetites, and self-deification.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond Agnosticism|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1929|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=12–19}}</ref> Thus, if one attempted to be agnostic passively, he or she would incidentally join the worship of the world's gods.

In ''Unfashionable Convictions (1931),'' he criticized the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s complete faith in human [[Sense|sensory perception]], augmented by scientific instruments, as a means of accurately grasping Reality. Firstly, it was fairly new, an innovation of the Western World, which [[Aristotle]] invented and [[Thomas Aquinas]] revived among the scientific community. Secondly, the divorce of "pure" science from human experience, as manifested in American [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]], had completely altered the environment, often disfiguring it, so as to suggest its insufficiency to human needs. Thirdly, because scientists were constantly producing more data—to the point where no single human could grasp it all at once—it followed that human intelligence was incapable of attaining a complete understanding of universe; therefore, to admit the mysteries of the unobserved universe was to be ''actually'' scientific.

Bell believed that there were two other ways that humans could perceive and interact with the world. ''Artistic experience'' was how one expressed meaning through speaking, writing, painting, gesturing—any sort of communication which shared insight into a human's inner reality. ''Mystical experience'' was how one could "read" people and harmonize with them, being what we commonly call love.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=4–5}}</ref> In summary, man was a scientist, artist, and lover. Without exercising all three, a person became "lopsided."

Bell considered a [[Humanism|humanist]] to be a person who cannot rightly ignore the other ways of knowing. However, humanism, like agnosticism, was also temporal, and would eventually lead to either scientific [[materialism]] or [[theism]]. He lays out the following thesis:

# Truth cannot be discovered by reasoning on the evidence of scientific data alone. Modern peoples' dissatisfaction with life is the result of depending on such incomplete data. Our ability to reason is not a way to discover Truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly. Without a full, human perception of the world, one's reason tends to lead them in the wrong direction.
# Beyond what can be measured with scientific tools, there are other types of perception, such as one's ability know another human through loving. One's loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal, but we know them far better than we know the surface of the sun. They show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal, and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than detached facts can provide.
# To be religious, in the Christian sense, is to live for the Whole of Reality (God) rather than for a small part (gods). Only by treating this Whole of Reality as a person—good and true and perfect—rather than an impersonal force, can we come closer to the Truth. An ultimate Person can be loved, but a cosmic force cannot. A scientist can only discover peripheral truths, but a lover is able to get at the Truth.
# There are many reasons to believe in God but they are not sufficient for an agnostic to become a theist. It is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book, even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias, it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what we are taught in school. Neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal God would have to show human beings how to live, considering they have so much trouble on their own. Nor is it enough to believe for the reason that, throughout history, millions of people have arrived at this Wholeness of Reality only through religious experience. The aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion, but they fall short of convincing. However, if one presupposes that God is in fact a knowable, loving person, as an experiment, and then lives according that religion, he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown. One's life becomes full, meaningful, and fearless in the face of death. It does not defy reason but ''exceeds'' it.
# Because God has been experienced through love, the orders of prayer, fellowship, and devotion now matter. They create order within one's life, continually renewing the "missing piece" that had previously felt lost. They empower one to be compassionate and humble, not small-minded or arrogant.
# No truth should be denied outright, but all should be questioned. Science reveals an ever-growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings. Reason is to be trusted and cultivated. To believe in God is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts, but to step into the unknown and discover the fullness of life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unfashionable Convictions|last=Bell|first=Bernard Iddings|publisher=Harper & Brothers Publishing|year=1931|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=25–28}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Agnosticism is criticized from a variety of standpoints. Some religious thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to [[materialism]]. Some atheists criticize the use of the term agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.<ref name="EB-Agnosticism"/>

===Theistic===
Theistic critics claim that agnosticism is impossible in practice, since a person can live only either as if God did not exist (''etsi deus non-daretur''), or as if God did exist (''etsi deus daretur'').<ref name=SM>

====Christian====
According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]], strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific [[truth]].<ref name=YOJC/><ref name=TT/> He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.<ref name=YOJC>{{cite book| title=The Yes of Jesus Christ: Spiritual Exercises in Faith, Hope, and Love| first=Joseph| last=Ratzinger|publisher=Cross Roads Publishing|year=2005}}

"Agnosticism", said Ratzinger, "is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man&nbsp;... The knowledge of God has always existed".<ref name=TT/> He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the [[scientific method]], a readiness to be purified by the truth.<ref name=YOJC/>

The [[Catholic Church]] sees merit in examining what it calls "partial agnosticism", specifically those systems that "do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge".<ref name="CEnc1">{{cite encyclopedia

</ref> However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The [[Council of the Vatican]] declares, "God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation".<ref name="CEnc1"/>

[[Blaise Pascal]] argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as [[Pascal's Wager]]: the [[Infinity|infinite]] expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer "bet" to choose God.<ref name=PKPW>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| title=Argument from Pascal's Wager| year=2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605044148/http://peterkreeft.com/topics/pascals-wager.htm| archivedate=June 5, 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>

===Atheistic===
According to [[Richard Dawkins]], a distinction between agnosticism and atheism is unwieldy and depends on how close to zero a person is willing to rate the probability of existence for any given god-like entity. About himself, Dawkins continues, "I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden."<ref>''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, p.&nbsp;51</ref> Dawkins also identifies two categories of agnostics; "Temporary Agnostics in Practice" (TAPs), and "Permanent Agnostics in Principle" (PAPs). He states that "agnosticism about the existence of God belongs firmly in the temporary or TAP category. Either he exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question; one day we may know the answer, and meanwhile we can say something pretty strong about the probability" and considers PAP a "deeply inescapable kind of fence-sitting".<ref>''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), Bantam Press, pp&nbsp;47-48</ref>

==Ignosticism==
A related concept is [[ignosticism]], the view that a coherent definition of a deity must be put forward before the question of the existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not coherent, the ignostic holds the [[theological noncognitivism|noncognitivist]] view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |title=The Argument From Non-Cognitivism |accessdate=October 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429162223/http://www.strongatheism.net/library/atheology/argument_from_noncognitivism/ |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> [[Alfred Ayer|A.&nbsp;J. Ayer]], [[Theodore Drange]], and other philosophers see both atheism and agnosticism as incompatible with ignosticism on the grounds that atheism and agnosticism accept "a deity exists" as a meaningful proposition that can be argued for or against.<ref>Ayer, ''Language'', 115: "There can be no way of proving that the existence of a God&nbsp;... is even probable.&nbsp;... For if the existence of such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experimental propositions which were not deducible from those other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is not possible."</ref><ref name="Drange">Drange, ''Atheism''</ref>
