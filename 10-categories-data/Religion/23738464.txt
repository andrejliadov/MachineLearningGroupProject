'''Anaisa Pye''' (alternatively, '''Anaisa Pie''', '''Anaisa Pie Danto''', or '''Anaisa La Chiquita''') is a popular [[loa]] within religion in the Dominican Republic.  She is considered the [[patron saint]] of love, money, and general happiness within the religion in the [[Dominican Republic]] [[#Afro-Caribbean religions|21 Divisions]]. 

She is often considered extremely flirtatious, generous, and playful by her devotees. She, as well as other worshipers, are concerned for other female loas, as they consider themselves able to provide for anything a person could request.  

Among Dominican [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] believers, she is [[Syncretism#Religious_syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Saint Anne]]. Her altars are often decorated with pictures and statues of Saint Anne and [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|the child Mary]].   She is said to work very well with [[Belie Belcan]], another popular loa who is associated with [[St. Michael: Roman Catholic traditions and views|Saint Michael the Archangel]]. Icons of Saint Anne are generally placed next to icons of Saint Michael in Vodou households and temples.  

Her [[feast day]] is celebrated on 26 July. Her favorite colors are yellow and pink.  Some people consider [[Our Lady of Charity|Cachita]] to be one of her ''puntos'' (or incarnations).
