'''Agricultural spiritualism''' or the '''Spirit of Agriculture''' refers to the idea that the concepts of [[food]] [[production (economics)|production]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and the essential [[spiritualism|spiritual]] nature of [[human race|humanity]] are linked. It assumes that spirituality is inherent to human [[consciousness]], is perhaps a product of it, and is accessible to all who cultivate it. The association with [[agriculture]] includes such agricultural [[metaphor]]s as "cultivate" in language used by most [[mysticism|mystics]] across history.

Followers of this idea state the following reasons to justify this link:
*Agriculture was the preoccupation of the majority of the [[population]] of the world at the time that the major [[scripture]]s of the continuing [[religion]]s were compiled.
*The approach that agriculture takes to creating the optimal conditions for production of its [[harvest]] is the same as that recommended by the traditional religions for producing insight or wisdom.
*Historically, the adoption of agriculture liberated part of a population to focus on understanding of spirituality.
