'''Irreligion in [[Montenegro]]''' refers in its narrowest sense to [[agnosticism]], [[atheism]], [[secular humanism]], and general [[secularism]]. Increase of the number of irreligious people is usually interpreted by the [[Modernization theory|modernization]] marked with tendency of secularization and the progress of science and technology that directly affect human society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/ateisti-cg-vjerske-organizacije-manipulisu-osjecanjima-gradana|title=Ateisti CG: Vjerske organizacije manipulišu osjećanjima građana|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref>

The majority of Montenegro's population, 98.69%, declares to belong to a religion,<ref name="monstat 2011" /> though observance of their declared religion may vary widely.

On the census from 2011, atheists, those who declared no religion, comprised about 1.24% of the whole population, and agnostics 0.07%.<ref name="monstat 2011" />

Religiosity is lowest in the [[Bay of Kotor]] region and the capital city of [[Podgorica]].<ref name="monstat 2011" />

Municipalities with highest share of atheists are [[Herceg Novi]] (2.43%), [[Kotor]] (2.03%), [[Podgorica]] (1.99%) and [[Tivat]] (1.7%). In contrast, [[Rožaje]] has the fewest atheists, who make up only 0.01% of its population.<ref name="monstat 2011" />

In some municipalities more than half of population are undeclared, however.
