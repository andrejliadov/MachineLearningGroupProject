The study of '''religion and video games''' is a subfield of [[Religion and the Internet|digital religion]], which the American scholar of communication, [[Heidi Campbell]], defines as "Religion that is constituted in new ways through digital media and cultures." (Campbell, 2012, p.&nbsp;3).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Heidi|title=Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415676113|page=288}}</ref> Video games once struggled for legitimacy as a cultural product, today, however, they are both business and art.<ref>{{cite podcast

==Defining religion and religious elements==
[[Religion]] has several definitions. [[Organized religion|Religions]] that are [[Religious organization|organized]] can be seen as [[cultural system]]s, with corresponding [[religious behaviour|behavior]] and practice. They often have [[sacred text]]s and [[holy places]]. A [[religious experience]], however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.

Themes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are [[Existentialism|existential]] in nature; while they are not immediately understood as "religious", they are about the [[meaning of life]].

==Use of religious elements==
[[Video game developer]]s use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Testa |first= Alessandro |title= Religion(s) in Videogames Historical and Anthropological Observations |url= http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/issue/view/1449/showToc |journal= Online - Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet |volume= 05 |issue= Religion in Digital Games.

The negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.<ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/>

Religious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other.<ref name="Understanding">{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Terry Ray |last2= Clanton | first2 = Dan W. |date= 2012 |title= Understanding Religion and Popular Culture: Theories, Themes, Products and Practices|publisher= [[Routledge]]|page= 130 |isbn= 9780415781060}}</ref> Religion in ''Mass Effect'', for instance, can be understood as an "[[unseen character]]".<ref name="auto">Irizarry, J.A. & Irizarry, I.T.

Volume 05 (2014)</ref>

===Explicit narrative references===
An explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring.<ref name="Understanding"/> These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] and names of characters from [[religious text]]s are used as reference points.

====Ancient religions====
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture}}
Ancient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like [[ancient Greek religion]].<ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/> In the real-time strategy game ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the player has to choose a "major god", which gives certain gameplay benefits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |title=Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review |date=9 May 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |access-date=2016-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201162520/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |archive-date=2016-02-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> In ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' the nameless Prince has to fight [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], an evil deity from [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Crecente, B. |year=2008 |title=Prince of Persia Ditches Roots, Gets a Final Fantasy Make-Over, |access-date=18 September 2015 |url=http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make-over |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150133/http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make+over |archive-date=2014-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Events and places====
Real world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2007) is [[historical fiction|fictional]], it is set during the [[Third Crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]; the player takes on the role of the [[Order of Assassins|Assassin]] [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims.<ref>{{cite web |author=LeJacq, Y. |year=2014 |title=Assassin's Creed Can Actually Teach You A Thing Or Two |url=http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |access-date=2016-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413112801/http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |archive-date=2016-04-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a "sanitized manner".<ref name="Kotaku Good">{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |title= Religion in Games: Less a Leap of Faith, More a Suspension of Belief |last= Good |first= Owen |date= 2010-04-04 |website= [[Kotaku]] |access-date= 2016-02-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090030/http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |url-status= live }}</ref>

====Organizations====
Religion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series involve a religion, or a cult.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |title=The Rules of Religion, and Why The Next One Just Might Be a Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |access-date=2016-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114184723/http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |archive-date=2016-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Religious violence====
In the action role-playing game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks.<ref name="auto1">Thames, R. C. Religion as a Resource in Digital Games. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective & Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)</ref> The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood.

==Video games as a religious medium==
Players and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|title=It's time we consider video games as ‘experiences,’ not mere products|work=[[VentureBeat]]|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924061323/http://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|archive-date=2016-09-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Developer [[Jenova Chen]] said that "I feel that ''Journey'' is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with ''Journey''—this is because many religions partly share a common structure".

===Religious video games===
{{see also|Christian video game|Islamic Fun}}
Some religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]''.

===Use of video games in a religious setting===

==Controversies==
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
Opinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are [[List of banned video games|banned]] for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''  Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment.<ref name="Kotaku Good"/> As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact.<ref>Ong, A. The Religions Behind Final Fantasy. History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business March 22, 2001</ref> Ubisoft's ''Assassin's Creed'' series show a disclaimer: {{blockquote| "Inspired by historical events and characters.

Despite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games.

===Christianity===
The game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' is heavily based on the notion of [[American exceptionalism]] at the turn of the 20th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of [[baptism]]. One developer on [[Irrational Games]] staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to consider baptism in relation to forgiveness rather than merely as a religious tenet.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | title = Bioshock Infinite altered after "conversations with religious people on the team" says Levine | first = Leon | last = Hurley | date = January 18, 2013 | access-date = January 20, 2013 | work = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122031459/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | archive-date = January 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | title = BioShock Infinite's religious themes led dev to consider quitting | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 28, 2013 | access-date = February 28, 2013 | website = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130301165135/http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | archive-date = 2013-03-01 | url-status = live }}</ref> At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref name="kotaku refund">{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/some-dont-like-bioshocks-forced-baptism-enough-to-as-473178476 | title = Some Don't Like BioShock's Forced Baptism.

The action game ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]]. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. "Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration", said Zed. "Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India." He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' sold beyond their expectations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |title=Hindu Statesman Criticizes Sony's Hanuman: Boy Warrior |website=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-20 |first=Leigh |last=Alexander |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921064557/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |archive-date=2016-09-21 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |title=India's First Game Gets India's First Game Controversy |website=[[Kotaku]] |access-date=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-18 |first=Owen |last=Good |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609200450/http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |archive-date=2016-06-09 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india/|title=Hindus Protest PS2 Game Released in India|work=GamePolitics|date=2009-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175535/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india|archive-date=2009-04-20}}</ref>

Zed was also critical of the use of [[Hindu deities]] in the [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''. In response, developer [[Hi-Rez Studios]] COO Todd Harris said that ''Smite'' would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that "the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay".<ref>Connor Sheridan on June 29, 2012, http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101200627/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/ |date=2016-01-01 }}</ref>

==Religion and violence==
A study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|title=Study Says Video Games Have 'Problematized' View of Religion|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|access-date=2016-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007080713/http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|archive-date=2015-10-07|url-status=live}}</ref> Researcher Greg Perreault said "It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|title=Video Games Depict Religion as Violent, Problematized, MU Study Shows|publisher=MU News Bureau|access-date=2016-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414101736/http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Games as focus of religious studies==
{{main|Game studies}}

For many years video games were seen as mere [[entertainment]], a form of "low culture".<ref>Mäyrä, F. An Introduction to Game Studies (2008). SAGE Publications. Page 30</ref> Playing video games was seen as a form of [[escapism]]<ref>Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 58</ref> and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To "play" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as "ludicrous".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|title=Here Be Dragons: the quest for academic credibility|work=The Critical Religion Association|access-date=2016-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034830/http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study.<ref>Newman, J. Videogames (2012). Routledge. Page 10</ref> Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an [[object (philosophy)|object]], while [[actant|actor-focused]] research looks at the player.

===Game-immanent approach===
Video games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as "[[Text (literary theory)|texts]]". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created.<ref name="auto2">Campbell, H. (ed.). Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds (2012). Rutledge. Page 145</ref> By "reading" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games.<ref>Campbell, H. A. en Grieve, G. P. Studying Religion in Digital Gaming. A Critical Review of an Emerging Field. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective & Interdisciplinary Approaches. Volume 05 (2014)</ref> This can be done in several ways.

*by studying the design, rules and mechanics or by talking to the developers
*by watching others play (e.g. [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play videos]])
*by playing the game themselves<ref>[[Espen Aarseth]]</ref>

===Player-focused approach===
Video games are [[Interactivity|interactive]]; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game "happen".<ref name="auto2"/><ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Luke |editor-last=Cuddy |title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |date=2008 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago |page=119}}</ref> As such, it is up to individual player to give [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] to their experience.<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=James |title=Videogames |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |page=14}}</ref>

Video games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters.<ref name="auto"/> Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character [[Commander Shepard]] of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series an atheist, while others thought of him/her{{efn|Commander Shepard can be female or male.}} as a Christian.<ref>Knoll, T. "Are Those the Only Two Solutions?" In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. Wysocki, J. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field. Volume 07 (2015)</ref> As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.<ref name="auto1"/>
