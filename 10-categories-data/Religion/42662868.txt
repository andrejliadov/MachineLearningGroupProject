'''Amrit Velā''' ({{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ ਵੇਲਾ}}, lit: Time of Amrit) begins at the start of a new day, therefore, begins at 3:00 am and ends at 6:00 am, [1] which is used for daily meditation and recitation of Gurbani hymns. Guru Nanak in the Japji Sahib (4th Pauri) says, "During the hours of Amrit velā, meditate on the grandeur of the one true Name."[1] The importance of Amrit Vela is found throughout the Guru Granth Sahib. The Guru Granth Sahib states that "those who consider themselves a Sikh must wake up daily at Amrit Vela and be in tune with the Naam (the Lord's Name)"[3]

In the Sikh Rehat Maryada, it is written to arise Amrit Velā, bath, and meditate on the divine Naam (through Simran and Naam Japna). Sikhs recite their morning Nitnem during Amrit Vela. Traditionally after Nitnem Sikhs meet with the Sangat (congregation) to recite Asa di Var.[4]
