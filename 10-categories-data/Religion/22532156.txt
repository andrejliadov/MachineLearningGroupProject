[[File:TokugawaIemochi grave.JPG|thumb|[[Tokugawa Iemochi]]'s grave at Zōjō-ji, one of the two Tokugawa ''bodaiji'']]A {{nihongo|'''bodaiji'''|菩提寺| lit. "[[bodhi]] temple"}} in Japanese Buddhism is a temple which, generation after generation, takes care of a family's dead, giving them burial and performing ceremonies in their soul's favor.<ref name="kojien">Iwanami kojien</ref> The name is derived from the term {{nihongo|''bodai''|菩提}}, which originally meant just Buddhist enlightenment ([[satori]]), but which in Japan has also come to mean either the care of one's dead to ensure their welfare after death or happiness in the beyond itself.<ref name="kojien"/> Several samurai families including the Tokugawa had their ''bodaiji'' built to order, while others followed the example of commoners and simply adopted an existing temple as family temple. Families may have more than one ''bodaiji''. The [[Tokugawa clan]], for example, had two, while the [[Ashikaga clan]] had several, both in the [[Kantō]] and in the [[Kansai]].
