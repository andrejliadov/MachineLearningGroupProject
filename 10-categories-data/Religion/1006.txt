==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Jacques Bergé, Aaron- Aaron, KBS-FRB.jpg|thumb|Aaron depicted by Jacques Bergé]]
According to the [[Book of Exodus]], Aaron first functioned as [[Moses]]' assistant. Because Moses complained that he could not speak well, God appointed Aaron as Moses' "prophet" (Exodus 4:10-17; 7:1).{{refn|group=note|He spoke and acted on behalf of Moses with the Egyptian royal court, including performing miraculous "signs" to validate Moses' mission.}} At the command of [[Moses]], he let his rod turn into a snake.<ref>[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+7%3A9–7%3A9&version=NRSV Exodus 7:9, New Revised Standard Version]</ref> Then he stretched out his [[Aaron's rod|rod]] in order to bring on the first three plagues.<ref>Exodus 7:19 {{Bibleref|Exodus|7:19||HE}}, Exodus 8:1,12.</ref><ref>Exodus 8:1, {{Bibleref|Exodus|8:1||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 8:12{{Bibleref|Exodus|8:12||HE}}</ref> After that, Moses tended to act and speak for himself.<ref>Exodus 9:23 {{Bibleref|Exodus|9:23||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 10:13 {{Bibleref|Exodus|10:13||HE}}</ref><ref>Exodus 10:22 {{Bibleref|Exodus|10:22||HE}}</ref>

During the journey in the wilderness, Aaron was not always prominent or active. At the [[Battle of Refidim|battle with Amalek]], he was chosen with [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] to support the hand of Moses that held the "[[Staff of Moses|rod of God]]".<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|17:9|KJV}}</ref> When the revelation was given to Moses at [[biblical Mount Sinai]], he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit. While [[Joshua]] went with Moses to the top, however, Aaron and Hur remained below to look after the people.<ref>
{{Bibleref|Exodus|24:9|14|KJV}}</ref> From here on in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, Joshua appears in the role of Moses' assistant while Aaron functions instead as the first high priest.

===High Priest===
{{See also|High Priest of Israel|Kohen}}
The books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] maintain that Aaron received from God a monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants (Exodus 28:1). The family of Aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to [[Yahweh]]. The rest of his tribe, the [[Levite]]s, were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary (Numbers 3). Moses anointed and consecrated Aaron and his sons to the priesthood, and arrayed them in the robes of office (Leviticus 8; cf. Exodus 28-29). He also related to them God's detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened (Leviticus 1–7, 11-27). Aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the [[Urim and Thummim]] by which the will of God could be determined (Exodus 28:30).<ref name=Olson>{{harvnb|Olson|2000|pp=1–2}}</ref> God commissioned the Aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean, and to teach the divine laws (the [[Torah]]) to the Israelites (Leviticus 10:10-11). The priests were also commissioned to bless the people (Numbers 6:22-27).<ref>{{harvnb|Mariottini|2006}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|6:22–27|KJV}}</ref> When Aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and, with Moses, "blessed the people: and the glory of the {{LORD}} appeared unto all the people: And there came a fire out from before the {{LORD}}, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces" (Leviticus 9:23-24).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|9:23–24|KJV}}</ref> In this way, the institution of the Aaronide priesthood was established.<ref name="phod">{{harvnb|Souvay|1913|p=7}}</ref>

In later books of the Hebrew Bible, Aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the [[Babylonian captivity]] and later. The books of [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The [[Book of Ezekiel]], which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the [[Zadokites]] after one of King David's priests.<ref name=Olson/> It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]], [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]]. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. What is clear is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the [[Second Temple period]].<ref>{{harvnb|VanderKam|2004}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}</ref> Most scholars think the Torah reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. 

===Conflicts===
Aaron plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts during Israel's wilderness wanderings. During the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai, the people provoked Aaron to make a [[golden calf]]. (Exodus 32:1-6). This incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites (Exodus 32:10). Moses successfully intervened, but then led the loyal Levites in executing many of the culprits; a plague afflicted those who were left (Exodus 32:25-35).<ref>{{Bibleref|Exodus|32:35||KJV}}</ref> Aaron, however, escaped punishment for his role in the affair, because of the intercession of Moses according to Deuteronomy 9:20.<ref>{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|9:20|| KJV }}</ref> Later retellings of this story almost always excuse Aaron for his role.<ref name="Watts 2011">{{harvnb|Watts|2011}}</ref> For example, in rabbinic sources<ref>Talmud Shabbat 99a</ref><ref>Exodus Rabbah 41</ref> and in the Quran, Aaron was not the idol-maker and upon Moses' return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the Israelites (Quran 7:142-152).<ref>{{Cite quran|7|142|e=152|s=ns}}</ref>

On the day of Aaron's consecration, his oldest sons, [[Nadab and Abihu]], were burned up by divine fire because they offered "strange" incense (Leviticus 10:1-3).<ref>{{Bibleref|Leviticus|10:1|3||HE}}</ref> Most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between priestly families some time in Israel's past. Others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God's instructions given through Moses.<ref name="Watts 2011"/>

The Torah generally depicts the siblings, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as the leaders of Israel after the Exodus, a view also reflected in the biblical [[Book of Micah]].<ref>{{bibleref|Micah|6:4|9}}</ref> Numbers 12, however, reports that on one occasion, Aaron and Miriam complained about Moses' exclusive claim to be the {{LORD}}'s prophet.<ref>{{bibleref|Numbers|12|HE}}</ref> Their presumption was rebuffed by God who affirmed Moses' uniqueness as the one with whom the {{LORD}} spoke face to face. Miriam was punished with a skin disease (''[[tzaraath]]'') that turned her skin white. Aaron pleaded with Moses to intercede for her, and Miriam, after seven days' quarantine, was healed. Aaron once again escaped any retribution.

According to Numbers 16–17, a Levite named [[Korah]] led many in challenging Aaron's exclusive claim to the priesthood. When the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth (Numbers 16:25-35),<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|196:23|35|KJV}}</ref> [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron, was commissioned to take charge of the [[censer]]s of the dead priests. And when a plague broke out among the people who had sympathized with the rebels, Aaron, at the command of Moses, took his censer and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated (Numbers 17:1-15, 16:36-50).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:1|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|16:36|KJV}}</ref>

[[File:Hirschvogel The Blossoming of Aarons Rod.jpg|thumb|right|The Blossoming of Aaron's Rod, etching by [[Augustin Hirschvogel]]]]
To emphasize the validity of the Levites' claim to the offerings and tithes of the Israelites, Moses collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods overnight in the [[tent of meeting]]. The next morning, Aaron's rod was found to have budded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds (Numbers 17:8).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|17:8|KJV}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mays|2000|p=177}}</ref> The following chapter then details the distinction between Aaron's family and the rest of the Levites: while all the Levites (and only Levites) were devoted to the care of the sanctuary, charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the [[Kohen|Aaronites]] alone (Numbers 18:1-7).<ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|18:1|KJV}}</ref>

===Death===
Aaron, like Moses, was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites<ref name="jd3"/> because the two brothers showed impatience at [[Meribah]] ([[Kadesh (Israel)|Kadesh]]) in the last year of the desert pilgrimage (Numbers 20:12-13), when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the people's thirst. Although they had been commanded to speak to the rock, Moses struck it with the staff twice, which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the {{LORD}} (Numbers 20:7-11).<ref name="jd3"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|20:7|11|KJV}}</ref>

There are two accounts of the death of Aaron in the Torah.<ref name="jd3"/> Numbers says that soon after the incident at Meribah, Aaron with his son Eleazar and Moses ascended Mount Hor. There Moses stripped Aaron of his priestly garments and transferred them to Eleazar. Aaron died on the summit of the mountain, and the people mourned for him thirty days (Numbers 20:22-29; compare 33:38-39).<ref name="jd3"/><ref name="Bibleref|Numbers|20:22|29|KJV"/><ref name="Bibleref|Numbers|33:38|39|KJV"/> The other account is found in Deuteronomy 10:6, where Aaron died at Moserah and was buried.<ref name="jd3"/><ref name="Bibleref|Deuteronomy|10:6|KJV"/> There is a significant amount of travel between these two points, as the itinerary in Numbers 33:31–37 records seven stages between Moseroth (Mosera) and Mount Hor.<ref name="jd3"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|33:31|37|KJV}}</ref> Aaron was 123 at the time of his death.<ref name=Colliers>{{harvnb|Gutstein|1997|p=3}}</ref>

===Descendants===
Aaron married [[Elisheba]], daughter of [[Amminadab]] and sister of [[Nahshon]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 6:23) of the tribe of Judah.  The sons of Aaron were [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]], and [[Nadab and Abihu]].{{refn | group = "note" | Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|24:1}}</ref>}} A descendant of Aaron is an Aaronite, or [[Kohen]], meaning Priest.<ref>{{harvnb|Steinmetz|2005|p=95}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Freedman|Beck|Myers|2000|p=1}}</ref> Any non-Aaronic [[Levite]]—i.e., descended from Levi but not from Aaron<ref>{{harvnb|Harbour|Reed|Tinsley|2005|pp=47–48}}</ref>—assisted the Levitical priests of the family of Aaron in the care of the tabernacle; later of the temple.<ref group = "note">According to Samaritan sources, a civil war once broke out between the sons of Itamar [[Eli (Bible)]] and the sons of Phineas that resulted in a division of those who followed Eli and those who followed High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki at Mount Gerizim Bethel. (A third group followed neither.) Ironically, and likewise according to Samaritan sources, the high priests' line of the sons of Phineas died out in 1624 CE with the death of the 112th High Priest, Shlomyah ben Pinhas, at which time the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar. See article Samaritan for list of High Priests from 1613 to 2004—the 131st high priest of the Samaritans is [[Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq]]. Also see article, [[Samaritan]]</ref>

The [[Gospel of Luke]] records that both  [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]] and therefore their son [[John the Baptist]] were descendants of Aaron.<ref name="Bibleverse||Luke|1:5"/>

==In religious traditions==

===Jewish rabbinic literature===
The older prophets and prophetical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophetic truth; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will-power requisite to resist the multitude in its idolatrous proclivities.<ref name="jd2">{{harvnb|Kohler|1906|p=3}}</ref> Thus Aaron, the first priest, ranks below Moses: he is his mouthpiece, and the executor of the will of God revealed through Moses, although it is pointed out<ref>Sifra, Wa-yiḳra, 1</ref> that it is said fifteen times in the Torah that "the Lord spoke to Moses ''and'' Aaron."

Under the influence of the priesthood that shaped the destinies of the nation under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule, a different ideal of the priest was formed, according to {{bibleverse|Malachi|2:4-7|HE}}, and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with Moses.<ref name="jd2"/> "At times Aaron, and at other times Moses, is mentioned first in Scripture—this is to show that they were of equal rank," says the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael]], which strongly implies this when introducing in its record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron's ministration.<ref name="jd2"/>

In fulfillment of the promise of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head,<ref>[[Leviticus Rabbah]] 10, [[Midrash Tehillim]] 133:1</ref> Aaron's death, as described in the [[aggadah]], was of a wonderful tranquility.<ref name="jd4">{{harvnb|Kohler|1906|p=4}}</ref> Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. Moses said, "Take off your priestly raiment and place it upon your son Eleazar! and then follow me."<ref name="jd4"/> Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur.<ref name="jd4"/> Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God. The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!"<ref name="jd4"/> When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, "Where is Aaron?" angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air.<ref name="jd4"/> A voice was then heard saying: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" (Malachi 2:6).<ref name="jd4"/> He died on the first of [[Av]].<ref name="sorh">according to [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] 9, Rosh Hashana 2, 3a</ref><ref name="jd4"/> The [[pillar of cloud]] which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death.<ref name="sorh"/><ref name="jd4"/> The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: "There [at Mosera] died Aaron."<ref name="jd4"/><ref group = "note">See [[Mekhilta]], Beshallaḥ, Vayassa, 1; [[Tanhuma]], Hukkat, 18; Yerushalmi Sotah, 1 17c, and [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]] Numbers and Deuteronomy on the above mentioned passages.</ref>

The rabbis particularly praise the brotherly sentiment between Aaron and Moses. When Moses was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest, neither betrayed any jealousy; instead they rejoiced in each other's greatness. When Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh, saying: "O my Lord, send, I pray, by the hand of him whom you will send" (Exodus 4:13), he was unwilling to deprive Aaron of the high position the latter had held for so many years; but the Lord reassured him, saying: "Behold, when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart" ({{Bibleref|Exodus|4:14|JPS}}).<ref name="jd4"/> Indeed, Aaron was to find his reward, says [[Shimon bar Yochai]]; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother's rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the [[Urim and Thummim]], which were to "be upon Aaron's heart when he goeth in before the Lord".<ref>[[Canticles Rabbah]] 1:10</ref><ref name="jd4"/> Moses and Aaron met in gladness of heart, kissing each other as true brothers,<ref>Exodus 4:27; compare [[Song of Solomon|Song of Songs]] 8:1</ref> and of them it is written: "Behold how good and how pleasant [it is] for brethren to dwell together in unity!" ([[Psalm 133]]:1).<ref name="jd4"/> Of them it is said: "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed [each other]";<ref>Psalms 85:10</ref> for Moses stood for righteousness (Deuteronomy 33:21) and Aaron for peace ({{Bibleref|Malachi|2:6|JPS}}). Again, mercy was personified in Aaron, according to Deuteronomy 33:8, and truth in Moses, according to Numbers 12:7.<ref name="jd4"/><ref>([[Tanhuma]], Shemot, ed. Buber, 24-26)</ref>

When Moses poured the oil of anointment upon the head of Aaron, Aaron modestly shrank back and said: "Who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office." Then the [[Shekhinah]] spoke the words: "Behold the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard of Aaron, that even went down to the skirts of his garment, is as pure as the dew of Hermon" ({{Bibleref2|Psalm|133:2–3}}).<ref name="jd4"/><ref>[[Sifra]], Shemini, Milluim; [[Tanhuma]], Korah, ed. Buber, 14</ref>

According to [[Tanhuma]],<ref>ed. Buber, 2:12</ref> Aaron's activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses.<ref name="jd2"/> Hillel held Aaron up as an example, saying: "Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law!"<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|1993}}</ref> This is further illustrated by the tradition<ref>Preserved in [[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] 12, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 6b, and elsewhere</ref> that Aaron was an ideal priest of the people, far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses.<ref name="jd3"/> While Moses was stern and uncompromising, brooking no wrong, Aaron went about as peacemaker, reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged, or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled, and winning evil-doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kohler|1906|pp=3–4}}</ref> As a result, Aaron's death was more intensely mourned than Moses': when Aaron died the whole [[house of Israel]] wept, including the women, (Numbers 20:29)<ref name="jd4"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Numbers|20:29}}</ref> while Moses was bewailed by "the sons of Israel" only (Deuteronomy 34:8).<ref name="jd4"/><ref>{{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|34:8|NASB}}</ref> Even in the making of the Golden Calf the rabbis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron.<ref name="jd4"/><ref>Sanhedrin 7a</ref> His fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction.<ref name="jd4"/><ref>[[Zebahim]] 115b</ref> Especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|Twelve Tribes]] had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tabernacle: "Say to thy brother Aaron: Greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift; for thou art called upon to kindle the light, and, while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts, thy light shall last forever."<ref name="jd4"/><ref>[[Tanhuma]], ed.

===Christianity===
[[File:Aaron-icon.jpg|thumb|[[Russian icon]] of Aaron (18th century, [[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] [[monastery]], [[Karelia]], Russia).]]
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Maronite Church|Maronite]] churches, Aaron is [[veneration|venerated]] as a [[saint]] whose [[feast day]] is shared with his brother Moses and celebrated on September 4. (Those churches that follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]] celebrate this day on September 17 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). Aaron is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers, the Sunday before [[Christmas]].

Aaron is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 30.  He is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syriac Calendar.

====Latter Day Saints====
In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Aaronic priesthood (LDS Church)|Aaronic]] order is the lesser order of priesthood, comprising the grades (from lowest to highest) of deacon, teacher, and priest. The chief office of the Aaronic priesthood is the presiding bishopric;<ref>{{harvnb|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|2001|p=79}}</ref> the head of the priesthood is the bishop. Each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aaronic priesthood.<ref>{{harvnb|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|2001|p=25}}</ref>

In the [[Community of Christ]], the [[Priesthood (Community of Christ)#Aaronic Order|Aaronic order of priesthood]] is regarded as an appendage to the [[Priesthood (Community of Christ)#Melchisedec Order|Melchisedec order]], and consists of the priesthood offices of deacon, teacher, and priest. While differing in responsibilities, these offices, along with those of the Melchisidec order, are regarded as equal before God.

Aaron ([[Arabic]]: هارون, ''Hārūn'') is also mentioned in the [[Quran]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] of [[God]].<ref>{{cite quran|19|53|s=ns}}</ref> The Quran praises Aaron repeatedly, calling him a "believing servant"<ref>{{cite quran|37|122|s=ns}}</ref> as well as one who was "guided"<ref>{{cite quran|6|84|s=ns}}</ref> and one of the "victors".<ref>{{cite quran|37|114|122|s=ns}}</ref> Aaron is important in [[Islam]] for his role in the events of [[the Exodus]], in which, according to the Quran and [[Muslim]] [[tradition]], he preached with his elder brother, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]],<ref name="Cite quran|19|41|e=53|s=ns"/> to the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Glasse|1989|pp=9–10}}</ref> Aaron's significance in Islam, however, is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses. Islamic tradition also accords Aaron the role of a [[patriarch]], as tradition records that the priestly descent came through Aaron's lineage, which included the entire [[Al-Imran|House of Amran]].{{refn | group = "note" | All commentators, classical and modern, hold that the Quranic ''House of Amran'' refers to Imrān's lineage, through his son Aaron.

====Aaron in the Quran====
{{Islamic prophets|Prophets in the Quran}}
The Quran contains numerous references to Aaron ([[Arabic]]: هارون ''Hārūn''), both by name and without name. It says that he was a descendant of Abraham ([[Quran 4]]: 163) and makes it clear that both he and Moses were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God's punishment ([[Quran 10]]: 75). It further adds that Moses had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with Aaron ([[Quran 20:29-30]]) and that Aaron helped Moses as he too was a prophet ([[Quran 19:53]]), and very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse ([[Quran 28]]: 34). The Quran adds that both Moses and Aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt, and to convert those houses into places of worship for God ([[Quran 10]]: 87).

The incident of the Golden Calf as it is narrated in the Quran paints Aaron in a positive light. The Quran says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses was up on {{Lang|ar-Latn|Tūr Sīnā’}} ({{lang-ar|طـور سيـنـاء}}, [[Mount Sinai]]) for a period of forty days ([[Quran 7]]: 142).<ref name="Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns"/> It adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf, which was built not by Aaron but by a wicked man by the name of '[[Samiri (Islamic figure)|As-Samiri]]' ([[Quran 19]]: 50). When Moses returned from Mount Sinai, he rebuked Aaron for allowing the worship of the idol, to which Aaron pleaded with Moses to not blame him when he had no role in its construction (Quran 7: 150).<ref name="Cite quran|7|103|e=156|s=ns"/> The Quran then adds that Moses here lamented the sins of Israel, and said that he only had power over himself and Aaron ([[Quran 5]]: 25).

Aaron is later commemorated in the Quran as one who had a "clear authority" ([[Quran 23]]: 45) and one who was "guided to the Right Path" ([[Quran 37]]: 118). It further adds that Aaron's memory was left for people who came after him (Quran 37: 119) and he is blessed by God along with his brother (Quran 37: 120). The Quran also says that people called [[Jesus in Islam|‘Isa]]'s mother [[Mary in Islam|Maryam]] ({{lang-ar|مـريـم}}, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]) a "sister of Harun" ([[Quran 19]]: 28). Muslim scholars debated as to who exactly this "Harun" was in terms of his historical persona, with some saying that it was a reference to Aaron of the Exodus, and the term "sister" designating only a metaphorical or spiritual link between the two figures, all the more evident when Mary was a descendant of the priestly lineage of Aaron, while others held it to be another righteous man living at the time of [[Christ]] by the name of "Aaron". Most scholars have agreed to the former perspective, and have linked Mary spiritually with the actual sister of Aaron, her namesake [[Miriam|Miryam]] ({{lang-ar|مـريم}}, {{lang-he|מִרְיָם}}),<ref name="RU2016">''Unless otherwise stated, the Jewish primary sources herein were provided courtesy of Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman in honor of M.A.M. from his 3-part series on Miriam the Prophetess, posted on RabbiUllman.com. Part 1: {{cite web|url=http://wp.rabbiullman.com/miriams-name/|title=Miriam's Name}} Part 2: {{cite web|url=http://wp.rabbiullman.com/miriam-in-egypt/|title=Miriam in Egypt}} Part 3: {{cite web|url=http://wp.rabbiullman.com/miriam-in-the-wilderness/|title=Miriam in the Wilderness}}''</ref> whom she resembled in many ways. The Quran also narrates that, centuries later, when the ''Tabut'' ({{lang-ar|تـابـوت}}, [[Ark of the Covenant]]) returned to Israel, it contained "relics from the family of Moses and relics from the family of Aaron" ([[Quran 2]]: 248).

====Aaron in Muhammad's time====
[[Muhammad]], in many of his sayings, speaks of Aaron. In the event of the [[Mi'raj]], his miraculous ascension through the Heavens, Muhammad is said to have encountered Aaron in the fifth heaven.<ref name="muslim">{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|309}}</ref><ref>{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|314}}</ref> According to old scholars, including [[Ibn Hisham]], Muhammad, in particular, mentioned the beauty of Aaron when he encountered him in Heaven. [[Martin Lings]], in his biographical ''Muhammad'', speaks of Muhammad's wonderment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory:
{{quote|Of Joseph he said that his face had the splendour of the moon at its full, and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty. Yet this did not diminish Muhammad's wonderment at his brethren, and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of Aaron.<ref>{{harvnb|Ibn Hisham|1967|p=186; §=270}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lings|1983|p=102}}</ref>}}

Aaron was also mentioned by Muhammad in likeness to ‘[[Ali]]. Muhammad had left ‘Ali to look after his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found ‘Ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence. ‘Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the Prophet said: "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O ‘Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet."<ref name="harvnb|Ibn Hisham|1967|p=604; §=897"/>

====Tomb of Aaron====
{{Main|Tomb of Aaron}}
[[File:Shrine on Mt Aaron.jpg|thumb|A 14th-century shrine built on top of the supposed grave of Aaron on Jabal Hārūn in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].|alt=]]
According to Islamic tradition, the [[tomb of Aaron]] is located on ''Jabal Harun'' ({{lang-ar|جَـبـل هَـارون}}, Mountain of Aaron), near [[Petra]] in [[Jordan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler|2013}}</ref> At {{convert|1350.0|m|ft|abbr=in}} above sea-level, it is the highest peak in the area; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here. A 14th-century [[Mamluk]] mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Petra.

===Baháʼí Faith===
In the [[Baháʼí Faith]], although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet, Aaron is merely described as a prophet. The Kitab-I-Iqan describes Imran as being his father.<ref>{{harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|'Abdu'l-Bahá|1976|p=270}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Llah|2003|p=243}}</ref>

==Art history==
Aaron appears paired with Moses frequently in Jewish and Christian art, especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bibles.<ref name=watt3>{{harvnb|Watts|2013}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}</ref> He can usually be distinguished by his priestly vestments, especially his turban or miter and jeweled breastplate. He frequently holds a censor or, sometimes, his flowering rod. (See [[:commons:Aaron|the "Aaron" category]] at Wikimedia Commons.) Aaron also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tabernacle and its altar, as already in the third-century frescos in the [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue]] at [[Dura-Europos]] in Syria. An eleventh-century portable silver altar from [[Fulda]], Germany depicts Aaron with his censor, and is located in the [[Musée National de l’Age Médiévale]] in [[Paris]]. This is also how he appears in the frontispieces of early printed Passover Haggadot and occasionally in church sculptures. Aaron has rarely been the subject of portraits, such as those by [[Anton Kern]] [1710–1747] and by [[Pier Francesco Mola]] [c. 1650].<ref name=Kline>{{harvnb|Kline|2010}}</ref> Christian artists sometimes portray Aaron as a prophet (Exod. 7:1) holding a scroll, as in a twelfth-century sculpture from the [[Noyon Cathedral|Cathedral of Noyon]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York and often in Eastern Orthodox icons. Illustrations of the [[Golden Calf]] story usually include him as well—most notably in [[Nicolas Poussin]]'s "[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]" (ca. 1633–34, [[National Gallery]] London).<ref>{{harvnb|National Gallery|2013}}</ref> Finally, some artists interested in validating later priesthoods have painted the ordination of Aaron and his sons (Leviticus 8). [[Harry Anderson (artist)|Harry Anderson]]'s realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the Latter Day Saints.<ref group ="note">Harry Anderson's ''Aaron Is Called to the Ministry'' is in the Conference Center of the LDS Church in Salt Lake City, Utah.</ref><ref name=watt3/>
