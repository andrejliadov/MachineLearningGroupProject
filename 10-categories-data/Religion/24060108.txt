The '''Faith and Globalisation Initiative''' ('''FGI''') is an international group of universities created in 2008 by former [[British prime minister]] [[Tony Blair]] and his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Faith Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |title=Introduction to Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Yale University=21 Jan 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928130909/http://faithandglobalization.yale.edu/ |archive-date=28 September 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>
The Faith and Globalisation Initiative is "bringing together some of the world’s leading research Universities to form a global network focusing on the emerging field of faith and globalisation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |title=Faith and Globalisation Initiative |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation=21 Jan 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151638/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/the-faith-and-globalisation-initiative/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==History and key objectives==
In 2008 Yale University was the first university the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation|Foundation]] started working with and in 10 months it expanded the network to include the National University of Singapore, Durham University and McGill University. Two years later the Foundation developed an associate university programme which seeks to foster the study of faith and globalisation in a broad range of higher education institutions.<ref>[http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008151655/http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/index.php/faith-and-globalisation/entry/associate-universities |date=8 October 2011 }}</ref>

The institutions were selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the Initiative, but also to ensure that they have a geographic and cultural spread that lends multiple perspectives to the discipline.

Key objectives of the FGI are the following:
* Develop multi-disciplinary teaching courses on Faith and Globalisation
* Advance knowledge in the field of Faith and Globalisation
* Disseminate university research related to Faith and Globalisation
* Engage policy-makers and the general public on the topic of Faith and Globalisation
* Support the implementation and development of the Foundation's Face to Faith and Faiths Act projects.
