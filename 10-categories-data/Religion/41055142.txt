'''Mathew H. Ahmann''' (September 10, 1931 – December 31, 2001) was an American [[Catholic Laity|Catholic layman]] and [[civil rights activist]].

By initiating the 1963 National Conference on Religion and Race, Ahmann worked to establish the civil rights movement as a moral cause. He was one of four white men who joined the "[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]" to organize the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]. He gave a speech during the march that preceded the "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]<ref name="Maurice" /> Following the Civil Rights Movement, he directed several civil rights and Catholic service initiatives.<ref name="Walberg">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-01-07/news/0201070258_1_race-relations-civil-rights-catholic-church|title=Mathew H.

== Early life and education==

Mathew Ahmann was born on September 10, 1931 in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], to Norbert Ahmann, a dentist, and Clothilda Ahmann, née Hall, a nurse.<ref name="auto">Murray, Paul T.

Web. 13 May 2015.</ref> Ahmann's grandfather, Mathew Hall, was a [[German American|German-American immigrant]] and St. Cloud businessman. Ahmann was the oldest of three brothers; religion was a large part of everyday life as they attended Catholic school and religious retreats.<ref name="auto"/> They each attended [[Saint John's Preparatory School (Collegeville, Minnesota)|Saint John's Preparatory School]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]].<ref name="Duffy" /><ref name="Maurice">{{cite web|url=http://wjon.com/st-cloud-man-instrumental-in-organizing-march-on-washington-in-1963/|title=St. Cloud Man Instrumental In Organizing 'March On Washington' in 1963|last=Maurice|first=Jim|date=August 28, 2013|work=[[WJON]]|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref> Ahmann grew up a Boy Scout and playing music in a band.

Ahmann studied social science at [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] for three years.<ref name="Duffy" /> After graduating in 1952, he entered a master's degree program in [[sociology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Ahmann's brother David recalled:

{{quote|When Matt announced he was going on to the University of Chicago the family promptly held a prayer meeting so that Matt wouldn't lose his faith. In fact, he found his faith.<ref name="auto"/>}}

Ahmann's intent was to finish his master's program but he left to focus on his work with the civil rights movement.<ref name="Walberg" />

== Civil rights movement ==

Ahmann worked in Chicago for several years as director of the Chicago Catholic Interracial Council.<ref name="Walberg" /> In 1960, he founded and became the executive director of the National Catholic Council for Interracial Justice. As director, Ahmann organized the National Conference on Religion and Race, the first national meeting on civil rights between Catholic, [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]] leaders. The conference was held at the [[Edgewater Beach Hotel]] in [[Chicago]] on January 14–17, 1963. Ahmann scheduled it to coincide with the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]'s 100th anniversary. Ahmann said his goal for the conference was to:

{{quote|examine the role of religious institutions in race relations and then move on to propose and inspire renewed action and interreligious projects to increase the leadership of religion in ending racial discrimination.<ref>Ahmann, Matthew, and Will D. Campbell. "Preface." Race: Challenge to Religion: Original Essays and ''An Appeal to the Conscience'' from the National Conference on Religion and Race. Chicago: Regnery, 1963. N. pag. Print</ref>}}

Leaders from 78 denominations attended, and speakers included [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Sargent Shriver]], and [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].<ref name="Duffy" /> One attendee said it was an achievement in itself that Protestant, Catholic Jewish and Orthodox leaders had even come together: "A total of 1,000 delegates — about 750 official delegates and 250 observer delegates" attended.<ref name="auto1">Mays, Benjamin E.

Web. 15 May 2015 .</ref> After Ahmann's speech, Heschel invited Ahmann to the stage and said, "We are here because of the faith of a 33-year-old Catholic layman." Heschel kissed Ahmann on the head, and Ahmann received a [[standing ovation]].<ref name="Duffy" /> A journalist who attended concluded that even if the attendees did nothing after they left the conference, they would never be the same. He also explained that after the conference it was expected that committees of the three religions would form on local and regional levels but in order to be successful they needed to be more unanimous in action, not independent.<ref name="auto1"/>

Ahmann was asked by organizers of the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] to find a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Catholic bishop]] who would serve as a Catholic chairman for the march. Unable to find a willing bishop, Ahmann himself volunteered to join the organizing committee and make a speech at the march.<ref name="Euchner">{{cite book|last=Euchner|first=Charles|title=Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780807000595|url-access=registration|date=25 September 2010|publisher=[[Beacon Press]]|isbn=978-0807095522}}</ref> Ahmann, as the Catholic presence, along with white leaders [[Walter Reuther]], [[Eugene Carson Blake]], and [[Joachim Prinz]], joined the original "[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]" to organize the march as the "Big Ten."

At the August 28 March on Washington, Ahmann gave a speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Ahmann's speech preceded King's "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.

In 1965, Ahmann urged all [[List of the Catholic dioceses of the United States|United States diocese]] clergy to attend the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], in response to King's call for participation. In the same year, he gave the commencement speech at the [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|College of Saint Benedict]], where he encouraged women to fight for rights. In 1967, Ahmann wrote a letter to the incarcerated King, saying, "Our conference sends you greetings while you serve sentence for your witness for humanity, dignity and justice."<ref name="Duffy" /> The King Center has uploaded this telegram to their online archives for the public to view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/telegram-mathew-ahmann-mlk#|title=Telegram from Mathew Ahmann to MLK|date=November 2, 1967|work=thekingcenter.org|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>

Ahmann continued to show his support to King and the movement in 1967 when he sent him a telegram on the 10-year anniversary of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] to congratulate them on all of the work they had done and continued to do for human rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/telegram-mathew-ahmann-mlk-0|title=Telegram from Mathew Ahmann to MLK|date=August 17, 1967|work=thekingcenter.org|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>
