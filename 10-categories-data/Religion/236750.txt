{{Jainism}}
'''Mahavira''' ([[Sanskrit]]: महावीर:), also known as '''Vardhamana''' or '''Kevala'''  was the 24th ''[[Tirthankara]]'' of [[Jainism]]. He was the spiritual successor of 23rd Tirthankara [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=90}} Mahavira was born in the early part of the 6th century BC into a royal [[Kshatriya]] Jain family in [[Bihar]], [[India]]. His mother's name was [[Trishala]] and father's name was [[Siddhartha of Kundagrama|Siddhartha]]. They were lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Mahavira abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of about 30 and left home in pursuit of [[spiritual awakening]], becoming an [[ascetic]]. Mahavira practiced intense meditation and severe austerities for 12 and half years, after which he attained ''[[Kevala Gyan]]'' (omniscience). He preached for 30 years and attained [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] (salvation) in the 6th century BC, although the year varies by [[Jain schools and branches|sect]].

Historically, Mahavira, who preached Jainism in ancient India, was an older contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Scholars variously date him from 6th-5th century BC and his place of birth is also a point of dispute among them.

Mahavira taught that observance of the vows of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' (non-violence), ''[[satya]]'' (truth), ''[[asteya]]'' (non-stealing), ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (chastity), and ''[[aparigraha]]'' (non-attachment) are necessary for spiritual liberation. He taught the principles of ''[[Anekantavada]]'' (many-sided reality): ''[[Anekantavada#Syādvāda|syadvada]]'' and ''[[Anekantavada#Nayavāda|nayavada]]''. Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] (his chief disciple) as the [[Jain Agamas]]. The texts, transmitted [[oral tradition|orally]] by Jain monks, are believed to have been largely lost by about the 1st century CE (when the remaining were first written down in the Svetambara tradition). The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of [[Svetambara]] Jainism's foundation texts, but their authenticity is disputed in [[Digambara]] Jainism.

Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting or standing meditative posture, with the symbol of a lion beneath him. His earliest iconography is from archaeological sites in the [[North India]]n city of [[Mathura]], and is dated from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century AD. His birth is celebrated as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and his ''[[nirvana]]'' (salvation) is observed by Jains as [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]].

=={{anchor|Titles & Names}}Names and epithets==
Surviving early Jain and Buddhist literature uses several names (or [[epithet]]s) for Mahavira, including ''Nayaputta'', ''Muni'', ''Samana'', ''Niggantha'', ''Brahman'', and ''Bhagavan''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} In early Buddhist ''[[Sutra|suttas]]'', he is referred to as ''Araha'' ("worthy") and ''Veyavi'' (derived from "Vedas", but meaning "wise" in this context; Mahavira did not recognize the [[Vedas]] as scripture).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=25–26}} He is known as ''[[Sramana]]'' in the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]'', "devoid of love and hate".{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}}

According to later Jain texts, Mahavira's childhood name was ''Vardhamāna'' ("the one who grows") because of the kingdom's prosperity at the time of his birth.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}} According to the ''Kalpasutras'', he was called Mahavira ("the great hero") by the gods in the ''Kalpa Sūtra'' because he remained steadfast in the midst of dangers, fears, hardships and calamities.{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=93}} He is also known as a ''[[tirthankara]]''.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=223}}

According to [[Jain cosmology]], 24 ''Tirthankaras'' have appeared on earth; Mahavira is the last ''Tirthankara'' of ''[[Avasarpiṇī]]'' (the present [[Jain cosmology#Time cycle|time cycle]]).{{refn|group=note|Heinrich Zimmer: "The cycle of time continually revolves, according to the Jainas. The present "descending" (avasarpini) period was preceded and will be followed by an "ascending" (utsarpini).

Tirthankara Mahavira was born into the royal [[Kshatriya]] family of King [[Siddhartha of Kundagrama|Siddhartha]] of the [[Ikshvaku|Ikshvaku Dynasty]] and Queen [[Trishala]] of the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi dynasty]].{{sfn|Sunavala|1934|p=52}}{{refn|group=note|Trishala was the sister of [[King Chetaka]] of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] in ancient India.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=29}}}} The [[Ikshvaku Dynasty]] was established by First [[Tirthankara]] [[Rishabhanatha]]{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=5}}{{refn|group=note|The Adipurana By Acharya Jinasena mentions that [[Ikshvaku Dynasty]] was founded by [[Lord]] [[Rishabhadeva]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jinasena|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwP0Wev3M4QC|title=Adipurana|date=2003|publisher=Bhāratīya Jñānapītha|isbn=978-81-263-0922-1|language=hi}}</ref>}}

According to Jains, Mahavira was born in 599{{nbsp}}BCE. His birthday falls on the thirteenth day of the rising moon in the month of [[Chaitra]] in the ''[[Vira Nirvana Samvat]]'' [[calendar era]].{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=549}}{{sfn|Dowling|Scarlett|2006|p=225}}{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=313}} It falls in March or April of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and is celebrated by Jains as [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]].{{sfn|Gupta|Gupta|2006|p=1001}}

Kundagrama (the place of Mahavira’s birth) is traditionally believed to be near Vaishali, an ancient town on the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. Its location in present-day Bihar is unclear, partly because of migrations from ancient Bihar for economic and political reasons.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} According to the "Universal History" in Jain texts, Mahavira underwent many rebirths (total 27 births) before his 6th-century birth. They included a denizen of hell, a lion, and a god (''[[Deva (Jainism)|deva]]'') in a heavenly realm just before his last birth as the 24th ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} Svetambara texts state that his embryo first formed in a Brahman woman before it was transferred by Hari-Naigamesin (the divine commander of Indra's army) to the womb of Trishala, Siddhartha's wife.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=21, 26}}{{sfn|Mills|Claus|Diamond|2003|p=320, note: Indra is referred to as Sakra in some Indian texts.}}{{refn|group=note|This mythology has similarities with those found in the mythical texts of the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of Hinduism.{{sfn|Olivelle|2006|pp=397 footnote 4}}}} The embryo-transfer legend is not believed by adherents of the Digambara tradition.{{sfn|Mills|Claus|Diamond|2003|p=320}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=22}}

Jain texts state that after Mahavira was born, the god [[Indra]] came from the heavens along with 56 dipkumaries, anointed him, and performed his ''[[abhisheka]]'' (consecration) on [[Mount Meru]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} These events, illustrated in a number of Jain temples, play a part in modern Jain temple rituals.{{sfn|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=5–9}} Although the ''Kalpa Sūtra'' accounts of Mahavira's birth legends are recited by Svetambara Jains during the annual ''[[Paryushana]]'' festival, the same festival is observed by the Digambaras without the recitation.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=284}}

=== Early life ===
Mahavira grew up as a prince. According to the second chapter of the Śvētāmbara [[Acharanga Sutra]], his parents were lay devotees of [[Parshvanatha]].{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=32}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}} Jain traditions differ about whether Mahavira married.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=22}}{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=99, Quote: "According to the Digambara sect, Mahavira did not marry, while the Svetambaras hold a contrary belief."}} The Digambara tradition believes that his parents wanted him to marry Yashoda, but he refused to marry.{{sfn|Shanti Lal Jain|1998|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|On this [[Champat Rai Jain]] wrote: ""Of the two versions of Mahavira's life — the Swetambara and the Digambara— it is obvious that only one can be true: either Mahavira married, or he did not marry. If Mahavira married, why should the Digambaras deny it? There is absolutely no reason for such a denial. The Digambaras acknowledge that nineteen out of the twenty-four Tirthamkaras married and had children. If Mahavira also married it would make no difference. There is thus no reason whatsoever for the Digambaras to deny a simple incident like this. But there may be a reason for the Swetambaras making the assertion; the desire to ante-date their own origin. As a matter of fact their own books contain clear refutation of the statement that Mahavira had married. In the Samavayanga Sutra (Hyderabad edition) it is definitely stated that nineteen ''Tirthankaras'' lived as householders, that is, all the twenty-four excepting Shri Mahavira, Parashva, Nemi, Mallinath and Vaspujya."{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1939|p=97}}}} The Śvētāmbara tradition believes that he was married to Yashoda at a young age and had one daughter, Priyadarshana,{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=29}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} also called Anojja.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=188}}

Jain texts portray Mahavira as tall; his height was given as four [[cubit]]s (6 [[Foot (unit)|feet]]) in the ''Aupapatika Sutra''.{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|p=95}} According to Jain texts, he was the shortest of the twenty-four ''tirthankaras''; earlier teachers were believed to have been taller, with [[Neminatha]] or Aristanemi —the 22nd ''tirthankara'', who lived for 1,000 years—said to have been sixty-five cubits (98{{nbsp}}feet) in height.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=16}}

=== Renunciation ===
{{see also|Jain monasticism}}
At age thirty, Mahavira abandoned royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life in the pursuit of spiritual awakening.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=224}}{{sfn|George|2008|p=319}}{{sfn|Jacobi|1964|p=269}} He undertook severe fasts and bodily mortifications,{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=5–7}} meditated under the [[Ashoka tree]], and discarded his clothes.{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=224}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=30}} The ''Acharanga Sutra'' has a graphic description of his hardships and self-mortification.{{sfn|Sen|1999|p=74}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=27}} According to the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]'', Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life in Astikagrama, [[Champapuri]], Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, [[Nalanda district|Nalanda]], [[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]], Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, [[Shravasti]], and [[Pawapuri]].{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=327}} He is said to have lived in [[Rajagriha]] during the rainy season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life, which is traditionally dated to 491{{nbsp}}BCE.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=79}}

=== Omniscience ===
{{see also|Samavasarana}}
[[File:Kevalajnana.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Painting of Mahavira meditating under a tree|The ''āsana'' in which Mahavira attained omniscience]] 
According to traditional accounts, Mahavira achieved [[Kevala Jnana]] (omniscience, or infinite knowledge) under a [[Shorea robusta|Sāla tree]] on the bank of the River Rijubalika near Jrimbhikagrama at age 43 after twelve years of rigorous penance.{{sfn|George|2008|p=319}}{{sfn|Jain|Upadhye|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=30, 327}} The details of the event are described in the Jain ''Uttar-purāņa'' and ''Harivamśa-purāņa'' texts.{{sfn|Jain|Upadhye|2000|p=31}} The ''Acharanga Sutra'' describes Mahavira as all-seeing. The ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'' expands it to all-knowing, and describes his other qualities.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=25}} Jains believe that Mahavira had a most auspicious body (''paramaudārika śarīra'') and was free from eighteen imperfections when he attained omniscience.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2016b|p=5}} According to the Śvētāmbara, he traveled throughout India to teach his philosophy for thirty years after attaining omniscience.{{sfn|George|2008|p=319}} However, the Digambara believe that he remained in his [[Samavasarana]] and delivered sermons to his followers.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=314}}

===Disciples===
Jain texts document eleven [[Brahmin]]s as Mahavira's first disciples, traditionally known as the eleven ''Ganadharas''.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|p=6}} [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] is believed to have been their leader,{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=314}} and the others included Agnibhuti, Vayubhuti, Akampita, Arya Vyakta, [[Sudharman]], Manditaputra, Mauryaputra, Acalabhraataa, Metraya, and Prabhasa. The ''Ganadharas'' are believed to have remembered and to have verbally transmitted Mahavira's teachings after his death. His teachings became known as ''Gani-Pidaga'', or the Jain ''Agamas''.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=6–8, 26}} According to ''Kalpa Sutra'', Mahavira had 14,000 ''[[Muni (Jainism)|muni]]'' (male ascetic devotees), 36,000 ''[[aryika]]'' (nuns), 159,000 ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|sravakas]]'' (male lay followers), and 318,000 ''sravikas'' (female lay followers).{{sfn|George|2008|p=326}}{{sfn|Heehs|2002|p=90}}{{sfn|Cort|2001|p=47}} Jain tradition mentions Srenika and Kunika of [[Haryanka dynasty]] (popularly known as [[Bimbisara]] and [[Ajatashatru]]) and [[Chetaka]] of [[Videha]] as his royal followers.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=327}}{{sfn|Caillat|Balbir|2008|p=88}} Mahavira initiated his [[mendicant]]s with the ''[[Ethics of Jainism|mahavratas]]'' (Five Vows).{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|p=6}} He delivered fifty-five ''[[pravachan]]a'' (recitations) and a set of lectures (''[[Uttaraadhyayana-sutra]]'').{{sfn|George|2008|p=319}} Chandana is believed to be the leader of female monastic order.{{sfn|Natubhai Shah|2004|p=44}}

According to the [[Jinasena]]'s ''[[Mahapurana (Jainism)|Mahapurana]]'', [[Deva (Jainism)|heavenly beings]] arrived to perform his funeral rites.

Jain texts describe Mahavira's 26 births before his incarnation as a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1925|p=327}} According to the texts, he was born as [[Marichi]] (the son of [[Bharata Chakravartin]]) in a previous life.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}}

The ''[[Kalpa Sūtra]]'' is a collection of biographies of ''tirthankaras'', notably Parshvanatha and Mahavira. ''[[Samavayanga Sutra]]'' is a collection of Mahavira’s teachings, and the ''[[Acharanga Sutra]]'' recounts his asceticism.

== Teachings ==
{{Main|Jain philosophy}}
Colonial-era Indologists considered Jainism (and Mahavira's followers) a sect of [[Buddhism]] because of superficial similarities in iconography and meditative and ascetic practices.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|p=408}} As scholarship progressed, differences between the teachings of Mahavira and the Buddha were found so divergent that the religions were acknowledged as separate.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}} Mahavira, says Moriz Winternitz, taught a "very elaborate belief in the soul" (unlike the Buddhists, who denied such elaboration). His ascetic teachings have a higher order of magnitude than those of Buddhism or Hinduism, and his emphasis on [[ahimsa]] (non-violence) is greater than that in other Indian religions.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|pp=408–409}}

=== {{anchor|Jain ''Agamas''}}Agamas ===
{{Main|Jain Agamas}}
{{see also|Jain councils}}
Mahavira's teachings were compiled by [[Indrabhuti Gautama|Gautama Swami]], his ''[[Ganadhara]]'' (chief disciple).{{sfn|Cort|2010|p=225}} The canonical scriptures are in twelve parts.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=xi}} Mahavira's teachings were gradually lost after about 300{{nbsp}}BCE, according to Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the [[Magadha]] kingdom dispersed the Jain monks. Attempts were made by later monks to gather, recite the canon, and re-establish it.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=6–8}} These efforts identified differences in recitations of Mahavira's teachings, and an attempt was made in the 5th{{nbsp}}century AD to reconcile the differences.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=6–8}} The reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions holding their own incomplete, somewhat-different versions of Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written in [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=6–8, 26}} According to the Digambaras, ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Āchārya]]'' [[Bhutabali]] was the last ascetic with partial knowledge of the original canon. Later, some learned ''achāryas'' restored, compiled, and wrote down the teachings of Mahavira which were the subjects of the ''Agamas''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=xii}} ''Āchārya'' Dharasena, in the 1st{{nbsp}}century CE, guided the ''Āchāryas'' [[Pushpadanta (Jain monk)|Pushpadant]] and Bhutabali as they wrote down the teachings. The two ''Āchāryas'' wrote ''[[Ṣaṭkhaṅḍāgama]]'', among the oldest-known Digambara texts, on palm leaves.

Mahavira is best remembered in the Indian traditions for his teaching that ''ahimsa'' is the supreme moral virtue.{{sfn|George|2008|p=319}}{{sfn|Jain|Jain|2002|p=13}} He taught that ''ahimsa'' covers all living beings,{{sfn|Titze|1998|p=4}} and injuring any being in any form creates bad [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (which affects one's rebirth, future well-being, and suffering).{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}} According to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Mahavira was the greatest authority on ''ahimsa''.{{sfn|Pandey|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Nanda|1997|p=44}}<ref name=fhe>{{citation |url=https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/quote/greatmen.htm |title=Great Men's view on Jainism |quote=Jainism Literature Center |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516085244/https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/quote/greatmen.htm |archive-date=16 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Soul ===
{{main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
Mahavira taught that the soul exists, a premise shared with Hinduism but not Buddhism. There is no soul (or self) in Buddhism, and its teachings are based on the concept of [[anatta]] (non-self).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta |title=Anatta |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2013 |quote=Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”). |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210185046/http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta |archive-date=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{sfn|Collins|1994|p=64|quote=Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.}}{{sfn|Nagel|2000|p=33|quote=The dispute with Buddhists, who do not accept an imperishable Self, gives the Atman schools a chance to articulate the intellectual aspects of their way to meditative liberation.}} Mahavira taught that the soul is [[dravya]] (substantial), eternal, and yet temporary .{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–76}}

To Mahavira, the metaphysical nature of the universe consists of ''dravya'', ''jiva'', and ''[[ajiva]]'' (inanimate objects).{{sfn|Caillat|Balbir|2008|p=88}} The ''jiva'' is bound to ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (transmigration) because of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (the effects of one's actions).{{sfn|Caillat|Balbir|2008|p=88}} Karma, in Jainism, includes actions and intent; it colors the soul (''[[lesya]]''), affecting how, where, and as what a soul is reborn after death.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=99–103}}

According to Mahavira, there is no [[creator deity]] and existence has neither beginning nor end. Gods and demons exist in Jainism, however, whose ''jivas'' a part of the same cycle of birth and death.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=90–99}} The goal of spiritual practice is to liberate the ''jiva'' from its karmic accumulation and enter the realm of the [[siddha]]s, souls who are liberated from rebirth.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=91–92, 104–105}} Enlightenment, to Mahavira, is the consequence of self-cultivation and self-restraint.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=88–89, 257–258}}

=== ''Anekantavada'' ===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
Mahavira taught the doctrine of ''anekantavada'' (many-sided reality).{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}{{sfn|Sharma|Khanna|2013|p=18}} Although the word does not appear in the earliest Jain literature or the Agamas, the doctrine is illustrated in Mahavira's answers to questions posed by his followers.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Truth and reality are complex, and have a number of aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is impossible to express it fully with language alone; human attempts to communicate are ''nayas'' ("partial expression[s] of the truth").{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}} Language itself is not truth, but a means of expressing it. From truth, according to Mahavira, language returns—not the other way around.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}<ref name=iepmahav/> One can experience the "truth" of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempt to express the experience is ''syāt'': valid "in some respect", but still a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".<ref name=iepmahav>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221042158/http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ |date=21 February 2015 }}, IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University</ref> Spiritual truths are also complex, with multiple aspects, and language cannot express their plurality; however, they can be experienced through effort and appropriate karma.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}

Mahavira's ''anekantavada'' doctrine is also summarized in Buddhist texts such as the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'' (in which he is called Nigantha Nātaputta),{{refn|group=note|''Samaññaphala Sutta'', D i.47: "Nigantha Nātaputta answered with fourfold restraint. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Nigantha Nātaputta answered with fourfold restraint. The thought occurred to me: 'How can anyone like me think of disparaging a [[brahmin|brahman]] or contemplative living in his realm?' Yet I [Buddha] neither delighted in Nigantha Nātaputta's words nor did I protest against them. Neither delighting nor protesting, I was dissatisfied. Without expressing dissatisfaction, without accepting his teaching, without adopting it, I got up from my seat and left."<ref>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Samaññaphala Sutta] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6NFylf86U?url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html |date=9 February 2014 }}, Thanissaro Bhikkhu (1997)</ref>}} and is a key difference between the teachings of Mahavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the [[Middle Way]], rejecting the extremes of "it is" or "it is not"; Mahavira accepted both "it is" and "it is not", with reconciliation and the qualification of "perhaps".{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}}

The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahavira's approach to answering [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]], philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt''). A version of this doctrine is also found in the [[Ajivika]] school of ancient Indian philosophy.{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}}

According to Dundas, the ''anekantavada'' doctrine has been interpreted by many Jains as "promot[ing] a universal religious tolerance ... plurality ... [and a] ... benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions"; however, this misreads Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} Mahavira's "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings are a doctrine about the nature of reality and human existence, not about tolerating religious positions such as sacrificing animals (or killing them for food) or violence against nonbelievers (or any other living being) as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The five vows for Jain monks and nuns are strict requirements, with no "perhaps".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Mahavira's Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism beyond the renunciant Jain communities, but each religion was "highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of their rivals".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

=== Gender ===
An historically-contentious view in Jainism is partially attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life; he did not wear clothing, as a sign of renunciation (the fifth vow, ''aparigraha''). It was disputed whether a female mendicant (''sadhvi'') could achieve the spiritual liberation of a male mendicant (''sadhu'') through asceticism.{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=36–37}}{{sfn|Harvey|2014|pp=182–183}}

The major Jain traditions have disagreed, with Digambaras (the sky-clad, naked mendicant order) believing that a woman is unable to fully practice asceticism and cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender; she can, at best, live an ethical life so she is reborn as a man.{{refn|group=note|According to Melton and Baumann, the Digambaras state that "women's physical and emotional character makes it impossible for them to genuinely engage in the intense [ascetic] path necessary for spiritual purification. (...) Only by being reborn as a man can a woman engage in the ascetic path. Later Digambara secondary arguments appealed to human physiology in order to exclude women from the path: by their very biological basis, women constantly generate and destroy (and therefore harm) life forms within their sexual organs. Svetambara oppose this view by appealing to scriptures."{{sfn|Melton|Baumann|2010|p=1396}}}} According to this view, women are seen as a threat to a monk's chastity.{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135–138}}

Mahavirasvami had preached about men and women equality. The clothes-wearing Svetambaras have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both sexes to pursue a mendicant, ascetic life with the possibility of ''moksha'' (''kaivalya'', spiritual liberation).{{sfn|Arvind Sharma|1994|pp=135–138}}{{sfn|Harvey|2014|pp=182–183}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=55–59}}

=== Rebirth and realms of existence ===
{{main|Saṃsāra (Jainism)}}
Rebirth and realms of existence are fundamental teachings of Mahavira. According to the [[Acaranga Sutra]], Mahavira believed that life existed in myriad forms which included animals, plants, insects, bodies of water, fire, and wind.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}{{sfn|Chapelle|2011|pp=263–270}} He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing any of them (including plants) and never swim, light (or extinguish) a fire, or wave their arms in the air; such actions might injure other beings living in those states of matter.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}

Mahavira preached that the nature of existence is cyclic, and the soul is reborn after death in one of the ''[[Trilok (Jainism)|trilok]]''{{snd}}the heavenly, hellish, or earthly realms of existence and suffering.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=41–42, 90–93}} Humans are reborn, depending on one's [[karma]] (actions) as a human, animal, element, microbe, or other form, on earth or in a heavenly (or hellish) realm.{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}}{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=179–181}}{{sfn|Gorski|2008|pp=125–128}} Nothing is permanent; everyone (including gods, demons and earthly beings) dies and is reborn, based on their actions in their previous life. ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]]'' who have reached [[Kevala Jnana]] ([[omniscience]]) are not reborn;{{sfn|Taylor|2008|pp=892–894}} they enter the ''siddhaloka'', the "realm of the perfected ones".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=179–181}}

==Legacy==

=== {{anchor|Ascetic lineage}}Lineage ===
Mahavira is often called the founder of Jainism, but Jains believe that the 23 previous ''tirthankaras'' also espoused it.{{Sfn|Wiley|2009|pp=5–7}} Although Mahavira is sometimes placed in Parshvanatha's lineage, this is contradicted by texts stating that Mahavira renounced the world alone.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–33}}

Parshvanatha was born 273 years before Mahavira. [[Parshvanatha]], a [[tirthankara]] whom modern Western historians consider a historical figure, lived in about the 8th century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chatterjee|first=Asim Kumar|title=A comprehensive history of Jainism, 1 (2nd rev. ed.)|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers|year=2000|isbn=81-215-0931-9|location=New Delhi|pages=15}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite book|last=Tähtinen|first=Unto|title=Ahimsa.

When Mahavira revived the Jain community in the 6th century BCE, ''ahimsa'' was already an established, strictly observed rule. The followers of [[Parshvanatha]] vowed to observe ''ahimsa''; this obligation was part of their ''caujjama dhamma'' (Fourfold Restraint).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Goyal|first=Śrīrāma|title=A history of Indian Buddhism|publisher=Kusumanjali Prakashan|year=1987|location=Meerut|pages=83, 84, 85, 103}}</ref>

According to Dundas, Jains believe that the lineage of Parshvanatha influenced Mahavira. Parshvanatha, as the one who "removes obstacles and has the capacity to save", is a popular icon; his image is the focus of Jain temple devotion.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–33}} Of the 24 ''tirthankaras'', Jain iconography has celebrated Mahavira and Parshvanatha the most; sculptures discovered at the [[Mathura]] archaeological site have been dated to the 1st{{nbsp}}century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–33}}{{sfn|Umakant P. Shah|1987|pp=9–11}}{{sfn|Cort|2010|pp=25–32, 120–122, 166–171, 189–192}} According to [[Moriz Winternitz]], Mahavira may be considered a reformer of an existing Jain sect known as ''[[Jainism#Political history|Niganthas]]'' (fetter-less) which was mentioned in early Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Winternitz|1993|p=408}} The [[Barli Inscription]] dating back to 443 BCE contains the line ''Viraya Bhagavate chaturasiti vase'', which can be interpreted as "dedicated to Lord Vira in his 84th year".{{sfn|S. R. Goyal|2005|p=22}}

=== Festivals ===
Two major annual Jain festivals associated with Mahavira are [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]] and [[Diwali (Jainism)|Diwali]]. During [[Mahavir Janma Kalyanak]], Jains celebrate Mahavira's birth as the 24th and last ''tirthankara'' of ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'' (the current time cycle).{{sfn|Gupta|Gupta|2006|p=1001}} During Mahavir JanmaKalyanak, the five auspicious events of Mahavira's life are re-enacted.{{sfn|George|2008|p=394}} Diwali commemorates the anniversary of Mahavira's ''[[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]'', and is celebrated at the same time as the [[Diwali|Hindu festival]].

=== Influence ===
Mahavira's teachings were influential. According to [[Rabindranath Tagore]],
{{quote|Mahavira proclaimed in India that religion is a reality and not a mere social convention. It is really true that salvation can not be had by merely observing external ceremonies. Religion cannot make any difference between man and man.|Rabindranath Tagore{{sfn|Nanda|1997|p=44}}<ref name=fhe/>}}

An event associated with the 2,500th anniversary of Mahavira's ''nirvana'' was held in 1974:{{sfn|Jaini|2000|p=31}}
{{quote|Probably few people in the West are aware that during this Anniversary year for the first time in their long history, the [[Jain monasticism|mendicants]] of the ''Śvētāmbara'', ''Digambara'' and ''[[Sthānakavāsī]]'' sects assembled on the same platform, agreed upon a common flag ([[Jain flag|Jaina ''dhvaja'']]) and emblem (''pratīka''); and resolved to bring about the unity of the community. For the duration of the year four ''dharma cakras'', a wheel mounted on a chariot as an ancient symbol of the ''samavasaraṇa'' (Holy Assembly) of ''Tīrthaṅkara'' Mahavira traversed to all the major cities of India, winning legal sanctions from various state governments against the slaughter of animals for sacrifice or other religious purposes, a campaign which has been a major preoccupation of the Jainas throughout their history.|[[Padmanabh Jaini]]}}
