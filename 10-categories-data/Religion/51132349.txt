{{Chinese folk religion}}
[[Chinese folk religion|Chinese traditional religion]] is [[polytheism|polytheistic]]; many deities are worshipped in a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view where divinity is inherent in the world.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=71}} The gods are energies or principles revealing, imitating and propagating the way of Heaven (''[[Tian]]'' {{lang|zh|天}}), which is the supreme godhead manifesting in the [[celestial pole|northern culmen of the starry vault of the skies]] and its order. Many gods are ancestors or men who became deities for their heavenly achievements; most gods are also identified with stars and constellations.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}} Ancestors are regarded as the equivalent of Heaven within human society,{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=76–77}} and therefore as the means connecting back to Heaven, which is the "utmost ancestral father" ({{lang|zh|曾祖父}} ''zēngzǔfù'').{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=84, note 282}}

Gods are innumerable, as every phenomenon has or is one or more gods, and they are organised in a complex celestial hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.sgjh.tn.edu.tw/cyberfair/treeking/story/story_2_3.htm|script-title=zh:民間信仰的神明概念|trans-title=Hierarchic organisation of the spiritual world|website=web.sgjh.tn.edu.tw}}</ref> Besides the traditional worship of these entities, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and formal thinkers in general give [[Chinese theology|theological interpretations]] affirming a [[monism|monistic]] essence of divinity.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=98 ff}} "Polytheism" and "[[monotheism]]" are categories derived from Western religion and do not fit Chinese religion, which has never conceived the two things as opposites.{{sfnb|Zhao|2012|p=45}} Since all gods are considered manifestations of {{lang|zh|氣}} ''[[qi|qì]]'', the "power" or ''[[pneuma]]'' of Heaven, some scholars have employed the term "polypneumatism" or "(poly)pneumatolatry", first coined by Walter Medhurst (1796–1857), to describe the practice of Chinese polytheism.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=202}} In the theology of the [[Chinese classics|classic texts]] and Confucianism, "Heaven is the lord of the hundreds of deities".{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=64}} Modern Confucian theology compares them to intelligence, [[potentiality and actuality|substantial forms or entelechies]] (inner purposes) as explained by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], generating all types of beings, so that "even mountains and rivers are worshipped as something capable of enjoying sacrificial offerings".{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|pp=173–174}}

Unlike in Hinduism, the deification of historical persons and ancestors is not traditionally the duty of Confucians or Taoists. Rather depends on the choices of common people; persons are deified when they have made extraordinary deeds and have left an efficacious legacy. Yet, Confucians and Taoists traditionally may demand that state honour be granted to a particular deity. Each deity has a cult centre and ancestral temple where he or she, or the parents, lived their mortal life. There are frequently disputes over which is the original place and source temple of the cult of a deity.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=147}}

==Terminology==
In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between {{lang|zh|神}} ''shén'', {{lang|zh|帝}} ''dì'' and {{lang|zh|仙}} ''[[xian (Taoism)|xiān]]''. Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between "god" and "deity", Latin ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' (meaning a generative principle, "spirit") and ''[[deus]]'' or 'Deva' (Sanskrit) and 'divus''; ''dì'', sometimes translated as "[[:wiktionary:thearch|thearch]]", implies a manifested or incarnate "godly" power.{{refn|group=note|The term "thearch" is from Greek ''theos'' ("deity"), with ''[[arche]]'' ("principle", "origin"), thus meaning "divine principle", "divine origin". In sinology it has been used to designate the incarnated gods who, according to Chinese tradition, sustain the world order and originated China. It is one of the alternating translations of {{lang|zh|帝}} ''dì'', together with "emperor" and "god".{{sfnb|Pregadio|2013|p=504, vol. 1, A-L|ps=: "Each sector of heaven (the four points of the compass and the center) was personified by a ''di'' {{lang|zh|帝}} (a term which indicates not only an emperor but also an ancestral "thearch" and "god")".}}}}{{sfnb|Medhurst|1847|p=260}} It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of ''di'' as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' explaining "deity" as "what faces the base of a melon fruit".{{sfnb|Zhao|2012|p=51}} The latter term {{lang|zh|仙}} ''xiān'' unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, (Xian sounds similar to Sanskrit word Chiranjeevi, The Immortal one)  similarly to the Western idea of "[[hero]]".{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}

{{Main article|Chinese theology}}
Chinese traditional theology, which comes in different interpretations according to the [[Chinese classics|classic texts]], and specifically Confucian, Taoist and other [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]] formulations,{{sfnb|Adler|2011|pp=4–5}} is fundamentally [[monism|monistic]], that is to say it sees the world and the gods who produce it as an organic whole, or [[cosmos]].{{sfnb|Cai|2004|p=314}} The universal principle that gives origin to the world is conceived as [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]] to creation, at the same time.{{sfnb|Adler|2011|p=5}} The Chinese idea of the universal [[God]] is expressed in different ways; there are many [[names of God]] from the different sources of Chinese tradition.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}

The radical Chinese terms for the universal God are ''[[Tian|Tiān]]'' {{lang|zh|天}} and ''[[Shangdi|Shàngdì]]'' {{lang|zh|上帝}} (the "Highest Deity") or simply ''Dì'' {{lang|zh|帝}} ("Deity").{{sfnb|Chang|2000}}{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|pp=63–67}} There is also the concept of ''Tàidì'' {{lang|zh|太帝}} (the "Great Deity"). ''Dì'' is a title expressing dominance over the [[Tianxia|all-under-Heaven]], that is all things generated by Heaven and ordered by its cycles and by the stars.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}} ''Tiān'' is usually translated as "Heaven", but by graphical etymology it means "Great One" and a number of scholars relate it to the same ''Dì'' through phonetic etymology and trace their common root, through their archaic forms respectively ''*Teeŋ'' and ''*Tees'', to the symbols of the squared north [[celestial pole]] godhead (''Dīng'' {{lang|zh|口}}).{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim''}}{{sfnb|Zhou|2005}} These names are combined in different ways in Chinese theological literature, often interchanged in the same paragraph if not in the same sentence.{{sfnb|Zhong|2014|p=66, note 224}}

===Names of the God of Heaven===
Besides ''Shangdi'' and ''Taidi'', other names include ''[[Jade Emperor|Yudi]]'' ("Jade Deity") and ''Taiyi'' ("Great Oneness") who, in mythical imagery, holds the ladle of the [[Big Dipper]] (Great Chariot) providing the movement of life to the world.{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=240}} As the hub of the skies, the north celestial pole constellations are known, among various names, as ''Tiānmén'' {{lang|zh|天門}} ("Gate of Heaven")<ref name=Reiter>{{cite book|last=Reiter|first=Florian C.|title=Purposes, Means and Convictions in Daoism: A Berlin Symposium|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2007|isbn=978-3447055130}} p. 190.</ref> and ''Tiānshū'' {{lang|zh|天樞}} ("Pivot of Heaven").<ref name=Milburn>{{cite book|last=Milburn|first=Olivia|title=The Spring and Autumn Annals of Master Yan|series=Sinica Leidensia|publisher=BRILL|year=2016|isbn=978-9004309661}} p. 343, note 17.</ref>

Other names of the God of Heaven are attested in the vast Chinese religio-philosophical literary tradition:
* ''Tiāndì'' {{lang|zh|天帝}}—the "Deity of Heaven" or "Emperor of Heaven":{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}} "On Rectification" (''Zheng lun'') of the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' uses this term to refer to the active God of Heaven setting in motion creation;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Tiānzhǔ'' {{lang|zh|天主}}—the "Lord of Heaven": In "The Document of Offering Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth on the Mountain Tai" (''Fengshan shu'') of the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' it is used as the title of the first God from whom all the other gods derive.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65}}
* ''Tiānhuáng'' {{lang|zh|天皇}}—the "King of Heaven": In the "Poem of Fathoming Profundity" (''Si'xuan fu''), transcribed in "The History of the Later Han Dynasty" (''Hou Han shu''), Zhang Heng ornately writes: «I ask the superintendent of the Heavenly Gate to open the door and let me visit the King of Heaven at the Jade Palace»;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}
* ''Tiāngōng'' {{lang|zh|天公}}—the "Duke of Heaven" or "General of Heaven";{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=981}}
* ''Tiānjūn'' {{lang|zh|天君}}—the "Prince of Heaven" or "Lord of Heaven";{{sfnb|Lagerwey|Kalinowski|2008|p=981}}
* ''Tiānzūn'' {{lang|zh|天尊}}—the "Heavenly Venerable", also a title for high gods in Taoist theologies;{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}
* ''Tiānshén'' {{lang|zh|天神}}—the "God of Heaven", interpreted in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' as "the being that gives birth to all things";{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Shénhuáng'' {{lang|zh|神皇}}—"God the King", attested in ''Taihong'' ("The Origin of Vital Breath");{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=64}}
* ''Lǎotiānyé'' ({{lang|zh|老天爺}})—the "Olden Heavenly Father".{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=66}}

''Tian'' is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[immanence|immanent]], manifesting in the three forms of dominance, destiny and nature of things. In the ''Wujing yiyi'' ({{lang|zh|五經異義}}, "Different Meanings in the [[Five Classics]]"), [[Xu Shen]] explains that the designation of Heaven is quintuple:{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=65}}
* ''Huáng Tiān'' {{lang|zh|皇天}} —"Yellow Heaven" or "Shining Heaven", when it is venerated as the lord of creation;
* ''Hào Tiān'' {{lang|zh|昊天}}—"Vast Heaven", with regard to the vastness of its vital breath (''qi'');
* ''Mín Tiān'' {{lang|zh|旻天}}—"Compassionate Heaven", for it hears and corresponds with justice to the all-under-Heaven;
* ''Shàng Tiān'' {{lang|zh|上天}}—"Highest Heaven" or "First Heaven", for it is the primordial being supervising all-under-Heaven;
* ''Cāng Tiān'' {{lang|zh|蒼天}}—"Deep-Green Heaven", for it being unfathomably deep.

All these designations reflect a hierarchical, [[multiperspectivity|multiperspective]] experience of divinity.{{sfnb|Lü|Gong|2014|p=63}}
