"'''Who is a Jew?'''" ({{lang-he|מיהו יהודי}} {{IPA-he|ˈmi(h)u je(h)uˈdi|pron}}) is a basic question about [[Jewish identity]] and considerations of Jewish [[self-identification]]. The question pertains to ideas about [[Jewish]] personhood, which have [[Jewish culture|cultural]], [[Jewish ethnic divisions|ethnic]], [[Judaism|religious]], [[political]], [[genealogy|genealogical]], and [[family|personal]] dimensions. [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] follow Jewish law ([[Halakha]]), deeming a person to be Jewish if their [[Matrilineality in Judaism|mother]] is Jewish or if they underwent a halakhic [[conversion to Judaism#Halakhic considerations|conversion]]. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] accept both [[matrilineal]] and [[patrilineal]] descent as well as conversion. [[Karaite Judaism]] predominantly follows patrilineal descent as well as conversion.

Jewish identity is also commonly defined through [[Jewish ethnic divisions|ethnicity]]. Opinion polls have suggested that the majority of Jews see being Jewish as predominantly a matter of ancestry and culture, rather than religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/16/a-closer-look-at-jewish-identity-in-israel-and-the-u-s/|title=A closer look at Jewish identity in Israel and the U.S.|date=March 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Poll-Many-Israelis-see-Jewish-identity-as-being-self-defined-375551|title=Poll: Many Israelis see Jewish identity as being self-defined – Israel News – Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref>

== Traditional interpretation and variations ==

The definition of who is a Jew varies according to whether it is being considered by Jews on the basis of religious law and tradition or self-identification, or by non-Jews for other reasons, sometimes for prejudicial purposes.

According to the simplest definition used by most Jews for self-identification, a person is a Jew by birth or becomes one through religious conversion. However, there are differences in interpretations when it comes to non-[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]] in the application of this definition, including

* Should a person with only a Jewish father be considered Jewish?
* Which conversion processes should be considered valid?
* Can one remain a Jew after converting to another religion?
* How does being unaware of having Jewish parents affect one's Jewish status?
* How is Jewish identity determined in different countries throughout the Jewish Diaspora?
* How is the claim to Israeli citizenship adjudicated in the context of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]]?

== Tannaitic Judaism ==
According to the [[Mishnah]], the first written source for [[halakha]], the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined matrilineally.

According to historian [[Shaye J. D. Cohen]], in the Bible, the status of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to other mixtures (''kilayim''). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the [[Tannaim]] may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, [[Mater semper certa est|offspring would follow the mother]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Shaye J.D.

== Contemporary Judaism ==
All [[Jewish religious movements]] agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion. According to ''[[halakha]],'' a Jew by birth must be born to a Jewish mother. ''Halakha'' states that the acceptance of the principles and practices of Judaism does not make a person a Jew. However, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.<ref name=about.com-jewish>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Lisa|title=Am I Jewish?|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/amijewish.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=8 November 2013}}</ref>

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, as movements which reject the concept of ''halakha'', often accept a child as Jewish when only the father is Jewish, provided that the child chooses to identify as Jewish.<ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew/> As conversion processes differ, those performed by more liberal denominations are not accepted by more orthodox denominations.<ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew>{{cite web|title=Who Is a Jew?|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/whoisjew.htm|publisher=Judaism101|access-date=8 November 2013}}</ref>

=== Jewish by birth ===

According to ''halakha'', to determine a person's Jewish status (Hebrew: ''yuhasin'') one needs to consider the status of both parents. If both parents are Jewish, their child will also be considered Jewish, and the child takes the status of the father (e.g., as a [[kohen]]). If either parent is subject to a genealogical disability (e.g., is a [[mamzer]]) then the child is also subject to that disability. If one of the parents is not Jewish, the rule is that the child takes the status of the mother ([[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 68b, [[Shulchan Aruch]], EH 4:19).<ref name = "AsktheRabbi">{{cite web

The [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] branches of Judaism maintain that the halakhic rules (i.e. matrilineal descent) are valid and binding. [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom)|Liberal Judaism]] do not accept the halakhic rules as binding, and most branches accept a child of one Jewish parent, whether father or mother, as Jewish if the parents raise the child as a Jew and foster a Jewish identity in the child, noting that "in the Bible the line always followed the father, including the cases of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]], who married into non-Israelite priestly families."<ref name=JVL>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal.html ''Patrilineal Descent'', Jewish Virtual Library], .

=== Patrilineal descent ===

In 1983, the Reform Central Conference of American Rabbis passed the Resolution on Patrilineal Descent, declaring that "the child of one Jewish parent is under the presumption of Jewish descent. This presumption of the status of the offspring of any mixed marriage is to be established through appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification with the Jewish faith and people... Depending on circumstances, mitzvot leading toward a positive and exclusive Jewish identity will include entry into the covenant, acquisition of a Hebrew name, Torah study, Bar/Bat Mitzvah, and Kabbalat Torah (Confirmation). For those beyond childhood claiming Jewish identity, other public acts or declarations may be added or substituted after consultation with their rabbi."<ref>''Jewish Living: A Guide to Reform Contemporary Practice'' by Rabbi Mark Washofsky (URJ Press)</ref>

Rabbi Mark Washofsky summarizes the 1983 CCAR resolution and subsequent interpretations in Reform responsa literature as follows:
* "The resolution is advisory rather than halachic in the traditional sense. It does not establish a new definition of Jewish identity, for its preamble states expressly that it means to be operative only for Reform Jews in North America, not for all Jews everywhere."
* "Jewish descent may be from either parent....The Reform Movement presumes the child of ''one'' Jewish parent, either mother or father, as Jewish. In fact, the 1983 resolution is in one significant respect more stringent than the traditional definition of Jewish status. The child of a Jewish mother and gentile father, whom halachah regards as clearly Jewish, enjoys but a ''presumption'' of Jewish status that must be "established" by "appropriate and timely public and formal acts of identification."
* "Biology remains a crucial factor. In the determination of Jewish identity...the child of ''two gentile'' parents is, as before, definitely a non-Jew and must undergo a formal conversion in order to become a Jew."
* "Both descent and behavior are crucial in determining Jewish status under the resolution. The Jewish status of a child of an intermarriage cannot be determined "automatically" either by biology or behavior. Both elements—descent from one Jewish parent ''and'' the performance of mitzvot that lead to a "positive and exclusive Jewish identity—must be present, and they must be present during childhood."
* "The resolution applies only to children raised exclusively as Jews....A child raised simultaneously in Judaism and another religious tradition does not develop a "positive and exclusive" Jewish identity; therefore the presumption of Jewish status is disproved, and the resolution does not apply to that child. He or she will require conversion prior to celebrating becoming bar or bat mitzvah in the synagogue."<ref>''Jewish Living: A Guide to Reform Contemporary Practice'', Rabbi Mark Washofsky (URJ Press)</ref>

Waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity was a departure from the traditional position requiring formal [[conversion to Judaism]] for children without a [[matrilineal descent|Jewish mother]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html|title=Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent (March 1983)|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}</ref>

The CCAR's 1983 resolution has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone not born of a Jewish mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515|title=The Establishment of Reform Judaism in Israel|publisher=American Jewish Committee|access-date=July 26, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=840313&ct=1051515|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent, on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line, basing this idea "on the fact that, in the Bible, [[Tribes of Israel#Origin|tribes]] are given male names and that biblical characters are always referenced by their fathers' names.<ref name="ReferenceA">p.154, Levinson, David (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures Vol 9 : Africa and the Middle East'', G. K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1995</ref> However, a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=karaite-korner.org|access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref>

The divergence of views has become an issue because Orthodox and Conservative communities do not recognize a person as Jewish if only their father is Jewish.<ref name=Judaism101-who-is-a-jew/> For the person to be accepted as Jewish by an Orthodox or Conservative community (for example, on an occasion of their bar or bat mitzvah or marriage), they require a formal conversion (in accordance with halakhic standards). Orthodox Judaism has a predominant position in Israel. Although Orthodox and Conservative Judaism do not recognize Jewishness through patrilineal descent, "it should also be noted, however, that in the case of a child born to a Jewish father but to a non-Jewish mother, most Orthodox rabbis will relax the stringent demands normally made of would-be converts",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal.html|title=Patrilineal Descent|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref> and the Rabbinical Assembly of the Conservative movement "agreed that 'sincere Jews by choice' should be warmly welcomed into the community".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/whoisjewdescent.htm|title=Who is a Jew via Descent|author=Lisa Katz|work=About|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

=== Converts to Judaism ===
{{Main|Conversion to Judaism}}

All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with most subgroups having a specific process for accepting converts. Not all conversions are recognised by all varieties of Judaism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJlGeE9D2JIC&q=%22increase+in+the+number%22|title=Conversion to Judaism|access-date=January 6, 2015|isbn=9781461627999|last1=Epstein|first1=Lawrence J.|date=1994-07-01}}</ref>

In [[Rabbinic Judaism]], the laws of conversion are based on [[Jewish law|the classical sources of Jewish law]], especially discussions in the [[Talmud]], and the law as codified in the [[Shulkhan Arukh]].<ref>Ben Rafael, Eliezer, ''Jewish identities: fifty intellectuals answer [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben Gurion]]'', p.210</ref> This corpus of traditional [[Jewish law]] (halakha) is regarded as authoritative by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]<ref name="Alon">{{cite book

For hundreds of years, it has been accepted as the final and authoritative codification of the laws found in the Talmud. (3 ELON at 1368–1422.) Even the work's title indicates its authority. Shulchan Aruch translates as "set table," thereby symbolically stating that the Jewish law has finally be set and settled in a clear code. (The authoritative code of Jewish law is the Shulchan Aruch along with glosses on the Shulchan Aruch added by Moshe Isserles (c. 1525–1572), also called Rama or Remu, that present legal opinions omitted by Karo, especially opinions specific to the Ashkenazic (German and Eastern European) Jewish customs. The glosses are called the "table cloth" to the "set table" of the Shulchan Aruch. The two together still form the definitive codification of Jewish law. 3 ELON at 1359–1365.)

[[Karaite Judaism]] does not accept the oral legal traditions of Rabbinic Judaism. It has different requirements for conversion and refrained from accepting any converts until recently.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Traditionally non-proselytizing, on August 1, 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion came 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151023/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html |date=October 11, 2008 }}.

[[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jewish communities]] do not normally carry out conversions, particularly where the conversion is suspected of being for the sake of marriage. Nor do they accept such converts from other communities, or the children of mixed marriages or marriages involving such converts.<ref>Although no scientific studies have been completed in regard to the Syrian-Jewish intermarriage rate, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Syrian community's current rate of intermarriage with non-Jews is between 2 and 3%. The National Jewish Population Survey study cited by Gordon and Horowitz {{cite web|url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/WillYourGrandchildrenBeJews.htm |title=Will Your Grandchildren Be Jewish |access-date=2008-02-19 |author=Antony Gordon and Richard Horowitz}} gives intermarriage rates for Centrist and Hasidic Jews of 3% for those between the ages of 18–39 and 6% overall, as compared with 32% for Conservative Jews, 46% for Reform Jews and 49% for secular Jews. Gordon and Horowitz suggest that the main reason for the difference is the growing commitment to Jewish Day School education: "The combination of Jewish commitment and having experienced a complete K-12 Orthodox Jewish Day School education results in an intermarriage rate of not greater than 3%." This suggests that Jewish day schools, rather than the edict, are the decisive factor in discouraging intermarriage.</ref>

=== Jews who have practiced another religion ===

In general, [[Orthodox Judaism]] considers individuals born of Jewish mothers to be Jewish, even if they convert to or are raised in another religion.<ref name="katz" /> [[Reform Judaism]] views Jews who convert to or are raised in another religion as non-Jews. For example "...anyone who claims that Jesus is their [[Salvation|savior]] is no longer a Jew..."

Historically, a Jew who has been declared to be a [[heresy|heretic]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[Minuth|min]],'' מין) or Christian (Hebrew: ''[[Nazarene (title)|notzri]],'' נוצרי, meaning "Nazarene") may have had a ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (similar to [[excommunication]]) placed on him or her; but the practice of communal and religious exclusion does not affect their status of Jewish birth.<ref name="leavesoffaith">{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first=Aharon |title=Leaves of Faith: Selected Essays of Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|date=March 2004|isbn=0-88125-668-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QshqTu9nGIC&q=Leaves+of+Faith:+Selected+Essays+of+Rabbi+Aharon+Lichtenstein&pg=PA369|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> Judaism also views as Jewish those who involuntarily convert from Judaism to another religion ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[anusim]],'' אנוסים, meaning "forced ones"), and their matrilineal descendants are likewise considered to be Jewish.

Judaism has a category for those who are Jewish but who do not practice or who do not accept the tenets of Judaism, whether or not they have converted to another religion. The traditional view regarding these individuals, known as [[Meshumad]]im ({{lang-he|משומדים}}), is that they are Jewish; however, there is much debate in the rabbinic literature regarding their status vis-a-vis the application of Jewish law and their participation in Jewish ritual,<ref name="leavesoffaith" /> but not to their status as Jews.

A Jew who leaves Judaism is free to return to the religion at any time. In general, no formal ceremony or declaration is required to return to Jewish practices. All [[Jewish denominations|movements of Judaism]] welcome the return to Judaism of those who have left, or been raised in another religion. When returning to Judaism, these individuals would be expected to abandon their previous practices and adopt Jewish customs.

The same rules in principle apply to the matrilineal descendants of such persons, though some rabbinical authorities may require stricter proof of Jewish descent than others. Whether such persons are required to undergo a full formal conversion depends on the community and their individual circumstances. For example, a male who has had a [[brit milah]], who has a general understanding of Judaism, but who has been raised in a secular home might not be required to undergo ritual conversion. However, a male who has not had a brit milah, a male or female who has converted to or been brought up in another religion, or an individual raised in a completely secular home without any Jewish education, in most communities, may be required to undergo a full ritual conversion. For full participation in the community (for example, to marry with the participation of a rabbi), they may be required to display sincerity, such as a declaration of commitment to Judaism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zelizer|first=Gerald L.|date=June 14, 1995|title=The Return of Second Generation Apostates|journal=YD|publisher=The Rabbinical Assembly|volume=268|issue=12|pages=146–50|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/zelizer_apostates.pdf|access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref>

Another example of the issues involved is the case of converts to Judaism who cease to practice Judaism (whether or not they still regard themselves as Jewish), do not accept or follow halakha, or now adhere to another religion. Technically, such a person remains Jewish, like all Jews, provided that the original conversion is valid. However, in some recent cases, [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Posek|rabbinical authorities]], as well as the current [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] [[Israel]]i [[Chief Rabbi]]nate, have taken the view that a given convert's lapse from Orthodox Jewish observance is evidence that he or she cannot, even at the time of the conversion, have had the full intention to observe the commandments and that the conversion must therefore have been invalid.

A valid Jewish court of sufficient stature has the ability to revoke a person's or a group's status as Jews. This was done for the [[lost Ten Tribes]] of Israel<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Yebamoth 16b)</ref> and the [[Samaritans]].<ref>Pirke De-Rabbi Elieze, chapter 36</ref>

== Religious definitions ==

=== Halakhic perspective ===
{{main|Matrilineality in Judaism}}
According to the traditional Rabbinic view, which is maintained by all branches of [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]], and some branches of [[Reform Judaism]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Reform Judaism – Halachah|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/a-to-z-of-reform-judaism/contemporary-issues/halachah.html|access-date=8 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104221109/http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/a-to-z-of-reform-judaism/contemporary-issues/halachah.html|archive-date=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> only ''[[Jewish law|halakha]]'' can define who is or is not a Jew when a question of Jewish identity, lineage, or parentage arises about any person seeking to define themselves or claim that they are Jewish.

As a result, mere ''belief'' in the principles of Judaism does ''not'' make one a Jew. Similarly, non-adherence by a Jew to the [[613 Mitzvot]], or even formal conversion to another religion, does not make one lose one's Jewish status. Thus, the immediate descendants of all female Jews (even [[apostate]]s) are still considered to be Jews, as are those of all their female descendants. Even those descendants who are not aware they are Jews or practice a religion other than Judaism, are defined by this perspective as Jews, as long as they come from an unbroken female line of descent. As a corollary, the children of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother are not considered to be Jews by Halakha unless they formally convert according to Halakha, even if raised fully observant in the Mitzvot.<ref>Angel, Marc, ''Choosing to be Jewish: the Orthodox road to conversion'', pp.114–117</ref><ref>The Jewish oral tradition adduces the law of matrilineal descent from Deuteronomy 7:3-4: “you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others…” By looking very closely and diacritically at the wording of the text, it says "...since he (the Canaanite father) will turn away your son (i.e. the child born to your Jewish daughter) from following me." Here, it is implied that God still reckons the child to be Jewish by calling him ''your son'' - even though such unions were forbidden. The text calls him ''your son'', implying that he is still an Israelite because he was born from a Jewish mother. However, the opposite is not true. The Torah does not say, "...for she (the Canaanite mother) will turn away your son." In this case, the child would no longer be considered your son, but rather a gentile. ({{cite book |author1=Yom Tov Asevilli|author-link1=Yom Tov Asevilli |title=Chiddushei Ha-Ritva |publisher=[[Mossad Harav Kook]]|location=Jerusalem|year=1985|pages=726–727 |language=he |oclc=878066707 }}, s.v. Kiddushin 68b; cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Yevamot'' 17a; [[Numbers Rabba]] 19:3)</ref>

Those not born to a Jewish mother may become accepted as Jews by the Orthodox and Conservative communities through a formal process of [[conversion to Judaism]] in order to become "righteous converts" (''{{lang|he-Latn|Gerei Tzedek}}''—{{lang-he|גרי צדק}}). In addition, Halakha requires that the new convert commit himself to the observance of its tenets; this is called ''{{lang|he-Latn|Kabbalat Ol Mitzvot}}'' ({{lang-he|קבלת עול מצוות}}), "Acceptance of the Yoke of the Commandments". ''{{lang|he-Latn|Kabbalat mitzvot}}'' ({{lang-he|קבלת מצוות}}) is used by [[Reform Judaism]] in accordance with reform responsa and Halakhah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.ccarnet.org/glgerim7.html |title=Guidelines for Rabbis Working with Prospective gerim |quote=Prior to completing the process of ''giur'', a rabbi should require that each prospective ''ger/gioret'' make commitments within each of the following areas.

Both [[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] accept a similar set of rules regarding Jewish status based on classical rabbinic Judaism, including both matrilineal descent and requirements that conversions be performed by Orthodox rabbis and that converts promise to strictly observe elements of traditional Judaism such as [[Shabbat]] and [[Niddah]]. However, their application of these rules have been different, and the difference has been increasing in recent years. Modern Orthodox authorities have been more inclined to rule in favor of Jewish status and to accept non-Orthodox Jews' word in doubtful cases involving people claiming to be Jews, while Haredi authorities have in recent years tended to presume non-Jewish status and require more stringent rules and standards of evidence in order for Jewish status to be proven, and have tended to distrust the evidence of Jews who are not personally Orthodox. Haredi rabbis have tended to look at a convert's current personal observance and to regard deficiencies or lack of Orthodoxy in current observance as evidence that the convert never intended to validly convert. In addition, the contemporary situation is further complicated by the fact that some Haredi rabbis no longer regard some Modern Orthodox rabbis as reliable.<ref name="The Forward">{{cite news|title=As Rabbinate Stiffens Rules, Orthodox Rites Face Scrutiny|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/as-rabbinate-stiffens-rules-orthodox-rites-face-s/|publisher=[[The Forward|Forward]]|date=June 2, 2006}}</ref><ref name="The New York Times">{{cite news|title=Israel's Chief Rabbis Reject Call By Non-Orthodox on Conversion|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E4DA163CF933A25751C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=|work=The New York Times| date=February 10, 1998 | first=Serge | last=Schmemann}}</ref><ref name="How do you prove you're a Jew">{{Cite news |author=Gersom Gorenberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/magazine/02jewishness-t.html |title=How do you prove you're a Jew? |work=The New York Times |date=March 2, 2008}}</ref>

=== Karaite Judaism ===

Karaite Judaism relies on the Tanakh to indicate that Jewishness is passed down through the paternal line, not the maternal line as is maintained by Orthodox Judaism (though a minority holds that both parents need to be Jewish). Karaite Jews are eligible for [[Aliyah]] under the [[Law of Return]]. The eligibility of converts to Judaism through the Karaite movement to make Aliyah under the Law of Return has not yet been addressed in Israeli courts.<ref>Yaron, Y., Joe Pessah, and Abraham Qanai. An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice, and Culture. N.p.: Qirqisani Center, 2003. Print.</ref>

Several verses in the Bible mentioning about laws of family inheritance depending on the paternal lineage of the tribe:<ref>Numbers 26 :53-55, Numbers 36 :7-8</ref>

{{blockquote|So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. |[[Book of Numbers]] 36 :7-8}}

=== Reform Judaism ===
Reform Judaism recognizes a child as being Jewish if either parent is Jewish and the child is being raised Jewish. Voices within the Reform movement say that the law, which changed to matriarchal around 2,000 years ago (originally in the Torah the offspring was determined by patriarchal descent) and was based on the tragic circumstances the Jewish people were facing, was once helpful but is no longer relevant.<ref>{{cite web | last=Troderman | first=Joshua | title=Halacha Unplugged, Part 1 – The Bris: Which Parent Makes a Child Jewish? | website=InterfaithFamily | date=2016-01-12 | url=https://interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/halacha-unplugged-part-1-the-bris-which-parent-makes-a-child-jewish/ | access-date=2018-02-21}}</ref>

Modern Progressive Jewish denominations have a conversion process based on their [[Columbus Platform|principles]]. In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 abolished circumcision as a requirement for converts,<ref>Meyer, Michael "''Berit Mila'' within the History of the Reform Movement" in Barth, Lewis (1990) ''Berit Mila'' in the Reform Context. New York: Berit Milah Board of reform Judaism</ref> and Reform does not require converts to have ''tevilah,'' ritual immersion. A "prospective convert declares, orally and in writing, in the presence of a rabbi and no less than two lay leaders of the congregation and community, acceptance of the Jewish religion and the intention to live in accordance with its ''mitzvot''".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/reform_practices.html|title=The Tenets of Reform Judaism|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

==== Controversies ====
The controversy in determining "who is a Jew" concerns four basic issues:

One issue arises because North American [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and UK [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|Liberal]] movements have changed some of the halakhic requirements for Jewish identity in two ways:

:A. Children born of just one Jewish parent – regardless of whether the father or mother is Jewish – can claim a Jewish identity. A child of only one Jewish parent who does not claim this identity has, in the eyes of the Reform movement, forfeited his/her Jewish identity. By contrast, the halakhic view is that any child born to a Jewish mother is Jewish, whether or not he/she is raised Jewish, or even whether the mother considers herself Jewish. As an example, the children of [[Madeleine Albright]] (who was raised Catholic and was unaware of her Jewish heritage) would all be Jewish according to halakha, since their mother's traceable female ancestors were all Jewish and all three of her children were female. However, this is not the belief of progressive Judaism, which views Jews who convert to or are raised in another religion as non-Jews.

:B. The requirement of ''[[brit milah]]'' has been relaxed, as has the requirement of ritual immersion. (While the Conservative movement permits conversion without circumcision in some cases, most Orthodox Jews do not,<ref name="chabad.org">{{cite web |title=Is a convert who is a hemophiliac required to have a circumcision? |author=Menachem Posner |publisher=Chabad.org |url=http://www.chabad.org/476233}}</ref> except in cases specifically exempted by the [[Talmud]], such as one who has had three brothers die as a result of circumcision; Jewish children who are [[hemophilia]]cs are exempt from circumcision.<ref name="chabad.org"/>)

Secondly, [[Orthodox Judaism]] asserts that non-Orthodox [[rabbi]]s are not qualified to form a ''[[beit din]].''<ref name="How do you prove you're a Jew"/> This has led to non-Orthodox conversions generally being unaccepted in Orthodox communities. Since [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional standards for conversion – in which the commitment to observe halakha is required – non-Orthodox conversions are generally not accepted in Orthodox communities because the non-Orthodox movements perform conversions in which the new convert does not undertake to observe halakha as understood by Orthodox Judaism.

A third controversy concerns persons (whether born Jews or converts to Judaism) who have converted to another religion. The traditional view is such persons remain Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus8.html|title=Efforts to convert Jews draw fire from interdenominational group|website=www.culteducation.com|access-date=September 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104185118/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus8.html|archive-date=November 4, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milechai.com/judaism/jewish-people.html|title=Jewish People – Define|access-date=January 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230222942/http://www.milechai.com/judaism/jewish-people.html|archive-date=December 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Reform Judaism]] regards such people as apostates,<ref>[http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=13&year=5753 Apostate in the Synagogue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929175340/http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=13&year=5753 |date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.ccarnet.org/cgi-bin/respdisp.pl?file=71&year=arr |title=American Reform Responsa : 71.

A fourth controversy stems from the manner in which the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] has been handling marriage and conversion decisions in recent years. Conversions and marriages within Israel are legally controlled by the Orthodox Israeli Chief Rabbinate; therefore, a person not proven to be a Jew to the Rabbinate's satisfaction is not legally permitted to marry a Jew in Israel today. Although the Rabbinate has always refused to accept non-Orthodox conversions, until recent years it was more willing to accept the Jewish parentage of applicants based on personal testimony, and the validity of conversions based on the testimony of Orthodox Rabbis. However, in recent years the rabbinate, whose rabbis historically had a more [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] orientation, has increasingly been filled by the more stringent [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] camp. It has increasingly been inclined to presume that applicants are not Jewish until proven otherwise, and require more stringent standards of proof than in the past. It has implemented a policy of refusing to accept the testimony of non-Orthodox Jews in matters of Jewish status, on grounds that such testimony is not reliable. It also has been increasingly skeptical of the reliability of Orthodox rabbis ordained by institutions not subject to its accreditation, particularly in matters of conversion. Accordingly, non-Orthodox Jews born to Jewish parents, and some Jews converted by Orthodox rabbis, have been increasingly unable to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate's satisfaction, because they are unable to find an Orthodox rabbi who is both acceptable to the Rabbinate, and familiar with and willing to vouch for the Jewishness of their maternal lineage or the validity of their conversion.<ref name="The Forward" /><ref name="The New York Times" /><ref name="How do you prove you're a Jew"/>

There have been several attempts to convene representatives of the three major movements to formulate a practical solution to this issue. To date, these have failed, though all parties concede the importance of the issue is greater than any sense of rivalry among them.

== Ethnic definitions ==
<!-- The term "Ethnic Jew" redirects here. -->
{{Anchor|Ethnic and cultural perspectives}}
{{More citations needed|date=February 2008}}
{{See also|Secular Jewish culture}}

''[[Ethnic group|Ethnic]] Jew'' is a term generally used to describe a person of Jewish parentage and background who does not necessarily actively practice Judaism, but still identifies with Judaism or other Jews culturally or fraternally, or both. The term ''ethnic Jew'' does not specifically exclude practicing Jews, but they are usually simply referred to as "Jews" without the qualifying adjective "ethnic".{{efn|See [[Ethnic group]].}}

The term can refer to people of diverse beliefs and backgrounds because [[genealogy]] largely defines who is "Jewish". "Ethnic Jew" is sometimes used to distinguish non-practicing from practicing (religious) Jews. Other terms include ''non-observant Jew'', ''non-religious Jew'', ''non-practicing Jew'', and ''secular Jew''.

The term may also refer to Jews who do not practice the religion of Judaism. Typically, ethnic Jews are cognizant of their Jewish background and may feel strong cultural (even if not religious) ties to Jewish traditions and to the Jewish people or nation. Like people of any other ethnicity, non-religious ethnic [[Jewish assimilation|Jews often assimilate]] into a surrounding non-Jewish culture, but, especially in areas where there is a strong local Jewish culture, they may remain largely part of that culture instead.

"Ethnic Jews" include [[Jewish atheism|atheists]], agnostics, non-denominational [[deism|deists]], Jews with only casual connections to [[Jewish denominations]] or converts to other religions, such as Christianity, [[Buddhism]], or Islam. Religious Jews of all denominations sometimes engage in outreach to non-religious Jews. In the case of some [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] denominations (e.g. [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]), this outreach extends to actively proselytizing more secular Jews.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/9689/ |title=Knesset Mulls Ban on Proselytizing |author=Orly Halpern |date=December 22, 2006 |work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=3773993 |journal=Ethnology |volume=44 |number=2 |date=Spring 2005 |pages=125–145 |author=Andrew Buckser |title=Chabad In Copenhagen: Fundamentalism And Modernity In Jewish Denmark |doi=10.2307/3773993}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0492_0573_ZO.html|title=492 U.S. 573|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/books/men-in-black.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Men In Black |author=Samuel G.

=== Public opinion ===
The 2013 Pew Research study of American Jews found that 62% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while 15% thought that it was mainly a matter of religion. Of those who stated themselves to be Jews by religion, 55% thought that being Jewish was mainly a matter of ancestry and culture, while two-thirds thought that it was not necessary to believe in God to be Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/|title=A Portrait of Jewish Americans|date=October 1, 2013|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

=== Historical European definitions ===
The traditional European definition of Jewishness (although it was not uniform across Europe) defined a Jew as one belonging to the "Mosaic faith".

The European definition is traditional in many respects and reflects not only how the Europeans saw Jews, but also how Jews saw themselves.

In the former [[Soviet Union]], "Jewish" was a nationality by law, as with other nationalities such as Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and others. There were certain restrictions on their civil liberties in the early years of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Decter|first1=Moshe|title=The Status of the Jews in the Soviet Union|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/23494/moshe-decter/the-status-of-the-jews-in-the-soviet-union|publisher=The Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=21 April 2015|date=January 1963}}</ref>

The term "Gershom", "Gershomi" or "Beta Gershom" has also been used as an alternative to "half-Jewish" and "part-Jewish" in connection with descendants of intermarriage, [[Gershom]] being the son of Moses and his [[Midian]]ite wife [[Zipporah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.half-jewish.org/Beta_Gershom.shtml|title=Beta-Gershom.org|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref> The term typically has no religious meaning, as terms like [[Jewish Christians|Jewish Christian]] do, but rather describes ethnic Jewry.

== Other non-religious definitions ==

The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] defines a Jew as "someone who identifies with the history, culture and fate of the Jewish people". In their view it is, therefore, possible for a non-religious individual to adopt Judaism and join a Humanistic Jewish community, and for the Society for Humanistic Judaism to adopt the person wanting to be part of the Humanistic Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHJ Philosophy|url=http://www.shj.org/mission.htm|access-date=8 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813073051/http://www.shj.org/mission.htm|archive-date=August 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As Israeli author [[Amos Oz]] puts it, "a Jew is anyone who chooses or is compelled to share a common fate with other Jews."<ref name="Auron2012">{{cite book|author=Yair Auron|title=Israeli Identities: Jews and Arabs Facing the Self and the Other|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGmF--NN5ZYC&pg=PA25|year=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-305-1|page=25}}</ref> Oz summed up his position more succinctly in a monologue published in ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'', saying "Who is a Jew?

== Legal structure in Israel ==
Israeli constitutional documents have not defined "who is a Jew" although the decision whether someone is Jewish or not has important legal, social and financial ramifications. This lack of definition has given rise to legal controversy in Israel and there have been many court cases in Israel that have addressed the question.<ref name="Navot, Suzi p.189">Navot, Suzi, ''Constitutional law of Israel'', p.189</ref><ref name="Uzi Rebhun pp.296-297">Uzi Rebhun, Chaim Isaac Waxman, ''Jews in Israel: contemporary social and cultural patterns'', pp.296–297</ref>

=== Law of Return ===
{{Main|Law of Return}}
Following the birth of the modern State of Israel in 1948, the [[Law of Return]] was enacted in 1950 to give any Jew the right to immigrate to Israel and become a citizen.<ref>Navot, Suzi, ''Constitutional law of Israel'', p.188</ref> However, due to an inability on the lawmakers to agree, the Law did not define who was a Jew, relying instead on the issue to resolve itself over time. As a result, the Law relied in form on the traditional halakhic definition. But, the absence of a definition of who is a Jew, for the purpose of the Law, has resulted in the divergent views of the various streams of Judaism competing for recognition.

Besides the generally accepted halakhic definition of who is a Jew, the Law extended the categories of person who are entitled to immigration and citizenship to the children and grandchildren of Jews, regardless of their present religious affiliation, and their spouses.<ref>Law of Return, paragraph 4A. This provision does not extend to the spouse of an Israeli Jew (a non-Israeli person who married an Israeli Jew).</ref> Also, converts to Judaism whose conversion was performed outside the State of Israel, regardless of who performed it, are entitled to immigration under the Law. Once again, issues arose as to whether a conversion performed outside Israel was valid. The variation of the definition in the Law and the definition used by various branches of Judaism has resulted in practical difficulties for many people.

It has been estimated that in the past twenty years about 300,000 avowed non-Jews and even practicing Christians have entered Israel from the former [[Soviet Union]] on the basis of being a child or grandchild of a Jew or by being married to a Jew.<ref name=rosenblum>Jonathan Rosenblum, [http://www.jr.co.il/articles/mixedm.txt "Our New Mixed Multitude"], Jacob Richman Home Page. Retrieved March 16, 2006.</ref>

However, there is an exception in the case of a person who has formally converted to another religion. This is derived from the ''[[Oswald Rufeisen#Life|Rufeisen]] Case'' in 1962,<ref name="Navot, Suzi p.189"/> in which the Supreme Court ruled that such a person, no matter what their halakhic position, is not entitled to immigration under the Law; they concluded that "no one can regard an apostate as belonging to the Jewish people".<ref>Yabuda Savir, [https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol17/iss1/9 The Definition of a Jew under Israel's Law of Return], 17 Sw L.J. 123 (1963)</ref> 

Current Israeli definitions specifically exclude Jews who have openly and knowingly converted to or were raised in a faith other than Judaism, including [[Messianic Judaism]]. This definition is not the same as that in traditional Jewish law; in some respects it is deliberately wider, so as to include those non-Jewish relatives of Jews who may have been perceived to be Jewish, and thus faced [[antisemitism]].

The Law of Return does not, of itself, define the Jewish status of a person; it only deals with those who have a right to immigration to Israel.

In the early 1950s, the [[Israel]]i [[Chief Rabbinate]] originally objected to the immigration of [[Karaite Jew]]s to Israel, and unsuccessfully tried to obstruct it. In 2007 Rabbi David Chayim Chelouche, the chief rabbi of Netanya was quoted in the Jerusalem Post as saying: "A Karaite is a Jew. We accept them as Jews and every one of them who wishes to come back [to mainstream Judaism] we accept back. There was once a question about whether Karaites needed to undergo a token circumcision in order to switch to rabbinic Judaism, but the rabbinate agrees that today that is not necessary."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1178708657471&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |author=Joshua Freeman |work=The Jerusalem Post |title=Laying down the (Oral) law |date=May 22, 2007}}</ref>

=== Israeli laws governing marriage and divorce ===
{{See also|Marriage in Israel}}

In relation to [[Marriage in Israel|marriage]], [[Get (divorce document)|divorce]], and burial, which are under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Israeli Interior Ministry]], the halakhic definition of who is a Jew is applied. When there is any doubt, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate generally determines the issue.

In terms of social relations, most secular Jews view their Jewish identity as a matter of culture, heritage, nationality, or ethnicity.<ref name="who">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism.htm|title=What Is Judaism?|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|publisher=Judaism 101|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> Ancestral aspects can be explained by the many Jews who [[Jewish atheist|view themselves as atheists]] and are defined by matrilineal descent<ref name="katz">{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/od/whoisajew/a/whoisjewdescent.htm|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Katz|first=Lisa|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name="aboutatheism">{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/world/AJ/bl_IsraelJudaism.html|title=Judaism in Israel|work=Judaism|publisher=About.com|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> or a [[Kohen|Cohen (Kohen)]] or [[Levi]], which is connected by ancestry.<ref name="cohenlevi">{{cite web|url=http://www.cohen-levi.org|title=The Tribe|publisher=The Cohen-Levi Family Heritage|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> The question of "who is a Jew" is a question that is under debate.<ref name="weiner">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/whojew1.html|title=Who is a Jew?|last=Weiner|first=Rebecca|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref> Issues related to ancestral or ethnic Jews are dealt with by the Israeli Chief Rabbinate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=559669&contrassID=1&subContrassID=5&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y|title=Amar: Bnei Menashe are Descendants of Ancient Israelites|date=January 4, 2005|work=Haaretz|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name="freund">{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193360806&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|title=Right On: A Miracle of Biblical Proportions|last=Freund|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2006|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=July 17, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615040438/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1159193360806&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archive-date=June 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Indian">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/bneimenashe.html|title=Chief Rabbi Says Indian Community Descended From Israelites|date=July 20, 2006|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name="jstandard">{{cite news|url=http://www.jstandard.com/articles/1101/1/Israel%92s-Chief-Rabbinate-rejects-some-diaspora-Orthodox-conversions|title=Israel's Chief Rabbinate Rejects some Diaspora Orthodox Conversions|last=Tigay|first=Chanan|date=May 26, 2006|publisher=New Jersey Jewish Standard|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref>

Orthodox halachic rules apply to converts who want to marry in Israel. Under these rules, a conversion to Judaism must strictly follow halachic standards to be recognised as valid. The rabbinate even scrutinizes Orthodox conversions, with some who have converted by orthodox authorities outside Israel not being permitted to marry in Israel.<ref name="jstandard" /><ref name="meyers">{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/22872/are-israel-s-marriage-laws-archaic-and-irrelevant/|title=Are Israel's Marriage Laws 'Archaic and Irrelevant'?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=July 12, 1997|work=Jewish News Weekly|access-date=July 17, 2008}}</ref>

If one's ancestral line of Jewishness is in doubt, then a proper conversion would be required in order to be allowed to marry in the Orthodox community, or in Israel, where such rules govern all marriages.

=== Israeli definition of nationality ===
The Jewish status of a person in Israel is considered a matter of "nationality".

In the registering of "nationality" on [[Israeli identity card]]s, which is administered by the Ministry of the Interior, a person had to meet the Halakhic definition to be registered as a "Jew". However, in a number of cases the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] has ordered the [[Ministry of Interior (Israel)|Ministry of Interior]] to register Reform and Conservative converts as Jews. The right of people who convert in the Diaspora under Reform or Conservative auspices to immigrate to Israel and claim citizenship as Jews is detailed in Israeli law.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://forward.com/articles/136245/ |title=Israeli Government Rejects Orthodox Converts' Bids To Immigrate as Jews |author=Nathan Jeffay |date=March 16, 2011 <!--issue of March 25, 2011--> |work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref>

Until recently, Israeli identity cards had an indication of nationality, and the field was left empty for those who immigrated not solely on the basis of being Jewish (i.e. as a child, grandchild or spouse of a Jew only) to indicate that the person may not be a Jew. Many Israeli citizens who are not recognised by the Rabbinate as Jewish have been issued with Israeli identity cards that do not include their Hebrew calendar birth date.

=== Outside Israel ===
In 2010 the Labour Court of South Africa addressed the question of who is a Jew for the purposes of the Employment Equity Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZALC/2010/218.html|title=Lewis v Media 24 Ltd (C88/2007) [2010] ZALC 218; (2010) 31 ILJ 2416 (LC) (4 May 2010)|access-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref> The question has also arisen in the United Kingdom, where religious schools are allowed to select all or a proportion of their intake based upon religion. A 2009 ruling, ''[[R(E) v Governing Body of JFS]]'', determined that the definition of Jewish religion based upon descent constituted discrimination on ethnic grounds, and therefore contravened racial discrimination laws. Also in the UK, under the [[Sunday Trading Act 1994]] "a person of the Jewish religion" who observes the Jewish Sabbath can open their shops on Sundays. The Act defines "person of the Jewish religion" as someone who holds a certificate that they are Jewish from a [[Rabbi]], [[synagogue]] secretary or the representative body of British Jewry, the [[Board of Deputies]].

== Other definitions ==
There have been other attempts to determine Jewish identity beside the traditional Jewish approaches. These range from [[genetics|genetic]] population studies{{efn|See ''[[Y-chromosomal Aaron]]''}} to controversial evolutionary perspectives including those espoused by [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] and [[Yuri Slezkine]]. Historians, such as the late [[Kamal Salibi]], have utilized [[etymology]] and geography to reconstruct the prehistoric origin of the Jewish people in the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Salibi, Kamal S. (1988). Secrets of the Bible People. New York: Interlink Books. p. 75 sqq. {{ISBN|0-940793-16-4}}</ref>

=== Sociology and anthropology ===

As with any other ethnic identity, Jewish identity is, to some degree, a matter of either claiming that identity or being perceived by others (both inside and outside the ethnic group) as belonging to that group, or both. Returning again to the example of Madeleine Albright—during her Catholic childhood, her being in some sense Jewish was presumably irrelevant. It was only after she was nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] that she, and the public, discovered her Jewish ancestry.

[[Ido Abram]] states that there are five aspects to contemporary Jewish identity:
#Religion, culture, and tradition.
#The tie with Israel and Zionism.
#Dealings with antisemitism, including issues of persecution and survival.
#Personal history and life-experience.
#Relationship with non-Jewish culture and people.<ref name=abram>[http://www.jhm.nl/exhibitions.aspx?ID=110 "What does it mean to be Jewish"], Jewish Historical Museum. Retrieved March 16, 2006.</ref><ref name=voudouris1>Monica Săvulescu Voudouris and Camil Fuchs, ''Jewish identity after the Second World War'', Editura Hasefer, Bucharest, 1999, p. 16. {{ISBN|973-9235-73-5}}</ref>

The relative importance of these factors may vary enormously from place to place. For example, a typical Dutch Jew might describe their Jewish identity simply as "I was born Jewish," while a Jew in [[Romania]], where levels of antisemitism are higher, might say, "I consider any form of denying as a proof of cowardice."<ref name=voudouris2>Monica Săvulescu Voudouris and Camil Fuchs (1999), p. 56.</ref>{{Clarify|date=June 2013}}

=== The Inquisition ===
During the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, conversion to Roman Catholicism did not result in total termination of the person's Jewish status. Legally, the converts were no longer regarded as Jews and thus allowed to stay in the Iberian Peninsula. During the Inquisition in Spain and [[Portugal]], however, many Jews were forced to convert, but thereafter were regarded by many people, though not in a legal form, as [[New Christian]]s, distinguishing them as separate from the Old Christians of non-Jewish lineage. Since legal, political, religious and social pressure pushed many people to untrue conversions (public behaviour as Christians while retaining some Jewish beliefs and practices privately, a kind of [[crypto-Judaism]]),{{efn|See [[Marrano]] and [[Anusim]]}} they were still treated with suspicion, a stigma sometimes carried for several generations by their identifiable descendants.
The ''[[limpieza de sangre]]'' ("Cleanliness of blood") required public officials or candidates for membership of many organizations to prove that they did not have Jewish or Muslim ancestry.

=== Secular philosophy ===

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who was not Jewish, suggested in ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]'' (1948) that Jewish identity "is neither national nor international, neither religious nor ethnic, nor political: it is a quasi-historical community." While Jews as individuals may be in danger from the antisemite who sees only "Jews" and not "people", Sartre argues that the Jewish experience of antisemitism preserves—even creates—the sense of Jewish community. In his most extreme statement of this view he wrote, "It is the anti-Semite who creates the Jew." Conversely, that sense of specific Jewish community may be threatened by the democrat who sees only "the person" and not "the Jew".

[[Hannah Arendt]] repeatedly asserted a principle of claiming Jewish identity in the face of antisemitism. "If one is attacked as a Jew, one must defend oneself as a Jew. Not as a German, not as a world-citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man, or whatever"; "A man attacked as a Jew cannot defend himself as an Englishman or a Frenchman. The world can only conclude from this that he is simply not defending himself at all."

Wade Clark Roof (1976), a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed that social sectors in [[modernity|modern life]], in which traditional symbols and rituals are meaningful, provide an alternative approach for explaining the social basis of religion in a secular order, in doing so, he turned to the local community as a sphere in modern society that still persists "as a complex system of friendship and kinship networks, formal and informal associations, as well as symbolic attachments, very much rooted in family life and ongoing socialization processes".<ref>Alice Goldstein, "Jews on the move: implications for Jewish identity'", in eds. [[Ivan Kalmar]] & [[Derek Penslar]], ''Orientalism and The Jews'', pp. 4. [[SUNY Press]], 1995 ({{ISBN|0-7914-2747-1}})</ref>

=== Antisemitic definitions ===

The question "who is a Jew?" is also sometimes of importance to non-Jews. Historically, it had exceptional significance when it was considered by anti-Jewish groups for the purpose of targeting Jews for [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] or discrimination. The definition can have an impact on whether a person may have a certain job, live in certain locations, receive a [[free education]], live or continue to live in specific countries, be [[prison|imprisoned]], or executed.

==== Nazism ====

The question was of critical importance during the rule of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi party in Germany]], which persecuted the Jews and defined them for the government's purposes by the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. In 2009, a United Kingdom court considered whether the question was a racial issue, in the case ''[[R(E) v Governing Body of JFS]]'' (2009).<ref>Nazi Germany's Nuremberg Laws sources:

The [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime instituted laws which discriminated against Jews, declared a race by the Nazis, and thus needed a working definition of who is a Jew as to its law-defined race system. These definitions almost completely categorised persons through the religions followed by each individual's ancestors, according to membership registries. Thus, personal faith or individual observance, as well as the religious definitions of Judaism as given by the [[Halacha]], were mostly ignored.

In Germany itself, the [[Ahnenpass]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws]] classified people as being of the Jewish race if they were descended from three or four grandparents enrolled in Jewish congregations. A person with one or two grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation could be classified as ''[[Mischling]]'',<ref>A Mischling was called ''Mischling of first degree'', or colloquially half-Jew, if they had two grandparents enrolled in a Jewish congregation, and ''Mischling of second degree'', or colloquially quarter-Jew, respectively, if they had one grandparent enrolled in a Jewish congregation.</ref> a crossbreed, of "mixed blood", if they were not a member of a Jewish congregation at the time the Nuremberg Laws were enacted. Only people with at least two of their grandparents of "German blood" could be German Reich's citizens, other Germans dropped into the new second class group of citizens, the so-called state citizens.<ref name="nurnberggesetz">[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Nuremberg_laws_Racial_Chart.jpg Nazi guide to the Nuremberg laws].</ref> If a person, with grandparents of the same religious combination, was enrolled as a member of a Jewish congregation in 1935 or would join later, they switched from the discriminatory class of Mischlinge into that of [[Geltungsjude]], "Jew by legal validity", despite of not fulfilling the no less law-defined discriminating criterion of descending from three or four Jewish grandparents. Whereas every Mischling could anytime drop into the class of Geltungsjude by joining a Jewish congregation, the Nuremberg Laws provided for the unchanged classification of any Geltungsjude, regardless if she or he tried to evade harm by seceding from the Jewish congregation after 1935, considering such secessions as being of no effect as to the discrimination. Let alone people with three or four Jewish grandparents who themselves could never alter their law-defined racial categorisation as Jews. After 1935, any Mischling with two Jewish grandparents colloquially called a half-Jew, who married anybody who was classified as a Jew would drop into the discriminated class which was called Geltungsjude. Mischlinge with one Jewish grandparent were usually forbidden from marrying anybody with any Jewish grandparents. The [[Mischling Test]] was introduced in order to identify Europeans with Jewish blood and those who were tested were considered "Jews of the first or second degree."

In the eyes of the Nazi government, one could not become a non-Jew by seceding from one's Jewish congregation, becoming non-practicing, marrying outside the religion, or converting to [[Christianity]]. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws forbade new marriages between people who were classified as Jews and people who belonged to other classifications.{{efn|See [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany]], ''[[Mischling]]e''}} Earlier contracted marriages between spouses of different classifications (so-called mixed marriages; Mischehe) provided the Jewish-classified spouse with uncertain protection from some discriminations and atrocities.

There were very few [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] in Europe during the Nazi era; most of them lived in [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and the [[Crimea]]. Karaites were not considered Jewish for the purpose of [[the Holocaust]] extermination policy;<ref>{{Cite book |author=Ruth Tsoffar |title=The Stains of Culture: An Ethno-Reading of Karaite Jewish Women |location=Detroit |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2006 |page=41}}</ref> according to SS Obergruppenführer Gottlob Berger, writing on November 24, 1944, discrimination against the Karaites had been prohibited due to their proximity to the Crimean [[Tatars]], to whom Berger views the Karaites as being related. Nazis still retained hostility towards the Karaites, on grounds of their religion; and there were a number of small scale massacres of Karaites.

In [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]], an ordinance defined a Jew as an individual who belonged to the Jewish religion or who had more than two Jewish grandparents.<ref name="Weisberg"/>

The [[Vichy France|Vichy régime]] in southern France defined a Jew as an individual with three Jewish grandparents or two grandparents if his/her spouse was Jewish. Richard Weisberg points out that this was a potentially broader classification than the one used in Occupied France, for example, a [[Mischling]] could not be classified a Jew under the Nazi dictate, by her/his spouse's classification if the marriage was contracted before the imposition of anti-Semitic marriage laws there, but would be deemed one under the Vichy act if he/she had married a Jew, regardless when.<ref name="Weisberg">Daniel C.

== Israelite identity loss claims ==
{{See also|Israelites|Ten Lost Tribes|Groups claiming affiliation with Israelites}}

There are various groups besides Jews which have claimed to be descended from the biblical [[Israelites]]. The question nowadays arises in relation to [[Israel]]'s [[Law of Return]], with various groups seeking to migrate there. Some claims have been accepted, some are under consideration, while others have been rejected by Israel's rabbinate.

=== Cochin Jews (Indian Jews) ===
{{See also|Cochin Jews}}

Some sources say that the earliest Jews of [[Cochin]], India were those who settled in the [[Malabar Coast]] during the times of [[Biblical account of King Solomon|King Solomon]] of Israel, and after the Kingdom of [[Israel]] split into two. There is historical documentation of the Jews being in Cochin after the fall of the Second Temple, from around the first century CE. Later additions were smaller immigration of Sephardic Jews from Europe in the sixteenth century after the expulsion from Spain, and [[Baghdadi Jews]], [[Arabic]]-speaking Jews who arrived in the late eighteenth century, at the beginning of the British colonial era.<ref>Katz 2000; Koder 1973; Thomas Puthiakunnel 1973; David de Beth Hillel, 1832; Lord, James Henry 1977.</ref> Following the independence of India and the establishment of [[Israel]], most Cochin Jews emigrated to Israel in the mid-1950s. Some have gone on to North America or Britain.

=== Bene Israel ===
{{See also|Bene Israel}}

The [[Bene Israel]] in India claim to be descended from Jews who escaped persecution in [[Galilee]] in the 2nd century BCE. The Bene Israel resemble the non-Jewish [[Marathi people]] in appearance and customs, which indicates some intermarriage between Jews and Indians. The Bene Israel, however, maintained the practices of Jewish [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], [[Brit milah|male circumcision]] and observation of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] as a day of rest. From the late eighteenth century, other Jewish communities instructed them in normative Judaism.

Initially, the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel said that the Bene Israel would have to undergo conversion in order to marry other Jews, as matrilineal descent could not be proven. In 1964 the Israeli Rabbinate declared that the Bene Israel are "full Jews in every respect".

The Bene Israel claim a lineage to the [[Kohen|Kohanim]], the Israelite priestly class, which claims descent from Aaron, the brother of Moses. In 2002, DNA testing revealed that the Bene Israel shared some genetic markers of the Kohanim. These are not exclusive to the Kohanim, but appear among them at a higher frequency. These are also shared with some non-Jewish Semitic peoples.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/16588182.cms |work=The Times of India |location=India | first1=Rashmee Z | last1=Ahmed | title=India's children of Israel find their roots | date=July 20, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Many of the Bene Israel emigrated from India to Israel, where around 6,000 Jews of this group reside. About 5,000 remain in India. They maintain 65 synagogues in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indjews.com/|title=Indian Jewish Community in Israel|publisher=indjews.com|access-date=July 26, 2015}}</ref>

=== Beta Israel ===
The [[Beta Israel]] or [[Falasha]] is a group formerly living in [[Ethiopia]] who have a tradition of descent from the lost tribe of [[Dan (biblical figure)|Dan]]. They have a long history of practicing such Jewish traditions as kashrut, Sabbath and Passover, and had Jewish texts. In 1975, their claim of Jewishness was accepted by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] and the Israeli government. The government assisted them in emigrating ''en masse'' to Israel during the 1980s and 1990s as Jews under the [[Law of Return]], when Ethiopia was undergoing a civil war. Some who claim to be Beta Israel still live in Ethiopia.

=== Bnei Menashe ===
The [[Bnei Menashe]] is a group in [[India]] claiming to be descendants of the half-tribe of [[Tribe of Menasheh|Menashe]]. Members who have studied Hebrew and who observe the Sabbath and other Jewish laws in 2005 received the support of the [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic]] [[Chief Rabbi of Israel]] to arrange formal conversion to Judaism. Some have converted and immigrated to Israel under the Law of Return.

=== The Kaifeng Jews ===
{{Details|History of the Jews in China}}

The [[Kaifeng Jews]], a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin-speaking]] group from [[Henan Province]], China, experienced first contact with Europeans in 1605 via the religious scholar [[Matteo Ricci]]. Modern researchers believe these Jews were descended from Persian merchants who settled in China during the early [[Song Dynasty]]. They prospered during the [[Ming Dynasty]] as Confucian civil servants, soldiers, and merchants, but they quickly assimilated and lost much of their Jewish heritage. By the beginning of the 19th century, the last rabbi with knowledge of Hebrew died, leaving no successor. The community had become extinct religiously by the late [[Qing Dynasty]] due to anti-foreign persecutions brought on by the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]]. There are a small number of Chinese people today who consider themselves to be descendants of these Jews.<ref>Xu, Xin. ''The Jews of Kaifeng, China: History, Culture, and Religion''. Jersey City, NJ: KTAV Pub. House, 2003.</ref>

Despite their isolation from the rest of the [[Jewish diaspora]], the Jews of Kaifeng preserved Jewish traditions and customs for many centuries. In the 17th century, assimilation began to erode these traditions. The rate of intermarriage between Jews and other ethnic groups, such as the [[Han Chinese]], and the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Manchu]] minorities in China, increased. The destruction of the synagogue in the 1860s led to the community's demise.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/992405.html|title = Taking the Silk Route back home|journal = [[Haaretz]]|first = Anshel|last = Pfeffer|date = June 27, 2008|access-date =December 28, 2009}}</ref> However, J.L. Liebermann, the first Western Jew to visit Kaifeng in 1867, noted that "they still had a burial ground of their own". S.M. Perlmann, the Shanghai businessman and scholar, wrote in 1912 that "they bury their dead in coffins, but of a different shape than those of the Chinese are made, and do not attire the dead in secular clothes as the Chinese do, but in linen".<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V4SmEW0WXCwC&q=german%20jewish%20china&pg=PA117|editor-first = Jonathan|editor-last = Goldstein|title = From Berlin To Tianjin|journal = The Jews of China|volume = 1|year = 1998|page = 117|isbn = 978-0-7656-0103-2|first = Heinz|last = Dawid}}</ref> To date, there is only one scholar, Zhou Xu, who doubts the Kaifeng community's Jewishness and claims them to have been a western construct.<ref>Xun Zhou, "The Kaifeng Jew Hoax: Constructing the 'Chinese Jews'", in eds. Ivan Kalmar & Derek Penslar, ''Orientalism and The Jews'', pp. 68–80. Brandeis University Press (USA), 2004 ({{ISBN|1-58465-411-2}})</ref>

Today, 600-1,000 residents of Kaifeng trace their lineage to this community.<ref name=autogenerated1/> After contact with Jewish tourists, the Jews of Kaifeng have reconnected to mainstream Jewry. With the help of Jewish organizations, some members of the community have emigrated to Israel.<ref name=autogenerated1/> In 2009, Chinese Jews from Kaifeng arrived in Israel as immigrants.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/10/26/1008728/descendants-of-chinese-jews-arrive-in-israel| title=Descendants of Chinese Jews arrive in Israel |work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=October 26, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chinese Jews from Kaifeng arrive in Israel 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edhtdoPukk0 |quote=A short documentary produced by Shavei Israel on the aliyah of Jews from Kaifeng China to Israel.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3936926,00.html |title=Kaifeng Jews study in Israeli yeshiva |author=Rebecca Bitton |date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>

=== The Lemba ===
{{see also|Jews and Judaism in Africa}}
The [[Lemba people|Lemba]], group of people from southern Africa, primarily [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]], speak the [[Bantu languages]] spoken by their geographic neighbours and resemble them physically, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]], which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition.<ref name="Magdel">{{Cite book|author= le Roux, Magdel|title=The Lemba – A Lost Tribe of Israel in Southern Africa?|pages=209–224, 24, 37 |publisher=University of South Africa|location=Pretoria|year=2003}}</ref> They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi= 10.1163/157430199X00100|title='Lost Tribes1 of Israel' in Africa?

=== New Mexico's Crypto-Jews ===
A small [[Hispanic|Hispano]] group of Sephardic Jews in northern [[New Mexico]] may be one of the oldest groups of practicing Jews in North America, dating back to the early Spanish settlers of Jewish descent who had been forcibly converted to Catholicism as [[Conversos]] or [[New Christians]], or both after 1492. Some families of Conversos began to settle in Mexico City in the 1530s and 1540s. Some converted back to Judaism; others maintained some Jewish beliefs and practices in secret. After the [[Spanish Inquisition]] came to the New World in 1571, the conversos were threatened with death if it was found they were practicing Judaism.

In 1598, the first expedition was made to New Mexico and included conversos.<ref name="wheelwright"/> After that, other conversos fled to the northwestern frontier of the [[Spanish Empire]],<ref name="latimes"/> today the American Southwest, to evade the scrutiny and threat of discovery in the more monitored settlements. Outwardly Catholic, these forced converts maintained Jewish practices and customs for generations in secret, hence their name, "[[Crypto-Jews]]". They have been the subject of recent academic study.<ref>Hordes, Stanley M. (2005). ''To The End of The Earth: A History of the Crypto-Jews of New Mexico,'' Columbia University Press. pp. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-231-12937-4}}.</ref> Some of New Mexico's Crypto-Jews have begun to return to normative Judaism in recent years, through study and ritual conversion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/29/national/29religion.html| work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Hispanics Uncovering Roots as Inquisition's 'Hidden' Jews | date=October 29, 2005}}</ref> Others feel enlarged by learning this part of their history but continue as practicing Catholics.

A genetic study of men in the early 2000s showed that many Hispanos of the American Southwest are descended from [[Anusim]] (Sephardic Jews who were forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism). Only Catholic Spanish were allowed to go to the New World with the exploration and colonial expeditions. Families first kept their secrets for protection and then out of habit. Michael Hammer, a research professor at the [[University of Arizona]] and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites possessed the male-specific "[[Y-chromosomal Aaron|Cohanim marker]]" or Cohen Modal Haplotype, which is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests. 30 of 78 Latinos tested in New Mexico (38.5%), were found to have Y-DNA with the Cohanim marker.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/05/nation/na-heritage5 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Kelly | title=DNA Clears the Fog Over Latino Links to Judaism in New Mexico | date=December 5, 2004}}</ref> Wider DNA testing of Hispanic populations has revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome associated with the Middle East. Their history makes it most likely that they are Jewish rather than Arabic Muslims.

In 2008, a [[BRCA mutation|gene mutation]] that is typically found only in [[Ashkenazi]] Jews, and is linked to a virulent form of breast cancer in women, was discovered in a cluster of Hispanic Catholic women in southern Colorado, many of whom trace their family's roots to northern New Mexico. It was conclusively shown to be related to Jewish ancestry, given the history of the people in the area, and many families reported knowledge of a high incidence of cancer. After testing and notification of families, researchers worked with the extended families on genetic counseling and to develop health strategies for monitoring, early detection and treatment, as they were faced with the higher risk associated with the gene.<ref name="wheelwright">{{Cite journal |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/san-luis-valley.html |title=The 'Secret Jews' of San Luis Valley |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |author=Jeff Wheelwright |date=October 2008}}</ref>

Other evidence of Jewish ancestry is language. According to a Jewish genealogy blog, so-called "Mountain Spanish", a Spanish [[dialect]] spoken by many of the old families of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado—and chiefly only among themselves—appears to be a form of [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino or Judezmo]]. This was a hybrid language that developed among Sephardic Jews in Iberia, from Old Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Hebrew]], with sprinklings of [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and other languages, depending on the geographic region of the speakers or their ancestors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tracingthetribe.blogspot.com/2009/10/turkey-ladino-newspaper.html |title=Turkey: A Ladino newspaper |work=Tracing the Tribe: The Jewish Genealogy Blog |date=October 9, 2009 |quote=In northern New Mexico, the descendants of Converso settlers who arrived as early as the late 16th century, still speak "Mountain Spanish." In reality, it is 16th century Ladino, and scholars who have visited them have been amazed at how well the language has been transmitted down through the generations.}}</ref>
