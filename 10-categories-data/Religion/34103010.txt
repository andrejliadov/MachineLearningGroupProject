{{short description|Danish theologian and evangelist}}
'''Johannes Monrad Aagaard''' (29 April 1928 â€“ 23 March 2007) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[theologian]] and [[Evangelism|evangelist]]. He was a professor of [[missiology]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] and was active in the [[Christian countercult movement]] as the founder of the [[Dialog Center International]], an international educational organization concerned with groups it defines as [[cult]]s and other [[new religious movement]]s.<ref>[http://www.cesnur.org/2007/aagaard.htm In memoriam: Johannes Aagaard (1928-2007)], [[Massimo Introvigne]],  [[CESNUR]], 2007</ref>{{better|date=December 2019}}<ref>''Contemporary missiology: an introduction'', Johannes Verkuyl, W. B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 1978, page 26</ref>

Aagaard had travelled to Asia and was concerned about [[Buddhism]] and other [[Eastern religions]], which he felt were gaining influence in Europe.<ref>''Sharing Jesus in the Buddhist world'', David S. Lim, Steve Spaulding. William Carey Library, 2003, pages 57-66</ref>  In 1973 Aagaard founded the Dialog Center  which was later greatly influential in promoting a negative public opinion of cults in Denmark and other European nations. He regarded [[Scientology]] as being especially dangerous, but later in his life stated that Islam was an even greater threat. Other concerns included [[Satanism]] and [[New Age]] groups.   Aagaard cooperated with both religious and secular anti-cultists, but opposed [[deprogramming]] of cult members since he felt that it was ineffective and often counterproductive. He retired from the Dialog Center in 2002.<ref>''Exploring New Religions'', [[George D.
