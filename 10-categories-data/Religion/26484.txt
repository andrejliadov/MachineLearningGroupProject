'''Religious pluralism''' is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of [[religion|religious]] [[belief system]]s co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:

* As the name of the worldview according to which one's own religion is not held to be the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions.
* As acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid, this may be considered a form of either [[toleration]] (a concept that arose as a result of the [[European wars of religion]]) or [[moral relativism]].
* The understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].
* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.
* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.
*As a [[social norm]] and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.<ref name="Silk 64–81">{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64–81

Religious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:<ref name="Beneke06-6">Beneke 2006: 6.</ref> "The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts."<ref name="Beneke06-6"/> In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from "a late eighteenth-century perspective".<ref name="Beneke06-5">Beneke 2006: 5.</ref> Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with "something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]".<ref name="Beneke06-6"/> Mark Silka, in "Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis", states that Religious pluralism "enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole."<ref name="Silk 64–81"/>

Religious pluralism can be defined as "respecting the otherness of others". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[Paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Of course, many religious communities have long been engaged in building peace, justice, and development themselves, and the emergence of the secular peacemaking field has led religious communities to systematize and institutionalize their own peacebuilding and interfaith work. The Catholic Church has worked in development and poverty reduction, human rights, solidarity, and peace, and after World War II, it began to develop specific tools and apply conflict transformation practices.<ref name="academia.edu">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/43891542/Pluralism_and_Democracy_in_Islam |title= Hamed Kazemzadeh: Pluralism and Democracy in Islam }}</ref>

Giving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.<ref name=meister>Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57</ref>

[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry}}</ref> Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].

==History==
{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}
[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]], which recognized two different churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]
[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].

German philosophers of religion [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] concluded that [[Eastern religions|Asian religious traditions]], in particular [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of [[Freedom of religion|freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith]] and develop a personal religious construct within it<ref name=meister2/><ref>Roof & McKinney (1985), ''Denominational America and the new religious pluralism'', The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 480(1), pp. 24-38</ref> (see also [[Buddhism and Hinduism|Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism]]); [[Jainism]], another [[Indian religions|ancient Indian religion]], as well as [[Daoism]] have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints.<ref name=meister2>Chad Meister (2010), ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp. 62-72</ref> The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the [[French Revolution]] ([[liberalism]], [[democracy]], [[civil and political rights]], [[freedom of thought]], [[separation of Church and State]], [[secularization]]), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and [[decline of Christianity]]. According to Chad Meister,<ref name=meister2/> these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.

{{Main|Baháʼí Faith and the unity of religion}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of [[Baháʼí Faith]], a religion that developed in Persia, having roots in Islam,<ref>{{Cite web|title=BBC - Religions - Bahai: Origins of Bahá'í history|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/history/origins_1.shtml|access-date=2020-11-04|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB}}</ref> urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and religion has been progressively revealed over time through [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestations of God]], the founders of religion. Bahá'u'lláh taught that Baháʼís must associate with peoples of all religions, whether this is reciprocated or not.

Baháʼís refer to this concept as [[Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)|Progressive revelation]], meaning that each religion brings a more advanced understanding of divinity and updated social laws as mankind matures. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], [[Báb]] and Bahá'u'lláh (the founder of the [[Baháʼí Faith]]) among them. According to Baháʼí writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.

==Buddhism==

The earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:

<blockquote>All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>

When asked, "Don’t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?" the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] said:<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a "Fashion"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.</ref>

<blockquote>
People from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don’t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.

In the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something… That is not healthy.

For individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.

I am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.

==Classical civilization: Greek and Roman religions==

For the Romans, [[Religion in Ancient Rome|religion was part of the daily life]].<ref>[[Jörg Rüpke]], "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances; in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Era]], as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgins]], who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|disbanded under Christian persecution and domination]].

The Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored. The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of [[augury]], since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.

[[Mystery religions]] imported from the [[Near East]] ([[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Parthian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]), which offered initiates [[Soteriology|salvation through a personal God]] and [[Afterlife|eternal life after the death]], were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[Sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of "[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|Senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC.

[[File:0 Relief représentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marble relief of [[Tauroctony|Mithras slaying the bull]] (2nd century, [[Louvre-Lens]]); [[Mithraism]] was among the most widespread [[mystery religions]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>G. W. Bromiley (ed.), ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', Vol. 4 (Eerdmans, 1988), p. 116. {{ISBN|0-8028-3784-0}}.</ref>]]
As the Romans extended their dominance throughout the Mediterranean world, their policy in general was to [[Interpretatio romana|absorb the deities and cults of other peoples]] rather than try to eradicate them,<ref>"This mentality", notes John T. Koch, "lay at the core of the genius of cultural assimilation which made the Roman Empire possible"; entry on "Interpretatio romana", in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.</ref> since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.<ref>Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," p. 4; Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; W.H.C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.</ref>

One way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by [[Freedom of religion|supporting their religious heritage]], building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local Gods.<ref>Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 261.</ref> By the height of the Empire, numerous [[Interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]] (among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Serapis]], [[Epona]]), and Gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]]. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]].<ref>A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State", in ''Classical Philology'', 81.4 (1986), pp. 285–297.</ref> The monotheistic rigor of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.

Some Christians<ref>[http://www.christians.eu/why-jesus/ Why Jesus?] Article stating that Jesus is the saviour and not Mohammed or Buddha—see second part of this article.</ref> have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept.

Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Most Christians hold this idea to be [[logic]]ally impossible from the [[Principle of contradiction]].<ref>[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003214003/http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html |date=2009-10-03 }} By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International</ref> The two largest Christian branches, the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Orthodox Church]], both claim to be the "[[one true church]]" and that "[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|outside the true Church there is no salvation]]"; Protestantism however, which has many different denominations, has no consistent doctrine in this regard, and has a variety of different positions regarding religious pluralism.

Other Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. [[John Macquarrie]], described in the ''Handbook of Anglican Theologians'' (1998) as "unquestionably [[Anglicanism]]'s most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century",<ref>p. 168, Timothy Bradshaw (1998), "John Macquarrie," in: Alister E. McGrath (ed). ''[https://books.google.com/books?client=firefox-a&cd=1&id=ZHzZAAAAMAAJ&dq=9780281051458&q=macquarrie#search_anchor The SPCK Handbook of Anglican Theologians]'' (pp. 167-168). London: [[SPCK]]. {{ISBN|978-0-281-05145-8}}</ref> wrote that "there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]] movement" (p.&nbsp;2).<ref name=macmediate>John Macquarrie (1996). ''Mediators between human and divine: From Moses to Muhammad''. New York: Continuum. {{ISBN|0-8264-1170-3}}</ref> In discussing 9 founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called "mediators between the human and the divine", Macquarrie wrote that:
<blockquote>
I do not deny for a moment that the truth of God has reached others through other channels - indeed, I hope and pray that it has. So while I have a special attachment to one mediator, I have respect for them all. (p. 12)<ref name=macmediate/>
</blockquote>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1977/10/respect-for-other-peoples-beliefs?lang=eng |title=Respect for Other People's Beliefs |first=Gerald E. |last=Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1977}}</ref>

===Classical Christian views===
Before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed "one holy catholic and apostolic church", in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that it alone is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.

Church unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of "validity" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as "[[heresy|heterodox]]" and "[[schism]]atic", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).

===Modern Christian views===
Some other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in "one" church, an "invisible church" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some [[evangelical]] Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this "invisible church", and usually they reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]], unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms "developmental theology," understood to mean that the "[[Holy Spirit]], in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the [[deposit of faith]] (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles--these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize [[baptism of desire]] quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14-16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: "When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires . . . . They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . . . .<ref>See Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), pp. 101-102.</ref> Various forms of "implicit faith" come to hold standing, until at [[Vatican Council II]], the Church declares: "Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration [[Nostra aetate]] addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them. Since Vatican Council II, Catholic dialogists in particular are working out the implications of [[John Paul II]]'s statement, in [[Redemptor hominis]] #6 that Christians should recognize "the Holy Spirit operating outside the visible confines of the [[Mystical Body of Christ]]." Among these dialogists, [[Robert Magliola]], an affiliate of the Italian community "Vangelo e Zen" ("The Gospel and Zen"), Desio and Milano, Italy, who taught in predominantly Buddhist cultures for years, and practiced Buddhist-Catholic dialogue there and in the West, and who is widely published in this dialogue, argues the following:
<blockquote>
If God has willed that all persons be saved (see [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] #851, quoting 1 Tim. 2:4) but has not sent the opportunity of Christian conversion to all, how can we not conclude that God wills those good Buddhists in this latter category to live, flourish, and die as good Buddhists? That God in His providence--at least for now--wants Buddhism to be the setting for millions of good and noble people in the world? (This does not mean that Catholics should not witness to the Catholic faith or even--on the proper occasions and in a courteous way--consider it their duty to preach Catholicism to Buddhists, and to teach it mightily. But it does mean that Catholics would do well to remember that God alone sends the grace of conversion when and to whom He wills.)<ref>Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up  to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), p. 116 and p. 142, where he applies the same reasoning to relations with other non-Christian religions.</ref>

While some claim that religious pluralism is controversial in Islam, Islamic civilizations have been characterized as one of the most religiously pluralist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/letters/2006/06/18/what-pluralism-means-to-islam/|title=What pluralism means to Islam - Letters {{!}} The Star Online|last1=Ch|first1=Guest Columnist Dr|last2=Muzaffar|first2=Ra|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref> The primary sources that guide Islam, namely [[Quran]] and [[hadith]]s, promote the fundamental right to practise an individual's belief, even though it may be a false belief.<ref>Cole & Hammond (1974), Religious pluralism, legal development, and societal complexity: rudimentary forms of civil religion, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 177-189</ref><ref name=mb>Michael Bonner (2008), Jihad in Islamic History: Doctrines and Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691138381}}, pp. 23-31</ref> The acceptability of religious pluralism within Islam remains a topic of active debate, however the vast majority of Islamic scholars and historical evidences reveal Islam's commitment to no coercion in religion, supporting pluralism. Hamed Kazemzadeh, a pluralist orientalist argues that cultural absolutism of ours is, of course, today under heavy pressure, a double pressure of defining and semi-bankrupt imperialism and surprisingly strong counter assertive challenge that changed the mentality of Muslims to have a pluralist identity.<ref name="academia.edu"/> Then he highlights the policy method of Islam Messenger in the early Islamic civilization toward other religions.

In several [[Sura]]h, Quran asks Muslims to remain steadfast with Islam, and not yield to the vain desires of other religions and unbelievers. These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, [[Al-Ma'ida|Surah Al-Ma'idah]] verses 47 through 49 state:
{{quote
|Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. ({{cite quran|5|47|end=49|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:
{{quote
|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt. And Allah knows the deeds that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; '''Our Allah and your Allah is one'''; and it is to Him we bow in Islam." And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the [[People of the Book]] believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. ({{cite quran|29|45|end=47|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:
{{quote
|This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: "O People of the Book! '''come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah'''; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah." If then they turn back, say ye: "Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah's Will. Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! ({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:
{{quote
|Say : O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}

Several verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):<ref name=mb/> 
{{quote|
A (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}

However, this verse has been explained.<ref>Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added</ref>
{{quote|
. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).}}

Bernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145–150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct "religious obligation", but suggests that "it is a pity" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:
{{quote|
Muslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays."{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}

In Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.
{{quote|
Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}

Some people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:
{{quote|
These Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}

In Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
{{quote|
Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way. They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): so take not friends from their ranks until they forsake the domain of evil in the way of God (from what is forbidden). But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (guarantees of) peace, then God hath opened no way for you (to war against them). Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto; if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them; in their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them ({{cite quran|4|88|end=91|style=nosup}}) }}

===Sufism===
The [[Sufi]]s were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at a certain point. Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[al-Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.<ref>http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/</ref> Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi's popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.

Rumi says:
<blockquote>
I looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. 
</blockquote>

Rumi also says:
<blockquote>
How many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.
</blockquote>

Rumi also says:
 <blockquote>
A true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,
be sure of that.
Since in the religion of Love,
there is no irreverence or faith.
When in Love,
body, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.
Become this,
fall in Love,
and you will not be separated again.
</blockquote>

===Ahmadiyya===
{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
Ahmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.

The Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:
"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America—all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam."<ref name="ReferenceA">"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur’an" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad. Part 2, Argument 4 Section labeled "A Grand Conception"</ref>

[[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] wrote in his book ''[[A Message of Peace]]'':
"Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America."<ref name="Mirza Ghulam Ahmad pg. 6">"A Message of Peace" by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, pg. 6</ref>

===In modern practice===
Religious pluralism is a contested issue in modern Islamic countries. Twenty three (23) Islamic countries have laws, as of 2014, which make it a crime, punishable with death penalty or prison, for a Muslim, by birth or conversion, to [[Apostasy|leave Islam]] or convert to another religion.<ref name=locplural>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/apostasy.pdf Laws Criminalizing Apostasy in Selected Jurisdictions] Library of Congress, US Government (May 2014)</ref><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php Laws Criminalizing Apostasy] Library of Congress (2014)</ref><ref>Doi, Abdur Rahman (1984), Shari`a: The Islamic Law; Taha Publishers; London UK</ref> In Muslim countries such as [[Algeria]], it is illegal to preach, persuade or attempt to convert a Muslim to another religion.<ref>Law No. 02-06 (bis), al Jarida al Rasmiyya, vol.12, 1 March 2006</ref> [[Saudi Arabia]] and several Islamic nations have strict laws against the construction of Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas anywhere inside the country, by anyone including minorities working there.<ref name=meister/> [[Brunei]] in southeast Asia adopted [[Sharia]] law in 2013 that prescribes a death penalty for any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion.<ref name=locplural/> Other Islamic scholars state Sharia does not allow non-Muslim minorities to enjoy religious freedoms in a Muslim-majority nation, but other scholars disagree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamnewsroom.com/news-we-need/329-yusuf-estes-correcting-quran-misquotes|title=Islam News Room - Yusuf Estes Corrects QURAN Mis-Quotes|first=Ansar Al|last=Adl|website=islamnewsroom.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Mawdudi, S.

==Jainism==
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
''Anekāntavāda'', the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of [[Jainism]]. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref>Dundas (2002) p.231</ref><ref>Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp.400-7</ref> Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]]—the omniscient beings—can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.91</ref> Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth—only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the "[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.<ref name = hughes>Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1</ref> For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of ''ekānta'' (one-sidedness).<ref name="The Metaphysics of Paradox">{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm. Andrew |title=The Metaphysics of Paradox: Jainism, Absolute Relativity, and Religious Pluralism |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-1-4985-6392-5 |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498563925/The-Metaphysics-of-Paradox-Jainism-Absolute-Relativity-and-Religious-Pluralism}}</ref> Openness to the truths of others is one way in which Jainism embodies religious pluralism.

==Sikhism==
{{See|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}
The [[Sikh gurus]] have propagated the message of "many paths" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them.

The [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, says:
{{quote|Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.|  Guru Granth Sahib page 1350<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1350&english=t&id=57718|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref>}}

As well as:
<blockquote>
Some call the Lord "Ram, Ram", and some "Khuda". Some serve Him as "Gusain", others as "Allah". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885)<ref>{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=885|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
One who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142)<ref>{{cite web|title=pluarism in sggs|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=142|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)
</blockquote>

The Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that "peoples of other faiths" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.

Additionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:
<blockquote>
First, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| 
<ref>{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1349&english=t&id=57707#l57707}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Again, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:
<blockquote>
[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] ("word") lose their ego and class consciousness. ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 67)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=67&english=t&id=2722|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref> 
</blockquote>

Most of the 15 [[Sikh Bhagats]] who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.

The pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words ''Na koi hindu na koi musalman'' - "There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim". He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.

Sikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar]], who on the pleas of a [[pandit]] of the [[Kashmiris]], agreed to fight against a tyrannic [[Moghul Empire]] (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.

==Religious pluralism and human service professions==
The concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.<ref name=p97/><ref name=zp>Brian J. Zinnbauer & Kenneth I. Pargament (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=2995869&site=ehost-live Working with the sacred: Four approaches to religious and spiritual issues in counseling]. ''Journal of Counseling & Development'', v78 n2, pp162-171. ISSN 0748-9633</ref><ref name=nf/> For example, [[psychologist]] [[Kenneth Pargament]]<ref name=p97>Kenneth I. Pargament (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=Vn5XObcpnd4C&dq=pargament+pluralistic&q=pluralism#v=snippet&q=pluralism&f=false The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice]''. New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}</ref> has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:

<blockquote>
...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path "up the mountain of God," the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)<ref name=zp/>
</blockquote>

Importantly, "the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy" (p.&nbsp;168).<ref name=zp/> The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as "should religious issues be discussed in counseling?", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&nbsp;362, Table 12.1).<ref name=p97/>

The profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: "With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative" (p.&nbsp;182).<ref name=nf>Nils Friberg (2001).
