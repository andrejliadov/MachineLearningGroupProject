== History ==
The manor was previously owned by [[William the Conqueror]] of 1066. William gave the house to Walter De Turberville and his family stayed for 145 years. Turberville granted the manor to the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1210–1211. At that time Ansty would have been one of only a handful of places where the holy observances were still celebrated, since the Knights Hospitallers, who answered directly to Rome, were excluded from [[Pope Innocent III]]'s [[Interdict#England|interdict (1208–1214)]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.achurchnearyou.com/ansty/|title=Ansty: St James, Ansty|last=|first=|date=|website=achurchnearyou|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
