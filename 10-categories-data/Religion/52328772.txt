The '''1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras''' occurred in the aftermath of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], when the [[Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghan Emirate]] signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]]. Afghan King [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] set out to bring the [[Turkistan]], [[Hazarajat]] and [[Kafiristan]] regions under his control. He launched several campaigns in the Hazarajat due to resistance from the [[Hazaras]], and he conducted a [[genocide]] which included killing and raping of Hazaras. Sixty percent of the total Hazara population was killed or displaced with thousands fleeing to [[Quetta]] and other adjoining areas. The Hazara land was distributed among Pashtun villagers. Hazara women and old men were sold as slaves, and many young Hazara girls were kept as concubines by Afghan kings.<ref>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazara-2</ref> Abdur Rahman arrested Syed Jafar, chief of the [[Sheikh Ali (Hazara tribe)|Sheikh Ali]] Hazara tribe, and jailed him in [[Mazar-e-Sharif]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} The repression after the uprising has been called the most significant case of [[genocide]] in the history of modern [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=afghanstaterebellion>{{cite book |last1=Ibrahimi |first1=Niamatullah |title=The Hazaras and the Afghan State Rebellion, Exclusion and the Struggle for Recognition |date=2017 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hazaras_and_the_Afghan_State/cp1YDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=genocide}}</ref>

==First uprising==
The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived and crushed as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat. Leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras had allies in two different groups, [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. Abdur Rahman took advantage of the situation, pitting Sunni Hazara against the Shia Hazara, and made pacts among the Hazara.

After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to [[Kabul]], opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses.<ref name="Iranica"/> People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan [[nomad]]s ([[Kuchis]]).<ref name=Mousavi/>

==Second uprising==
The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison.<ref name="Iranica"/> Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion, which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "[[jihad]]" against the Shias <ref>{{cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Afghanistan : Hazaras|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d693d.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> and raised an army of up to 40,000 soldiers, 10,000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of whom were Pashtun nomads).<ref name="Iranica"/> He also brought in [[British Raj|British]] military advisers to train his army.<ref name=Mousavi>{{cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5}}</ref>

The large army defeated the rebellion at its center, in [[Oruzgan Province|Oruzgan]], by 1892 and the local population was displaced with some being [[List of genocides by death toll|massacred]]. {{quote|"thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir".<ref name="Iranica"/>|S. A. Mousavi}}

Abdur Rahman ordered that all weapons of the Hazara be confiscated and for Sunni Mullahs to impose Sunni interpretation of Islam.<ref name=afghanstaterebellion>{{cite book |last1=Ibrahimi |first1=Niamatullah |title=The Hazaras and the Afghan State Rebellion, Exclusion and the Struggle for Recognition |date=2017 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hazaras_and_the_Afghan_State/cp1YDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=genocide}}</ref>
