The Arabic singular form ''dar'' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:دار#Arabic|دار]]}}), translated literally, may mean "house", "abode", "structure", "place", "land", or "country". In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] it often refers to a part of the world.

===Dar al-Harb===
'''''Dar al-Harb''''' ({{lang-ar|دار الحرب|links=no}} "house of war"). Dar al-Harb is a term classically referring to those countries which do not have a treaty of nonaggression or peace with Muslims (those that do are called Dar al-'Ahd or Dar al-Sulh).<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e490?_hi=17&_pos=3|title=Dar al-Harb|work=oxfordislamicstudies.com}}</ref>

According to [[Majid Khadduri]], the fundamental distinction between ''Dar al-Islam'' and ''Dar al-Harb'' was introduced after the defeat of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732 which prevented the expansion of Islam to the north, while at the same time the expansion of the caliphate to the east had been halted.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4v4cCgAAQBAJ&q=732|title= Muslims and Modernity: Current Debates|author= Clinton Bennet|publisher= [[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year= 2005|page= 158|isbn= 9781441100504|author-link= Clinton Bennet}}</ref>

[[Wahbah al-Zuhayli]] argues that the concept of Dar al-Harb is mostly historical: "The existence of Dār al-Islām and Dār al-Ḥarb in contemporary times is rare or extremely limited. This is because Islamic countries have joined the United Nations covenant that stipulates that the relationship between nations is peace and not war. Therefore non-Muslim countries are Dār al-‘Ahd …"<ref>Al-Zuhaylī, Al-Mu‘āmalāt al-Māliyyah, p. 255.</ref>

'''Dar al-'Ahd''' ({{lang-ar|دار العهد|links=no}} "house of truce") or '''Dar al-[[Sulh]]''' ({{lang-ar|دار الصلح|links=no}} "house of conciliation/treaty") are terms used for territories that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims.<ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/>

This designation can be found in the Quran, where Muslims are directed on how they should act in war:

"Excepting those who join a people between whom and you there is a treaty, or such as come to you with hearts reluctant to fight you, or to fight their own people. Had Allah wished, He would have imposed them upon you, and then they would have surely fought you. So if they keep out of your way and do not fight you, and offer you peace, then Allah does not allow you any course [of action] against them." [https://quran.com/4/90 Quran 4:90]
