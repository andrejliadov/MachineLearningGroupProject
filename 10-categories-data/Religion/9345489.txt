"'''How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?'''" (alternatively ''"How many [[angel]]s can ''stand'' on the ''point'' of a [[pin]]?"''<ref name=Bartleby/>) is a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' challenge to medieval [[scholasticism]] in general, and its [[Christian angelology|angelology]] in particular, as represented by figures such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name="Summa"/><ref>Kennedy, D. J., [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14698b.htm "Thomism"], in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'')</ref> It is first recorded in the 17th century, in the context of [[Protestant]] apologetics. It also has been linked to the [[fall of Constantinople]], with the [[imagery]] of scholars debating while the Turks besieged the city.<ref name=TodaysZaman>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213014807/http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|archive-date=2014-12-13|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/op-ed_how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin-by-mouhanad-halwani-_270236.html|title=How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?|publisher=Today's Zaman}}</ref><ref name=Ramirez>{{Cite book|title = Las Andanzas Del Diablo: Confidencias de un Abogado Ingenuo|last = Ramírez|first = José A.|publisher = Editorial Planeta|year = 1975|isbn = 9788432053375|pages = 58|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oHQnr2oRRocC&q=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler&dq=%22sexo+de+los+angeles%22+alfiler}}</ref>

In modern usage, the term has lost its [[theological]] context and is used as a [[metaphor]] for wasting time debating topics of no practical value, or questions whose answers hold no intellectual consequence, while more urgent concerns accumulate.<ref name=Bartleby>{{cite book | title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy | editor= Hirsch, E.

==Origin==
[[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written {{circa|1270}}, includes discussion of several questions regarding angels such as, "Can several angels be in the same place?"<ref name="Summa">{{Citation | title = Summa | publisher = New advent | url = http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1052.htm#article3}}.</ref> However, the idea that such questions had a prominent place in medieval scholarship has been debated, and it has not been proved that this particular question was ever disputed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Asselt|first= Willem J | author-link = Willem van Asselt |title= Introduction to Reformed Scholasticism | year= 2011|page= 65}}</ref> One theory is that it is an [[early modern]] fabrication,{{Efn | More precisely, in play in the 17th century, and discussed at various levels by the [[Cambridge Platonists]] [[Ralph Cudworth]] and [[Henry More]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].}} used to discredit scholastic philosophy at a time when it still played a significant role in university education. [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] has raised the scholarly issue, and mentions that there is a 17th-century reference in [[William Chillingworth]]'s ''Religion of Protestants'' (1637),<ref>Franklin 1993 p. 127.</ref> where he accuses unnamed scholastics of debating "whether a Million of Angels may not fit upon a Needle's point?<!--original capitalization; see MOS:QUOTE-->"
This is earlier than a reference in the 1678 ''The True Intellectual System Of The Universe'' by [[Ralph Cudworth]]. [[Helen S. Lang]], author of ''Aristotle's Physics and its Medieval Varieties'' (1992), says (p.&nbsp;284):

{{quote|The question of how many angels can dance on the point of a [[Sewing needle|needle]], or the head of a pin, is often attributed to 'late medieval writers'.... In point of fact, the question has never been found in this form…}}

[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] (2016) has suggested that the first reference to angels dancing on a needle's point occurs in an expository work by the English divine, [[William Sclater]] (1575–1626). <ref name=phar>[[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]], [http://nq.oxfordjournals.org/content/63/1/45.full.pdf+html "Angels on Pinheads and Needles’ Points"], ''Notes and Queries'', 63 (2016), 45–47.</ref>
In ''An exposition with notes upon the first Epistle to the Thessalonians'' (1619), Sclater claimed that scholastic philosophers occupied themselves with such pointless questions as whether angels "did occupie a place; and so, whether many might be in one place at one time; and how many might sit on a Needles point; and six hundred such like needlesse points." <ref>William Sclater, 'An Exposition with Notes Upon the First and Second Epistles to the Thessalonians'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSdhvqsGDSQC&pg=PA385 p 385.] (Google Books)</ref>
Harrison proposes that the reason an English writer first introduced the "needle’s point" into a critique of medieval angelology is that it makes for a clever pun on "needless point".<ref name=phar/>

A letter written to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1975<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sylla |first1=E. D. |year=2005 |chapter=Swester Katrei and Gregory of Rimini: Angels, God, and Mathematics in the Fourteenth Century |editor1-last=Koetsier |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Bergmans |title=Mathematics and the Divine: A Historical Study |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMOQZfrZq-EC&pg=PA251&dq=%22heaven+a+thousand+angels+can+stand%22#q=%22heaven%20a%20thousand%20angels%20can%20stand%22 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |page=251 |isbn=0444503285 |access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref> identified a close parallel in a 14th-century [[mystical]] text, the ''[[Swester Katrei]]''. However, the reference is to souls sitting on a needle: ''tusent selen siczen in dem himelrich uff einer nadel spicz'' — "in heaven a thousand souls can sit on the point of a needle."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=George MacDonald |title=Angels |journal=Philosophy |date=October 1985 |volume=60 |issue=234 |pages=495–511 |doi=10.1017/S0031819100042534 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/philosophy/article/angels/0CECE579523EFAF532F62F3ED40F3932}}</ref>

Other possibilities are that it is a surviving parody or self-parody, or a training topic in debating.
