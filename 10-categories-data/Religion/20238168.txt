During the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the Dalai Lama escaped to [[India]], where he currently lives in exile while remaining the most important spiritual leader of Tibet. The Dalai Lama advocates for the welfare of Tibetans while continuing to call for the [[Protests and uprisings in Tibet since 1950#Middle Way Approach|Middle Way Approach]] to negotiations with China for the autonomy of Tibet and the protection of Tibetan culture, including for the religious rights of Tibetans. 

The Dalai Lama also meets with other world leaders, and travels giving Tibetan Buddhist teachings. His work includes focus on the [[environmental quality|environment]], [[economics]], [[women's rights]], [[nonviolence]], [[interfaith dialogue]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[Buddhism and science]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[reproductive health]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

Along with his teachings on Tibetan [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, the Dalai Lama's Kalachakra teachings and initiations are international events.

The Dalai Lama is a recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] awarded in 1989, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal|US Congressional Gold Medal]] in 2006.

Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new [[incarnation]] when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old.<ref name=bell397>Bell 1946, p. 397.</ref> [[Sir Basil Gould]], British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related his account of the north-eastern team to Sir [[Charles Alfred Bell]], former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the [[thirteenth Dalai Lama]], at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which his successor would be found. The [[Regent]], [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], shortly afterwards had a [[vision (religion)|vision]] at the sacred lake of [[Lhamo La-tso]] which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang [[Rinpoche]], went first to meet the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama]], who had been stuck in [[Jyekundo]], in northern Kham.<ref name=bell397 /> The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.<ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265">Laird 2006, p. 265.</ref> He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates. Within a year the Panchen Lama had died. Two of his three candidates were crossed off the list but the third, a "fearless" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in the vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great [[Kumbum Monastery]] with its gilded, turquoise roof. There they found a house, as interpreted from the vision—the house where Lhamo Thondup lived.<ref name=bell397 /><ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" />

The 14th Dalai Lama claims that at the time, the village of [[Taktser]] stood right on the "real border" between the region of [[Amdo]] and China.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 262–263.</ref> When the team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. He held an old [[Buddhist prayer beads|mala]] that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said "if you know who I am, you can have it." The child said "Sera Lama, Sera Lama" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests. One test consisted of showing him various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the [[13th Dalai Lama]] and one which had not. In every case, he chose the Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 265–266.</ref>

From 1936 the Hui '[[Ma Clique]]' Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled [[Qinghai]] as its governor under the nominal authority of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] central government.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&q=ma+bufang+paintings&pg=PA36|title=Beyond the Great Wall: urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|author=Piper Rae Gaubatz|year=1996|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|page=36|isbn=0-8047-2399-0|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Ma Bufang had [[Sino-Tibetan War|seized this north-east corner of Amdo]] in the name of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of [[Qinghai]].<ref>Laird 2006, p. 262.</ref> Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects.<ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /> When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, he had the family brought to him in Xining.<ref>Mullin 2001, p. 459.</ref> He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one, told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.<ref name=bell398>Bell 1946, p. 398.</ref> Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them, to let them go to Lhasa.<ref name=bell398 /><ref>Richardson 1984, p. 152.</ref> Kewtsang managed to raise this, but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the Kumbum Monastery; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself, he said.<ref>Bell 1946, pp. 398–399.</ref>

Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army.<ref>Richardson 1984, pp. 152–153.</ref> Meanwhile, the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas.<ref name=laird267>Laird 2006, p. 267.</ref> The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa.<ref name=laird267 /><ref name=rich153>Richardson 1984, p. 153.</ref> The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection; Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessions.<ref name=rich153 />

Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup, now 4 years old, riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939.<ref>Laird 2006, pp. 268–269.</ref> The ordination ([[pabbajja]]) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by [[Reting Rinpoche]].

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (''Wish-Fulfilling Gem''), Kyabgon (''Saviour''), or just Kundun (''Presence'').

Historically the Dalai Lamas or their [[regent]]s held political and religious leadership over [[Tibet]] from [[Lhasa]] with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720–1912).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W. Jr.|title=Tibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relations|date=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New Delhi|isbn=0-8133-3155-2|pages=107–149}}</ref>

During the Dalai Lama's recognition process, the cultural Anthropologist Goldstein writes: 
{{quote|everything the Tibetans did during the selection process was designed to prevent China from playing any role.<ref name="Powers">{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=The Buddha Party: How the People's Republic of China Works to Define and Control Tibetan Buddhism}}</ref>}}

Afterwards in 1939, at the age of four, the Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The traditional ceremony enthroning the 14th Dalai Lama was attended by observing foreign dignitaries after a traditional Tibetan recognition processes. Despite historical records of eyewitness accounts, China's [[Kuomintang]] government later presented false claims to have ratified the Dalai Lama, and that a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. 

The British representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]], who was also at the enthronement ceremony, disputes the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: 
{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.<ref>Bell 1946, p. 400.</ref>}}

Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, and wrote that the word "主持 (preside or organize)" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. He added that Wu Zhongxin spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.<ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997_preside">{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133–}}</ref>

In October 1950 the army of the [[People's Republic of China]] marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in [[warlord]]-controlled [[Kham]]. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama assumed full temporal (political) power as ruler of Tibet.<ref name="dlce" />

The [[Panchen Lama]] and Dalai Lama had many conflicts throughout Tibetan history. Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which ratified the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]].

He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.

The Dalai Lama appealed to the [[United Nations]] on the rights of Tibetans.

At the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] in 1987 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic "zone of peace" without [[nuclear weapons]], and with support for [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plan would come to be known as the "Strasbourg proposal", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at [[Strasbourg]] on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China." This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/05/china.lukeharding Interview] with ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 September 2003</ref> In the 1970s, the [[Paramount leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he "must [come back] as a Chinese citizen  ... that is, patriotism".<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/01/content_10921943_3.htm |title = Origin of the title of "Dalai Lama" and its related background |date = 1 March 2009 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |first=Jiang|last=Yuxia |publisher = [[Xinhua]]}}</ref>

In his essay "The Ethic of Compassion" (1999), the Dalai Lama expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to "cultivate love." He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dalai Lama XIV|title=The Ethic of Compassion.|date=1999|publisher=Riverhead Books|pages=123–31}}</ref>

Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers, the Dalai Lama has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of his time and resources investigating the interface between [[Buddhism and science]] through the ongoing series of [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind and Life]] dialogues and its spin-offs than on any other single activity.<ref name=Grnd /> As the institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues, which continue to expand worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title = Dialogues with the Dalai Lama |url = https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/ |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015 |quote = These Dialogues will expand as Mind and Life grows to include Europe, Asia, and beyond}}</ref>

In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities & Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology.<ref name="pdf" />

In his 2005 book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' and elsewhere, and to mark his commitment to scientific truth and its ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader the Dalai Lama advises his Buddhist followers: "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = The Universe in a Single Atom |date = 2005 |publisher = Random House|location=New York |isbn =978-0-375-72845-7 |page = 3|edition=First Large Print}}</ref> He has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas he has abandoned himself on this basis.<ref name="nyt" /><ref>{{cite web|author1=James Kingsland |title = Dalai Lama enlightens and enraptures contemplative scientists in Boston |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/nov/03/dalai-lama-scientists-boston-international-symposium-contemplative-studies |work = The Guardian|location=Boston, USA |date = 3 November 2014 |quote = He   ... had long since abandoned Buddhist ideas about cosmology after reading about the findings of modern astronomers}}</ref>

These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a Professor of Religion took place in Beijing.

=== Democracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India ===

[[File:Vienna 2012-05-26 - Europe for Tibet Solidarity Rally 194 HH sequence s.jpg|thumb|Tenzin Gyatso in Vienna, Austria, in&nbsp;2012]]

The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of [[nonviolence]] and religious harmony throughout the world. "I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over." He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century.

The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try [[vegetarianism]] or at least reduce their consumption of meat.

=== Environment ===
The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about [[environmental problem]]s, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment. He has pointed out that many rivers in Asia [[Geography of Tibet|originate in Tibet]], and that the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|melting of Himalayan glaciers]] could affect the countries in which the rivers flow.<ref name="global">{{Cite news |url = https://www.smh.com.au/environment/think-global-before-local-dalai-lama-20091130-k17b.html |title = Think global before local: Dalai Lama|first=Joyce|last=Morgan |date = 1 December 2009 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> He acknowledged official Chinese laws against [[deforestation]] in Tibet, but lamented they can be ignored due to possible [[Corruption in the People's Republic of China|corruption]].<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Dalai_Lama_bemoans_deforestation_of_Tibet_999.html |title = Dalai Lama bemoans deforestation of Tibet|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date = 21 November 2007 |accessdate = 28 August 2010}}</ref> He was quoted as saying "ecology should be part of our daily life";<ref>{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/DalaiLama_2006_09_19 |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Address to the University at Buffalo |accessdate = 2 May 2010|date = 19 September 2006 }}</ref> personally, he takes showers instead of baths, and turns lights off when he leaves a room.<ref name="global" /> Around 2005, he started campaigning for [[wildlife conservation]], including by issuing a religious ruling against wearing tiger and leopard skins as garments.<ref>{{Cite news |title = Dalai Lama Campaigns to End Wildlife Trade |date = 8 April 2005 |publisher = ENS |url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2005/2005-04-08-01.asp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title = Reports Fur Flies Over Tiger Plight |author = Justin Huggler |work = The New Zealand Herald|date = 18 February 2006 |url = http://www.tew.org/archived/wildlife.skins.issue.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013141142/http://tew.org/archived/wildlife.skins.issue.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 13 October 2007 }}</ref> The Dalai Lama supports the [[anti-whaling]] position in the [[whaling controversy]], but has criticized the activities of groups such as the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] (which carries out acts of what it calls aggressive nonviolence against property).<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2010/2010-06-23-02.html |title = Dalai Lama Reminds Anti-Whaling Activists to Be Non-Violent|location=Tokyo |date = 23 June 2010 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |agency=[[Environment News Service]]}}</ref> Before the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], he urged national leaders to put aside domestic concerns and take collective action against [[climate change]].<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AT16B20091130 |title = Dalai Lama says climate change needs global action|location=Sydney |date = 30 November 2009 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |work=[[Reuters]]|first=Michael|last=Perry}}</ref>

=== Sexuality ===

A monk since childhood, the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and "more independence, more freedom".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Dalai-Lama-Sex-spells-trouble-20081128 |title=Dalai Lama: Sex spells trouble |date=28 November 2008 |agency=[[News24.com]]}}</ref> He has said that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder.<ref name=Teleg>{{cite news |author =  GMT 2|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3534994/Sexual-intercourse-spells-trouble-says-Dalai-Lama.html |title = Sexual intercourse spells trouble, says Dalai Lama |work = The Telegraph|date = 29 November 2008 |accessdate = 2 May 2010|location=London}}</ref> He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery.<ref name="foxsports1">{{cite web |url = http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/The-Dalai-Lama-comments-on-Tiger-Woods%2527-scandal?GT1=39002 |title = The Dalai Lama comments on Tiger Woods' scandal |work = FOX Sports |date = 20 February 2010 |accessdate = 9 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505160519/http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/The-Dalai-Lama-comments-on-Tiger-Woods'-scandal?GT1=39002 |archive-date=5 May 2010}}</ref>

In his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior, he explains the concept of "right organ in the right object at the right time", which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, he also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are [[gay]] or [[transgender]] from a secular point of view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd2.htm|title=Buddhism and homosexuality|website=religioustolerance.org}}</ref> In a 1994 interview with ''[[OUT Magazine]]'', the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying, "If someone comes to me and asks whether [[homosexuality]] is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay.'"<ref>OUT Magazine February/March 1994</ref> However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor [[Evan Solomon]] on ''[[CBC News: Sunday]]'' about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that "it is sexual misconduct".<ref>{{cite web|website=HuffPost|date=13 July 2009|title=Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-shaheen/gay-marriage-what-would-b_b_230855.html|first=James|last=Shaheen}}</ref>

In his 1996 book ''Beyond Dogma'', he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else ... Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."<ref>''Beyond Dogma'' by the Dalai Lama</ref> He elaborated in 1997, explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him. He also conveyed his own "willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context".<ref>"Dalai Lama Urges 'Respect, Compassion, and Full Human Rights for All', including Gays". Conkin, Dennis. ''Bay Area Reporter'', 19 June 1997.</ref>

In 2006, the Dalai Lama has expressed concern at "reports of violence and discrimination against" [[LGBT people]] and urged "respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |title=His Holiness The Dalai Lama Issues Statement in Support of Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People |publisher=International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) |location=Geneva |date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=20 November 2013 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623030316/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |archivedate=23 June 2013 }}</ref>

=== Women's rights ===

In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman: "If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form."<ref>{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1571850/Dalai-Lama-says-successor-could-be-a-woman.html |title = Dalai Lama says successor could be a woman |work = The Telegraph|date = 7 December 2007 |accessdate = 19 November 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2009, on [[gender equality]] and sexism, the Dalai Lama proclaimed at the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]: "I call myself a [[feminist]]. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for [[women's rights]]?" He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate "based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children". He called on women to "lead and create a more compassionate world", citing the good works of nurses and mothers.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html |title = Tamara Conniff: The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis |work = HuffPost|date = 23 September 2009 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, he said in a [[BBC]] interview that if a female succeeded him, "that female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use," and when asked if he was joking, replied, "No. True!"

=== Health ===

In 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], the Dalai Lama said that "Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities."<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/dalai-lama-culture-of-com_n_3111216.html |title = Dalai Lama 'Culture of Compassion' Talk: Key To Good Health Is 'Peace of Mind' (VIDEO) |work = HuffPost|date = 18 April 2013}}</ref>

==== Response to COVID-19 ====
In a 2020 statement in ''Time'' magazine on the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Dalai Lama said that the pandemic must be combated with compassion, empirical science, prayer, and the courage of healthcare workers. He emphasized "emotional disarmament" (seeing things with a clear and realistic perspective, without fear or rage) and wrote: "The outbreak of this terrible coronavirus has shown that what happens to one person can soon affect every other being. But it also reminds us that a compassionate or constructive act – whether working in hospitals or just observing social distancing – has the potential to help many."<ref>https://time.com/5820613/dalai-lama-coronavirus-compassion/</ref><ref>

=== Immigration ===
In September 2018, speaking at a conference in [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]] home to a large [[Immigration to Sweden|immigrant population]], the Dalai Lama said "I think Europe belongs to the Europeans", but also that Europe was "morally responsible" for helping "a refugee really facing danger against their life". He stated that Europe has a responsibility to refugees to "receive them, help them, educate them", but that they should aim to return to their places of origin and that "they ultimately should rebuild their own country".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=12 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-to-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=13 September 2018}}</ref>

Speaking to German reporters in 2016, the Dalai Lama said there are "too many" refugees in Europe, adding that "Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country." He also said that "Germany is Germany".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/31/the-dalai-lama-says-too-many-refugees-are-going-to-germany/|title=The Dalai Lama says 'too many' refugees are going to Germany|last=https://www.facebook.com/max.bearak|website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/migrant-crisis-dalai-lama-says-germany-cannot-become-an-arab-country-20160601-gp8mhr.html|title=Migrant crisis: Dalai Lama says Germany 'cannot become an Arab country'|first=Max|last=Bearak|date=31 May 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

== Retirement and succession plans ==

In May 2011, the Dalai Lama retired from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]].<ref>{{cite news |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Remarks on Retirement – March 19th, 2011 |url = http://dalailama.com/messages/retirement/retirement-remarks |accessdate = 14 September 2014 |date = 19 March 2011}}</ref>

In September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement concerning his [[reincarnation]]:
<blockquote>When I am about ninety I will consult the high Lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, the Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, and re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue or not. On that basis we will take a decision. If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama's Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China.<ref>[http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on the Issue of His Reincarnation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002812/http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation |date=4 February 2013 }} [http://www.dalailama.com/ Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet] 24 September 2011.</ref></blockquote>

In October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian [[CTV News]]. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. "Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter," he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he has not decided on whether he would reincarnate or be the last Dalai Lama.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = CTV |title = CTV Exclusive: Dalai Lama will choose successor |date = 3 October 2011 |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |accessdate = 27 June 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101945/http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |archive-date = 6 October 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In an interview with the German newspaper ''Welt am Sonntag'' published on 7 September 2014 the Dalai Lama stated "the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose", and that "We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries.

His administration's reception of CIA funding has become one of the grounds for some state-run [[Chinese newspapers]] to discredit him along with the [[Tibetan independence movement]].

In his autobiography ''[[Freedom in Exile]]'', the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA again for supporting the [[Tibetan independence movement]] "not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all [[communist]] [[Executive (government)|governments]]".<ref>{{cite news |title = CIA Gave Aid to Tibetan Exiles in '60s, Files Show |url = https://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/15/news/mn-22993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = 8 September 2013 |quote = In his 1990 autobiography, 'Freedom in Exile', the Dalai Lama explained that his two brothers made contact with the CIA during a trip to India in 1956.

The [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese press]] has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the International Buddhist Conference in [[Gujarat]] saying that he was "Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality" and referral to himself as a "son of India" in particular led the ''[[People's Daily]]'' to opine, "Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?"<ref name="heart">{{Cite news |url = http://chinatibet.people.com.cn/6876597.html |title = A look at the Dalai Lama's ridiculous Indian heart |date = 22 January 2010 |accessdate = 17 August 2010 |publisher = China Tibet Information Center }}</ref> Dhundup Gyalpo of the ''[[Tibet Sun]]'' replied that Tibetan religion could be traced back to [[Nalanda]] in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese "apart  ... from a handful of culinary dishes".<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |title = Why is the Dalai Lama "son of India"? |first = Dhundup |last = Gyalpo |location = Dharamshala |date = 9 February 2010 |accessdate = 18 August 2010 |publisher = [[Tibet Sun]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053610/http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |archive-date = 17 July 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref> The ''People's Daily'' stressed the links between [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and accused the Dalai Lama of "betraying [[South Tibet|southern Tibet]] to India".<ref name="heart" /> In 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory India claims and administers as part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is part of India, citing the disputed [[Simla Accord (1914)|1914 Simla Accord]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Tawang is part of India: Dalai Lama |publisher = TNN |date = 4 June 2008 |url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Tawang_is_part_of_India_Dalai_Lama_/articleshow/3097568.cms |accessdate = 4 June 2008}}</ref>

=== Shugden controversy ===
{{Main|Dorje Shugden controversy}}
The Dorje Shugden Controversy reappeared in the Gelug school by the publication of the ''Yellow Book'' in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of ''Dorje Shugden'' against Gelugpas who also practiced [[Nyingma]] teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an "inclusive" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Mills|2003}}{{sfn|Kay|2004}} started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978.{{sfn|Kay|2004|p=47}}

The controversy has attracted attention in the West because of demonstrations held in 2008 and 2014 by Dorje Shugden practitioners. A 2015 [[Reuters]] investigation determined "that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party" and that the "group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing's long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama".<ref>Lague, David.

=== Gedhun Choekyi Nyima ===
In April 2018, the [[Dalai Lama]] confirmed the official Chinese claims about [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] by saying that he knew from "reliable sources" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education. He said he hoped that the Chinese-recognised Panchen Lama ([[Gyaincain Norbu]]) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation.<ref>[https://www.thestatesman.com/india/11th-panchen-lama-alive-receiving-education-dalai-lama-1502627372.html 11th Panchen Lama alive, receiving education: Dalai Lama], ''The Statesman'', 25 April 2018: "Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Wednesday said 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima "according to reliable source is alive and receiving normal education". Talking to the media at Gaggal Airport in Kangra district after returning from four-day Delhi visit, Lama hoped that the official Panchen Lama studies well under the guidance of a good teacher. "Then the Panchen Lama, which I recognised sometime back, there was no news, but then according to reliable information, he is still alive and receiving normal education. So we will see," he said. He said there are instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, "where a reincarnated lama took more than one manifestation"."</ref><ref>Dr. Andrea Galli, [https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/05/09/dalai-lama-and-the-panchen-lama-quarrel-the-way-for-rapprochement-with-china/ Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama quarrel: The way for rapprochement with China], ''Modern Diplomacy'', 9 May 2018.</ref>
