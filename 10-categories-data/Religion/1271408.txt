'''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''' ('''Α''' or '''α''') and '''[[omega (letter)|omega]]''' ('''Ω''' or '''ω''') are the first and last letters of the [[Greek alphabet]], and  a title of [[Christ (title)|Christ]] and [[God]] in the [[Book of Revelation]]. This pair of letters is used as a [[Christian symbolism|Christian symbol]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Gauding | first = Madonna | title = The Signs and Symbols Bible: The Definitive Guide to Mysterious Markings | publisher = Sterling Pub.

==Origin==
The term ''Alpha and Omega'' comes from the phrase "I am the Alpha and the Omega" ([[Koiné Greek]]: "ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ"), an appellation of Jesus and of the Father in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase ("I am the Alpha and the Omega") is first found in Chapter 1 verse 8 ("1:8"), and is found in every [[manuscript]] of Revelation that has 1:8. Several later manuscripts repeat "I am the Alpha and the Omega" in 1:11 too, but do not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, [[Sinaitic Palimpsest|Sinaitic]], and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to "I am the Alpha and the Omega" in 1:11, the "oldest [manuscripts] omit" it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Robert|title=Young's Concise Commentary on the Holy Bible|page=180|date= 1977}}</ref>

A similar reference is in [[Isaiah 44#Verse 6|Isaiah 44]],<ref>{{bibleref2|Isaiah|44:6-8|NKJV}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/InterlinearGreekEnglishSeptuagintOldTestamentPrint | page = [https://archive.org/details/InterlinearGreekEnglishSeptuagintOldTestamentPrint/page/n2431 2432] | title = Interlinear Greek English Septuagint Old Testament (LXX) | language = grc, en }}</ref> where the Lord says to be the first and the one who is after all.

==Christianity==
[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] (Α) and [[omega (letter)|omega]] (Ω) are the first and last letters, respectively, of the classical (Ionic) [[Greek alphabet]]. Thus, the phrase "I am the alpha and the omega" is further clarified with the additional phrase, "the beginning and the end" in Revelation 21:6, 22:13. The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet were used because the book of Revelation is in the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek.

This phrase is interpreted by many Christians{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} to mean that [[Jesus]] has existed for all eternity or that God is eternal.  Though many commentators and dictionaries ascribe the title "the alpha and the omega"  to both God and to [[Christ (title)|Christ]],<ref>''The New Bible Dictionary'', edited by Alton Bryant; ''Bible Dictionary'' by Wm. Smith; and the ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia''</ref> some secular sources argue otherwise. ''Barnes' Notes on the New Testament'' (1974) claims: "It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here ... There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such."<ref>''Notes on the New Testament, Explanatory and Practical'' by Albert Barnes. 1956, 1962, 1974. {{ISBN|978-0825422003}}</ref> Most Christian denominations also teach that the title applies to both Jesus and his Father.

The letters Alpha and Omega, in juxtaposition, are often used as a Christian visual symbol (see examples). The symbols were used in [[early Christianity]] and appear in the Roman [[catacombs]]. The letters were shown hanging from the arms of the cross in [[Early Christian art]], and some [[crux gemmata]], jeweled crosses in precious metal, have formed letters hanging in this way, called [[pendilia]]; for example, in the [[:File:Escudo de Asturias.svg|Asturian coat of arms]], which is based upon the Asturian [[Victory Cross]]. In fact, despite always being in Greek, the letters became more common in Western than [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian art.  They are often shown to the left and right of Christ's head, sometimes within his [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], where they take the place of the [[Christogram]] used in Orthodox art.

==Judaism==
In [[Hebrew]], the word ''emet''  (אמת, meaning "truth"), is referred to as the "[[Seal (emblem)|Seal]] of God."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yoma 69b:7-8|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69b.7-8|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Shabbat 55a:12|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.55a.12|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bereishit Rabbah 81:2|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.81.2|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref> [Cf. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Isaiah 44:6|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.44.6|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>] The word is composed of the first, middle, and last letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].

==Islam==
The [[Qur'an]] gives ''al'Awwal'' (الأول), meaning "The First" and ''al'Akhir'' (الآخر), meaning "The Last" as two of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|names]] of [[God in Islam|God]]: {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}}.

==APL programming language==

Some dialects of the [[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]] support the [[direct function]] syntax where the left (optional) and right arguments are denoted by the letters alpha and omega. For example, the following function computes the sum of the left argument and twice the right argument:
<syntaxhighlight lang=apl>
{⍺+2×⍵}
</syntaxhighlight>
