'''Christian apologetics''' ({{lang-el|ἀπολογία}}, "verbal defence, speech in defence")<ref>{{cite web|title=ἀπολογία|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627|work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon|access-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> is a branch of [[Christian theology]] that defends [[Christianity]] against objections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01618a.htm|title=Meaning of apologetics|website=Catholic Encyclopedia|access-date=5 November 2016}}</ref> 

Christian [[apologetics]] has taken many forms over the centuries, starting with [[Paul the Apostle]] in the [[Early Christianity|early church]] and [[Patristic]] writers such as [[Origen]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Tertullian]], then continuing with writers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury]] during [[Scholasticism]].  

[[Blaise Pascal]] was an active Christian apologist before the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In the modern period, Christianity was defended through the efforts of many authors such as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[C. S. Lewis]], as well as [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].   

In contemporary times, Christianity is defended through the work of figures such as [[Norman Geisler]], [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Robert Barron]], [[Scott Hahn]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[John Lennox]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Hugh Ross (astrophysicist)|Hugh Ross]], [[James White (theologian)|James White]], [[Gary Habermas]], [[Frank Turek]], [[R. C. Sproul]] and [[William Lane Craig]].

==History==

=== Jewish Precursors ===
According to [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]] in the first century CE Jewish apologetic elements could be seen in works such as [[The Wisdom of Solomon]], [[Philo]]'s ''On the Contemplative Life'' and more explicitly in [[Josephus]]' ''[[Against Apion]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A History of Early Christian Literature|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofearlych0000good|url-access=registration|last=Goodspeed|first=Edgar J.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1966|isbn=0226303861|location=Chicago|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofearlych0000good/page/93 93]-100}}</ref>

=== Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Period ===
Christian apologetics first appear in the New Testament (e. g. Paul's preaching on Mars Hill in Acts 17:22-31). During the [[Apostolic Fathers|subapostolic]] age Christianity was already competing with Judaism as well as with various other religions and sects in the Greco-Roman world. Christian apologetics can be first seen in the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Preaching of Peter<nowiki>''</nowiki> ([[Gospel of Peter]]), but the first explicitly apologetic work comes from [[Quadratus of Athens]] (c. 125 CE) in which he writes a defense of the faith to emperor [[Hadrian]]. Only a fragment, quoted by [[Eusebius]], has survived to our day:<ref name=":0" /><blockquote>"But the works of our Saviour were always present, for they were genuine:—those that were healed, and those that were raised from the dead, who were seen not only when they were healed and when they were raised, but were also always present; and not merely while the Saviour was on earth, but also after his death, they were alive for quite a while, so that some of them lived even to our day." (''Church History'' iv. 3. 2)</blockquote>One of the first comprehensive attacks on Christianity came from the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]], who wrote ''[[The True Word]]'' (c.175 CE), a polemic criticizing Christians as being unprofitable members of society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferguson|first1=Everett|title=Backgrounds of Early Christianity|url=https://archive.org/details/backgroundsearly00ferg|url-access=limited|date=1993|publisher=William B.

=== The Middle Ages and Early Modern Period ===
[[Anselm of Canterbury]] propounded the ontological argument in his ''[[Proslogion]]''. [[Thomas Aquinas]] presented five ''ways'', or arguments for God's existence, in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', while his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'' was a major apologetic work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|title=A History of Apologetics|year=2005|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0898709334|pages=120}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Classical Readings in Christian Apologetics|year=1983|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=031045641X|editor=L Russ Bush|page=275}}</ref> Aquinas also made significant criticisms of the ontological argument which resulted in its losing popularity until it was revived by Rene Descartes in his ''[[Meditations]]''.<ref>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/</ref> [[Blaise Pascal]] outlined an approach to apologetics in his ''[[Pensées]]'': "Men despise religion; they hate it and fear it is true. To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true."<ref>{{cite book|last=Pascal|first=Blaise|title= Pensées|trans-title=Thoughts|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pascal/pensees.i.html|page=187}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Groothuis|first=Douglas|title=Christian Apologetics|year=2011|publisher=IVP Academic|location=Downers Grove|isbn=978-0830839353|pages=25–31}}</ref>

=== Late Modern Period ===
Christian apologetics continues in modern times in a wide variety of forms. Among the Roman Catholics there are [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Bishop Robert Barron]], [[G. K. Chesterton]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Chesterton|first=G K|title=The Everlasting Man|year=2008|publisher=Wilder Publications|location=Radford|isbn=978-1604592467|page=180}}</ref> [[Ronald Knox]], [[Taylor Marshall]], [[Arnold Lunn]], [[Karl Keating]], [[Michael Voris]], [[Peter Kreeft]], [[Frank Sheed]], [[Scott Hahn|Dr. Scott Hahn]], and [[Patrick Madrid]]. The [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[Seraphim Rose]] is perhaps the best known modern, English speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] apologist. Among the Evangelicals there is the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[C. S. Lewis]] (who popularized the argument now known as [[Lewis's trilemma]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=C S|title=Mere Christianity|url=https://archive.org/details/merechristianity00csle_1|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=HarperSan Francisco|location=San Francisco|isbn=0060652888|pages=[https://archive.org/details/merechristianity00csle_1/page/54 54–56]|edition=HarperCollins|chapter=The Shocking Alternative}}</ref> Among Protestant apologists of the 19th century there was [[William Paley]] who popularized the [[Watchmaker analogy]]. In the first half of the 20th century, many [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] became well known apologists. Some of the best known are [[R. A. Torrey]] and [[John Gresham Machen]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Norman Geisler, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[John Warwick Montgomery]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Francis Schaeffer]] were among the most prolific Christian apologists in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st, while [[Gordon Clark]] and [[Cornelius Van Til]] started a new school of philosophical apologetics called [[presuppositional apologetics|presuppositionalism]], which is popular in [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] circles.

Others include [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Hugo Anthony Meynell]], [[Timothy J. Keller]], [[Francis Collins]], [[Vishal Mangalwadi]], [[Richard Bauckham]], [[Craig A. Evans|Craig Evans]], [[Darrell Bock]], [[John F. MacArthur]], [[Michael R. Licona]] and [[John Lennox]].

==Terminology and origin==
The original Greek ''[[apologia]]'' (ἀπολογία, from ἀπολογέομαι, ''apologeomai'', "speak in return, defend oneself") was a formal verbal defense, either in response to accusation or prosecution in a court of law.  The defense of [[Socrates]] as presented by [[Apology (Plato)|Plato]] and [[Apology (Xenophon)|Xenophon]] was an ''apologia'' against charges of "corrupting the young, and … not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other [[daemon (classical mythology)|''daimonia'']] that are novel".<ref>Plato, ''Apology'' 24b; compared to Christian apologetics by Anders-Christian Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies—Some Definitions," in ''Continuity and Discontinuity in Early Christian Apologetics'' (Peter Lang, 2009), p. 14.</ref>

In later use 'apologia' sometimes took a literary form in early Christian discourse as an example of the integration of educated Christians into the cultural life of the [[Roman Empire]], particularly during the [[Little Peace of the Church|"little peace" of the 3rd century]],<ref>Kevin Butcher, ''Roman Syria and the Near East'' (Getty Publications, 2003) p. 378.</ref> and of their participation in the Greek intellectual movement broadly known as the [[Second Sophistic]].<ref>Graham Anderson,  ''The Second Sophistic: A Cultural Phenomenon in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 1993, 2003), p. 203.</ref> The Christian apologists of the early Church did not reject [[Greek philosophy]], but attempted to show the positive value of Christianity in dynamic relation to the Greek rationalist tradition.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 6.''</ref>

In the 2nd century, apologetics was a defense or explanation of Christianity,<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 8.''</ref> addressed to those standing in opposition and those yet to form an opinion, such as [[Roman emperor|emperors]] and other authority figures, or potential converts.<ref name="Jacobsen p. 14">Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14.''</ref> The earliest [[Acts of the Martyrs|martyr narrative]] has the spokesman for the persecuted present a defense in the apologetic mode: Christianity was a rational religion that worshiped only God, and although Christians were law-abiding citizens willing to honor the emperor, their belief in a single divinity prevented them from taking the loyalty oaths that acknowledged the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|emperor's divinity]].<ref>Maureen A. Tillby, "North Africa", in ''Cambridge History of Christianity: Origins to Constantine'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), vol. 1, p. 388, citing the ''[[Scillitan Martyrs|Martyrum Scillitanorum Acta]]''.</ref>

The apologetic [[historiography]] in the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' presented Christianity as a religious movement at home within the Roman Empire and no threat to it and was a model for the first major [[church history|historian of the Church]], Eusebius.<ref>Margaret M. Mitchell, "Gentile Christianity," p. 107, and "Emergence of the Written Record" p. 193, in ''Cambridge History of Christianity'', vol. 1.</ref> Apologetics might also be directed to Christians already within the community explain their beliefs and justify positions.<ref name="Jacobsen p. 14"/> [[Origen]]'s apologetic ''[[Celsus|Contra Celsum]]'', for instance, provided a defense against the arguments of a critic dead for decades to provide answers to doubting Christians lacking immediate answers to the questions raised. Apologetic literature was an important medium for the formation of early Christian identity.<ref>Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' p. 14 ''et passim''.''</ref>

In addition to Origen and Tertullian, early Christian apologists include [[Justin Martyr]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and the author of the [[Epistle to Diognetus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Apologetics|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=0898709334|location=San Francisco|pages=31–42}}</ref> [[Augustine of Hippo]] was a significant apologist of the [[Patristics|Patristic]] era.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Apologetics|last=Dulles|first=Avery Robert Cardinal|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=0898709334|location=San Francisco}}</ref> Some scholars regard apologetics as a distinct [[literary genre]] exhibiting commonalities of style and form, content, and strategies of [[argumentation]]. Others viewed it as a form of [[discourse]] characterized by its [[Tone (literature)|tone]] and purpose.<ref name="Jacobsen pp. 19">Jacobsen, "Apologetics and Apologies,'' pp. 19–20.''</ref>

===Biblical basis===
R. C. Sproul, quoting the [[First Epistle of Peter]], writes that "The defense of the faith is not a luxury or intellectual vanity. It is a task appointed by God that you should be able to give a reason for the hope that is in you as you bear witness before the world."<ref>{{cite book|title=Defending Your Faith|last=Sproul|first=R C|publisher=Crossway Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4335-0315-3|location=Wheaton|page=9}}</ref> The verse quoted here reads in full: "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect."<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Peter 3:15}}</ref>

Another passage sometimes used as a biblical basis for Christian apologetics is God's entreaty in the [[Book of Isaiah]]: "Come now, let us reason together."<ref>{{bibleref2|Isaiah 1:18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Christian Apologetics|last=Geisler|first=Norman L|publisher=Baker Book House|year=1988|isbn=0-8010-3822-7|edition=Paperback|location=Grand Rapids|pages=[https://archive.org/details/christianapologe00norm/page/n154 11]–12|url=https://archive.org/details/christianapologe00norm|url-access=limited}}</ref> Other scriptural passages which have been taken as a basis for Christian apologetics include [[Psalm 19]], which begins "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands,"<ref>{{bibleref2|Psalms 19:1}}</ref> and [[Romans 1]], which reads "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse."<ref>{{bibleref2|Romans 1:20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Reason and Worldviews|last=Anderson|first=Owen|publisher=University Press of America|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7618-4038-1|location=Plymouth, U.K.|page=2}}</ref>

==Varieties==
There are a  variety of Christian apologetic styles and schools of thought. The major types of Christian apologetics include historical and legal evidentialist apologetics, presuppositional apologetics, philosophical apologetics, prophetic apologetics, doctrinal apologetics, biblical apologetics, moral apologetics, and scientific apologetics.

===Biblical apologetics===
Biblical apologetics include issues concerned with the authorship and date of biblical books, [[biblical canon]], and [[biblical inerrancy]]. Christian apologists defend and comment on various books of the Bible. Some scholars who have engaged in the defense of biblical inerrancy include [[Robert Dick Wilson]], [[Gleason Archer]], Norman Geisler and [[R. C. Sproul]]. There are several resources that Christians offer defending inerrancy in regard to specific verses.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Authors defending the reliability of the Gospels include [[Craig Blomberg]] in ''The Historical Reliability of the Gospels'',<ref>{{cite book|title=The Historical Reliability of the Gospels|last=Bloomberg|first=Craig|publisher=Inter-Varsity Press|year=1987|isbn=0-87784-992-7|location=Downeres Grove}}</ref>  Mark D.

Evans|Craig Evans]] and [[Darrell Bock]].

Other old Earth creationists, such as astrophysicist [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], see each of the six days of creation as being a long, but finite period of time, based on the multiple meanings of the Hebrew word ''[[yom]]'' (day light hours/24 hours/age of time) and other Biblical creation passages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reasons.org/interpreting-genesis/other-creation-passages/response-genesis-and-big-bang|title=Response to Genesis and the Big Bang by Gerald Schroeder|author=Ross, Hugh|author2=Endara, Miguel|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Reasons To Believe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christian-knowledge.com/forums/genesis-chapter1/day-genesis-t8.html|title=Day 1 (Genesis 1:1-5)|author=Russell, Ryan|work=Genesis: verse-by-verse Bible Study|publisher=Christian Knowledge|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724071849/http://www.christian-knowledge.com/forums/genesis-chapter1/day-genesis-t8.html|archive-date=24 July 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=3 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Experiential apologetics===
Experiential apologetics is a reference to an appeal "primarily, if not exclusively, to experience as evidence for Christian faith."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geisler, Normal L.|year=1999|title=Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics|publisher=Baker Academic|place=Grand Rapids, MI}}</ref> Also, "they spurn rational arguments or factual evidence in favor of what they believe to be a self-verifying experience." This view stresses experience that other apologists have not made as explicit, and in the end, the concept that the Holy Spirit convinces the heart of truth becomes the central theme of the apologetic argument.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lewis, Gordon R.|year=1990|title=Testing Christianity's Truth Claims: Approaches to Christian Apologetics|publisher=University Press of America Inc.|place=Lanham, MD}}</ref>

===Historical and legal evidentialism===
A variety of arguments has been forwarded by legal scholars such as [[Simon Greenleaf]]  and [[John Warwick Montgomery]], by expert forensic investigators such as cold case homicide detective [[J. Warner Wallace]], and academic historical scholars, such as [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]]. These arguments present a case for the historicity of the [[resurrection of Christ]] per current legal standards of evidence or undermining the pagan myth hypothesis for the origin of Christianity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/greenleaf.html|title=Testimony of the Evangelists|last=Greenleaf|first=Simon|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissart1.htm|title=Evidence for Faith|last=Montgomery|first=John Warwick|publisher=Canadian Institute for Law, Theology, and Public Policy|year=2004|isbn=1896363172|location=Edmonton|chapter=The Jury Returns: A Juridical Defense of Christianity|editor=John Warwick Montgomery|access-date=8 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201174627/http://www.mtio.com/articles/bissart1.htm|archive-date=1 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ankerberg.com/Articles/apologetics/AP0302W3.htm|title=Could the Evidence Stand-Cross Examination in a Modern Court of Law?|last=Ankerberg|first=John|publisher=Ankerberg Theological Research Institute|work=The Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ|access-date=8 May 2012|author2=John Weldon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023015751/http://ankerberg.com/Articles/apologetics/AP0302W3.htm|archive-date=23 October 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Case Christianity|last=Wallace|first=J.

Evidence for the historicity of the A. N. Sherwin-White states:

{{quote|For Acts, the confirmation of historicity is overwhelming. Acts is, in simple terms and judged externally, no less of a propaganda narrative than the Gospels, liable to similar distortions. But any attempt to reject its basic historicity, even in matters of detail, must now appear absurd. Roman historians have long taken it for granted.... The agnostic type of form-criticism would be much more credible if the compilation of the Gospels were much later in time.... Herodotus enables us to test the tempo of myth-making, [showing that] even two generations are too short a span to allow the mythical tendency to prevail over the hard historic core.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin-White|first=A N|title=Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament|year=1963|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=189–190}}</ref>}}

===Moral apologetics===
{{see also|Divine command|Biblical law in Christianity||}}
Moral apologetics states that real moral obligation is a fact. Catholic apologist [[Peter Kreeft]] said, "We are really, truly, objectively obligated to do good and avoid evil."<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Christian Apologetics|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|publisher=Intervarsity Press|year=1994|isbn=0-8308-1774-3|location=Downers Grove|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofchrist00kree/page/72 72]|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofchrist00kree/page/72}}</ref> In moral apologetics, the arguments for man's sinfulness and man's need for redemption are stressed. Examples of this type of apologetic would be [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]'s sermon "[[Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/e/edwards/sermons/sinners.html|title=Select Sermons - Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}</ref> The [[Four Spiritual Laws]] religious tract (Campus Crusade for Christ) would be another example.<ref>[http://www.greatcom.org/laws/ The Four Spiritual Laws – English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Philosophical apologetics===
Philosophical apologetics concerns itself primarily with [[arguments for the existence of God]], although they do not exclusively focus on this area. They do not argue for the veracity of Christianity over other religions but merely for the existence of a [[Creator god|Creator]] [[deity]]. Omnipotence and omniscience are implied in these arguments to greater or lesser degrees: some argue for an interventionist god, some are equally relevant to a [[Deism|Deist]] conception of God.

They do not support [[hard polytheism]], but could be used to describe the first god who created many other gods; however, the arguments are only relevant when applied to the first god (the [[Primum movens|first cause]], [[Actus purus|pure act]] and [[unmoved mover]]; it is a contradiction ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' to suppose a plurality of "pure acts" or "first causes" or "unmoved movers").

These arguments can be grouped into several categories:

#[[Cosmological argument]] – Argues that the existence of the universe demonstrates that God exists. Various primary arguments from cosmology and the nature of causation are often offered to support the cosmological argument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godevidences.net/space/lawsofscience.php|title=Evidences for God from Space<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=27 August 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050802090327/http://godevidences.net/space/lawsofscience.php|archive-date=2 August 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2329 Apologetics Press – "So Long, Eternal Universe; Hello Beginning, Hello End!"<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112035608/http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2329 |date=12 November 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/Area/isd/wanser.asp|title=Keith H. Wanser, Physics}}</ref>
#[[Teleological argument]] – Argues that there is a purposeful design in the world around us, and a design requires a designer. [[Cicero]], [[William Paley]], and [[Michael Behe]] use this argument as well as others.<ref>[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v22/i2/design.asp A brief history of design<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051121160325/http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v22/i2/design.asp |date=21 November 2005 }}</ref>
#[[Ontological argument]] – Argues that the very concept of God demands that there is an actual existent God.
#[[Argument from morality|Moral Argument]] – Argues that there are objectively valid moral values, and therefore, there must be an absolute from which they are derived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/god-ethi.html|title=Morality Apart From God: Is It Possible?}}</ref>
#[[Transcendental argument for the existence of God|Transcendental Argument]] – Argues that all our abilities to think and reason require the existence of God.
#[[Presuppositional apologetics|Presuppositional Arguments]] – Argues that the basic beliefs of theists and nontheists require God as a necessary precondition.

Other philosophical arguments include:

*[[Alvin Plantinga]]'s argument that belief in God is properly basic, [[reformed epistemology]].<ref>[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Intellectual Sophistication and Basic Belief in God<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225232043/http://origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html |date=25 December 2005 }}</ref>

Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbD0B2HcTn4C&pg=PA155|title=History of Philosophy: Descartes to Leibniz|last=Copleston|first=Frederick Charles|year=1958|isbn=0809100681|page=155}}</ref><ref name="hammond">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hast|url-access=registration|title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|last=Hammond|first=Nicholas|year=2000|isbn=9780198600244|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hast/page/518 518]|chapter=Blaise Pascal|editor=Hastings|display-editors=etal}}</ref>

In addition to arguments for the existence of God, Christian apologists have also attempted to respond successfully to arguments against the existence of God. Two very popular arguments against the existence of God are the hiddenness argument and the argument from evil. The hiddenness argument tries to show that a perfectly loving God's existence is incompatible with the existence of nonresistant nonbelievers. The argument from evil tries to show that the existence of evil renders God's existence unlikely or impossible. 

====Presuppositional apologetics====
{{Main article|Presuppositional apologetics}}

Presuppositional apologetics is a [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] methodology which claims that [[presupposition (philosophy)|presuppositions]] are essential to any philosophical position and that there are no "neutral" assumptions from which a Christian can reason in common with a non-Christian.<ref name="Presup">{{cite encyclopedia|author=John M. Frame|url=http://www.frame-poythress.org//frame_articles/2005Presuppositional.htm| title=Presuppositional Apologetics|encyclopedia=New Dictionary of Christian Apologetics|editor1=W. C. Campbell-Jack |editor2=Gavin J. McGrath |editor3=C. Stephen Evans |publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8308-2451-9 |access-date=12 March 2007}}</ref> There are two main schools of presuppositional apologetics, that of [[Cornelius Van Til]] (and his students [[Greg Bahnsen]] and [[John Frame (philosopher)|John Frame]]) and that of [[Gordon Haddon Clark]].

Van Til drew upon but did not always agree with, the work of Dutch [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] philosophers and theologians such as [[D. H. Th. Vollenhoven]], [[Herman Dooyeweerd]], [[Hendrik G. Stoker]], [[Herman Bavinck]], and [[Abraham Kuyper]]. Bahnsen describes Van Til's approach to Christian apologetics as pointing out the difference in ultimate principles between Christians and non-Christians and then showing that the non-Christian principles reduce to absurdity.<ref>Greg Bahnsen, ''Van Til's Apologetic'', P&R Publishing, 1998, {{ISBN|0-87552-098-7}}, pp. 275–77.</ref> In practice, this school utilizes what has come to be known as the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].

Clark held that the Scriptures constituted the [[axiom]]s of Christian thought, which could not be questioned, though their consistency could be discussed.<ref name="Presup" /> A consequence of this position is that God's existence can never be demonstrated, either by empirical means or by philosophical argument. In ''The Justification of Knowledge'', the Calvinist theologian [[Robert L. Reymond]] argues that believers should not even attempt such proofs.

===Prophetic fulfillment===
{{see also|Postdiction}}
In his book ''Science Speaks'', [[Peter Stoner]] argues that only God knows the future and that Biblical prophecies of a compelling nature have been fulfilled.<ref>[http://www.sciencespeaks.net/Prophetic_Accuracy.html Chapter 2] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110724054728/http://www.sciencespeaks.net/Prophetic_Accuracy.html|date=24 July 2011}}, ''Science Speaks'',  [[Peter Stoner]]</ref> Apologist [[Josh McDowell]] documents the Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ, relating to his ancestral line, birthplace, virgin birth, miracles, death, and resurrection.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Evidence that Demands a Verdict|last=McDowell|first=Josh|page=chapter 8|no-pp=true}}</ref> Apologist [[Blaise Pascal]] believed that the prophecies are the strongest evidence for Christianity.   He notes that Jesus not only foretold, but was foretold, unlike in other religions, and that these prophecies came from a succession of people over a span of four thousand years.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pensées|last=Pascal|first=Blaise|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1966|location=England|pages=x,xii,xiii}}</ref>

===Origins apologetics===
Many Christians contend that science and the Bible do not contradict each other and that scientific fact supports Christian apologetics.<ref>Jitse M. van der Meer and Scott Mandelbrote, ''Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: Up to 1700'', BRILL, 2009, {{ISBN|90-04-17191-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=I--WJ5X-LqYC&pg=PA295 p. 295.]</ref><ref>Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman, ''Faith Has Its Reasons: Integrative Approaches to Defending the Christian Faith'', Biblica, 2006, {{ISBN|1-932805-34-6}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmeuGcfgZQAC&pg=PA173 p. 173.]</ref> The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' states that "The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge... These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator."<ref name="CCC287">''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 2nd ed. #287.</ref> The theologian and mathematician [[Marin Mersenne]] used celestial mechanics as evidence in his apologetic work,<ref>Avery Cardinal Dulles, ''A History of Apologetics'', 2nd ed., Ignatius Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-89870-933-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA159 p. 159.]</ref> while [[Matteo Ricci]] engaged in scientific apologetics in China.<ref>Jean Lacouture (tr. Jeremy Leggatt), ''Jesuits: A Multibiography'', Counterpoint Press, 1997, {{ISBN|1-887178-60-0}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0-J-9de_VwkC&pg=PA189 p. 189.]</ref> In modern times, the theory of the [[Big Bang]] has been used in support of Christian apologetics.<ref>Louis Markos, ''Apologetics for the Twenty-First Century'', Crossway, 2010, {{ISBN|1-4335-1448-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G4xS9tkb9wIC&pg=PA134 p. 134.]</ref><ref>James Stroud, ''Mere Christian Apologetics'', Xulon Press, 2011, {{ISBN|1-61379-449-5}},[https://books.google.com/books?id=go8ZJhSl56QC&pg=PA19 p. 19.]</ref>

Several Christian apologists have sought to reconcile Christianity and science concerning the question of origins. [[Theistic Evolution]] claims that classical religious teachings about God are compatible with the modern scientific understanding about biological evolution and that the Creator God uses the process of evolution. [[Denis Lamoureux]], in ''Evolutionary Creation: A Christian Approach to Evolution'' states that "This view of origins fully embraces both the religious beliefs of biblical Christianity and the scientific theories of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution. It contends that the Creator established and maintains the laws of nature, including the mechanisms of a [[Teleology|teleological evolution]]."<ref>[https://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/evolutionary_creation.pdf Evolutionary creation], [[Denis Lamoureux]]</ref>

The most radical{{cn|date=November 2019}} example of a Christian-evolutionary synthesis is the work of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], which was intended as apologetics to the world of science,<ref>Dulles, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xli4W2pSZpQC&pg=PA297 p. 297 ff.]</ref> but which was later condemned by the Catholic Church.

====Creationist apologetics====
<!-- linked from redirect [[Creationist apologetics]] -->
[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Creation Museum]] is a young Earth creationism museum run by the creation apologetics organization [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG) in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]].]]
Creationist apologetics aims to defend views of origins such as [[Young Earth creationism]] and [[Old Earth creationism]] that run counter to mainstream science. Young Earth creationists believe the Bible teaches that the Earth is approximately 6,000 years old, and reject the scientific consensus for the [[age of the Earth]]. They apply a [[biblical literalism|literal interpretation]] to the primordial history in Genesis 1–11 – such as the long life spans of people such as [[Methuselah]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.creationontheweb.com/content/view/805|title=Living for 900 years - creation.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH311.html|title=CH311: Vapor canopy's effect on lifespan|last=Isaak|first=Mark}}</ref> the [[Great Flood (Biblical)|Flood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icr.org/article/570/|title=Why Does Nearly Every Culture Have a Tradition of a Global Flood? - The Institute for Creation Research}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/flood.asp|title=The Flood}}</ref> and the [[Tower of Babel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/abr-a021.html|title=TOWER OF BABEL - Is there archaeological evidence of the Tower of Babel? • ChristianAnswers.Net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/q-abr/confusionoflanguages.html|title=CONFUSION OF LANGUAGES - Is there any reference in early Mesopotamian literature to what happened at the Tower of Babel? • ChristianAnswers.Net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/140-the-tower-of-babel-legend-or-history|title=The Tower of Babel: Legend or History?}}</ref> Old Earth creationists believe it is possible to harmonize the Bible's six-day account of creation with the scientific evidence that the universe is 13.8 billion-years-old and Earth is 4.54 billion-years-old.
