'''Secularist of the Year''' (also known as the '''Irwin Prize''') is an award presented annually by the UK's [[National Secular Society]] to the individual or organisation considered to have made the greatest contribution to [[secularism]] in the previous year. The prize consists of a trophy, the "Golden Ammonite", and a cheque for £5000. It was first awarded in 2005 and is sponsored by humanist and secularist campaigner Dr. [[Michael Irwin]]. The award ceremony normally takes place in London in March.
