The database indexes articles, [[essay]]s, and [[book review]]s related to a wide range of scholarly fields related to religion. The database is available on a subscription basis through a database aggregator.

The total database includes over 2.1 million article citations from over 1,940+ journals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atla.com/products/prodinfo/Pages/ATLA-RDB.aspx|title=Atla Religion Database® (Atla RDB®)|website=www.atla.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> There are more than a quarter of a million essay citations from more than 18,000 multi-author works. The number of book reviews is over half a million.<ref>{{cite web |title=ATLA Religion Database |url=http://www.atla.com/products/catalog/Pages/rdb-db.aspx |accessdate=July 31, 2011 |publisher=American Theological Library Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718005224/http://www.atla.com/products/catalog/Pages/rdb-db.aspx |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Atla indexes multi-author works, such as [[Festschrift]]en and [[Academic conference|conference proceedings]], with separate records for each essay.

== Formats ==
The ''Atla Religion Database'', formerly available on CD-ROM, is a [[MARC standards|MARC record format]] database<ref>{{cite conference |title=American Theological Library Association Summary of Proceedings |last1=Luedtke |first1=Tami |year=1998 |publisher= American Theological Library Association |pages=243–246 |issn= 0066-0868 }}</ref> that incorporates several out-of-print indexes, including [[Religion Index One: Periodicals]], [[Religion Index Two: Multi-Author Works]], and [[Index to Book Reviews in Religion]].<ref name="Finding" />

The database indexes scholarly works on [[major world religions]].<ref>{{cite conference |title=World Religions/Religious Studies in ATLA's RDB |last=Campbell |first=Cameron J. |conference=American Theological Library Association Summary of Proceedings |year=2004 |pages=85–89 |issn=0066-0868}}</ref> There are, however, selection criteria for inclusion according to scholarly merit and scope. More than 60 languages are represented. Some records cover articles as far back as the 19th century. Atla claims full coverage for core journals back to 1949.

In the 1990s, ''Atla Religion Database'' received criticism in a masters thesis for under-representing the emerging fields of [[lesbian theology]] and [[womanist theology]] in its coverage.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smailes |first=Suzanne A. |title=Reliability of Coverage of Periodical Indexing of Lesbian Theological and Womanist Theological Articles in the ATLA Religion Database |date=May 1996 |publisher=[[Kent State University]] |degree=Master of Library Science |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=ED401940}}</ref>
