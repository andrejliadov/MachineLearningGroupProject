[[Worship]] or deification of [[fire]] (also '''pyrodulia''', '''pyrolatry''' or '''pyrolatria''') is known from various [[religion]]s. Fire has been an important part of [[homo (genus)|human]] culture since the [[Lower Paleolithic]]. The earliest known traces of [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled fire]] were found at the [[Daughters of Jacob Bridge]], [[Israel]], and dated to 790,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goren-Inbar|first1=Naama|last2=Alperson|first2=Nira|last3=Kislev|first3=Mordechai E.|last4=Simchoni|first4=Orit|last5=Melamed|first5=Yoel|last6=Ben-Nun|first6=Adi|last7=Werker|first7=Ella|date=2004-04-30|title=Evidence of Hominin Control of Fire at Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel|journal=Science|language=en|volume=304|issue=5671|pages=725â€“727|doi=10.1126/science.1095443|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15118160|bibcode=2004Sci...304..725G|s2cid=8444444}}</ref> Religious or [[animist]] notions connected to fire are assumed to reach back to such early pre-''[[Homo sapiens]]'' times.

==Indo-European religions==
In [[Indo-European languages]], there were two concepts regarding fire: that of an animate type called *''egni-'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''agni'' English ''ignite'' from Latin ''ignis'', and Russian ''ogon''), and an inanimate type *''paewr-'' (cf. English - ''fire'', Greek ''pyr'', Sanskrit ''pu''). A similar distinction existed for [[water]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=fire&searchmode=none |title=Fire | publisher=etymonline.com}}</ref>

Archaeologically, the earliest evidence for Indo-Iranian fire worship is found at the transition from the [[Sintashta culture|Sintashta-Petrovka]] to the [[Andronovo culture]] around 1500 BC, together with first evidence of [[cremation]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}. While cremation became ubiquitous in Hinduism, it came to be disavowed in Zoroastrianism{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}. However, even earlier
evidences of vedic{{dubious|date=December 2020}}  fire altars have been found at the Indus Valley sites of [[Kalibangan]] and [[Lothal]], giving rise to speculations toward earlier assumed the geographical location of the early Indo-Iranians.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Although the term "fire-worshippers" is primarily associated with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], the idea that Zoroastrians worship fire is originally from anti-Zoroastrian polemic. Instead, fire&mdash;even in a [[fire temple]] (the Zoroastrian terms are more prosaic and simply mean "house of fire")&mdash;is considered to be an agent of purity and as a symbol of righteousness and truth. In the present day this is explained to be because fire burns ever-upward and cannot itself be polluted. Nonetheless, [[Sadeh]] and [[Chaharshanbe Suri]] are both fire-related festivals celebrated throughout [[Greater Iran]] and date back to when Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion of the region.

In Vedic disciplines of [[Hinduism]],  fire is a central element in the [[Yajna]] ceremony, with [[Agni]], "fire", playing the role as mediator between the worshipper and the other gods. Related concepts are the [[Agnihotra]] ritual, the invocation of the healing properties of fire; the [[Agnicayana]] ritual, which is the building of a fire altar to Agni; and [[Agnistoma]], which is one of the seven [[Somayajna]]s. In the Vaishnav branch of [[Hinduism]], Agni or Fire is considered the tongue of the Supreme Lord Narayana, hence all the sacrifices done even to any demigod ultimately is a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord Narayana.<ref>{{cite book |author=Madhulika Sharma |title=Fire Worship in Ancient India |publisher=Jaipur Publication Scheme |year=2002 |isbn=978-81-86782-57-6}}</ref>

In [[Albanian mythology]] the deification of fire is associated with [[En (deity)|En or Enji]], a fire deity firstly worshiped by the [[Illyrians]] whose name continues to be used in the [[Albanian language]] to refer to [[Thursday]] (''enjte'').<ref name="Lurker">{{cite book|last=Lurker|first=Manfred|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons|publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis|year=2005|isbn=0-203-64351-8|page=57}}</ref><ref name="Tagliavini">{{cite book|last=Tagliavini|first=Carlo|title=Storia di parole pagane e cristiane attraverso i tempi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQEsAAAAMAAJ&dq|year=1963|publisher=Morcelliana|page=103}}</ref>

Fire worship in Graeco-Roman tradition had two separate forms: fire of the [[hearth]] and fire of the [[forge]]. Hearth worship was maintained in Rome by the [[Vestal Virgins]], who served the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], protector of the home, who had a sacred flame as the symbol of her presence in the city (''cf.'' [[Sacred fire of Vesta]]). The Greek equivalent of the goddess was [[Hestia]], whose worship took place more commonly within the household. The fire of the forge was associated with the Greek god [[Hephaestus]] and the Roman equivalent [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. These two seem to have served both as craft-guild patrons and as protectors against accidental fires in cities. Also associated with fire is the [[Titan (mythology)|titanic god]] [[Prometheus]], who stole fire for humans from the gods. Most forms of worship in Graeco-Roman religion involved either cooking or burning completely an animal on a fire made on an [[altar]] in front of a [[temple]] (''see'' [[hecatomb]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

[[Celtic mythology]] had [[Belenus]], whose name, "shining one", associated him with fire.

In [[Slavic mythology]], [[Svarog]], meaning "bright and clear", was the spirit of fire. The best known and dramatic among numerous Slavic Pagan fire [[ritual]]s is the jumping over the bonfire on the [[Ivan Kupala Day]].

==Semitic religions==

Fire is an element of [[theophany]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]'s [[burning bush]], [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and the flame of the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]]. The highest form of sacrifice was the [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|Korban Olah]], performed twice-daily, which is an [[animal sacrifice]] completely [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|consumed by fire]].

Islam on the other hand has no rituals associated with fire and burning. The Quran describes the devil as a creature of fire. The devil's rejection and contempt toward humans originate from the devil's perception that fire is superior to mud. This sentiment was the cause of the devil's banishment from the heavens.

Fire continues to be a part of many human religions and cultures. For example, it is used in [[cremation]] and [[bonfire]]s; [[candle]]s are used in various religious ceremonies; [[eternal flame]]s are used to remind of notable occasions; and the [[Olympic Flame]] burns for the duration of the [[Olympic Games|games]].

The [[Holy Fire]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] has been consecutively documented since 1106 AD.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.holyfire.org/eng/index.htm | title=Holy Fire.
