'''Agni Yoga''' ({{lang-ru|А́гни Йо́га}}) or the '''Living Ethics''' ({{lang-ru|links=no|Жива́я Э́тика}}), or the '''Teaching of Life''' ({{lang-ru|links=no|Уче́ние Жи́зни}}), is a [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophical]] [[religious doctrine]] transmitted by [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] from 1920. The term ''Agni Yoga'' means "Mergence with Divine Fire" or "Path to Mergence with Divine Fire". This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of the Roerichs and of [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the modern Theosophical movement and of the [[Theosophical Society]].

Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the [[yoga]] of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the [[planetary consciousness]] is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of all [[yoga]]s. In all the [[list of Hindu texts|ancient Hindu scriptures]], the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni–Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all yogas, will saturate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire [[baptism]].

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and [[universalism]]. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the [[universe]].

Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of [[Asian religions]] to the [[Western world]]. Living Ethics has an international following and has thousands of adherents. The ideas of the Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on other [[esoteric]] movements and philosophies, among them [[New Age]] and [[transhumanism]].

===Etymology and concept===
The term ''Agni Yoga'' means "Mergence with Divine Fire" or "Path to Mergence with Divine Fire". This term was introduced to the Western public by [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html|title=Agni Yoga|publisher=highest-yoga.info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023071905/http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html|archive-date=23 October 2018|url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[Agni]]'' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and Living Ethics' "god of fire", who marks immortality and is the symbol of life. Agni is one of the highest gods in the [[Rigveda]]. In Agni Yoga it is the creative fire of the universe, the root of the "Fire of Space"; and the "psychic energy", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowker|first=John|title=World Religions|publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc.|year=1997|oclc=659908115|author-link=John Bowker (theologian)}}</ref> In the original myth found in many [[Indo-European culture]]s Agni is a bird-like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from Heaven to [[Earth]]. In the early [[Vedic literature]], Agni primarily connotes fire as a god, reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.<ref name="Macdonell1898p15">{{cite book|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|title=Vedic Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC|year=1898|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1113-3|pages=15–16, 92–93|author-link=Arthur Anthony Macdonell}}</ref>

''[[Yoga]]'' ({{lang-sa|योग}}; {{pronunciation|Yoga pronunciation.ogg|help=no}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. Yoga is a group of [[soul|spiritual]], [[mind|mental]], and [[human body|physical]] practices or disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]]. The term ''Yoga'' has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include ''[[Jnana Yoga]]'', ''[[Bhakti Yoga]]'', ''[[Karma Yoga]]'', ''[[Laya Yoga]]'' and ''[[Hatha Yoga]]''. The term ''[[Rāja Yoga]]'' originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is ''[[Samadhi]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|समाधि}}, {{IPA-hi|səˈmaːdʱi}}), but was popularised by [[Swami Vivekananda]] as the common name for ''Ashtanga Yoga''. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, ''Samadhi'' is the eighth and final limb identified in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].<ref name="Feuerstein2012">{{cite book|first=Georg|last=Feuerstein|title=The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI5XDwAAQBAJ|date=23 October 2012|publisher=Hohm Press|isbn=978-1-935387-39-8|page=37|author-link=Georg Feuerstein}}</ref><ref name=yogadarsanabook3>{{cite book|url=http://www.universaltheosophy.com/pdf-library/Yoga%20Darshana%20Eng%20with%20Vyasa%20Bhashya%20&%20Notes%20-%20Ganganath%20Jha%201907.pdf|title=The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa – Book 3 (G.N.

''[[Karma]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkɐɽmɐ|IPA|Karma.ogg}}) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in [[history of India|ancient India]]'s [[Vedic civilization]], the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Parvesh Singla|title=The Manual of Life – Karma|publisher=Parvesh singla|year=2002|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_1mXR35jX-TsC|pages=5–7}}</ref> Karma works as one of the great principles of cosmic action.

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and universalism. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the Universe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Samokhina|first=N.

====Theosophy====
{{Main|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] was officially formed in [[New York City]] on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. It was self-described as "an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity". After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]], in [[Chennai|Madras]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OC4IAQAAIAAJ|year=1951|title=The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950|publisher=Cunningham Press|location=Los Angeles|oclc=5050326}}</ref>

Madame Blavatsky (''Upasica'' – this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the "Teachers" called her<ref>{{cite book|title=Theosophy and culture: Nicholas Roerich|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdpG8sGt8K8C|author=Stasulane, Anita|publisher=Gregorian Biblical Bookshop|location=Rome|volume=8|year=2005|pages=26–27|isbn=978-88-7839-035-5}}</ref>), the greatest [[occultist]] in the history of [[Western civilization]]{{According to whom|date=August 2020}}, insisted that [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is not a [[religion]], although she did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement is: "There is no Religion higher than Truth".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ultindia.org/tm_magazine/TMOct2018.pdf|title=The motto is located at the top of the magazine page|journal=The Theosophical Movement.

Theosophical organisations regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in Theosophists who also identify as [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], or [[Hindus]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Kd5ngEACAAJ|last=Blavatsky|first=Helena|year=2013|title=Is Theosophy a Religion?|page=24|isbn=9781258977719}}</ref>

The term [[Neo-Theosophy]] was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/|title=Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy: Margaret Thomas' Study of C.

Other Neo-Theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]], and [[Samael Aun Weor]]. [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of the leading edge of the Theosophical movement. Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include [[Benjamin Creme]]<ref>{{cite book|url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf|first=Benjamin|last=Creme|title=Transmission A Meditation for the New Age|publisher=share-international.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703160721/https://www.share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf|archive-date=3 July 2019|url-status=live|author-link=Benjamin Creme}}</ref> and [[Victor Skumin]]. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of [[spiritual evolution]], proposed a classification of ''Homo spiritalis'' ([[Latin]]: "Spiritual man"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): ''HS-0'' Anabiosis spiritalis, ''HS-1'' Scientella spiritalis, ''HS-2'' Aurora spiritalis, ''HS-3'' Ascensus spiritalis, ''HS-4'' Vocatus spiritalis, ''HS-5'' Illuminatio spiritalis, ''НS-6'' Creatio spiritalis, and ''HS-7'' Servitus spiritalis.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=V.

==== Russian philosophy and Russian Cosmism ====
{{Main|List of Russian philosophers|Russian Cosmism}}

[[File:Vladimir Solovyov 1892 by Nikolay Yarochenko.jpg|180px|thumb|left|<center>[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] by [[Nikolai Yaroshenko]], 1892</center>]]
[[File:Pasternak fedorov.jpg|180px|thumb|left|<center>[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] by [[Leonid Pasternak]]</center>]]

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[history of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[Eurasianism]]. "Slavophilia" was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its own early history. There were also similar movements in [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed [[Slavophobia]], a fear of [[Slavic culture]].<ref name=Brit>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Slavophile Russian history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010135930/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavophile|url-status=live|archive-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>

The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[religion]], and [[Russian cosmism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James T. Andrews|title=Red Cosmos: K.E. Tsiolkovskii, Grandfather of Soviet Rocketry (Centennial of Flight Series)|year=2009|pages=168|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|oclc=680622488|isbn=9781603443609}}</ref>

Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity ''Sophia'' in his works, such as ''Three Encounters'' and ''Lectures on Godmanhood''. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various iterations of the Russian [[Slavophiles]]' concept of [[sobornost]]. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the [[Russian symbolism|Russian symbolist]] art movements of his time. His teachings on ''Sophia'', conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew ''[[Shekinah]]'' or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a [[heresy]] by [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] and as unsound and unorthodox by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html|title=The Sophian heresy and attempts to feminize God|publisher=ecumenizm.tripod.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904010747/http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html|url-status=live|archive-date=4 September 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Volition-of-the-Cosmos.jpg|180px|right|thumb|<center>The cover of the book "The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces" by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]], 1928</center>]]

[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] was a [[Russian Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmist movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of [[evolution]], as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the "Common Cause". Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving [[immortality]] and revival is the greatest goal of science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1915_186.html|first=Nikolai|last=Berdyaev|title=The religion of resuscitative resurrection The "Philosophy of the Common Task" of N.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by fiction writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[H. G. Wells|Herbert Wells]] as well as philosophical movements like [[Russian cosmism]]. In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the [[Russian Empire]], but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of Interplanetary Spaceflight.<ref name="Riper2007">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&pg=PA26|first=A.

He believed humans would eventually colonize the [[Milky Way]]. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538|last=Tsiolkovsky|first=Konstantin Eduardovich|author-link=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|title=The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces|place=Kaluga|year=1928|pages=23|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001447/https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538|url-status=live|archive-date=19 October 2018}}</ref>

Information about [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]] spread in [[Western countries]] in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voices in religion were arguing over [[fundamentalism]] and [[modernism]] as the only available choice, and long before [[Shangri-La]] had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the [[Eastern world]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Brian Taves|year=1985|title=Philosophy into Popular Fiction: Talbot Mundy and The Theosophical Society|journal=Southern California Quarterly|volume=67|issue=2|pages=153–186|doi=10.2307/41171147|jstor=41171147}}</ref>

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended Masters]]. They are referred to by Theosophists as Elder Brothers of the human race, [[Adept]]s, [[Mahātmā]]s, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Blavatsky]], after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]], too.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TI6fAwAAQBAJ|title=The myth of the Masters revived: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Elena Roerich|isbn=978-90-04-27043-5|last=Andreyev|first=Alexandre|date=8 May 2014}}</ref> She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers.

When Nicholas Roerich died, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, "I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment". The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753|title=When Helena Roerich called Kalimpong home|author=Ajay Kamalakaran|publisher=Russia Beyond|date=18 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112021249/https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753|url-status=live|archive-date=12 November 2018}}</ref>

===The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York===
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building ''[[Master Apartments]]''. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agniyoga.ws/agni-yoga.html|title=Agni Yoga (Sacred Heart Fire), The Great Synthesis|publisher=agniyoga.ws|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602055254/http://www.agniyoga.ws/agni-yoga.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 June 2019}}</ref>

Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a "Living Ethics". Speaking about the role of [[personality]] in the [[spiritual evolution]] of mankind, [[Helena Roerich]] wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html|title=The Spiritual Work of the United Nations and the Liberation of Humanity Creating Fundamental Global Transformations through the Power of Thought|publisher=aquaac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222054552/http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html|url-status=live|archive-date=22 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php|title=Letters of Helena Roerich II, 25 October 1936|publisher=agniyoga.org|access-date=25 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224065553/http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php|url-status=live|archive-date=24 February 2017}}</ref>

===Latvian Roerich Society in Riga===
The [[Latvia]]n Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerich family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in [[London]], met Nicholas and Helena Roerich. In [[Riga]] they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and other theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to [[India]], to become the secretary of Roerich.<ref name="la">{{cite web|url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm|title=In short about Latvian Roerich Society|publisher=latvijasrerihabiedriba|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118234925/http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm|url-status=live|archive-date=18 November 2017}}</ref>

In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by [[doctor (title)|doctor]]-[[homeopathy|homeopath]] [[:lv:Fēlikss Lūkins|Felix Lukin]]. He and his son [[:lv:Haralds Lūkins|Harald Lukin]] conducted [[clinical trials]] and many natural [[medication]]s that they received from [[Svetoslav Roerich]] of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-0B1OWsbIC&pg=PA144|title=History and status of homoeopathy around the world |author=Aswarda Das |isbn=978-81-8056-573-1 |year=2005 |pages=144–147}}</ref>

In 1936 [[Richard Rudzitis]] officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs [[Banner of Peace]]. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the [[USSR]] who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received social beneficial status in the [[Republic of Latvia]].<ref name="la"/>

===Master Institute of United Arts in New York City===
Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to beauty, knowledge, and culture. His vision is captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in [[New York City]] in 1921:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/|title=Inspired By Art: Nicholas Roerich's Symbolic Journey|publisher=philosophicalsociety.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921115023/https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/|url-status=live|archive-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>
{{quote|''Art will unify all humanity. Art is one – indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one.  Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all''.}}

Louis L. Horch and Nettie S. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the [[Master Apartments]], designed by [[Harvey Wiley Corbett]] in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6636038/|title=Louis L. and Nettie S.

Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as [[George Bellows]], [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], [[Norman Bel Geddes]], [[Stark Young]], [[Deems Taylor]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]], and [[Lee Simonson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|title=Nicholas Roerich Biography America|publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105124603/http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php|url-status=live|archive-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students in accordance with the proposed curriculum. There were [[Felix Salmond]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Michael Fokin]].

Roerich's family moved to [[India]] in December 1923. They settled in [[Darjeeling]], a town in the [[India]]n [[states and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/|title=Roerich Himalayan Museum of Folk And Tribal Art|publisher=ignca.gov.in|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914132456/http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/|url-status=live|archive-date=14 September 2018}}</ref>

From 1925 to 1928, Roerich took part in a [[Central Asia]] expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of [[India]], [[China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. [[Sikkim]] was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as [[history]], [[archeology]], [[ethnography]], [[history of philosophy]], [[arts]] and [[religions]], and [[geography]] was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]''. She also wrote a book entitled "Chalice of the East", which was published under the pen name "Iskander Khanum". Helena Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's teaching were interpreted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/biography/|title=Helena I.

The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)]], which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920s. The brownstone has natural scenes from the Himalayas, where the artist spent two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with orange skies or deep blue mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/journeys-specialty-museums-finding-art-not-crowds-in-new-york.html|date=16 April 2006|first=Seth|last=Kugel|title=Journeys: Speciality Museums; Finding Art, Not Crowds, in New York.

Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich's accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Kyo03NxncC&pg=PA86|title=Spiritual Places|last=Squires|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Squires|author2=Len Belzer|year=2000|pages=86|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1931044035}}</ref>

The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness.

It carries in itself a new cosmic worldview. The core of Roerichism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between mankind and the [[cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.icr.su/museum/|title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623105616/http://en.icr.su/museum/|publisher=en.icr.su|archive-date=23 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===The World Organisation of Culture of Health===
[[File:Skuminpadma083020.jpg|thumb|left|175px|<center>Skumin at the age of 72</center>]]

The World Organisation of Culture of Health (WOCH) – International [[Social movement organization|social movement]] "To Health via Culture'" ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. [[Victor Skumin]] was elected to the post of the president-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the charter registered with the [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824|title=Charter of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Russian: Устав)|publisher=Kult-zdor.ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324162957/http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824|archive-date=24 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book ''Supermundane'' (paragraph 525) recorded the words of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]], addressed to Urusvati,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php|title=Supermundane, 525|publisher=agniyoga.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003072908/http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php|url-status=live|archive-date=3 October 2018}}</ref>

{{quote|''Urusvati knows that people are responsible for three aspects of health. First, their own health; second, the health of the planet; and finally, the health of the supermundane world... People must safeguard their own health, not only for themselves but also for those around them.

Professors Verhorubova and Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that, in accordance with the concept of the culture of health, proposed by [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]], culture – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii|last2=Lobanova|first2=N.A.|last1=Verhorubova|first1=O.V.|title=Многообразие определений феномена "культура здоровья" как показатель его многогранности в педагогическом образовании|trans-title=The diversity of definitions the phenomenon of "culture of health" as an indicator of its versatility in education|journal=Вестник Томского государственного педагогического университета|year=2012|issue=5|pages=161–5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107165104/http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.

Many works of [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Svetoslav Roerich]], as [[artist]]s, are thematically related to Agni Yoga. Roerich's artistic works tell about the internal needs of the individual and about the ways of their realization. Roerich's paintings are a kind of "Teaching of Life", on the spiritual development of mankind, about culture and its role in human life. They are a conversation about the [[eternity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php|title=The Museum Collection|publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum NY|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190602175504/http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php|url-status=live|archive-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> [[Germany|German]]-born [[New Age]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] musician [[Karunesh|Karunesh (Bruno Reuter)]] believes that Roerich's paintings have healing properties.
