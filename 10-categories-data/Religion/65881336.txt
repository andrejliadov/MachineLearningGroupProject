== History ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:The_Cameron_family.jpg|thumb|The Cameron family in Dundee, 1883]]
The Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Collections comprise collections from different sources acquired by the Brotherton Library at various times.  These are curated under a single collection group.  Each collection is an outsider’s representation of the communities as the collectors were not Gypsies, Travellers or Roma.  As a whole the collections trace attitudes to, and relationships with, the communities, from the romantic stance of the early twentieth century to the social reality of more modern collections.<ref name=":0" />

The Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Collections relate to communities with a nomadic culture, history or lifestyle.  The communities represented include those recognised in UK law as ethnic groups; English and Welsh (Romany) Gypsies, Irish Travellers and Scottish Travellers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tackling inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities - Women and Equalities Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmwomeq/360/full-report.html|access-date=2020-12-14|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>  They also embrace non-ethnic groups that consider themselves distinct e.g. New Travellers, Showmen and Bargees. ‘Gypsy' may be considered offensive outside of the UK, so ‘Roma’ is often the preferred term representing a number of distinct groups such as Sinti and Manouche.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Papers of Jenny Smith, (Gypsy and Traveller Rights Campaigner) - Library {{!}} University of Leeds|url=https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/611487|access-date=2020-10-21|website=explore.library.leeds.ac.uk}}</ref>

=== The Romany Collection ===
The Romany Collection was donated by [[Dorothy Una Ratcliffe]] in 1950.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-05-14|title=Don't Miss the Leeds University Library Galleries|url=https://leeds-list.com/culture/15-reasons-why-the-leeds-university-library-galleries-are-a-hidden-treasure-worth-seeking-out/|access-date=2020-11-22|website=Leeds-List|language=en}}</ref>  It includes manuscripts, letters, typescripts, press cuttings, photographs, musical scores, artwork and objects featuring Gypsies and Travellers in the UK and worldwide. Many of the archives relate to the [[Gypsy Lore Society]] and  its members.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Catalogue of the Romany collection - Library {{!}} University of Leeds|url=https://explore.library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-explore/346747|access-date=2020-10-21|website=explore.library.leeds.ac.uk}}</ref>  The papers reflect the members’ research interests and include articles published in the Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Gypsy Lore Society|url=http://www.gypsyloresociety.org/home|access-date=2020-10-21|website=www.gypsyloresociety.org}}</ref>

Ratcliffe left a fund to purchase more material to add to the collection.  Additions include individual items and a series of press cuttings from Durrants Press Cuttings Limited.<ref name=":1" />

== Research and Outreach ==

The Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Collections offer a wealth of research opportunities; covering subjects such as art, literature, history, culture, language/linguistics, philology, sociology, religion, law, politics, human rights, activism and geography.<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Grady|first=Clare|title=Celebrating Archives: Leeds University Library Special Collections - Register of Qualified Genealogists|url=https://www.qualifiedgenealogists.org/RQGNews/blog/leeds-university-library-special-collections/|access-date=2020-11-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Recent Research ===
The collections have been used to research the experiences of the community in different parts of [[Europe]] including [[Spain]] and in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Many of the collections have been studied to explore Romani contributions to European culture and the singing traditions of the community.  Some researchers have examined the concept of the [[nomad]] and nomadic living. The collections have been studied for information about the construction and design of wagons sometimes known as caravans.
