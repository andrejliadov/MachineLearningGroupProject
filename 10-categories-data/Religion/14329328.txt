The [[Bhavishya Purana]] contains the following: "At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the [[Shakyamuni]], and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the [[Kali Yuga|Kali Age]], the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists. Those who sought refuge with Vishnu were deluded." Found in Wendy O'Flaherty, ''Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology.'' University of California Press, 1976, page 203.

==Hinduism==
{{main|Gautama Buddha in Hinduism}}
[[File:Avatarbuddha.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Some Hindus regard Buddha as the 9th [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].]]
Gautama Buddha is mentioned as an [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the [[Puranic]] texts of [[Hinduism]].<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/en1 Bhagavata Purana, Canto 1, Chapter 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521022342/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/3/en1 |date=21 May 2013 }} - SB 1.3.24: "Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Anjana, in the province of Gaya, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist." ... SB 1.3.28: "All of the above-mentioned incarnations [avatars] are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord [Krishna or Vishnu]"</ref> In the [[Bhagavata Purana]] he is twenty fourth of twenty five avatars, prefiguring a forthcoming final incarnation. A number of [[Hindu]] traditions portray Buddha as the most recent of ten principal avatars, known as the [[Dashavatara]] (''Ten Incarnations of God'').

Siddhartha Gautama's teachings deny the authority of the [[Vedas]] and consequently [at least atheistic] Buddhism is generally viewed as a ''[[Nastika|nāstika]]'' school (heterodox, literally "It is not so"<ref>"in Sanskrit philosophical literature, 'āstika' means 'one who believes in the authority of the Vedas' or 'one who believes in life after death'. ('nāstika' means the opposite of these).  The word is used here in the first sense." Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta.  An Introduction to Indian Philosophy. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 5, footnote 1.</ref>) from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.

Many of the eighteen orthodox Puranas mention the Buddha in a less favouring light. They present the birth of the Buddha as a ploy by the Supreme God Vishnu to corrupt demons and sway them from Vedic teachings. Only by leading them astray with his teachings could the demons be destroyed. This belief is sometimes associated with the Asuras of Tripura (the three citadels) as well as others. Literature from the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], on the other hand, maintains that [[Krishna]] took the appearance of an atheistic teacher out of benevolence, in order to trick atheists into worshipping God (i.e., himself).

==Sikhism==
Buddha is mentioned as the 23rd avatar of Vishnu in the [[Chaubis Avtar]], a composition in Dasam Granth traditionally and historically attributed to [[Guru Gobind Singh]].<ref>http://www.info-sikh.com/VVPage1.html</ref>

==Taoism, Confucianism and Shinto==

Some early Chinese Taoist-Buddhists thought the Buddha to be a reincarnation of [[Lao Tzu]].<ref>The Cambridge History of China, Vol.1, (The Ch'in and Han Empires, 221 BC—220 BC) {{ISBN|0-521-24327-0}} hardback</ref>

In Japan, since one of the symbols of [[Vairocana|Dainichi Nyorai]] (one of the non-historical buddhas of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism) was the sun, many equated [[Amaterasu]], the Sun Goddess, with a previous reincarnation (bodhisattva) of Dainichi Nyorai.

==Ahmadiyyat==
[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the Fourth [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|Ahmadiyya Community]], in his book ''[[Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth]]'', argues that Buddha was indeed a prophet of God who preached Monotheism. He quotes from the inscriptions on Ashoka's stupas which mention "Isa'na" which means God. He quotes, "'Thus spake Devanampiya Piyadasi: "Wherefore from this very hour, I have caused religious discourses to be preached, I have appointed religious observances that mankind, having listened thereto, shall be brought to follow in the right path, and give glory to God* (Is'ana)."<ref>[http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_2_section_2.html ''Al-Islam.org''] Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, Chapter, Buddhism.</ref> The Ahmadiyya hold the view that the Buddha was indeed a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Prophet of God]].

[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] has also stated that the Qur'anic figure called [[Dhul-Kifl]] may have been the Buddha in his book "An Elementary Study of Islam."<ref>http://www.alislam.org/books/study-of-islam/prophets.html</ref>

In fact, a verse in the Qur'an quotes that God has sent many prophets to thee (Humanity). However, only a few have been named. It is believed by some{{Who|date=September 2018}} that Buddha may (or may not) have been a Prophet of God sent to his people who taught Monotheism.

The Greek legend of "[[Barlaam and Josaphat|Barlaam and Ioasaph]]", sometimes mistakenly attributed to the 7th century [[John of Damascus]] but actually written by the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] monk [[Euthymius of Athos|Euthymius]] in the 11th century, was ultimately derived, through a variety of intermediate versions ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]) from the life story of the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Ioasaph (Georgian ''Iodasaph'', Arabic ''Yūdhasaf'' or ''Būdhasaf'': Arabic "b" could become "y" by [[Arabic alphabet|duplication of a dot]] in handwriting) ultimately derives his name from the Sanskrit [[Bodhisattva]], the name used in Buddhist accounts for Gautama before he became a Buddha.<ref name="CatholicEncyclopedia">{{CathEncy|wstitle=Barlaam and Josaphat}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wiekisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Barlaam_and_Josaphat|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Article on Barlaam and Josaphat}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Barlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Greek Orthodox calendar of [[saint]]s on 26 August, and in the West they were entered as "[[Barlaam and Josaphat]]" in the Roman Martyrology on the date of 27 November.

==Judaism==
The story was translated into Hebrew in the 13th century by [[Abraham Ibn Chisdai]] (or Hasdai) as "ben-haMelekh v'haNazir" ("The Prince and the [[Nazirite]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Baháʼí Faith==
In the [[Baháʼí Faith]], Buddha is classified as one of the [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestations of God]] which is a title for a major prophet in the Baháʼí Faith.<ref>Hornby, Helen Bassett (1994).
