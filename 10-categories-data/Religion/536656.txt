The '''Templeton Prize''' is an annual award granted to a living person, in the estimation of the judges, "whose exemplary achievements advance [[Sir John Templeton]]'s philanthropic vision: harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind’s place and purpose within it." It was established, funded and administered by [[John Templeton]] starting in 1972. It is now co-funded by the Templeton philanthropies, and administered by the [[John Templeton Foundation]].<ref>Online: https://templetonreligiontrust.org/areas-of-focus/</ref>

The prize was originally awarded to people working in the field of religion ([[Mother Teresa]] was the first winner), but in the 1980s the scope broadened to include people working at the intersection of science and religion.<ref name=Nature2011>{{cite journal |last1=Waldrop |first1=M.
