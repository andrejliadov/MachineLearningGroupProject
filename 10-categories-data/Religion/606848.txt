[[File:Ignatius of Antiochie, poss. by Johann Apakass (17th c., Pushkin museum).jpg|thumb|The first use of the term "Catholic Church" (literally meaning "universal church") was by the [[church father]] Saint [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in his ''[[Letter to the Smyrnaeans]]'' (circa 110&nbsp;AD).<ref>John Meyendorff, ''Catholicity and the Church'', St Vladimirs Seminary Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0-88141-006-3}}, p. 7</ref> Ignatius of Antioch is also attributed the earliest recorded use of the term "Christianity" ({{Lang-el|Χριστιανισμός|links=no}}) circa 100&nbsp;A.D.{{sfn|Elwell|Comfort|2001|pp=266, 828}} He died in Rome, with his [[relic]]s located in the [[Basilica of San Clemente al Laterano]].]]

Since the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054, the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Church]] has taken the adjective "Orthodox" as its distinctive epithet (however, its official name continues to be the "Orthodox Catholic Church"<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eastern-Orthodoxy "Eastern Orthodoxy"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online.</ref>) and the [[Western Church]] in communion with the [[Holy See]] has similarly taken "Catholic", keeping that description also after the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century, when those who ceased to be in communion became known as "Protestants".<ref>"catholic, adj. and n." [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online. Oxford University Press, June 2014. Web. 7 August 2014. Excerpt: "After the separation of East and West 'Catholic' was assumed as its descriptive epithet by the Western or Latin Church, as 'Orthodox' was by the Eastern or Greek. At the Reformation, the term 'Catholic' was claimed as its exclusive right by the body remaining under the Roman obedience, in opposition to the 'Protestant' or 'Reformed' National Churches. These, however, also retained the term, giving it, for the most part, a wider and more ideal or absolute sense, as the attribute of no single community, but only of the whole communion of the saved and saintly in all churches and ages. In England, it was claimed that the Church, even as Reformed, was the national branch of the 'Catholic Church' in its proper historical sense."

Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, commonly called the pope, whose jurisdiction is called the [[Holy See]]. In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institutes]] that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop.

In the first thousand years of Catholic history, different varieties of Christianity developed in the Western and [[Eastern Christian]] areas of Europe. Though most Eastern-tradition churches are no longer in communion with the Catholic Church after the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, autonomous [[particular churches]] of both traditions currently participate, also known as "churches ''[[sui iuris]]''" ({{lang-la|"of one's own right}}"). The largest and most well known is the Latin Church, the only Western-tradition church, with more than 1&nbsp;billion members worldwide. Relatively small in terms of adherents compared to the Latin Church, are the 23 self-governing Eastern Catholic Churches with a combined membership of 17.3&nbsp;million {{As of|2010|lc=y}}.<ref name="Roberson">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnewa.org/default.aspx?ID=125&pagetypeID=1&sitecode=HQ&pageno=1 |author=Ronald G.

The Latin Church is governed by the pope and diocesan bishops directly appointed by him. The pope exercises a direct [[patriarch]]al role over the Latin Church, which is considered to form the original and still major part of [[Western Christianity]], a heritage of certain beliefs and customs originating in Europe and northwestern Africa, some of which are inherited by many [[Christian denominations]] that trace their origins to the Protestant Reformation.<ref name="west_christ">[http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/west/westessay.html "General Essay on Western Christianity"], [http://www.philtar.ac.uk/encyclopedia/christ/west/westrc.html "Western Church/Roman Catholicism"] ''Overview of World Religions''.

The Eastern Catholic Churches follow the traditions and spirituality of [[Eastern Christianity]] and are churches which have always remained in full communion with the Catholic Church or who have chosen to re-enter full communion in the centuries following the [[East–West Schism]] and earlier divisions. These churches are communities of Catholic Christians whose forms of worship reflect distinct historical and cultural influences rather than differences in doctrine.

A church ''sui iuris'' is defined in the ''[[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches|Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches]]'' as a "group of Christian faithful united by a hierarchy" that is recognised by the pope in his capacity as the [[papal supremacy|supreme authority]] on matters of doctrine within the church.{{refn|{{cite web |url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_PR.HTM |title=Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches, Title 2 |publisher=intratext.com |date=1992}}}} The term is an innovation of the ''CCEO'' to denote the relative autonomy of the Eastern Catholic Churches,<ref name="MalankaraCCSIJS">{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2057012/Malankara-Catholic-Church-sui-iuris-Juridical-Status-and-Power-of-Governance |title=Malankara Catholic Church sui iuris: Juridical Status and Power of Governance |work=Scribd}}</ref> who remain in [[full communion]] with the pope, but have governance structures and liturgical traditions separate from that of the Latin Church.<ref name="Gunton"/><!--Each church is headed by a [[patriarch]] or [[major archbishop]],<ref name=CCEO56>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1199/_P1K.HTM "''CCEO'', Canon 56."].

The church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected [[Infallibility of the Church|infallibly]] from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM |work=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Vatican |access-date=28 April 2011 |title=The teaching office |quote=889 in order to preserve the Church in the purity of the faith handed on by the apostles, Christ who is the Truth willed to confer on her a share in his own infallibility. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072610/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2A.HTM |archive-date=29 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Second Vatican Council |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |work=Lumen Gentium |publisher=Vatican |access-date=24 July 2010 |title=Chapter III, paragraph 25 |quote=by the light of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;... vigilantly warding off any errors that threaten their flock. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |archive-date=6 September 2014}}</ref>

===Final judgement===

Depending on the judgement rendered following death, it is believed that a soul may enter one of three states of the afterlife:
* [[Heaven in Christianity#Roman Catholicism|Heaven]] is a state of unending union with the divine nature of God, not ontologically, but by grace. It is an eternal life, in which the soul contemplates God in ceaseless [[beatific vision|beatitude]].<ref name="1023_">{{CCC|1023|30 July 2014|pp_range=1023–29, 1042–50}}</ref><!--<ref name=autogenerated7>''CCC'', 1023–1029, 1042–1050</ref>-->

* [[Hell in Christian beliefs#Roman Catholicism|Final Damnation]]: Finally, those who persist in living in a state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject themselves to hell, an everlasting separation from God.<ref name="1033_">{{CCC|1033|7 August 2014|pp_range=1033–37, 1057}}</ref> The church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God.<ref name="1058_">{{CCC|1058|7 August 2014}}</ref> No one is [[predestination|predestined]] to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell.<ref name="1037_">{{CCC|1037|7 August 2014}}</ref> Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation.<ref name="Luke23">Christian [[Bible]], {{bibleverse||Luke|23:39–43}}</ref> Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in [[original sin]] are assigned to [[limbo]], although this is not an official [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7529&CFID=32422018&CFTOKEN=46037657 |title=Library : The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptized |publisher=Catholic Culture |date=19 January 2007 |access-date=28 October 2010}}</ref>

While the Catholic Church teaches that it alone possesses the full means of salvation,<ref name=CCC_816/> it also acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of [[Ecclesial Community|Christian communities]] separated from itself to "impel towards Catholic unity"<ref name="ewtn.com">[https://www.ewtn.com/library/Doctrine/subsistit.htm "Christ's Church Subsists in the Catholic Church"].

It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Catholic Church but that people can be saved outside of the ordinary means known as [[baptism of desire]], and by pre-baptismal martyrdom, known as [[baptism of blood]], as well as when conditions of [[Invincible ignorance (Catholic theology)|invincible ignorance]] are present, although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation.<ref>{{cite CE1913| wstitle = Baptism | first = William | last = Fanning | accessdate = }} (See: "Necessity of baptism" and "Substitutes for the sacrament")</ref>

<!--Content derived from "[[Saints]] (version 841312648)" and "[[Canonization]] (version 841807635)" -->
A [[saint]] (also historically known as a hallow) is a person who is recognised as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to God, while [[canonization]] is the act by which a Christian church declares that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the "canon", or list, of recognised saints.<ref name="WilsonFischer2005">{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Douglas |last2=Fischer |first2=Ty |title=Omnibus II: Church Fathers Through the Reformation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zClmDnl3b3EC&pg=PA101 |access-date=13 January 2013 |date=2005 |publisher=Veritas Press |isbn=978-1-932168-44-0 |page=101 |quote=The word 'hallow' means 'saint,' in that 'hallow' is just an alternative form of the word 'holy' ('hallowed be Thy name').}}</ref><ref name="DiehlDonnelly2001">{{cite book |last1=Diehl |first1=Daniel |last2=Donnelly |first2=Mark |title=Medieval Celebrations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WKyMpNnRWUC&pg=PA13 |access-date=13 January 2013 |date=2001 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=978-0-8117-2866-9 |page=13 |quote=The word hallow was simply another word for saint.}}</ref> The first persons honoured as saints were the [[martyr]]s. Pious legends of their deaths were considered affirmations of the truth of their faith in [[Christ]]. By the fourth century, however, "[[confessor]]s"—people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life—began to be [[veneration|venerated publicly]].

In the Catholic Church, both in Latin and Eastern Catholic churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the [[Apostolic See]] and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that he is worthy to be recognised as a saint. The church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in [[Heaven]] and that he may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the [[liturgy]] of the church, including in the [[Litany of the Saints]]. [[Canonization]] allows universal veneration of the saint in the liturgy of the [[Roman Rite]]; for permission to venerate merely locally, only [[beatification]] is needed.<ref>"Beatification, in the present discipline, differs from canonization in this: that the former implies (1) a locally restricted, not a universal, permission to venerate, which is (2) a mere permission, and no precept; while canonization implies a universal precept" ([http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm Beccari, Camillo.

The Catholic Church teaches that it was entrusted with [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|seven sacraments]] that were instituted by Christ. The number and nature of the sacraments were defined by several [[ecumenical council]]s, most recently the Council of Trent.<ref name="1113_14">{{CCC|pp=1113–1114, 1117|accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Other councils that addressed the sacraments include the [[Second Council of Lyon]] (1274); [[Council of Florence]] (1439); as well as the [[Council of Trent]] (1547)<ref name=1113_14/>|}} These are [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation]], the [[Eucharist]], [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]], [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (formerly called Extreme Unction, one of the "[[Last Rites]]"), [[Holy Orders]] and [[Catholic marriage|Holy Matrimony]]. Sacraments are visible rituals that Catholics see as signs of God's presence and effective channels of God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] to all those who receive them with the proper disposition (''[[ex opere operato]]'').<ref>Kreeft, pp. 298–299</ref> The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' categorizes the sacraments into three groups, the "sacraments of Christian initiation", "sacraments of healing" and "sacraments at the service of communion and the mission of the faithful". These groups broadly reflect the stages of people's natural and spiritual lives which each sacrament is intended to serve.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1210–1211 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=30 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042152/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |archive-date=9 June 2011}}</ref>

The liturgies of the sacraments are central to the church's mission. According to the ''Catechism'':

{{Quote|In the liturgy of the New Covenant every liturgical action, especially the celebration of the Eucharist and the sacraments, is an encounter between Christ and the Church. The liturgical assembly derives its unity from the "communion of the Holy Spirit" who gathers the children of God into the one Body of Christ. This assembly transcends racial, cultural, social—indeed, all human affinities.<ref>{{CCC|1097|21 November 2014}}</ref>|}}

According to church doctrine, the sacraments of the church require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly celebrated.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Sacraments}}</ref> In addition, the [[Canon Law]]s for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments.<ref name="CoCC291">{{cite news |title=''CoCC'' 291 |publisher=Vatican.va |quote=To receive Holy Communion one must be fully incorporated into the Catholic Church and be in the state of grace, that is, not conscious of being in mortal sin.

[[File:Jf9694Wedding San Nicolas Church Tolentine Marriage Pampangafvf 02.JPG|right|thumb|Wedding mass in the [[Philippines]]]]
The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is a social and spiritual bond between a man and a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to [[Catholic teachings on sexual morality]], it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death.<ref>{{CCC|1601|15 November 2014|pp_range=1601,1614|quote=The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring; this covenant between baptised persons has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament.}}</ref>{{refn|Marriages involving unbaptised individuals are considered valid, but not sacramental. While sacramental marriages are insoluble, non-sacramental marriages may be dissolved under certain situations, such as a desire to marry a Catholic, under [[Pauline privilege|Pauline]] or [[Petrine privilege]].<ref name="Gantley"/><ref name="Doors"/>||group="note"}} The church recognises certain [[Marriage (Catholic Church)#Conditions for a valid marriage of Catholics|conditions]], such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the church sets specific rules and norms, known as [[Marriage (Catholic Church)#Canonical form|canonical form]], that Catholics must follow.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1631 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=30 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628191157/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |archive-date=28 June 2011}}</ref>

The church does not recognise divorce as ending a valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce only as a means of protecting the property and well-being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an [[annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].<ref name="annulment">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |title=''CCC'', 1629 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=30 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628191157/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM |archive-date=28 June 2011}}</ref> Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.<ref name="annulment"/>

The [[Roman Rite]] is the most common [[Catholic liturgical rites|rite of worship]] used by the Catholic Church.

An outline of its major liturgical elements can be found in the sidebar.

[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|thumb|right|Elevation of the [[chalice]] before an [[altar]] after the consecration during a [[Solemn Mass]] of [[Tridentine Mass]]]]
In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI affirmed the licitness of continued use of the [[1962 Roman Missal]] as an "extraordinary form" (''forma extraordinaria'') of the Roman Rite, speaking of it also as an ''usus antiquior'' ("older use"), and issuing new more permissive norms for its employment.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to bishops on 7 July 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929015429/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |date=29 September 2010 }} "The last version of the ''Missale Romanum'' prior to the [[Second Vatican Council|Council]], which was published with the authority of Pope John XXIII in 1962 and used during the Council, will now be able to be used as a Forma extraordinaria of the liturgical celebration. [...] As for the use of the 1962 Missal as a ''forma extraordinaria'' of the liturgy of the Mass, I would like to draw attention to the fact that this Missal was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted." — Pope Benedict XVI</ref> An instruction issued four years later spoke of the two forms or usages of the Roman Rite approved by the pope as the ordinary form and the extraordinary form ("the ''forma ordinaria''" and "the ''forma extraordinaria''").<ref name="Universae Ecclesiae">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html |title=Instruction on the application of the Apostolic Letter Summorum Pontificum of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI given Motu Proprio |work=vatican.va |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223094426/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/ecclsdei/documents/rc_com_ecclsdei_doc_20110430_istr-universae-ecclesiae_en.html |archive-date=23 February 2016}}</ref>

The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, published a few months before the [[Second Vatican Council]] opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardized in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]] at the request of the [[Council of Trent]] and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass.<ref name=Kreeft326/> Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1604, [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1634, [[Pope Pius X]] in 1911, [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, and [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition.

The Eastern Catholic Churches share common patrimony and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including [[Eastern Orthodox]] and other [[Eastern Christian]] churches who are no longer in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East.

[[File:Hans Memling - Allegory with a Virgin - WGA14896.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Allegory]] of chastity by [[Hans Memling]]]]<!--copied from chastity article 22 May 2016-->
The Catholic Church calls all members to practise [[chastity]] according to their state in life. Chastity includes [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Discipline|self-mastery]], personal and cultural growth, and [[divine grace]]. It requires refraining from [[lust]], [[masturbation]], [[fornication]], [[pornography]], [[prostitution]] and, especially, [[rape]]. Chastity for those who are not married requires living in [[Sexual abstinence|continence]], abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.<ref>{{CCC|2332|17 November 2014|pp_range=Part 3, Section 2, Chapter 2, Article: The Sixth Commandment|quote='''2332:''' Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others.}}</ref>

In the church's teaching, sexual activity is reserved to married couples, whether in a [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|sacramental marriage]] among Christians or in a [[natural marriage]] where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly [[engagement to marriage]], partners are called to practise continence, in order to test mutual respect and fidelity.<ref>{{CCC|2348|20 December 2014|end=50}}</ref> Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy.

====Divorce and declarations of nullity====
{{Main|Declaration of nullity}}
{{further|Divorce law by country}}
Canon law makes no provision for divorce between baptised individuals, as a valid, consummated sacramental marriage is considered to be a lifelong bond.<ref>{{CCC|1640|15 November 2014|quote=Thus the marriage bond has been established by God himself in such a way that a marriage concluded and consummated between baptized persons can never be dissolved. This bond, which results from the free human act of the spouses and their consummation of the marriage, is a reality, henceforth irrevocable, and gives rise to a covenant guaranteed by God's fidelity. The Church does not have the power to contravene this disposition of divine wisdom. (Cf. [[Code of Canon Law]] 1983, can. [http://www.catholicdoors.com/misc/marriage/canonlaw.htm 1141])|}}</ref> However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when the proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a valid marriage were absent from the beginning—in other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an [[ecclesiastical tribunal]] determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted.<ref>{{CCC|pp=1625–1632|accessdate=15 November 2014|quote=For this reason (or for other reasons that render the marriage null and void) the Church, after an examination of the situation by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal, can declare the nullity of a marriage, i.e., that the marriage never existed.

The church teaches that [[Human reproduction#Copulation|sexual intercourse]] should only take place between a man and woman who are married to each other, and should be without the use of [[birth control]] or [[contraception]].

This teaching was continued especially by [[John Paul II]] in his encyclical ''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'', where he clarified the church's position on contraception, [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] by condemning them as part of a "culture of death" and calling instead for a "[[culture of life]]".<ref name="Bokenkotter493">Bokenkotter, pp. 27, 154, 493–494</ref>

The Christian religion is based on the teachings of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], who lived and preached in the 1st century AD in the province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Catholic theology]] teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus.<ref name="Catholic News Service"/> Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. [[Emperor Constantine]] legalized the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted [[Arian Christianity]], eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding [[Muslim conquests]] following the advent of [[Islam]] led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between Rome and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Eastern Orthodox opposition to papal supremacy|Conflicts involving authority in the church]], particularly the [[Ecclesiastical differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church#Papal authority|authority of the Bishop of Rome]] finally culminated in the [[East–West Schism]] in the 11th century, splitting the church into the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches. Earlier splits within the church occurred after the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the Eastern Catholic Churches.

Early monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman [[classical civilization]]. The church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilization into the modern age. Many [[Renaissance]] figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the church, in particular to its religious authority, by [[List of Protestant Reformers|figures in the Protestant Reformation]], as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the [[New World]].

In 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] declared the dogma of [[papal infallibility]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the [[Papal States]] to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons. In the Second World War, the church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the [[Holocaust]]; its efforts, however, have been criticized as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the [[Communist]] countries newly aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], several of which had large Catholic populations.

In the 1960s, the [[Second Vatican Council]] led to reforms of the church's liturgy and practices, described as "opening the windows" by defenders, but criticized by [[traditionalist Catholic]]s. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[Human sexual activity#Sex outside of marriage|sexual activity]] outside of marriage, remarriage following [[divorce]] without [[annulment]], and against [[same-sex marriage]].

In considering this point, it will be well to begin with the third century, when references to it become frequent and work backwards from this point. In the middle of the third century St. Cyprian expressly terms the Roman See the Chair of St. Peter, saying that Cornelius has succeeded to "the place of Fabian which is the place of Peter" (Ep 55:8; cf. 59:14). Firmilian of Caesarea notices that Stephen claimed to decide the controversy regarding rebaptism on the ground that he held the succession from Peter (Cyprian, Ep. 75:17). He does not deny the claim: yet certainly, had he been able, he would have done so. Thus in 250, the Roman episcopate of Peter was admitted by those best able to know the truth, not merely at Rome but in the churches of Africa and of Asia Minor. In the first quarter of the century (about 220) Tertullian (De Pud. 21) mentions Callistus's claim that Peter's power to forgive sins had descended in a special manner to him. Had the Roman Church been merely founded by Peter and not reckoned him as its first bishop, there could have been no ground for such a contention. Tertullian, like Firmilian, had every motive to deny the claim. Moreover, he had himself resided at Rome, and would have been well aware if the idea of a Roman episcopate of Peter had been, as is contended by its opponents, a novelty dating from the first years of the third century, supplanting the older tradition according to which Peter and Paul were co-founders and Linus first bishop. About the same period, Hippolytus (for Lightfoot is surely right in holding him to be the author of the first part of the "Liberian Catalogue" – "Clement of Rome", 1:259) reckons Peter in the list of Roman bishops...."<ref name=JoyceCE1913/>|}} Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/was-peter-in-rome |title=Was Peter in Rome? |publisher=Catholic Answers |date=10 August 2004 |quote=if Peter never made it to the capital, he still could have been the first pope, since one of his successors could have been the first holder of that office to settle in Rome.

[[Raymond E. Brown]] also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having "roles that would contribute in an essential way to the development of the role of the papacy in the subsequent church". These roles, Brown says, "contributed enormously to seeing the bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal".<ref name="REB">Raymond E.

===Antiquity and Roman Empire===

Conditions in the [[Roman Empire]] facilitated the spread of new ideas. The empire's network of roads and waterways facilitated travel, and the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' made travelling safe. The empire encouraged the spread of a common culture with Greek roots, which allowed ideas to be more easily expressed and understood.<ref name="bokenkotter24">Bokenkotter, p. 24.</ref>

Unlike most religions in the Roman Empire, however, Christianity required its adherents to renounce all other gods, a practice adopted from Judaism (see [[Idolatry]]). The Christians' refusal to join [[Paganism|pagan]] celebrations meant they were unable to participate in much of public life, which caused non-Christians—including government authorities—to fear that the Christians were angering the gods and thereby threatening the peace and prosperity of the Empire. The [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|resulting persecutions]] were a defining feature of Christian self-understanding until Christianity was legalized in the 4th century.<ref name="macculloch155and164">MacCulloch, ''Christianity'', pp. 155–159, 164.</ref>

In 313, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]]'s [[Edict of Milan]] legalized Christianity, and in 330 Constantine moved the imperial capital to [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul, Turkey]]. In 380 the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] made [[Nicene Christianity]] the [[state church of the Roman Empire]], a position that within the diminishing territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]] would persist until the empire itself ended in the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, while elsewhere the church was independent of the empire, as became particularly clear with the [[East–West Schism]]. During the period of the [[Seven Ecumenical Councils]], five primary sees emerged, an arrangement formalized in the mid-6th century by Emperor [[Justinian I]] as the [[pentarchy]] of Rome, [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]].<ref name="Valliere2012">Paul Valliere, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qrt3Z7fyzlUC&pg=PA92&dq=Justinian+pentarchy#v=onepage&q=Justinian%20pentarchy ''Conciliarism''] (Cambridge University Press 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-107-01574-6}}), p. 92</ref><ref name="Bartholomew2008">Patriarch Bartholomew, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4_UB3_UpIcQC&pg=PA3&dq=Justinian+pentarchy#v=onepage&q=Justinian%20pentarchy ''Encountering the Mystery''] (Random House 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-385-52561-9}}), p. 3</ref> In 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]], in a canon of disputed validity,<ref name="Michalopulos">George C.

Most of the Germanic tribes who in the following centuries invaded the Roman Empire had adopted Christianity in its [[Arianism|Arian]] form, which the Catholic Church declared [[Christian heresy|heretical]].<ref>Le Goff, p. 14: "The face of the barbarian invaders had been transformed by another crucial fact.

The massive Islamic invasions of the [[Christianity in the 7th century|mid-7th century]] began a long struggle between [[Christianity and Islam]] throughout the Mediterranean Basin.

In the 11th century, the efforts of [[Hildebrand of Sovana]] led to the creation of the [[College of Cardinals]] to elect new popes, starting with [[Pope Alexander II]] in the [[Papal election, 1061|papal election of 1061]].

The basic election system of the College of Cardinals which Gregory VII helped establish has continued to function into the 21st century.

The [[Age of Discovery]] beginning in the 15th century saw the expansion of Western Europe's political and cultural influence worldwide. Because of the prominent role the strongly Catholic nations of Spain and Portugal played in Western Colonialism, Catholicism was spread to the Americas, Asia and Oceania by explorers, conquistadors, and missionaries, as well as by the transformation of societies through the socio-political mechanisms of colonial rule. [[Pope Alexander VI]] had awarded colonial rights over most of the newly discovered lands to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]]<ref name="Koschorke13">Koschorke, pp. 13, 283</ref> and the ensuing ''[[Patronato real|patronato]]'' system allowed state authorities, not the Vatican, to control all clerical appointments in the new colonies.<ref>Hastings (1994), p. 72</ref> In 1521 the Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] made the first Catholic converts in the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]].<ref name="Koschorke21">Koschorke, p. 21</ref> Elsewhere, Portuguese missionaries under the Spanish Jesuit [[Francis Xavier]] evangelized in India, China, and Japan.<ref name="Koschorke3">Koschorke, pp. 3, 17</ref> The [[French colonization of the Americas]] beginning in the 16th century established a Roman Catholic [[French language|francophone]] population and forbade non-Catholics to settle in [[Quebec]].<ref>Lyons (2013), p. 17</ref>

In 1415, [[Jan Hus]] was burned at the stake for heresy, but his reform efforts encouraged [[Martin Luther]], an [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]] monk in Germany, who [[History of Lutheranism#The start of the Reformation|sent]] his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'' to several bishops in 1517.<ref name="Bokenkotter215">Bokenkotter, p. 215</ref> His theses protested key points of Catholic [[doctrine]] as well as the sale of [[indulgence]]s, and along with the [[Leipzig Debate]] this led to his [[Martin Luther#Excommunication|excommunication]] in 1521.<ref name="Bokenkotter215"/><ref name="Vidmar184">Vidmar, p. 184.</ref> In [[Switzerland]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], [[John Calvin]] and other [[Protestant Reformers]] further criticized Catholic teachings.

The Reformation contributed to clashes between the Protestant [[Schmalkaldic League]] and the Catholic Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and his allies. The first nine-year war ended in 1555 with the [[Peace of Augsburg]] but continued tensions produced a far graver conflict—the [[Thirty Years' War]]—which broke out in 1618.<ref name="Vidmar233"/> In France, a series of conflicts termed the [[French Wars of Religion]] was fought from 1562 to 1598 between the [[Huguenot]]s (French [[Calvinists]]) and the forces of the [[Catholic League (French)|French Catholic League]], which were backed and funded by a series of popes.<ref name="Duffy177">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), pp. 177–178</ref> This ended under [[Pope Clement VIII]], who hesitantly accepted King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV's]] 1598 [[Edict of Nantes]] granting civil and [[religious toleration]] to French Protestants.<ref name="Vidmar233">Vidmar, ''The Catholic Church Through the Ages'' (2005), p. 233</ref><ref name="Duffy177"/>

The [[Council of Trent]] (1545–1563) became the driving force behind the [[Counter-Reformation]] in response to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as [[transubstantiation]] and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation.<ref name="Bokenkotter242">Bokenkotter, pp. 242–244</ref> In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world, in part through missionaries and [[imperialism]], although its hold on European populations declined due to the growth of [[religious scepticism]] during and after the Enlightenment.<ref>Maxwell, Melvin.

The [[Italian unification]] of the 1860s incorporated the Papal States, including Rome itself from 1870, into the [[Kingdom of Italy]], thus ending the papacy's [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]]. In response, Pope Pius IX excommunicated [[Victor Emmanuel II|King Victor Emmanuel II]], refused payment for the land, and rejected the Italian [[Law of Guarantees]], which granted him special privileges.

A number of [[anti-clerical]] governments emerged in the 20th century.

The 1926 [[Calles Law]] separating church and state in Mexico led to the [[Cristero War]]<ref name="Chadwick264">Chadwick, Owen, pp. 264–265</ref> in which more than 3,000&nbsp;priests were exiled or assassinated,<ref name="Scheina">Scheina, p. 33.</ref> churches desecrated, services mocked, nuns raped, and captured priests shot.<ref name="Chadwick264"/> Following the 1917 [[October Revolution]], persecution of the church and Catholics in the [[Soviet Union]] continued into the 1930s, with the execution and exiling of clerics, monks and laymen, the confiscation of religious implements, and closure of churches.<ref>Riasanovsky 617</ref><ref name="Riasanovsky 634">Riasanovsky 634</ref> In the 1936–39 [[Spanish Civil War]], the Catholic hierarchy allied with [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Spanish State|Nationalists]] against the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government,<ref>Payne, p. 13</ref> citing as justification [[Red Terror (Spain)|Republican violence]] against the church.<ref>Alonso, pp. 395–396</ref><ref>''Blood of Spain'', Ronald Fraser p. 415, collective letter of bishops of Spain, addressed to the bishops of the world. {{ISBN|0-7126-6014-3}}</ref> [[Pope Pius XI]] referred to these three countries as a "terrible triangle".<ref>Fontenelle, Mrg R (1939), ''Seine Heiligkeit Pius XI'', p. 164.

After violations of the 1933 [[Reichskonkordat]] between the church and [[Nazi Germany]], [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the 1937 encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', which publicly condemned the Nazis' persecution of the church and their ideology of [[Modern Paganism|neo-paganism]] and [[Supremacism|racial superiority]].<ref name="Rhodes182">Rhodes, pp. 182–183</ref><ref name="Rhodes197">Rhodes, p. 197</ref><ref name="Rhodes204">Rhodes, pp. 204–205</ref> The church condemned the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]] that started [[World War II]] and other subsequent wartime Nazi invasions.<ref name="Cook983">Cook, p. 983</ref> Thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and brothers were imprisoned and murdered throughout the countries occupied by the Nazis, including Saints [[Maximilian Kolbe]] and [[Edith Stein]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp |title=Non-Jewish Victims of Persecution in Germany |publisher=Yad Vashem |access-date=28 October 2010}}</ref> While [[Pope Pius XII]] has been credited with helping to [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|save hundreds of thousands of Jews]] during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]],<ref>Bokenkotter p. 192</ref><ref name="Deák">Deák, p. 182</ref> the church has also been accused of having encouraged centuries of [[Christianity and antisemitism|antisemitism]] by its teachings<ref>{{cite news |last=Eakin |first=Emily |title=New Accusations Of a Vatican Role In Anti-Semitism; Battle Lines Were Drawn After Beatification of Pope Pius IX |work=The New York Times |date=1 September 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/01/arts/new-accusations-vatican-role-anti-semitism-battle-lines-were-drawn-after.html |access-date=9 March 2008}}</ref> and not doing enough to stop Nazi atrocities.<ref name="Phayer">Phayer, pp. 50–57</ref>

{{Main|Second Vatican Council|History of the Catholic Church since 1962|Spirit of Vatican II}}
The [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965) introduced the most significant changes to Catholic practices since the [[Council of Trent]], four centuries before.<ref>The Second Vatican Council Celebrating Its Achievements and the Future p. 86</ref> Initiated by [[Pope John XXIII]], this ecumenical council modernised the practices of the Catholic Church, allowing the Mass to be said in the [[vernacular]] (local language) and encouraging "fully conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |title=Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy Sacrosanctum Concilium |publisher=Vatican.va |date=4 December 1963 |access-date=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221180735/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html |archive-date=21 February 2008}}</ref> It intended to engage the church more closely with the present world (''[[aggiornamento]]''), which was described by its advocates as an "opening of the windows".<ref name="Duffy272">Duffy, pp. 270–276</ref> In addition to changes in the liturgy, it led to changes to the church's approach to [[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenism]],<ref>Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), pp. 272, 274</ref> and a call to improved relations with non-Christian religions, especially [[Judaism]], in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]''.<ref name="NOSTRA AETATE">Pope Paul VI.

According to Section 4: "True, the Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead pressed for the death of Christ; still, what happened in His passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction, then alive, nor against the Jews of today. Although the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures."</ref>

The council, however, generated significant controversy in implementing its reforms: proponents of the "[[Spirit of Vatican II]]" such as Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] said that Vatican II had "not gone far enough" to change church policies.<ref>Bauckham, p. 373</ref> [[Traditionalist Catholics]], such as [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]], however, strongly criticized the council, arguing that its liturgical reforms led "to the destruction of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the sacraments", among other issues.<ref>O'Neel, Brian.

Several teachings of the Catholic Church came under increased scrutiny both concurrent with and following the council; among those teachings was the church's teaching regarding the immorality of [[Birth control|contraception]]. The recent introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] (including "the pill"), which were believed by some to be morally different from previous methods, prompted John XXIII to form a committee to advise him of the moral and theological issues with the new method.<ref>{{cite book |last=May |first=John F. |title=World Population Policies: Their Origin, Evolution, and Impact |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |pages=202–203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCQRxtm3Z34C&pg=PA203 |isbn=978-94-007-2837-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kinkel |first=R.

Paul did not agree with the arguments presented, and eventually issued ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', saying that it upheld the constant teaching of the church against contraception. It expressly included hormonal methods as prohibited.<ref group="note">While ruling contraception to be prohibited, Pope Paul VI did, however, consider natural family planning methods to be morally permissible if used with just cause.</ref> This document generated a largely negative response from many Catholics.{{From whom?|date=September 2016}}<ref name="HV_then_now">{{cite web |url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/germain-grisez-on-humanae-vitae-then-and-now |title=Germain Grisez on "Humanae Vitae", Then and Now: The Dust Still Hasn't Settled, But There Are Signs of Hope |publisher=Zenit: The World Seen from Rome |date=14 July 2003 |access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref>

====Pope Francis====
{{main|Pope Francis}}
Pope Francis, the current pope of the Catholic Church, succeeded Pope Benedict XVI in 2013 as the first pope from the [[Americas]], the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first Pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century. Pope Francis has been noted for his [[humility]], emphasis on God's mercy, concern for the [[poverty|poor]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], as well as his commitment to [[interfaith dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors.

Pope Francis is recognised for his efforts "to further close the nearly 1,000-year estrangement with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Churches]]".<ref name="orthodox">Ritter, Karl, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/15/pope-francis-jews_n_2883560.html "Pope Francis reaches out to Jews"], huffingtonpost.com, 16 March 2013.

The Churches which, while not existing in perfect ''Koinonia'' with the Catholic Church, remain united to her by means of the closest bonds, that is, by apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist, are true [[particular Churches]]. Therefore, the Church of Christ is present and operative also in these Churches, even though they lack full communion with the Catholic Church since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy, which, according to the will of God, the Bishop of Rome objectively has and exercises over the entire Church. ... 'The Christian faithful are therefore not permitted to imagine that the Church of Christ is nothing more than a collection—divided, yet in some way one—of Churches and [[ecclesial community|ecclesial communities]]; nor are they free to hold that today the Church of Christ nowhere really exists, and must be considered only as a goal which all Churches and ecclesial communities must strive to reach.'}}</ref>

The term ''sui iuris'' is an innovation of the CCEO, and it denotes the relative autonomy of the oriental Catholic Churches. This canonical term, pregnant with many juridical nuances, indicates the God-given mission of the Oriental Catholic Churches to keep up their patrimonial autonomous nature. And the autonomy of these churches is relative in the sense that it is under the supreme authority of the Roman Pontiff. — Fr. Thomas Kuzhinapurath, 1998}}</ref>-->
