'''Antireligion''' is opposition to [[religion]] of any kind.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anti-religion|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anti-religion|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Antireligion|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/antireligion|website=Collins Dictionary|publisher=Collins Dictionary Online|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Bullivant|first1=Stephen|last2=Lee|first2=Lois|title=A Dictionary of Atheism|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191816819}}</ref> It involves opposition to [[organized religion]], [[religious ritual|religious practices]] or [[religious institutions]]. The term ''antireligion'' has also been used to describe opposition to specific forms of supernatural worship or practice, whether organized [[spiritual but not religious|or not]].

Opposition to religion also goes beyond the [[Misotheism|misotheistic]] spectrum.{{what|date=July 2020}} As such, antireligion is distinct from deity-specific positions such as [[atheism]] (the lack of belief in deities) and [[antitheism]] (an opposition to belief in deities); although "antireligionists" may also be atheists or antitheists.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2020}}
An early form of mass antireligion was expressed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as early as the 17th century. [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s book ''Christianity Unveiled'' published in 1761, attacked not only Christianity but religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to historian [[Michael Burleigh]], antireligion found its first mass expression of barbarity in [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] as "organised ... irreligion...an 'anti-clerical' and self-styled 'non-religious' state" responded violently to religious influence over society.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]] ''Earthly Powers'' p 96-97 {{ISBN|0-00-719572-9}}</ref>

The [[Soviet Union]] adopted the political ideology of [[Marxism–Leninism]].

Massive state resources have been expended not only to prevent the implanting of religious belief in nonbelievers but also to eradicate "prerevolutionary remnants" already existing. The regime is not merely passively committed to a godless polity but takes an aggressive stance of official forced atheization. Thus a major task of the police apparatus is the persecution of forms of religious practice. Not surprisingly, the Committee for State Security (KGB) is reported to have a division dealing specifically with "churchmen and sectarians."</ref> It directed varying degrees of antireligious efforts at varying faiths, depending on what threat they posed to the Soviet state, and their willingness to subordinate itself to political authority.

Authorities in the [[People's Republic of Romania]] aimed to move towards an atheistic society, in which religion would be considered as the ideology of the bourgeoisie; the régime also set to propagate among the laboring masses in science, politics and culture to help them fight [[superstition]] and [[mysticism]], and initiated an anti-religious campaign aimed at reducing the influence of religion in society.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Leustean|first1=Lucian|title=Orthodoxy and the Cold War: Religion and Political Power in Romania, 1947-65|date=2009|publisher=la University of Michigan|isbn=978-3447058742|pages=92–93|quote= One of the main aims of the regime was to transform Romania into a communist atheist society in which religion was considered the ideology of the bourgeoise.

== Notable antireligious people ==
{{expand list|date=November 2014}}
===Philosophers===

* [[Lucretius]] (99 BC – 55 BC){{cn|date=July 2020}}
* [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809), English-American author and [[Deism|deist]] who wrote a scathing critique on religion in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793–4): "All national institutions of churches, whether [[Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], or Turkish [i.e. [[Muslim]]], appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit".
* [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883), German philosopher, social scientist, socialist. He is well known for his antireligious views. He said "religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness".<ref>Marx, K. 1976. ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right]''.

* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, composer, and Latin and Greek scholar. He wrote several critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for metaphor and irony.{{cn|date=July 2020}}
* [[John Dewey]] (1859–1952), an American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher, who believed neither religion nor [[metaphysics]] could provide legitimate moral or social values, though scientific [[empiricism]] could (see [[science of morality]]).<ref>"Dewey felt that science alone contributed to 'human good,' which he defined exclusively in naturalistic terms. He rejected religion and metaphysics as valid supports for moral and social values, and felt that success of the scientific method presupposed the destruction of old knowledge before the new could be created. ... (Dewey, 1929, pp. 95, 145) "William Adrian,</ref>
* [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), English logician and philosopher who believed that authentic philosophy could only be pursued given an atheistic foundation of "unyielding despair". In 1948, he famously debated the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and [[History of philosophy|philosophical historian]] Father [[Frederick Copleston]] on the [[existence of God]].<ref>''"I think all the great religions of the world{{spaced ndash}}[[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Communism]]{{spaced ndash}}both untrue and harmful. It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true.&nbsp;... I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue."''

* [[Richard Dawkins]] (born 1941), English biologist, one of the "four horsemen" of [[New Atheism]]. He wrote ''[[The God Delusion]]'', criticizing [[Theism|belief in the divine]], in 2006.<ref>"Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where's the harm? September 11th changed all that. Revealed faith is not harmless nonsense, it can be lethally dangerous nonsense. Dangerous because it gives people unshakeable confidence in their own righteousness. Dangerous because it gives them false courage to kill themselves, which automatically removes normal barriers to killing others. Dangerous because it teaches enmity to others labelled only by a difference of inherited tradition. And dangerous because we have all bought into a weird respect, which uniquely protects religion from normal criticism. Let's now stop being so damned respectful!" The Guardian, 2001-10-11</ref>

* [[Steven Pinker]] (born 1954), Canadian-American cognitive scientist who believes religion incites violence.<ref>"[T]he Bible, contrary to what a majority of Americans apparently believe, is far from a source of higher moral values. Religions have given us stonings, witch-burnings, crusades, inquisitions, jihads, fatwas, suicide bombers, gay-bashers, abortion-clinic gunmen, and mothers who drown their sons so they can happily be united in heaven."
