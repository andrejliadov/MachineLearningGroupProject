The '''Center for the Study of Democracy''' is a research and education institute at [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] that focuses on the study of the history of emerging democracy in [[St. Mary's City, Maryland]], the site of Maryland'a first colonial capital and the location of many firsts in the development of democratic rights in North America; this work is done in conjunction with studies of modern democracies.

The mission of the Center for the Study of Democracy is to draw historical lessons and also inspiration from history, in order to increase understanding of the processes and principles that lead to the constructive maintenance and enhancement of democracy in the United States and around the world.

It does so by drawing on in-depth historical research, in conjunction with in-depth research on modern democracy-related issues and events, as they both relate to the process of [[democratization]] (establishing and improving democracy in all of its processes).

The center also sponsors numerous ongoing public forums and debates and seminars on these issues, many of which are covered by the media.

The debates also often include hosting and moderating major political leaders or policy leaders facing off against their opponents.

The Center for the Study of Democracy also strives to better understand historic setbacks and inconsistencies in the [[democratization]] process of historic Maryland and the United States, in order to better understand how these were eventually overcome; taking lessons from history that can then be applied to study of how democracy might be more constructively furthered today. The center Works in particular to increase understanding of how democracy may be enhanced in spite of the many obstacles that democratization often faces.

The center is jointly run by the Public Honors College, [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]] and its partner institution and neighbor, [[St. Mary's City, Maryland#Historic St. Mary's City|Historic St. Mary's City]], one of the nation's preeminent historical and archeological research institutions,
