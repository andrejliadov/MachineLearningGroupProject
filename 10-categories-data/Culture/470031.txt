Anecdotes may be real or fictional;<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Kennedy |first=X.

==Etymology==

The word ''anecdote'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀνέκδοτον "unpublished", literally "not given out") comes from [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the biographer of [[Justinian I]], who produced a work entitled {{lang|grc|Ἀνέκδοτα}} (''Anekdota'', variously translated as ''Unpublished Memoirs'' or ''Secret History''), which is primarily a collection of short incidents from the private life of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] court. Gradually, the term "anecdote" came to be applied<ref>Its first appearance in English is of 1676 (''[[OED]]'').</ref> to any short tale utilized to emphasize or illustrate whatever point the author wished to make. In the context of Greek, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Russian humor]], an anecdote refers to any short humorous story without the need of factual or biographical origins.

== As evidence ==
{{main|Anecdotal evidence}}
Anecdotal evidence is an informal account of [[evidence]] in the form of an anecdote. The term is often used in contrast to [[scientific evidence]], as evidence that cannot be investigated using the [[scientific method]]. The problem with arguing based on anecdotal evidence is that anecdotal evidence is not necessarily typical; only statistical evidence can determine how typical something is. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is an [[informal fallacy]].

When used in [[advertising]] or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal evidence is often called a [[testimonial]]. The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. [[Psychologist]]s have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than the typical example.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}
