The '''balady citron''' is a variety of [[citron]], or ''[[etrog]]'', grown in [[Israel]], mostly for Jewish ritual purposes. Not native to the region, it was imported around 500 or 300 BCE by either Jewish or Greek settlers. Initially not widely grown, it was promoted and popularized in the 1870s by Rabbi [[Chaim Elozor Wax]].

== Etymology ==
''[[wikt:بلدي|Balady]] ({{lang-ar|بلدي}})'' is [[Arabic]] for "native." Local Arab farmers began using this name in the mid-19th century to distinguish this variety from the [[Greek citron]], which was cultivated along the [[Jaffa]] seashore.<ref>[http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf קונטרס פרי עץ הדר, ירושלים תרל"ח] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410122008/http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}</ref>

The balady citron is an [[acid]]ic variety, alongside the [[Florentine citron|Florentine]] and [[Diamante citron]] from [[Italy]], and the [[Greek citron]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234002705 | title=A review on citron-pharmacognosy, phytochemistry and medicinal uses |author1=Meena, Ajay Kumar |author2=Kandale, Ajit |author3=Rao, M.

"Palestinian citrons began to figure in the European market in the late 1850s. These etrogim, however, met considerable opposition from certain Orthodox communities on the grounds that they were grafted. To counteract this unfavorable propaganda, a group of Palestinian rabbis investigated the situation and published a volume to inform world Jewry in which areas grafting was practiced and which exporters could not be relied upon, thus by implication putting the seal of approval upon the rest. The rabbis denied that grafting was universal in Palestine."</ref>
{{Yishuv haYashan}}
In the 1870s, Rabbi [[Chaim Elozor Wax]] devoted himself to its cultivation and organized shipments to [[Europe]]. He felt the Balady citron had the strongest traditional lineage of species pureness, and claimed it was to be found in the wild when [[Nahmanides]] (d. 1270) arrived in the county. He wrote many letters to the rabbis hoping  to influence the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] to use the Balady citron. These letters were published in his [[responsa]] ''Nefesh Haya'' and the responsa of his correspondents, as well as in pamphlets addressing the Greek citron controversy.<ref>תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.
שו"ת ביכורי שלמה סי' לח</ref>  Under his influence, many Jews began to purchase the Balady instead of the [[Greek citron]].<ref name="auto">תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.</ref> While the variety was not domesticated, it was used by important scholars and pious Jews who believed in its  purity and appropriateness.<ref>שו"ת נפש חיה או"ח סי' ב-ד
* תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרקים ח-י.</ref> Rabbi Wax also saw the trade in this citron as an important source of economic income for the [[Yishuv haYashan|Jewish community in Palestine]]. He invested large sums establishing orchards in [[Hittin]] donating the profits to charity.<ref name="auto" /> In 1875, Wax planted 600 trees and by 1883 over 40,000 citrons had been exported.<ref>[http://kupathrabbimeir.org/t-OurHistory.aspx Our History], Kupath Rabbi Meir Baal Haness.</ref>

The pro-[[Zionist]] newspapers ''HaMelitz'' and ''HaLevanon'' were instrumental in stirring up interest in etrog cultivation in Israel, which was seen as important in paving the way for Jewish independence.<ref>יוסף שלמון, הפולמוס על אתרוגי קורפו ואתרוגי ארץ ישראל - 1875–1891, ציון - רבעון לחקר תולדות ישראל, שנה סה (תש"ס) עמוד 75 והלאה.</ref>  Some years before,{{when|date=April 2016}} the Greek citron had already been [[Greek citron#Introduction to Israel|introduced for plantation]] by newly arrived [[Sephardic]] Jews with the financial backing of Sir [[Moses Montefiore]]. The new Greek-Jaffa variety was more commercially successful than Balady.<ref>[http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf קונטרס פרי עץ הדר, השותפים סלאנט, ירושלים תרל"ח] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410122008/http://www.jafgifts.com/esrog/Pri_Etz_Hadar_Jerusalem.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}

The supporters of the Balady were strained in a conflict of interest. While the Greek citron grown in [[Jaffa]] showed a good economical future, the [[Halachic]] intentions were against it. As a partial solution, the Greek-Jaffa citron was occasionally grafted onto Balady [[rootstock]]. The progeny achieved the beautiful properties of the [[grafting|scion]] type, while the possible influence of lemon rootstock was assumed to be flushed, and replaced with that of the most kosher Balady rootstock<ref>Igros HoRaye 114</ref> At some point, Rabbi Wax was forced to relent and commence [[topworking]] to part of his orchard, in order to replace part of the crop with the Greek citron.<ref>תולדות הנפש חיה, י.ד. בית הלוי, פרק ח.

== Rescue and selections ==

The [[Old Yishuv]] rabbis [[Shmuel Salant]] and [[Meir Auerbach]] supported the progeny of Umm el-Fahm, but those declined quickly. Later, some Israeli rabbis did their utmost for the rescue of Balady. Each collected propagation material from a different place and brought it into cultivation under close supervision. This is how a diversity of sub-varieties or selections with different names developed.<ref name="auto1">אתרוגי ארץ ישראל, זהר עמר, תשע"א</ref>

The list of [[rabbi]]s who were instrumental includes (arranged in order of date): Rabbi Zarach Reuven Braverman founder and dean of the [[Yeshiva]] [[Mea Shearim]]; Rabbi [[Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld]];<ref>According to Professor [[Eliezer E. Goldschmidt]] (''Hilkhot Sadeh'', issue 146, Elul 5765, Page 24) the ''Kibilewitz-etrog'' was obtained in 1910 at the remote nature of [[Wadi Qelt]]. According to the Widow Kibilewitz and Mr. & Mrs. Kelli, it was obtained by Rabbi Sonnenfeld.</ref> and students and close disciples of Rabbi [[Yehoshua Leib Diskin]], who are said to have been inspired to this ambition by their master.<ref name="auto1" />

When the [[Chazon Ish]] reached the Holy Land, he made his own selection according to his satisfaction. To Yakov Halperin, founder of [[Zichron Meir]] in [[Bnei Brak]], he gave plantings of the variety called Halperin-Chazon Ish; and to Rabbi [[Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz]], the variety called Lefkowitz-Chazon Ish.<ref>Menachem Pines, (September 2009). [http://halachicadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/The-Etrog-TREE-OF-THE-CHAZON-ISH.pdf "The Chazon Ish's Magic Esrog Tree"], ''[[Mishpacha]]''.</ref>

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] promoted the intraspecific graft from the [[Greek citron]] onto Balady citron rootstock, and granted his [[Hechsher]] for this, believing that it was a practical solution to grow beautiful etrogs that were also kosher. However, he still acknowledged the halachic promotion of those etrogs cultivated at different Arabic villages, that were never as nice but were praised for not being grafted.<ref>.אגרות הראי"ה, חלק א, סימן נב, עמוד סא</ref>

Balady citron varieties are still grown and sold today in [[diaspora]] as well as in [[Israel]], and are favored by the followers of the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rov]] and the Chazon Ish.<ref>See [[:he:אתרוג|Etrog in Hebrew Wikipedia]]</ref>
