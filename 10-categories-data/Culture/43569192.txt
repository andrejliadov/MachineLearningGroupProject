'''Aversion to happiness''', also called '''cherophobia''' and '''fear of happiness''', is an attitude towards [[happiness]] in which individuals may deliberately avoid experiences that invoke positive emotions or happiness.<ref>{{cite journal|last2= Lepshokova|first2= Z.

One of several reasons why cherophobia may develop is the belief that when one becomes [[Happiness|happy]], a negative event will soon occur that will taint that happiness, as if punishing that individual for satisfaction. This belief is thought to be more prevalent in [[eastern world|Eastern]] cultures. In [[Western cultures]], such as [[American culture]], "it is almost taken for granted that happiness is one of the most important values guiding people's [[personal life|lives]]". Western cultures are more driven by an urge to maximize happiness and to minimize sadness. Failing to appear happy often gives cause for concern. The value placed on happiness echoes through Western [[positive psychology]] and through research on subjective well-being.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.springer.com/about+springer/media/springer+select?SGWID=0-11001-6-1457741-0 |title= What's so bad about feeling happy? |date= 17 March 2014 |author= Joan Robinson |publisher= Springer}}</ref> Fear of happiness is associated with fragility of happiness beliefs, suggesting that one of the causes of aversion to happiness may be the belief that happiness is unstable and fragile.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Fragility of Happiness Beliefs Across 15 National Groups|first1= Mohsen|last1= Joshanloo|first2= Dan|last2= Weijers|first3= Ding-Yu|last3= Jiang|first4= Gyuseog|last4= Han|first5= Jaechang|last5= Bae|first6= Joyce S.|last6= Pang|first7= Lok Sang|last7= Ho|first8= Maria Cristina|last8= Ferreira|first9= Melikşah|last9= Demir|first10= Muhammad|last10= Rizwan|first11= Imran Ahmed|last11= Khilji|first12= Mustapha|last12= Achoui|first13= Ryosuke|last13= Asano|first14= Tasuku|last14= Igarashi|first15= Saori|last15= Tsukamoto|first16= Sanne M.

==Cultural factors==
Joshanloo and Weijers identify four reasons for an aversion to happiness: (1) a belief that happiness will cause bad things to happen; (2) that happiness will cause you to become a bad person; (3) that expressing happiness is somehow bad for you and others; and (4) that pursuing happiness is bad for you and others.<ref>{{citation |title=It's time for Western psychology to recognise that many individuals, and even entire cultures, fear happiness |journal=Journal of Happiness Studies |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=717–735 |url=http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/07/its-time-for-western-psychology-to.html |accessdate=October 4, 2014|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9489-9 |last1=Joshanloo |first1=Mohsen |last2=Weijers |first2=Dan |s2cid=144425713 }}.</ref> For example, "some people—in Western and Eastern cultures—are wary of happiness because they believe that bad things, such as unhappiness, suffering, and death, tend to happen to happy people."<ref name="livescience44233">{{citation |title=Why Happiness Scares Us |author=Stephanie Pappas |url=http://www.livescience.com/44233-fear-of-happiness.html |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |date=20 March 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.</ref>

These findings "call into question the notion that happiness is the ultimate goal, a belief echoed in any number of articles and [[self-help]] publications about whether certain choices are likely to make you happy".<ref name="livescience44233"/> Also, "in cultures that believe worldly happiness to be associated with sin, shallowness, and moral decline will actually feel less satisfied when their lives are (by other standards) going well",<ref>{{citation |title=13 of Psychology's Newest and Coolest Ideas |author=Susan Krauss Whitbourne |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201304/13-psychology-s-newest-and-coolest-ideas |publisher=[[Psychology Today]] |date=6 April 2013 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}.</ref> so measures of personal happiness cannot simply be considered a yardstick for satisfaction with one's life, and attitudes such as aversion to happiness have important implications for measuring happiness across cultures and ranking nations on [[Happiness economics|happiness scores]].

Aversion to happiness can be thought of as a specific example of ''ideal affect'' (described by affect valuation theory),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tsai |first1=Jeanne L. |last2=Louie |first2=Jennifer Y. |last3=Chen |first3=Eva E. |last4=Uchida |first4=Yukiko |title=Learning What Feelings to Desire: Socialization of Ideal Affect Through Children's Storybooks |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |date=2007 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=17–30 |doi=10.1177/0146167206292749|pmid=17178927 |s2cid=3163885 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tsai |first1=Jeanne L |title=Ideal affect in daily life: implications for affective experience, health, and social behavior |journal=Current Opinion in Psychology |date=October 2017 |volume=17 |pages=118–128 |doi=10.1016/j.copsyc.2017.07.004|pmid=28950957 |pmc=5659332 }}</ref> whereby cultures vary in the extent to which they value the experience of different emotions.
