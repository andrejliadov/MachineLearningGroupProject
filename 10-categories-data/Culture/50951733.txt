'''Human interactions with microbes''' include both practical and symbolic uses of [[microbe]]s, and negative interactions in the form of human, domestic animal, and crop diseases.

Practical use of microbes began in ancient times with [[fermentation in food processing]]; [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]] have been produced by [[yeast]]s from the dawn of civilisation, such as in [[ancient Egypt]]. More recently, microbes have been used in activities from [[biological warfare]] to the production of chemicals by fermentation, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including [[enzyme]]s and bioactive molecules such as [[hormone]]s and [[competitive inhibition|competitive inhibitors]] for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as [[ethanol]] and [[methane]]; [[Algae fuel|fuels may also be produced by algae]]. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in [[sewage treatment]]. In scientific research, yeasts and the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' serve as [[model organism]]s especially in [[genetics]] and related fields.

On the symbolic side, an early poem about brewing is the [[Sumer]]ian "Hymn to [[Ninkasi]]", from 1800 BC. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': addressed people's fear of deadly contagion and the moral decline that could result. Novelists have exploited the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic possibilities]] of [[pandemic]]s from [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1826 ''[[The Last Man]]'' and [[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' onwards. [[Hilaire Belloc]] wrote a humorous poem to "The Microbe" in 1912. Dramatic plagues and mass infection have formed the story lines of many [[Hollywood]] films, starting with ''[[Nosferatu]]'' in 1922. In 1971, ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' told the tale of an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial microbe]] threatening life on Earth. [[Microbiologist]]s since [[Alexander Fleming]] have used coloured or [[fluorescence|fluorescing]] colonies of bacteria to create miniature artworks.

Microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es are important as [[pathogen]]s, causing disease to humans, [[crop plant]]s, and [[domestic animal]]s.

===Food production===
{{Main|Fermentation in food processing}}

Controlled [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] with microbes in [[brewing]], [[wine making]], [[baking]], [[pickling]] and cultured [[dairy product]]s such as [[yogurt]] and [[cheese]], is used to modify ingredients to make [[foods]] with desirable properties. The [[List of microorganisms used in food and beverage preparation|principal microbes involved]] are [[yeast]]s, in the case of beer, wine, and ordinary [[bread]]; and [[bacteria]], in the case of [[anaerobic respiration|anaerobically]] fermented [[vegetable]]s, [[dairy product]]s, and [[sourdough]] bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including [[alcohol]], [[organic acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[carbon dioxide]]. Safety is maintained with the help of [[food microbiology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsci.uoguelph.ca/dairyedu/micro.html |title= Dairy Microbiology |access-date=9 October 2006 |publisher= University of Guelph}}</ref><ref name=Steinkraus>{{cite book |editor=Steinkraus, K.

===Water treatment===

Oxidative sewage treatment processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing [[methane]] gas and a sterile mineralised residue. In [[potable water]] treatment, one method, the [[slow sand filter]], employs a complex gelatinous layer composed of a wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Biology of Wastewater Treatment | url=https://archive.org/details/biologywastewate00gray | url-access=limited | author=Gray, N.F. | publisher=Imperial College Press | year=2004 | page=[https://archive.org/details/biologywastewate00gray/page/n1181 1164] | isbn=978-1-86094-332-4}}</ref>

===Chemicals, enzymes ===
[[File:Penicillin bioreactor.jpg|thumb|An early [[Penicillin]] bioreactor, from 1957, now in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
{{main|Industrial enzymes}}

Microorganisms are used for many commercial and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, [[enzymes]] and other bioactive molecules, often through [[protein engineering]]. For example, [[acetic acid]] is produced by the  bacterium ''[[Acetobacter aceti]]'', while [[citric acid]] is produced by the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, [[Streptokinase]] produced by the bacterium ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and modified by [[genetic engineering]] is used [[clot buster|to remove clots]] from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a [[myocardial infarctions|heart attack]]. [[Cyclosporin A]] is an [[immunosuppressive agent]] in [[organ transplantation]], while [[statins]] produced by the yeast ''[[Monascus purpureus]]'' serve as [[blood cholesterol]] lowering agents, [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibiting]] the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.<ref>{{cite book |title=Biology textbook for class XII |publisher=National council of educational research and training |isbn=978-81-7450-639-9 |page=183|year=2006 }}</ref>

Microorganisms are essential tools in [[biotechnology]], [[biochemistry]], [[genetics]], and [[molecular biology]]. The yeasts brewer's yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') and fission yeast (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'') are important [[model organism]]s in science, since they are simple [[eukaryote]]s that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Castrillo J.I. |author2=Oliver S.

[[Microbial art]] is the creation of artworks by culturing bacteria, typically on [[agar plate]]s, to form desired patterns. These may be chosen to [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under ultraviolet light in different colours.<ref name=Science2009>{{cite journal |editor-last=Torrice |editor-first=Michael |date=6 November 2009 |title=Petri Dish Artists |journal=Science |publisher=AAAS |volume=326 |issue=5954 |page=777 |doi=10.1126/science.326_777b }}</ref> [[Alexander Fleming]], the discoverer of [[penicillin]], created "germ paintings" using different species of bacteria that were naturally pigmented in different colours.<ref name=Fleming>{{cite web| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Painting-With-Penicillin-Alexander-Flemings-Germ-Art.html |title=Painting With Penicillin: Alexander Fleming's Germ Art |author=Dunn, Rob |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=11 July 2010}}</ref>

An instance of a [[protist]] in an artwork is the artist [[Louise Bourgeois]]'s [[bronze]] sculpture ''Amoeba''. It has a white [[patina]] resembling plaster, and was designed in 1963–5, based on drawings of a pregnant woman's belly that she made as early as the 1940s. According to the [[Tate Gallery]], the work "is a roughly modelled organic form, its bulges and single opening suggesting a moving, living creature in the stages of evolution."<ref>{{cite web|title=Louise Bourgeois.

===Disease===
{{main|Pathogen}}

Microorganisms are the causative agents ([[pathogen]]s) in many infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals. [[Pathogenic bacteria]] cause diseases such as [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[anthrax]]. Protozoa cause diseases including [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[dysentery]] and [[toxoplasmosis]]. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as [[ringworm]], [[candidiasis]] and [[histoplasmosis]]. [[Pathogenic viruses]] cause diseases such as [[influenza]], [[yellow fever]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Alberts, B. |author2=Johnson, A. |author3=Lewis, J.  |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |publisher=Garland Science |date=2002 |section=Introduction to Pathogens |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26917/ |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metapathogen.com | title=MetaPathogen | access-date=15 January 2015 }}</ref>

The [[tulip breaking virus]] played a role in the [[tulip mania]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. The famous Semper Augustus tulip, in particular, owed its striking pattern to infection with the plant disease, a kind of [[mosaic virus]], making it the most expensive of all the tulip bulbs sold.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused |author=Dash, Mike |date=2001 |publisher=Gollancz}}</ref>
