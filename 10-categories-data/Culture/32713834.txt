The Coöperative also has business units in Belgium, Germany, France, Spain, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Ukraine, Brazil, Uruguay and China.

==History==

===Agrifirm till 2011===
[[File:Agrifirm.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Agrifirm headquarters in [[Apeldoorn]]]]
Agrifirm grew out from the Cooperative Agricultural Bank and Trading Company (''Coöperatieve Landbouwersbank en Handelsvereeniging'') established on 13 April 1909 with the purpose of taking advantage of joint purchasing and sales of agricultural products and equipment. The office was located in Meppel. Later on, it was expended further with a feed mill, grain silos and fertilizer sheds. Besides, it operated as a bank as well as a plant for artificial [[insemination]].

The original function of the company was expended due to several mergers in the 1960s and 1970s. At that time the name of the company was Cooperative Agricultural Bank Meppel (''Coöperatieve Landbouwersbank Meppel - CLM''). In the 1980s the bank division became an independent operating unit as Rabobank Meppel and surroundings. In 1990 there was a merger among CLM, Aceco (Groningen) and CAF (Leeuwarden) resulting in the Purchase and Sales Cooperative Meppel (''Aan- en verkoop Coöperatie Meppel - ACM''). The "old" Agrifirm - which has covered two-thirds of the Netherlands in terms of providing agricultural products and services (excluding Southern Netherlands) - was established due to the merger between ACM and Cavo Latuco (in Utrecht) in 2002. Since 1 June 2010 Agrifirm as it now exists following the merger between the Agrifirm cooperative (in Meppel) and Cehave Landbouwbelang (in [[Veghel]]) – the latest had the jurisdiction in Southern Netherlands. The head office is located in Apeldoorn.

===Cehave Landbouwbelang till 2011===

The agricultural cooperative organization of Cehave Landbouwbelang (CHV LBB) was formed by the merger of Cehave and Landbouwbelang in 2000. Both companies covered a different region: Cehave was active in [[North Brabant]] while Landbouwbelang operated in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. The headquarters of the cooperative organization was located in [[Veghel]].

In 2007 the cooperative had approximately 5300 Dutch members and owned a number of companies mainly active in the field of animal feed production and trade. With 1500 employees Cehave Landbouwbelang operated in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Hungary and China and was continuously growing further during years. In 2010 CHV LBB merged with Agrifirm and the "new" Agrifirm as it is now was established. However CHV LBB lost its name during the merger, the old logo still exists with the new Agrifirm slogan of "Link to Success".{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
