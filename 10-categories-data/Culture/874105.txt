A '''sun cross''', '''solar cross''', or '''wheel cross''' is a [[solar symbol]] consisting of an equilateral [[cross]] inside a [[circle]].

The design is frequently found in the symbolism of prehistoric cultures,  particularly during the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] to [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] periods of European prehistory. The symbol's ubiquity and apparent importance in [[prehistoric religion]] have given rise to its interpretation as a solar symbol, whence the modern English term "sun cross" (a [[calque]] of {{lang-de|Sonnenkreuz}}).

The same symbol is in use as a modern [[astronomical symbol]] representing the Earth rather than the Sun. In [[pharmacy]], sun cross symbol represents [[pharmaceutical drug|various/miscellaneous drugs]].

==Interpretation as solar symbol==
The interpretation of the simple equilateral cross as a solar symbol in Bronze Age religion was widespread in 19th-century scholarship. The cross-in-a-circle was interpreted as a solar symbol derived from the interpretation of the disc of the Sun as the wheel of the [[chariot]] of the [[Sun god]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Martin Persson Nilsson |title=The Minoan‚ÄìMycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion |publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers |year=1950 |page=421 |quote=there is a wide-spread opinion that the equal-limbed cross is another symbol of the sun. It was, for example, a favorite theory of the late [[Oscar Montelius|Professor Montelius]], and has been embraced by many other archaeologists; its wide acceptance being due to an interest in finding a pre-Christian origin of the symbol of Christianity. The disc of the sun was regarded as a wheel; hence the myth that the sun-god drives in a chariot across the heavens. }}</ref>
Wieseler (1881) postulated an (unattested) [[Gothic rune]] {{lang|is|hvel}} ("wheel") representing the solar deity by the "wheel" symbol of a cross-in-a-circle, reflected by the [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic letter]] ''[[hwair]]'' (êçà).<ref>{{lang|de|
Karl Georg Wieseler|italic=no}} (1813‚Äì83), {{lang|de|Untersuchungen Zur Geschichte Und Religion Der Alten Germanen in Asien und Europa|italic=yes}}, 1881, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=FtgRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA157 p. 157].
The suggestion of a specifically Gothic variant of the runic alphabet partially preserved in the Gothic alphabet is due to [[Jacob Grimm]]'s {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mythologie]]|italic=yes}} (1835).</ref>

The English term "Sun-Cross", on the other hand, is comparatively recent, apparently loaned from German {{lang|de|Sonnenkreuz}} and used in the 1955 translation of [[Rudolf Koch]]'s ''Book of Signs'' ("The Sun-Cross or Cross of [[Wotan]]", p. 94).

The German term {{lang|de|Sonnenkreuz}} was used in 19th-century scholarly literature of any cross symbol interpreted as a solar symbol, an equilateral cross either with or without a circle, or an oblique cross ([[Crux decussata|Saint Andrew's cross]]). {{lang|de|Sonnenkreuz}} was used of the flag design of the [[Paneuropean Union]] in the 1920s.<ref>{{lang|de|Richard Nicolaus Graf von Coudenhove-Kalergi, ''Kampf um Paneuropa aus dem 1. Jahrgang von Paneuropa'', Paneuropa Verlag, 1925|italic=unset}}, p. 36.</ref> In the 1930s, a version of the symbol with broken arms (resembling a [[swastika]]) was popular as a link between Christianity and Germanic paganism in the {{lang|de|[[v√∂lkisch]]}} [[German Faith Movement]].<ref>For example:

* {{lang|de|Waldemar M√ºller-Eberhart, ''Kopf und herz des Weltkrieges: General Ludendorffs Wertung als Deutscher'', Georg Kummer, 1935|italic=unset}}, p. 244.</ref>

==Archaeological record==
===Bronze Age===
[[Image:Scheibenkopfnadeln.jpg|upright|thumb|Ornamental pins, found in [[Switzerland]], date to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC; their circular heads are incised with crosses]]
[[Image:Radanhaenger-edited.jpg|thumb|Wheel pendants dating to the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, found in [[Z√ºrich]], are held at the [[Swiss National Museum]]. Variants include a six-spoked wheel, a central empty circle, and a second circle with twelve spokes surrounding one of four spokes.]]
In the [[prehistoric religion]] of [[Bronze Age Europe]], crosses in circles appear frequently on artifacts identified as cult items, for example the  "miniature standard" with an [[amber]] inlay that shows a cross shape when held against the light, dating to the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], held at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]].<ref>[http://www.landesmuseum-fuer-vorgeschichte-halle.de/himmel/en_standarte.htm entry] at the [[Nebra sky disk]] exhibition site (landesmuseum-fuer-vorgeschichte-halle.de)</ref> The Bronze Age symbol has also been connected with the [[spoke]]d [[chariot]] [[wheel]], which at the time{{clarify|date=August 2019}} was four-spoked (compare the [[Linear B]] ideogram 243 "wheel" {{lang|gmy|êÉè}}).  In the context of a culture that celebrated the [[sun chariot]], it may thus have had a "solar" connotation (compare the [[Trundholm sun chariot]]).

==Modern culture==

===Astronomy===
The same symbol represents the Earth in [[astronomical symbols]], while the [[Sun]] is represented by a circle with a center point.

===Ethnography===
The Sacred Hoop aka [[Medicine Wheel]] is a similar symbol in widespread use by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] including [[Plains Indians]] and previously by [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] cultures. Other indigenous peoples also use or used the solar cross on their symbolism and as decoration practices.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Politics===
The [[Sassanian Empire]] in [[Persia]] used a similar solar cross on their banner, called the [[Derafsh Kaviani]] symbol.

The [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[fascism|fascist]] party {{lang|no|[[Nasjonal Samling]]|italic=no}} used a golden sun cross on a red background as an official symbol from 1933 to 1945. The cross with the circle was attached to [[Olaf II of Norway]], patron saint of Norway, and the colors were the [[coat of arms of Norway]].

The [[Paneuropean Union]], a European unification movement, uses this symbol as central element of its flag. {{Citation needed|reason=Flag includes a cross on a circular background not a cross with a circle round it.  Is this a Sun cross?|date=April 2020}}

A square cross interlocking with or surrounded by a circle is one of the most popular symbols used by individuals and organisations to represent white nationalism, white supremacy, Neo-Nazism, and white pride; it is used as the logo for white nationalist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]. This stems from the use of a circled cross by Norwegian Nazis during World War II.

In Germany, a "stylized" circled cross was adopted by a prohibited political party (VSBD/PdA), leading to a ban of the symbol if used within a context of promoting racism (see ''[[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a]]''). Although there were doubts on the constitutionality of the ban, it was upheld in a decision of the supreme court.<ref>{{cite web |title=BGH, Beschluss vom 01.10.2008 - 3 StR 164/08 |url=https://dejure.org/ext/dc2fdbc589031d705919b26f41b1f62a |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>

In Italy, there is a similar ban based on ''Legge Mancino'' (the "[[Mancino Law]]", from the Minister of Interior who enacted the law),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legislationline.org/documents/id/19322 |title=Criminal Code (1993) (excerpts) |work=LegislatiOnline }}</ref> although there are some examples of the use of the circled cross as a Roman Catholic symbol in Northern Italy.

===Religion and neopaganism===

In [[Wicca]], the solar cross represents not only the Sun but also the four quadrants of the [[Wheel of the Year]], the cycle of the four seasons.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

Among other symbols, [[neo-paganism]] used the sun cross for the reconstruction of faith and pagan culture, particularly the [[Celtic neopaganism]], the [[heathenry (new religious movement)|heathenism]], especially the {{lang|is|[[√Åsatr√∫]]|italic=no}}, and other beliefs such as [[Norse paganism]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}

===Tools===
A similar glyph is used in tool sets to denote [[Screwdriver#Drive tip|Phillips-head]] screws and screwdrivers.

==Unicode==
There is no formal [[code point]] in [[Unicode]] for this symbol, though other symbols representing the sun are included. Symbols designed for other purposes, such as {{unichar|1F728|ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR VERDIGRIS}}, {{unichar|2295|CIRCLED PLUS}} and {{unichar|2A01|N-ARY CIRCLED PLUS OPERATOR}}, may be considered as alternatives.
