[[File:Nice Cup of Tea.jpg|thumb|Tea is the world's second-most-consumed drink]]
A '''drink''' (or '''beverage''') is a [[liquid]] intended for [[human]] consumption. In addition to their basic function of satisfying [[thirst]], drinks play important roles in human [[culture]]. Common types of drinks include plain [[drinking water]], [[milk]], [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[hot chocolate]], [[juice]] and [[soft drink]]s. In addition, [[alcoholic drink]]s such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[liquor]], which contain the drug [[ethanol]], have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years.

Non-alcoholic drinks often signify drinks that would normally contain alcohol, such as [[beer]] and [[wine]], but are made with a sufficiently low concentration of [[alcohol by volume]]. The category includes drinks that have undergone an alcohol removal process such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.

== Biology ==
When the human body becomes dehydrated, it experiences [[thirst]]. This craving of fluids results in an instinctive need to drink. Thirst is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating. The complete elimination of drinks, that is, water, from the body will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance.<ref name="Cheney">{{cite journal|last=Cheney|first=Ralph|date=July 1947|title=The Biology and Economics of the Beverage Industry|journal=Economic Botany|volume=1|issue=3|pages=243–275|jstor=4251857|doi=10.1007/bf02858570|s2cid=20752304}}</ref> Water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history.<ref name="Cheney" /> As water is essential for life, it has also been the carrier of many diseases.<ref name="Liquid Pleasure">{{cite book|last=Burnett|first=John|title=Liquid Pleasures: A Social History of Drinks in Modern Britain|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|pages=1–20|isbn=978-1-134-78879-8}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Baco, por Caravaggio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Caravaggio]]'s interpretation of Bacchus]]
[[Drinking]] has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries. In [[Ancient Greece]], a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a [[symposium]], where watered down wine would be drunk. The purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence. In [[Ancient Rome]], a similar concept of a ''convivium'' took place regularly.

Many early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods,<ref name="Beverage Book">{{cite book|last=Katsigris|first=Costas|author2=Thomas, Chris|title=The Bar and Beverage Book|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2006|pages=5–10|isbn=978-0-470-07344-5}}</ref> leading to the creation of gods such as [[Dionysus]]. Other religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic drinks for various reasons. In [[List of countries with alcohol prohibition|some regions]] with a dominant religion the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic drinks is forbidden to everybody, regardless of religion.

[[Toast (honor)|Toasting]] is a method of honouring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink.<ref name="Beverage Book" /> Another tradition is that of the [[loving cup]], at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle, shared by everyone until empty.<ref name="Beverage Book" />

In East Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the [[Ethiopian Church]] banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor [[Menelik II]].<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Pankhurst |title=Economic History of Ethiopia |location=Addis Ababa |publisher=[[Addis Ababa University|Haile Selassie I University]] |year=1968 |page=198}}</ref> The drink was also banned in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons<ref name="hopkins2006">{{cite web|url=http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ |title=Food Stories: The Sultan's Coffee Prohibition |last=Hopkins |first=Kate |date=March 24, 2006 |work=Accidental Hedonist |access-date=January 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120105621/http://accidentalhedonist.com/food-stories-the-sultans-coffee-prohibition/ |archive-date=November 20, 2012 }}<!-- doubtful WP:RS, but comments suggest it can be sourced to both "Devil's Cup" and "Devil's Picnic" --></ref> and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.

== Production ==
A drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption. The preparation can include a number of different steps, some prior to transport, others immediately prior to consumption.

=== Purification of water ===
{{details|Water purification}}
Water is the chief constituent in all drinks, and the primary ingredient in most. Water is purified prior to [[drinking water|drinking]]. Methods for purification include [[filtration]] and the addition of chemicals, such as [[Water chlorination|chlorination]]. The importance of purified water is highlighted by the [[World Health Organization]], who point out 94% of deaths from [[diarrhea]] – the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually – could be prevented by improving the quality of the victim's environment, particularly safe water.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/combating_diseasepart1lowres.pdf |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Combating Waterborne Diseases at the Household Level |page=11 |year=2007|isbn=978-92-4-159522-3}}</ref>

=== Pasteurisation ===
{{details|Pasteurisation}}
Pasteurisation is the process of heating a liquid for a period of time at a specified temperature, then immediately cooling. The process reduces the growth of [[microorganism]]s within the liquid, thereby increasing the time before spoilage. It is primarily used on [[milk]], which prior to pasteurisation is commonly infected with [[pathogen]]ic bacteria and therefore is more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness.<ref name=wilson>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = G. S. | title = The Pasteurization of Milk | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 4286 | year = 1943 | pages = 261–262 | pmc=2282302 | pmid=20784713 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4286.261}}</ref>

=== Juicing ===
[[File:Pressoir epi.jpg|right|thumb|First developed in the [[Middle Ages]], basket presses have a long history of use in winemaking.]]
{{details|Juice|Pressing (wine)}}
The process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms. Simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid, though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit. Both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine.

=== Infusion ===
{{details|Infusion}}
Infusion is the process of extracting flavours from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water. This process is used in the production of [[tea]]s, [[herbal teas]] and can be used to prepare [[coffee]] (when using a [[french press|coffee press]]).

=== Percolation ===
{{details|Coffee percolation}}
The name is derived from the word "[[percolation|percolate]]" which means ''to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=percolate|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/percolated|year=2008|dictionary=Merriam Webster|access-date=2008-01-09}}</ref>
In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.

=== Carbonation ===
{{details|Carbonation}}
Carbonation is the process of dissolving [[carbon dioxide]] into a liquid, such as water.

=== Fermentation ===
{{details|Fermentation|Fermentation in winemaking|Beer}}

Fermentation is a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process that converts [[sugar]] to [[ethanol]]. Fermentation has been used by humans for the production of drinks since the [[Neolithic age]]. In [[winemaking]], grape juice is combined with yeast in an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environment to allow the fermentation.<ref name="cox">Jeff Cox ''"From Vines to Wines: The Complete Guide to Growing Grapes and Making Your Own Wine"'' pgs 133–136 Storey Publishing 1999 {{ISBN|1-58017-105-2}}</ref> The amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the [[sweetness of wine|sweetness of the wine]].<ref name="Bird">D. Bird ''"Understanding Wine Technology"'' pg 67–73 DBQA Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-891267-91-4}}</ref>

When [[brewing]] beer, there are four primary ingredients – water, grain, yeast and hops. The grain is encouraged to [[germinate]] by soaking and drying in heat, a process known as [[malting]]. It is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation. This process is known as [[mashing]]. Hops are added for flavouring, then the yeast is added to the mixture (now called [[wort]]) to start the fermentation process.<ref name="beer">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yjLqQPU_DzYC&pg=PT197 |title=The Illustrated Guide to Brewing Beer|author= Matthew Schaefer |page=197|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|date= 15 Feb 2012 |access-date=13 November 2012 |isbn= 978-1-61608-463-9}}</ref>

=== Distillation ===
{{details|Distillation|Distilled beverage}}
[[File:Liquor Still Frankfort 489226997.jpg|thumb|upright|An old [[whiskey]] [[still]]]]
Distillation is a method of [[separation process|separating]] [[mixture]]s based on differences in [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] of components in a boiling liquid mixture. It is one of the methods used in the purification of water. It is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic drinks.

=== Mixing ===
{{details|Cocktail}}
An [[alcoholic drink|alcoholic]] [[mixed drink]] that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail. Cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and [[bitters]].<ref>{{cite book
|title=How To Mix Drinks
|url=https://archive.org/details/howtomixdrinkso00schugoog
|author=Thomas, Jerry
|year=1862}}</ref> The term is now often used for almost any mixed drink that contains alcohol, including mixers, mixed shots, etc.<ref name=Regan>{{cite book

== Type ==

=== Non-alcoholic drinks ===
{{details|Non-alcoholic beverage}}
[[File:Ice water with lemon.jpg|thumb|upright|Ice water with lemon]]
A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no [[Ethanol|alcohol]]. This category includes [[low-alcohol beer]], non-alcoholic [[wine]], and [[apple cider]] if they contain a sufficiently low concentration of [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). The exact definition of what is "non-alcoholic" and what is not depends on local laws: in the [[United Kingdom]], "alcohol-free beer" is under 0.05% ABV, "de-alcoholised beer" is under 0.5%, while "low-alcohol beer" can contain no more than 1.2% ABV.<ref>{{cite web |title=Differences between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beers |url=https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/alcoholic-drinks-units/alcoholic-and-non-alcoholic-beers/ |website=www.drinkaware.co.uk |access-date=19 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The term "soft drink" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to "hard drink" and "drink". The term "drink" is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop, [[sparkling water]], [[iced tea]], [[lemonade]], [[root beer]], [[fruit punch]], [[milk]], [[hot chocolate]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[milkshake]]s, and [[tap water]] and [[energy drink]]s are all soft drinks.

Regarded as one of the "original" drinks,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Edgar|date=5 September 1890|title=Beverages|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=16|issue=396|pages=127–131|jstor=1766104|doi=10.1126/science.ns-16.396.127 |pmid=17782638|bibcode=1890Sci....16..127R|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448319}}</ref> milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies. In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (especially [[cattle]], [[goat]]s and [[sheep]]) as a drink. Plant milk, a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source, also has a long history of consumption in various countries and cultures. The most popular varieties internationally are [[soy milk]], [[almond milk]], [[rice milk]] and [[coconut milk]].

==== Soft drinks ====
{{See also|Carbonation|Soft drink}}
Carbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them. This can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure. The first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by Thomas Henry in the late 1770s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steen|first=Dr. David|author2=Ashhurst, Philip.|title=Carbonated Soft Drinks: Formulation and Manufacture |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2008|pages=1–2|isbn=978-1-4051-7170-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfphGPaZtzwC}}</ref>
Cola, orange, various roots, ginger, and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; sugars and preservatives may be added later.<ref name="SIVASANKAR">{{cite book|last=Sivasankar|first=B.|title=FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

The most consumed carbonated soft drinks are produced by three major global brands: [[Coca-Cola]], [[PepsiCo]] and the [[Dr Pepper Snapple Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reportlinker.com/ci02018/Soft-Drink.html|title=Soft Drink Industry: Market Research Reports, Statistics and Analysis|publisher=Report Linker|access-date=10 June 2013}}</ref>

==== Juice and juice drinks ====
{{Main|Juice}}
[[File:Oranges and orange juice.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Orange (fruit)|Orange]] [[juice]] is usually served cold]]
[[Fruit]] juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as [[orange juice]] and [[tangerine]] juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while [[grapefruit juice]], pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. [[Coconut water]] is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces [[wine]].

Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.

Vegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as [[carrot]]s, tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, [[celery]] and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]].

=== Sleep drinks ===
{{Main article|Nightcap (drink)}}
A [[Nightcap (drink)|nightcap]] is a drink taken shortly before bedtime to induce sleep. For example, a small [[alcoholic drink]] or a cup of [[Sleep induction|warm milk]] can supposedly promote a good night's sleep. Today, most nightcaps and [[relaxation drink]]s are generally non-alcoholic beverages containing calming ingredients. They are considered beverages which serve to relax a person. Unlike other calming beverages, such as [[tea]], [[warm milk]] or [[milk]] with [[honey]]; relaxation drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient. Relaxation drinks have been known to contain other natural ingredients and are usually free of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] but some have claimed to contain [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].

=== Alcoholic drinks ===
{{Main|Alcoholic drink}}
A drink is considered "alcoholic" if it contains [[ethanol]], commonly known as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (although in [[chemistry]] the definition of "alcohol" includes many other compounds). [[Beer]] has been a part of human culture for 8,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology |last=Arnold |first=John P |year=2005 |edition=Reprint |publisher=BeerBooks.com}}</ref>

In many countries, imbibing alcoholic drinks in a local [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]] is a cultural tradition.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Drinking Life: A Memoir |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkinglifememo00hami |url-access=registration |last=Hamill |first=Pete |year=1994 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York|isbn= 978-0-316-34102-8}}</ref>

==== Beer ====
[[File:Aufseß Bier.JPG|thumb|Glasses and tankards of [[German beer]]]]
Beer is an [[alcoholic drink]] produced by the [[Hydrolysis|saccharification]] of [[starch]] and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification [[enzyme]]s are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly [[malt]]ed barley and malted wheat.<ref name="Barth 2014">Barth, Roger. ''The Chemistry of Beer: The Science in the Suds'', Wiley 2013: {{ISBN|978-1-118-67497-0}}.</ref> Most beer is also flavoured with [[hops]], which [[bittering agent|add bitterness]] and act as a natural [[preservative]], though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called [[brewing]]. Beer is the world's most widely consumed [[alcoholic drink]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Volume of World Beer Production|work=European Beer Guide|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#production|access-date=17 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028165040/http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm|archive-date=28 October 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status=live}}</ref> and is the third-most popular drink overall, after [[Drinking water|water]] and [[tea]]. It is said to have been discovered by goddess [[Ninkasi]] around 5300 BCE, when she accidentally discovered yeast after leaving grain in jars that were later rained upon and left for several days. Women have been the chief creators of beer throughout history due to its association with domesticity and it, throughout much of history, being brewed in the home for family consumption.

[[Wine]] is an [[alcoholic drink]] made from [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] [[grape]]s or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of [[sugar]]s, [[acid]]s, [[enzyme]]s, water, or other [[nutrient]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Vintage: The Story of Wine |last=Johnson |first=H. |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-79182-7 |pages=11–6 }}</ref> [[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast consumes the sugars]] in the grapes and converts them into [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, [[terroir]] and subsequent [[appellation]], along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.

Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, [[rice wine]], [[pomegranate]] wine, [[Apfelwein|apple wine]] and [[elderberry wine]]) and are generically called [[fruit wine]]. The term "wine" can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified drinks having higher alcohol content, such as [[barley wine]], [[huangjiu]], or [[sake]].

Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred {{c.|lk=no|6000}}&nbsp;BC in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name=archaeology96>{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Berkowitz |title=World's Earliest Wine |url=http://www.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/wine.html |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |journal=Archaeology |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=1996 |access-date=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=Keys>{{cite news|first=David |last=Keys |title=Now that's what you call a real vintage: professor unearths 8,000-year-old wine |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 December 2003 |access-date=20 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005120059/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html |archive-date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Cultures of The World Georgia"/> It had reached the [[Balkans]] by {{c.|lk=no|4500}}&nbsp;BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient [[ancient Greece and wine|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|Rome]].

From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. [[Red wine]] was closely associated with [[blood]] by the [[ancient Egyptians]], who, according to [[Plutarch]], avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC [[Saite dynasty]], "thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods".<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html | title = Isis & Osiris | journal = Nature | volume = 146 | issue = 3695 | pages = 262–263 | publisher = University of Chicago| bibcode = 1940Natur.146U.262. | year = 1940 | doi = 10.1038/146262e0 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[cult of Dionysus|cult]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Dionysus]], carried on by the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] in their [[Bacchanalia]], were the origins of western [[theater]].

==== Spirits ====
{{further|List of alcoholic drinks#Distilled beverages}}
Spirits are [[distilled beverage]]s that contain no [[added sugar]] and have at least 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). Popular spirits include [[borovička]], [[brandy]], [[gin]], [[rum]], [[slivovitz]], [[tequila]], [[vodka]], and [[whisky]]. Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any [[starch]]- or [[sugar]]-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from [[Cereal|grains]] such as [[sorghum]], [[maize|corn]], [[rye]] or [[wheat]].

===Hot drinks{{anchor|Hot drink}}===

==== Coffee ====
[[File:A small cup of coffee.JPG|thumb|A cup of black [[coffee]]]]
{{Main|Coffee}}
Coffee is a [[Drip brew|brewed]] drink prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an [[evergreen]] [[shrub]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Coffea]]''. The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded ''[[Coffea arabica]]'', and the "robusta" form of the hardier ''[[Coffea canephora]]''. Coffee plants are cultivated in [[List of countries by coffee production|more than 70 countries]]. Once ripe, coffee [[epigynous berries|"berries"]] are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.

Coffee is slightly [[acidic]] (pH 5.0–5.1<ref>[http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/7health.html#coffeeacidic Coffee and Health]. Thecoffeefaq.com (2005-02-16). Retrieved on 2013-01-22.</ref>) and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its [[caffeine]] content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world.<ref name="Villanueva">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ijc.21587 |title=Total and specific fluid consumption as determinants of bladder cancer risk |year=2006 |last1=Villanueva |first1=Cristina M. |last2=Cantor |first2=Kenneth P. |last3=King |first3=Will D. |last4=Jaakkola |first4=Jouni J.K. |last5=Cordier |first5=Sylvaine |last6=Lynch |first6=Charles F. |last7=Porru |first7=Stefano |last8=Kogevinas |first8=Manolis |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=118 |issue=8 |pages=2040–7 |pmid=16284957|s2cid=27175168 }}</ref> It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways.

====Hot chocolate====
{{Main|Hot chocolate}}
Hot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate or cocoa, is a heated drink consisting of shaved [[chocolate]], melted chocolate or [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]], heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chocolate: history, culture, and heritage |last1=Grivetti |first1=Louis E. |first2=Howard-Yana |last2=Shapiro |author-link2=Howard-Yana Shapiro |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0-470-12165-8 |page=345 }}</ref>

The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of [[Aztec]] culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/6194447/Aztecs-and-cacao-the-bittersweet-past-of-chocolate.html |work=Telegraph |title=Aztecs and cacao: the bittersweet past of chocolate|author=Bee Wilson|date=15 Sep 2009}}</ref><ref name="Trivedi">{{cite magazine|last1=Trivedi|first1=Bijal|title=Ancient Chocolate Found in Maya "Teapot"|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/07/0717_020717_TVchocolate.html|magazine=National Geographic|access-date=July 15, 2017|date=July 17, 2012}}</ref> The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the [[New World]] and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.

Hot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced ''chocolate para mesa'' of Latin America, the very thick ''cioccolata calda'' served in Italy and ''chocolate a la taza'' served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including [[cafeteria]]s, [[fast food restaurant]]s, [[coffeehouse]]s and [[teahouse]]s. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at [[grocery store]]s and [[online]].

==== Tea ====
{{See also|Tea|Herbal tea}}
[[File:Tea leaves steeping in a zhong čaj 05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oolong tea]]]]
Tea, the second most consumed drink in the world, is produced from infusing dried leaves of the ''camellia sinensis'' shrub, in boiling water.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DJ2j_bX6WTUC|title=Tea: The Drink that Changed the World |author= Martin, Laura C. |publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2007|pages=7–8|ref=Martin|isbn=978-0-8048-3724-8}}</ref> There are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption: lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide. Other additions include butter and salt in [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], and [[Tibet]]; [[bubble tea]] in [[Taiwan]]; fresh ginger in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; mint in North Africa and [[Senegalese tea culture|Senegal]]; cardamom in Central Asia; rum to make [[Jagertee]] in Central Europe; and coffee to make [[yuanyang (drink)|yuanyang]] in Hong Kong. Tea is also served differently from country to country: in [[China]] and [[Japan]] tiny cups are used to serve tea; in Thailand and the United States tea is often served cold (as "iced tea") or with a lot of sweetener; Indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as [[masala chai]]; tea is brewed with a [[samovar]] in Iran, [[Kashmir]], Russia and Turkey; and in the Australian [[Outback]] it is traditionally brewed in a [[billycan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Saberi|first=Helen|title=Tea: A Global History|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2010|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781861897763/page/7 7]|isbn=978-1-86189-892-0|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781861897763|url-access=registration}}</ref>
Tea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different. Chinese yellow and green tea are steamed, roasted and dried; Oolong tea is semi-oxidised and appears green-black and black teas are fully oxidised.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=E.L.|author2=Rycroft, J.A.|others=Watson, R.; Martin, C.|title=Psychological and Physiological Consequences of Drinking Tea ''in Handbook of Behavior, Food and Nutrition''|editor=Victor R.

Around the world, people refer to other herbal infusions as "teas"; it is also argued that these were popular long before the ''Camellia sinensis'' shrub was used for tea making.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mars|first=Brigitte|title=Healing Herbal Teas: A Complete Guide to Making Delicious, Healthful Beverages|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|year=2009|pages=vi|isbn=978-1-4429-6955-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFvyKltCvngC}}</ref> Leaves, flowers, roots or bark can be used to make a herbal infusion and can be bought fresh, dried or powdered.<ref>{{cite book|last=Safi|first=Tammy|title=Healthy Teas: Green, Black, Herbal, Fruit|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2001|edition=Illustrated|pages=16|isbn=978-0-7946-5004-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyTGfrmSbXYC}}</ref>

== In culture ==

=== Places to drink ===
[[File:Vincent Willem van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (Yorck).jpg|thumb|''[[Cafe Terrace at Night]]'', September 1888, by [[Vincent van Gogh]].]]
Throughout history, people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking. This includes cafés and [[coffeehouse]]s, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the [[Middle East]], and in [[West Asia]]n immigrant districts in the [[Western world]], offer ''shisha'' (''nargile'' in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a [[hookah]]. [[coffeehouse#Espresso bars|Espresso bars]] are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving [[espresso]] and espresso-based drinks.

In China and Japan, the establishment would be a [[tea house]], where people would socialise while drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse as a place to share ideas.

Alcoholic drinks are served in [[drinking establishments]], which have different cultural connotations. For example, [[pub]]s are fundamental to the culture of [[British culture|Britain]],<ref name="EB">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482410/public-house Public House] Britannica.com; Subscription Required. Retrieved 3 July 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insiders-scotland-guide.com/ScottishPubs.html |title=Scottish pubs |publisher=Insiders-scotland-guide.com |access-date=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Culture of Ireland#Food and drink|Ireland]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Michael|author2=O'Connor, Barbara|title=Irish Tourism: image, culture, and identity |editor=Barbara O'Connor|publisher=Channel View Publications|year=2003|series=Tourism and Cultural Change|volume=1|page=83|isbn= 978-1-873150-53-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLkIW-c4dScC&q=%22Many+foreign+visitors+regard+Ireland%27s+pub+culture%22&pg=PA83 |access-date=27 March 2011}}</ref> [[Australian culture|Australia]],<ref>[http://www.convictcreations.com/culture/drinking.htm Australian Drinking Culture] Convict Creations. Retrieved 24 April 2011.</ref> [[Canada]], [[New England]], [[Metro Detroit]], [[South Africa]] and [[Culture of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of [[Samuel Pepys]] describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so [[cask ale]] or [[keg beer]] may be a better value than wines and spirits.

In contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed "dive bars",<ref>Todd Dayton, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpUSVjBPHRwC&q=the+ideal+dive&pg=PT7 |title=''San Francisco's Best Dive Bars'', page 4 |publisher=Ig Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9703125-8-7 |access-date=2010-07-22 }}</ref> to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide [[Bar stool|stools]] or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term "bar" is derived from the [[bar (counter)|specialized counter]] on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, [[Go-Go dancing|go-go dancers]], or [[striptease|strippers]]. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the [[bartender]], or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.

=== Matching with food ===
{{Main|Wine and food matching}}
[[File:Champagne flute and bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|Champagne flute and bottle]]
[[Food]] and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented.<ref name="Oldman pg 219-235">M. Oldman "Oldman's Guide to Outsmarting Wine" pg 219-235 Penguin Books 2004 {{ISBN|0-14-200492-8}}</ref> In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.<ref name="MacNeil pg 83-88">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 83-88 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref>

=== Presentation ===
Different drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption. This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or [[snifter|brandy snifters]] which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.

Many glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature [[carbonation]], by reducing the [[surface area]] at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a [[champagne coupe]], the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard [[wine glass]].

== Commercial trade ==

=== International exports and imports ===
