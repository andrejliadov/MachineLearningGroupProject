'''Retrocomputing''' is the use of older computer [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[computer software|software]] in modern times. Retrocomputing is usually classed as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of technology; enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and software for sentimental reasons. However, some do make use of it.<ref name="catb">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/retro/ |title=The Retrocomputing Museum |publisher=Catb.org |access-date=30 October 2013}}</ref>

==Historical retrocomputing==
A more serious line of retrocomputing is part of the [[history of computer hardware]]. It can be seen as the analogue of [[experimental archaeology]] in computing.<ref>Cignoni, Giovanni & Gadducci, Fabio. (2012). Experimental archaeology of computer science. 119. 111-116. 10.2424/ASTSN.M.2012.17.</ref> Some notable examples include the reconstruction of [[Babbage]]'s [[Difference engine]] (more than a century after its design) and the implementation of [[Plankalkül]] in 2000 (more than half a century since its inception).

=="Homebrew" computers==
[[File:Mini C88 (31505391518).png|thumb|A Mini C88 eight byte homebrew computer.]]
Some retrocomputing enthusiasts also consider the "[[Homebrew (video gaming)|homebrewing]]" (designing and building of retro- and retro-styled computers or kits), to be an important aspect of the hobby, giving new enthusiasts an opportunity to experience more fully what the early years of hobby computing were like.<ref name="catb" />  There are several different approaches to this end. Some are exact replicas of older systems, and some are newer designs based on the principles of retrocomputing, while others combine the two, with old and new features in the same package. Examples include:
* Device offered by [[IMSAI]], a modern, updated, yet backward-compatible version and replica of the original [[IMSAI 8080]], one of the most popular early personal systems;
* Several [[Apple I|Apple 1]] replicas and kits have been sold in limited quantities in recent years, by different builders, such as the "[[Replica 1]]", from Briel Computers;<ref>http://www.brielcomputers.com/</ref>
* A currently ongoing project that uses old technology in a new design is the [[Z80]]-based [[N8VEM]];
* The [[Arduino]] Retro Computer kit is an open source, open hardware kit you can build and has a BASIC interpreter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amigojapan.github.com/Arduino-Retro-Computer-with-SD-card-and-LCD-display-and-Keyboard-input-with-BASIC-interpreter/ |title=Arduino Retro Computer with SD card and LCD display and Keyboard input with BASIC interpreter |publisher=amigojapan.github.com |access-date=30 October 2013}}</ref> There is also a version of the Arduino Retro Computer that can be hooked up to a TV;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amigojapan.github.com/Arduino-Retro-Computer-TV/ |title=Arduino Retro Computer TV |publisher=amigojapan.github.com |access-date=30 October 2013}}</ref>
* There is at least one remake of the Commodore 64 using an [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] configured to [[Emulator|emulate]] the 6502;<ref name="c1">{{cite web

* MSX 2/2+ compatible [[do-it-yourself]] kit [[GR8BIT]], designed for the hands-on education in electronics, deliberately employing old and new concepts and devices (high-capacity [[Static random-access memory|SRAMs]], micro-controllers and [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]);
* The MEGA65 will be a [[Commodore 65]] compatible computer;<ref>https://mega65.org</ref>
* The Commander X16 is an ongoing project that hopes to build a new 8-bit platform inspired by the [[Commodore 64]], using off the shelf modern parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retrosummit.com/2019/09/24/project-commander-x16/|title=Project Commander X16 {{!}} Retro Summit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><!-- Please feel free to edit this information, and to make it more suitable for Wikipedia  -->
*The C256 Foenix and its different versions is a new retro computer family based on the WDC65C816. FPGAs are used to simulate CBM custom chips and has the power of an Amiga with its graphic and sound capabilities.

==Vintage computers==
The [[personal computer]] has been around since approximately 1976. But in that time, numerous technological revolutions have left generations of obsolete computing equipment on the junk heap. Nevertheless, in that time, these otherwise useless computers have spawned a sub-culture of [[History of computing hardware|vintage computer]] collectors, who often spend large sums to acquire the rarest of these items, not only to display but restore to their fully functioning glory, including active software development and adaptation to modern uses. This often includes so-called [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]] who add-on, update and create hybrid composites from new and old computers for uses for which they were otherwise never intended.  [[Ethernet]] interfaces have been designed for many vintage 8-bit machines to allow limited connectivity to the [[Internet]]; where users can access user groups, [[bulletin board]]s and databases of software.  Most of this hobby centers on those [[History of computing hardware (1960s–present)|computers manufactured after 1960]], though some collectors specialize in [[History of computing hardware|pre-1960 computers]] as well.

[[File:Microcomputer Collection 2.jpg|thumb|Altair and IMSAI computers with drives]]

===MITS Inc.===
[[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS) produced the [[Altair 8800]] in 1975, which is widely regarded as starting the [[microcomputer revolution]].

===IMSAI===
[[IMSAI]] produced a machine similar to the Altair 8800, though considered by many {{Weasel inline|date=September 2018}} to be a more robust design.

===Processor Technology===
[[Processor Technology]] produced the Sol-20.  This was one of the first machines to have a case that included a [[Keyboard technology|keyboard]]; a design feature copied by many of later "home computers".
[[File:Microcomputer Collection.jpg|thumb|SWTPC and Altair computers from the 70s]]

===SWTPC===
Southwest Technical Products Corporation ([[SWTPC]]) produced the SWTPC 6800 and later the SWTPC 6809 kits that employed the [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 series|68xx]] series microprocessors.  The 68xx line was to be followed later by the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] processor that was used in many early "home computers", such as the [[Apple II]].

===Apple Inc.===
The earliest of the [[Apple Inc.]] personal computers are among some of the most collectible. They are relatively easy to maintain in an operational state thanks to Apple's use of readily available off-the-shelf parts.

*'''[[Apple I]]''': The Apple-1 was Apple's first product and has brought some of the highest prices ever paid for a microcomputer at auction.
*'''[[Apple II]]''': The Apple II series of computers are some of the easiest to adapt, thanks to the original expansion architecture designed into them. New [[Apple II peripheral cards|peripheral]] cards are still being designed by an avid thriving community, thanks to the longevity of this platform, manufactured from 1977 through 1993. Numerous websites exist to support not only the legacy users, but new adopters who weren't even born when the Apple II was discontinued by Apple.<ref>{{cite web| author=Weyhrich. Steven | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/#02 | title=The Apple II | page=2 | publisher=apple2history.org | access-date=30 October 2013}}</ref>
*'''[[Macintosh]]''': Perhaps because of its friendly design and first commercially successful [[graphical user interface]] as well as its enduring [[Finder (software)|Finder]] application that persists on the most current Macs, the Macintosh is one of the most collected and used of the vintage computers. With dozens of websites around the world, old Macintosh hardware and software is put into daily use. Many maintain vast collections of functional and non-functional systems, which are lovingly maintained and discussed on worldwide user forums. The Macintosh had a strong presence in many early computer labs, creating a strong nostalgia factor for former students who recall their first computing experiences.

===RCA===
* The '''[[COSMAC ELF]]''' in 1976 was an inexpensive (about $100) single-board computer that was easily built by hobbyists. Many people who could not afford an Altair could afford an ELF, which was based on the RCA 1802 chip. Because the chips are still available from other sources, modern recreations of the ELF are fairly common and there are a number of fan web sites.

===IBM===
* The '''[[IBM 1130]]''' computing system from 1966 which still has a following of interested users, albeit via an [[emulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibm1130.org/sim |title=Simulating the IBM 1130 on 21st-century hardware |publisher=IBM1130.org | access-date=30 October 2013}}</ref> rather than the actual machine.
* The '''[[IBM 5100|5100]]''' also has an avid collector and fan base.
* The '''[[IBM PC|PC]]''' series ([[IBM 5150|5150]] PC, [[IBM 5155|5155]] Portable PC, [[IBM 5160|5160]] PC/XT, [[IBM 5170|5170]] PC/AT) has become very popular in recent years, with the earliest models (PC) being considered the most collectible.

[[File:BBC Master with Retro Software games.jpg|thumb|upright|BBC Master with Retro Software games at the Wakefield RISC OS Show 2011]]

===Acorn BBC & Archimedes===
* The [[Acorn Computers|Acorn]] '''[[BBC Micro]]''' was a very popular British computer in the 1980s with home and educational users, and enjoyed near universal usage in British schools into the mid-1990s.  It was possible to use 100K {{frac|5|1|4}}-inch disks, and it had many expansion ports.
* The '''[[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]]''' series{{snd}} the de facto successor to the BBC Micro{{snd}} has also enjoyed a following in recent years, thanks to its status as the first computer to be based around [[Advanced RISC Machines|ARM]]'s [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] microprocessor.

===Tandy/Radio Shack===
* The [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]]/[[RadioShack]] '''[[Radio Shack Model 100|Model 100]]''' is still widely collected and used as one of the earliest examples of a truly portable computer.  Other Tandy offerings, such as the '''[[TRS-80]]''' line, are also very popular, and early systems, like the Model I, in good condition can command premium prices on the vintage computer market.

===Sinclair===
* The [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] '''[[ZX81]]''' and '''[[ZX Spectrum]]''' series were the most popular British home computers of the early 1980s, with a wide choice of emulators available for both platforms.  The Spectrum in particular enjoys a cult following due to its popularity as a games platform, with new games titles still being developed even today.  Original "rubber key" Spectrums fetch the highest prices on the second hand market, with the later [[Amstrad]]-built models attracting less of a following.  The earlier ZX81 is not as popular in original hardware form due to its monochrome display and limited abilities next to the Spectrum, but still unassembled ZX81 kits still appear on [[EBay]] occasionally.

===MSX===
* Although nearly nonexistent in the United States, the [[MSX]] architecture has strong communities of fans and hobbyists worldwide, particularly in Japan (where the standard was conceived and developed), South Korea (the only country had a MSX based game console, [[Zemmix]]), [[Netherlands]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Russia]], [[Chile]], [[Middle East|the Middle East]] and others. New hardware and software are being actively developed to this day as well.
* One of the latest fundamental (from hardware and software perspectives) revivals of the MSX is the [[GR8BIT]].

===Robotron===
* The [[VEB Robotron|Robotron]] '''[[Robotron Z1013|Z1013]]''' was an East German home computer produced by VEB Robotron. It had a [[U880]] processor, 16 kByte RAM and a [[membrane keyboard]].
* The '''[[KC 85]]''' series of computers was a modular 8 bit computer system used in East German schools.

=== Commodore ===
The commodore 64 was the most sold single model of computer in the world.

The commodore pet was the first computer made by commodore and is highly collectible

==In popular culture==
In an interview with [[Conan O'Brien]] in May 2014, [[George R. R. Martin]] revealed that he writes his books using [[WordStar|WordStar 4.0]], an [[MS-DOS]] application dating back to 1987.<ref name="got">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/05/14/george_r_r_martin_writes_on_dos_based_wordstar_4_0_software_from_the_1980s.html|title=George R.R. Martin Writes on a DOS-Based Word Processor From the 1980s|author=Lily Hay Newman|date=14 May 2014|access-date=20 September 2015}}</ref>
US-based streaming video provider [[Netflix]] recently released a multiple-choice movie branded to be part of their [[Black Mirror]] series, called [[Bandersnatch]]. The protagonist is a teenage programmer working on a contract to deliver a video-game adaptation of a fantasy novel for an 8-bit computer in 1984. The multiple storylines evolve around the emotions and mental health issues resulting from a reality-perception mismatch between a new generation of computer-savvy teenagers and twenty-somethings, and their care givers.

==Education==
Due to their low complexity together with other technical advantages, 8-bit computers are frequently re-discovered for education, especially for introductory programming classes in [[Primary school|elementary schools]]. [[8-bit|8-bit computers]] turn on and directly present a programming environment; there are no distractions, and no need for other features or additional connectivity. The [[BASIC]] language is a simple-to-learn programming language that has access to the entire system without having to load libraries for sound, graphics, math, etc. The focus of the programming language is on efficiency; in particular, one command does one thing immediately (i.e., COLOR 0,6 turns the screen green).

==Reception==
Retrocomputing (and [[retrogaming]] as aspect) has been described in one paper as [[Digital preservation|preservation]] activity and as aspect of the [[remix culture]].<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/38392/230.pdf |title=Retrocomputing as Preservation and Remix |access-date=2018-01-23 |last=Takhteyev |first=Yuri |last2=DuPont |first2=Quinn |date=2013 |publisher=iSchools |book-title=iConference 2013 Proceedings |pages= 422–432 |location=Fort Worth, Texas |doi=10.9776/13230}}</ref>

==Internet==
Though many retro computers pre-date widespread use of the internet many enthusiasts find way to connect their machines using technologies such as ''Retronet'' that emulate the modems and [[X.25]] protocol the machines were designed at the time to use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.codeplex.com/|title=CodePlex Archive|website=CodePlex Archive|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref>
