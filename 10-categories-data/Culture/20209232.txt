'''AEGIS''' is a research network of European centres in [[African studies]], which aims to create synergies between experts and institutions. With primary emphasis on Social Sciences and Humanities, AEGIS' main goal is to improve understanding about contemporary African societies.

AEGIS was founded in 1991 by African studies centres in [[Bayreuth]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Leiden]], [[London]], and [[Uppsala]]. In the course of a decade, it developed into a network that included centres from more European countries. Yearly meetings of the member centres were instrumental for the development of multiple links between them. Starting in 1998, international conferences on a variety of thematic areas were organized in different countries.

In the new millennium, the organization of European Conferences on African Studies (ECAS), open to everybody, became the central activity. These conferences are taking place every two years, always in a different country. The first European Conference on African Studies was held at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] and the [[Institute of Commonwealth Studies]] in [[London]] in July 2005; the second Conference was held at the [[Afrika-Studiecentrum, Leiden|African Studies Centre]] in [[Leiden]], Netherlands, in July 2007. ECAS 2009 was held in [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and ECAS 2011 was organized by the [[Nordic Africa Institute]] at [[Uppsala]]. The 5th European Conference on African Studies was organized in 2013 by the Centro de Estudos Africanos at [[ISCTE|ISCTE-University Institute]] of [[Lisbon]]. In 2015 the 6th ECAS took place in [[Paris]], the 7th edition in [[Basel]] in 2017 and the 8th edition of ECAS was held in [[Edinburgh]] in 2019.
