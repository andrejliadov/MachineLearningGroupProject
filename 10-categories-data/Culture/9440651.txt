[[File:Лепёшки из лебеды и машинного масла.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Breads made of [[Garden orache|orache]] and [[bran]], fried in [[machine oil]], were used as food in [[Siege of Leningrad|besieged Leningrad]]]]

A '''famine food''' or '''poverty food''' is any inexpensive or readily available food used to [[nourishment|nourish]] people in times of [[hunger]] and [[starvation]], whether caused by [[extreme poverty]] such as during [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]]; by natural disasters, such as [[drought]]; or by [[war]] or [[genocide]].

Foods associated with famine need not be nutritionally deficient, or unsavoury. People who eat famine food in large quantity over a long period of time may become averse to it over time.  In times of relative affluence, these foods may become the targets of social stigma and rejection.

The characterization of a foodstuff as "famine" or "poverty" food is primarily social. For example [[lobster]] and other [[crustacea]]ns may be considered poverty food in some societies and luxury food in others depending on periods.
