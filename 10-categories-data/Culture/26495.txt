'''Retirement''' is the withdrawal from one's position or occupation or from one's active working life.<ref>"Definition of retirement" [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/retirement Merriam Websters]</ref> A person may also semi-retire by reducing work hours or workload.

Many people choose to retire when they are eligible for private or public [[pension]] benefits, although some are forced to retire when bodily conditions no longer allow the person to work any longer (by illness or accident) or as a result of legislation concerning their position.<ref>For example, in the United States, a person holding the rank of general or admiral must retire after 40 years of service unless he or she is reappointed to serve longer. ([http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/10/subtitles/a/parts/ii/chapters/36/subchapters/iii/sections/section_636.html 10 USC 636] Retirement for years of service: regular officers in grades above brigadier general and rear admiral (lower half))</ref> In most countries, the idea of retirement is of recent origin, being introduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Previously, low [[life expectancy]] and the absence of pension arrangements meant that most workers continued to work until death. Germany was the first country to introduce retirement benefits in 1889.<ref>"The German Precedent" [http://www.ssa.gov/history/age65.html Social Security History, US Social Security Administration]</ref>

Nowadays, most developed countries have systems to provide pensions on retirement in [[old age]], funded by employers or the state. In many poorer countries there is no support for the old beyond that provided through the family. Today, retirement with a pension is considered a right of the worker in many societies; hard ideological, social, cultural and political battles have been fought over whether this is a right. In many western countries, this is a right embodied in national [[constitution]]s.

An increasing number of individuals are choosing to put off this point of total retirement, by selecting to exist in the emerging state of [[pre-tirement]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Britons opt for Pre-tirement over Total Retirement|url=http://cdn.zopa.com/pressrelease/2014/britons_opt_for_pretirement_overtotal_retirement.pdf}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of retirement}}
Retirement, or the practice of leaving one's job or ceasing to work after reaching a certain age, has been around since around the [[18th century]]. Prior to the 18th century,  humans had an average life expectancy between 26 and 40 years.<ref name=Galor&Moav2007>{{Cite web |year= 2007 |author1= Galor, Oded  |author2= Moav, Omer |url= http://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/sites/brown.edu.academics.economics/files/uploads/2007-14_paper.pdf |title= The Neolithic Revolution and Contemporary Variations in Life Expectancy |work= [[Brown University]] Working Paper |access-date= September 12, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="sticerd.lse.ac.uk">{{cite web |year= 2005 |author1= Galor, Oded  |author2= Moav, Omer |url= http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/seminarpapers/dg09102006.pdf |title= Natural Selection and the Evolution of Life Expectancy |work= [[Brown University]] Working Paper |access-date= November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=395 |title= Pre-European Exploration, Prehistory through 1540 |publisher= Encyclopediaofarkansas.net |date= October 5, 2010 |access-date= November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide12/part06.html |title= Time traveller's guide to Medieval Britain |publisher= Channel4.com |access-date= November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/241864.stm |title= A millennium of health improvement |work= BBC News |date= December 27, 1998 |access-date =November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Expectations of Life">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4DLK7zLxYMC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA8 "Expectations of Life" by H.O.

==In specific countries==
{{main|Retirement age}}
A person may retire at whatever age they please. However, a country's tax laws or state old-age pension rules usually mean that in a given country a certain age is thought of as the standard retirement age. As [[life expectancy]] increases and more and more people live to an advanced age, in many countries the age at which a pension is awarded has been increased in the 21st century, often progressively.<ref name=retage/>

The standard retirement age varies from country to country but it is generally between 50 and 70 (according to latest statistics, 2011). In some countries this age is different for men and women, although this has recently been challenged in some countries (e.g., Austria), and in some countries the ages are being brought into line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ebiz.turpin-distribution.com/search.aspx?pub=472&adv=1|title=Turpin Distribution. Search|website=ebiz.turpin-distribution.com}}</ref> The table below shows the variation in eligibility ages for public old-age benefits in the United States and many European countries, according to the [[OECD]].

''The retirement age in many countries is increasing, often starting in the 2010s and continuing until the late 2020s.''

==Data sets==
Recent advances in data collection have vastly improved our ability to understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains a wealth of information on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) and a host of other topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).<ref>{{cite journal

2002 and 2004 saw the introductions of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), which includes respondents from 14 continental European countries plus Israel. These surveys were closely modeled after the HRS in sample frame, design and content. A number of other countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea) also now field HRS-like surveys, and others (e.g., China, India) are currently fielding pilot studies. These data sets have expanded the ability of researchers to examine questions about retirement behavior by adding a cross-national perspective.

==Factors affecting decisions==

Many factors affect people's retirement decisions. Retirement funding education is a big factor that affects the success of an individual's retirement experience. Social Security clearly plays an important role because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security's both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2016/II_A_highlights.html|title=II. OVERVIEW|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> Knowledge affects an individual's retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people are much more likely to retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.).<ref>Gruber, Jonathan and David Wise, eds. (1999). ''Social Security and Retirement around the World.'' University of Chicago Press.</ref> This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age ''a'' is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age ''a''+1.<ref>Gustman, Alan and Thomas Steinmeier (2003). "Retirement Effects of Proposals by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security." NBER Working Paper No. 10030</ref> Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the [[Earnings test (US)|Social Security earnings test]] or the tax system).<ref>Feldstein, Martin and Jeffrey B. Liebman (2002). "Social Security," in ''Handbook of Public Economics'', Vol. 4, Elsevier Press</ref><ref>Friedberg, Leora (2000). "The Labor Supply Effects of the Social Security Earnings Test." ''Review of Economics and Statistics,'' Vol. 82, No. 1, pp. 48–63</ref><ref>Liebman, Jeffrey B., Erzo F.P. Luttmer and David G. Seif (2008). "Labor Supply Responses to Marginal Social Security Benefits: Evidence from Discontinuities." NBER Working Paper No. 14540</ref>

Greater wealth tends to lead to earlier retirement, since wealthier individuals can essentially "purchase" additional leisure. Generally the effect of wealth on retirement is difficult to estimate empirically since observing greater wealth at older ages may be the result of increased saving over the working life in anticipation of earlier retirement. However, a number of economists have found creative ways to estimate wealth effects on retirement and typically find that they are small. For example, one paper exploits the receipt of an inheritance to measure the effect of wealth shocks on retirement using data from the HRS.<ref>Brown, Jeffrey R., Courtney Coile and Scott J. Weisbenner (2006). "The Effect of Inheritance Receipt on Retirement." NBER Working Paper No. 12386</ref> The authors find that receiving an inheritance increases the probability of retiring earlier than expected by 4.4 percentage points, or 12 percent relative to the baseline retirement rate, over an eight-year period.

A great deal of attention has surrounded how the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and subsequent [[Great Recession]] are affecting retirement decisions, with the conventional wisdom saying that fewer people will retire since their savings have been depleted; however recent research suggests that the opposite may happen. Using data from the HRS, researchers examined trends in defined benefit (DB) vs. defined contribution (DC) pension plans and found that those nearing retirement had only limited exposure to the recent stock market decline and thus are not likely to substantially delay their retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nber.org/2009rrc/1.2%20Gustman,%20Steinmeier,%20Tabatabai-revised.pdf|title=Gustman, Alan, Thomas Steinmeier and Jahid Tabatabai (2009). "How Do Pension Changes Affect Retirement Preparedness? The Trend to Defined Contribution Plans and the Vulnerability of the Retirement Age Population to the Stock Market Decline of 2008–2009." Presented at 11th Annual Joint Conference of the Retirement Research Consortium, August 10–11, 2009, National Press Club, Washington, DC|website=nber.org}}</ref> At the same time, using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), another study estimates that mass layoffs are likely to lead to an increase in retirement almost 50% larger than the decrease brought about by the stock market crash, so that on net retirements are likely to increase in response to the crisis.<ref>Coile, Courtney B. and Phillip B. Levine (2009). "The Market Crash and Mass Layoffs: How the Current Economic Crisis May Affect Retirement," presented at NBER Summer Institute Workshop on Aging, July 21–25, 2009.</ref>

More information tells of how many who retire will continue to work, but not in the career they have had for the majority of their life. Job openings will increase in the next 5 years due to retirements of the baby boomer generation. The Over 50 population is actually the fastest growing labor groups in the US.

A great deal of research has examined the effects of health status and health shocks on retirement. It is widely found that individuals in poor health generally retire earlier than those in better health. This does not necessarily imply that poor health status leads people to retire earlier, since in surveys retirees may be more likely to exaggerate their poor health status to justify their earlier decision to retire. This justification bias, however, is likely to be small.<ref>Dwyer, Debra and Olivia Mitchell (1999). "Health problems as determinants of retirement: Are self-rated measures endogenous?" ''Journal of Health Economics'', Vol. 18, No. 2, pp. 173–193</ref>  In general, declining health over time, as well as the onset of new health conditions, have been found to be positively related to earlier retirement.<ref>Dwyer, Debra and Jianting Hu (2000). "Retirement Expectations and Realizations: the Role of Health Shocks and Economic Factors," in ''Forecasting Retirement Needs and Retirement Wealth'', Mitchell, Olivia, P. Brett Hammond and Anna Rappaport, eds.</ref> Health conditions that can cause someone to retire include [[hypertension]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[sleep apnea]], [[joint diseases]], and [[hyperlipidemia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741559|title = When It Comes to Work, How Old Is Too Old?|date = May 3, 2011|website = NIOSH: Workplace Safety and Health|publisher = Medscape and NIOSH|last = Chosewood|first = L.

Most people are married when they reach retirement age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, men are more likely to retire if their wives are also retired than if they are still in the labor force, and vice versa.<ref>Blau, David M. (1998). "Labor Force Dynamics of Older Married Couples." ''Journal of Labor Economics'', Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 595–629</ref><ref>Gustman, Alan and Thomas Steinmeier (2000).

=== EU member-states ===
[[Researcher]]s analyzed factors affecting retirement decisions in [[EU Member States]]:

* Alba-Ramirez (1997) uses micro data from the [[Active Population Survey of Spain]] and [[logit model]] for analyzing determinants of retirement decision and finds that having more members in the household, and as well as children, has a negative effect on the probability of retirement among older males. This is an intuitive result as males in bigger household with children have to earn more and pension benefits will be less than needed for household.<ref>Alba-Ramirez, A. 1997, “Labor Force Participation and Transitions of Older Workers in Spain”, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Working Paper 97-39, Economic series 17, May.</ref>
* Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) using [[German Socio-Economic Panel]] and hazard model find that Socio-demographic factors such as health and gender have a strong impact on the retirement decision: women tend to retire earlier than men, and poor health makes people go into retirement, particularly in the case of [[disability]] retirement. The relationship between health status and retirement is significant for both self-assessed and objective indicators of health status.<ref name="auto">Antolín, P. and S. Scarpetta. 1998. “Microeconometric Analysis of the Retirement Decision: Germany”, OECD Economics Department Working Papers, No. 204, OECD Publishing</ref> This is similar finding to the previous research of Blau and Riphahn (1997); using individual data from the German Socio-Economic Panel as well, but controlling for different variables they found that if individual has chronic health condition, then he tends to retire.<ref>Blau, D. and R. Riphahn. 1997. “Labor Force Transitions of Older Married Couples in Germany”. Paper presented at International Health and Retirement Surveys Conference, Amsterdam, August.</ref> Antolin and Scarpetta (1998) use better measure for health status than Blau and Riphahn (1997), because self-assessed and objective indicators of health status are better measures than chronic health condition.<ref name="auto"/>
* Blöndal and Scarpetta (1999) find significant effect of socio-demographic factors on the retirement decision. Men tend to retire later than women as women try to benefit from special early retirement schemes in Germany and the Netherlands. Another reason is that they get access to pensions earlier than men as standard age of entitlement to pension is lower for women compared with men in Italy and the United Kingdom. The other interesting finding is that retirement depends on household size: heads of large households prefer not to retire. They think that this can be because of the significance of wages in large households compared with smaller ones and insufficiency of pension benefits. Another finding is that health status is significant factor in all early retirements; poor health conditions are especially significant if respondents join to disability benefit scheme. This result is true for both indicators used to express health status (self assessment and objective indicators).<ref>Blöndal, S. and S. Scarpetta. 1997.

=== United States ===
* Quinn et al. (1998) find significant correlation between health status and retirement status. They transform answers for question about health status from five levels (“excellent”, “very good”, “good”, “fair” and “poor”) into three levels and report results for three groups of people. 85% of respondents who answered “excellent” or “very good” to the question about their health in 1992 were still working two years after this interview, compared to 82% of those who answered “good”, and 70% of those answered “fair” or “poor”. This fact is also true for year 1996: 73% of people from the first group were still on the job market, while this is 66% and 55% for other groups of people.<ref>Quinn, J., R. Burkhauser, K. Cahill and R. Weather. 1998. “Microeconometric Analysis of the Retirement Decision: The United States”, OECD Economics Department Working Paper No. 203</ref> However, Dhaval, Rashad and Spasojevic (2006) using data from six waves of [[Health and Retirement Survey]] (HRS) show that relationship between retirement and health status can imply the opposite effect in reality: physical and mental health decline after retirement.<ref>Dhaval, D., I. Rashad, and J. Spasojevic. 2006. “The Effects of Retirement on Physical and Mental Health Outcomes”, NBER Working Paper w12123</ref>
* Benitez-Silva (2000) analyzes determinants of labor force status and retirement process among elderly US citizens and possibility of decision returning to work using [[logit]] and [[probit]] models. He uses Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) for this purpose and finds that physical and mental health has significant effect on becoming employed. Male respondents are more likely to change their status from being not-employed to employed, but being insured has a negative effect on switching job status from “not-employed” to “employed” for people aged 60–62 and insignificant effect for 55-59 and aged over 63.<ref>Benitez-Silva, H. 2000. “Micro Determinants of Labor Force Status Among Older Americans”, SUNY-Stony Brook Department of Economics Working Papers 00-07</ref>

==Saving for==

Overall, income after retirement can come from state [[pension]]s, occupational pensions, private savings and investments (private pension funds, owned housing), donations (e.g., by children), and social benefits.<ref>Eurofound, Income from work after retirement in the EU (2012) http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2012/59/en/2/EF1259EN.pdf</ref> In some countries an additional lump sum is granted, according to the years of work and the average pay; this is usually provided by the employer. On a personal level, the rising cost of living during retirement is a serious concern to many older adults. [[Health care costs]] play an important role.

Provision of state pensions is a significant drain on a government's budget. As life expectancy increases and the health of older people improves with medical advances, the age of entitlement to a pension has been increasing progressively since about 2010.

Older people have poorer health, and the cost of health care in retirement is large. Most countries provide universal health insurance coverage for seniors, although in the United States many people retire before they become eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] health cover at age 65.

===Calculators===

A useful and straightforward calculation can be done if it is assumed that interest, after expenses, taxes, and inflation is zero. Assume that in real (after-inflation) terms, one's salary never changes over ''w'' years of working life. During ''p'' years of pension, one has a living standard that costs a replacement ratio ''R'' times as much as one's living standard in working life. The working life living standard is one's salary minus the proportion of salary Z that should be saved. Calculations are per unit salary (e.g., assume salary = 1).

Then after ''w'' years work, retirement age accumulated savings = ''wZ''. To pay for pension for ''p'' years, necessary savings at retirement = ''Rp(1-Z)''

Equate these: ''wZ'' = ''Rp''(''1-Z'') and solve to give ''Z'' = ''Rp'' / (''w + Rp''). For example, if ''w'' = 35, ''p'' = 30 and ''R'' = 0.65, a proportion ''Z'' = 35.78% should be saved.

Retirement calculators generally accumulate a proportion of salary up to retirement age. This shows a straightforward case, which nonetheless could be practically useful for optimistic people hoping to work for only as long as they are likely to be retired.

For more complicated situations, there are several online retirement calculators on the Internet. Many retirement calculators project how much an investor needs to save, and for how long, to provide a certain level of retirement expenditures. Some retirement calculators, appropriate for safe investments, assume a constant, unvarying rate of return. Monte Carlo retirement calculators take volatility into account and project the probability that a particular plan of retirement savings, investments, and expenditures will outlast the retiree. Retirement calculators vary in the extent to which they take taxes, social security, pensions, and other sources of retirement income and expenditures into account.

The assumptions keyed into a retirement calculator are critical. One of the most important assumptions is the assumed rate of real (after inflation) investment return. A conservative return estimate could be based on the real yield of [[Inflation-indexed bond]]s offered by some governments, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The [http://www.prospercuity.com/index.htm TIP$TER retirement calculator] projects the retirement expenditures that a portfolio of inflation-linked bonds, coupled with other income sources like Social Security, would be able to sustain. Current real yields on United States Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) are available at the [http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/interest-rate/real_yield.shtml US Treasury] site. Current real yields on Canadian 'Real Return Bonds' are available at the [http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/bonds.html Bank of Canada's] site. As of December 2011, US Treasury inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) were yielding about 0.8% real per annum for the 30-year maturity and a noteworthy slightly negative real return for the 7-year maturity.

[[File:Work 40 retire 20.jpg|right|250px]]
Many individuals use "retirement calculators" on the Internet to determine the proportion of their pay they should be saving in a tax advantaged-plan (e.g., IRA or 401-K in the US, RRSP in Canada, personal pension in the UK, [https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement superannuation in Australia]).
After expenses and any taxes, a reasonable (though arguably pessimistic) long-term assumption for a safe real rate of return is zero. So in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]], interest does not help the savings grow. Each year of work must pay its share of a year of retirement. For someone planning to work for 40 years and be retired for 20 years, each year of work pays for itself and for half a year of retirement. Hence, 33.33% of pay must be saved, and 66.67% can be spent when earned. After 40 years of saving 33.33% of pay, we have accumulated assets of 13.33 years of pay, as in the graph. In the graph to the right, the lines are straight, which is appropriate given the assumption of a zero real investment return.

The graph above can be compared with those generated by many retirement calculators. However, most retirement calculators use nominal (not "real" dollars) and therefore require a projection of both the expected inflation rate and the expected nominal rate of return. One way to work around this limitation is to, for example, enter "0% return, 0% inflation" inputs into the calculator. The [https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/calculators/retire.html Bloomberg retirement calculator] gives the flexibility to specify, for example, zero inflation and zero investment return and to reproduce the graph above. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20111222100421/http://money.msn.com/retirement/retirement-calculator.aspx  MSN retirement calculator] in 2011 has as the defaults a realistic 3% per annum inflation rate and optimistic 8% return assumptions; consistency with the December 2011 US nominal bond and inflation-protected bond market rates requires a change to about 3% inflation and 4% investment return before and after retirement.

Ignoring tax, someone wishing to work for a year and then relax for a year on the same living standard needs to save 50% of pay. Similarly, someone wishing to work from age 25 to 55 and be retired for 30 years till 85 needs to save 50% of pay if government and employment pensions are not a factor and if it is considered appropriate to assume a zero real investment return. The problem that the lifespan is not known in advance can be reduced in some countries by the purchase at retirement of an inflation-indexed [[life annuity]].

===Size of lump sum required===

To pay for pension, assumed for simplicity to be received at the end of each year, and taking discounted values in the manner of a [[net present value]] calculation, the ideal lump sum available at retirement should be:

:(1 – z<sup>prop</sup> ) R <sup>repl</sup>  S {(1+ i<sup>real</sup> ) <sup>−1</sup>+(1+ i<sup>real</sup> ) <sup>−2</sup>   +...  ....+ (1+ i<sup>real</sup> ) <sup>−p</sup>} = (1-z<sup>prop</sup> )  R <sup>repl</sup>   S  {(1 – (1+i<sup>real</sup>)<sup>−p</sup>   )/i<sup>real</sup>}

Above is the standard mathematical formula for the sum of a [[geometric series]]. (Or if i<sup>real</sup> =0 then the series in braces sums to p since it then has p equal terms). As an example, assume that S=60,000 per year and that it is desired to replace R<sup>repl</sup>=0.80, or 80%, of pre-retirement living standard for p=30 years. Assume for current purposes that a proportion z <sup>prop</sup>=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved. Using i<sup>real</sup>=0.02, or 2% per year real return on investments, the necessary lump sum is given by the formula as (1-0.25)*0.80*60,000*annuity-series-sum(30)=36,000*22.396=806,272 in the nation's currency in 2008–2010 terms. To allow for inflation in a straightforward way, it is best to talk of the 806,272 as being '13.43 years of retirement age salary'. It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available. It is common to not include any house value in the calculation of this necessary lump sum, so for a homeowner the lump sum pays primarily for non-housing living costs.

===Size of lump sum saved===

At retirement, the following amount will have been accumulated:

:z<sup>prop</sup> S {(1+ i <sup>rel to pay</sup> )<sup>w-1</sup>+(1+ i <sup>rel to pay</sup> )<sup>w-2</sup>   +...  ....+ (1+ i <sup>rel to pay</sup> )+ 1 }

:&nbsp;= z<sup>prop</sup>  S  ((1+i <sup>rel to pay</sup>)<sup>w</sup>- 1)/i <sup>rel to pay</sup>

===Equate and derive necessary saving proportion===

To make the accumulation match with the lump sum needed to pay pension:

:z<sup>prop</sup>  S  (((1+i <sup>rel to pay</sup> )) <sup>w</sup>  - 1)/i <sup>rel to pay</sup>   = (1-z<sup>prop</sup> )  R <sup>repl</sup>   S  (1 – ((1+i <sup>real</sup>)) <sup>−p</sup> )/i<sup> real </sup>

Bring z<sup>prop</sup> to the left hand side to give the answer, under this rough and unguaranteed method, for the proportion of pay that should be saved:

:z<sup>prop</sup> = R <sup>repl</sup>    (1 – ((1+i <sup>real</sup> )) <sup>−p</sup> )/i <sup>real</sup>  /  [(((1+i <sup>rel to pay</sup> )) <sup>w</sup> - 1)/i <sup>rel to pay</sup>  + R <sup>repl</sup>   (1 – ((1+i <sup>real</sup> )) <sup>−p</sup> )/i <sup>real</sup>  ]    (Ret-03)

Note that the special case i <sup>rel to pay</sup> =0 =  i <sup>real</sup> means that the geometric series should be summed by noting that there are p or w identical terms and hence z <sup>prop</sup> = p/(w+p). This corresponds to the graph above with the straight line real-terms accumulation.

===Sample results===
The result for the necessary z<sup>prop</sup> given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions made. As an example, one might assume that price inflation will be 3.5% per year forever and that one's pay will increase only at that same rate of 3.5%. If  a 4.5% per year nominal rate of interest is assumed, then (using 1.045/1.035 in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]]) pre-retirement and post-retirement net interest rates will remain the same, i<sup>rel to pay</sup> = 0.966 percent per year and i<sup>real</sup> = 0.966 percent per year. These assumptions may be reasonable in view of the market returns available on [[inflation-indexed bond]]s, after expenses and any tax. Equation (Ret-03) is readily coded in Excel and with these assumptions gives the required savings rates in the accompanying picture.

===Monte Carlo: better allowance for randomness===
Finally, a newer method for determining the adequacy of a retirement plan is [[Monte Carlo simulation]]. This method has been gaining popularity and is now employed by many financial planners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalspectator.com/WM/2007/03/a_sure_bet_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611162405/http://www.capitalspectator.com/WM/2007/03/a_sure_bet_1.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 June 2007|title=A SURE BET?

==Early retirement==
Retirement is generally considered to be "early" if it occurs before the age (or tenure) needed for eligibility for support and funds from government or employer-provided sources. Early retirees typically rely on their own [[saving]]s and [[investment]]s to be self-supporting, either indefinitely or until they begin receiving external support. Early retirement can also be used as a euphemistic term for being terminated from employment before typical retirement age.<ref name="bogleheads_guide">{{cite book|last1=Larimore|first1=Taylor|title=The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning|publisher=Wiley|page=213}}</ref>

===Savings needed===
{{further|Withdrawal rate}}
While [[conventional wisdom]] has it{{who|date=February 2018}} that one can retire and take 7% or more out of a portfolio year after year, this strategy would not have worked very often in the past.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114816694417158844 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Make Sure Your Money Lasts as Long as You | first=Jonathan | last=Clements | date=May 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/bus/scottburns/columns/archives/1995/951003TU.htm|title=Dallas News: Breaking News for DFW, Texas, World|work=dallasnews.com|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Year-to-year portfolio balances example 73-75.gif|right|250px]]The chart at the right shows the year-to-year portfolio balances after taking $35,000 (and [[Inflation adjustment|adjusting for inflation]]) from a $750,000 portfolio every year for 30 years, starting in 1973 (red line), 1974 (blue line), or 1975 (green line).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firecalc.com/intro.php|title=FIRECalc: Why another retirement calculator?|work=firecalc.com|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> While the overall market conditions and inflation affected all three about the same (since all three experienced exactly the same conditions between 1975 and 2003), the chance of making the funds last for 30 years depended heavily on what happened to the [[stock market]] in the first few years.

Those contemplating early retirement will want to know if they have enough to survive possible [[bear market]]s such as the one that would cause the hypothetical 1973 retiree's fund to be exhausted after only 20 years.

The history of the US [[stock market]] shows that one would need to live on about 4% of the initial portfolio per year to ensure that the portfolio is not depleted before the end of the retirement;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/s/dws/bus/scottburns/readers/trinitystudy/table3.html|title=Dallas News: Breaking News for DFW, Texas, World|work=dallasnews.com|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> this rule of thumb is a summary of one conclusion of the [[Trinity study]], though the report is more nuanced and the conclusions and very approach have been heavily criticized (see [[Trinity study]] for details). This allows for increasing the withdrawals with [[inflation]] to maintain a consistent spending ability throughout the retirement, and to continue making withdrawals even in dramatic and prolonged [[bear market]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retireearlyhomepage.com/safesum.html|title=Retire Early's Safe Withdrawal Rates in Retirement.|work=retireearlyhomepage.com|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref> (The 4% figure does not assume any pension or change in spending levels throughout the retirement.)

When retiring prior to age {{frac|59|1|2}}, there is a 10% IRS penalty on withdrawals from a retirement plan such as a 401(k) plan or a Traditional IRA. Exceptions apply under certain circumstances. At age 59 and six months, the penalty-free status is achieved and the 10% IRS penalty no longer applies.

To avoid the 10% penalty prior to age {{frac|59|1|2}}, a person should consult a lawyer about the use of IRS rule 72 T. This rule must be applied for with the IRS. It allows the distribution of an IRA account prior to age {{frac|59|1|2}} in equal amounts of a period of either 5 years or until the age of {{frac|59|1|2}}, whichever is the longest time period, without a 10% penalty. Taxes still must be paid on the distributions.

===Calculations using actual numbers===
Although the 4% initial portfolio [[withdrawal rate]] described above can be used as a rough gauge, it is often desirable to use a retirement planning tool that accepts detailed input and can render a result that has more precision. Some of these tools model only the retirement phase of the plan while others can model both the savings or accumulation phase as well as the retirement phase of the plan. For example, an analysis by ''[[Forbes]]'' reckoned that in 90% of historical markets, a 4% rate would have lasted for at least 30 years, while in 50% of the historical markets, a 4% rate would have been sustained for more than 40 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/fidelity/2015/03/04/five-ways-to-protect-your-retirement-income/|title=Five Ways To Protect Your Retirement Income|date=4 March 2015|access-date=9 March 2015}}</ref>

The effects of making inflation-adjusted withdrawals from a given starting portfolio can be modeled with a downloadable spreadsheet<ref>http://retireearlyhomepage.com/re60.html downloadable spreadsheet</ref> that uses historical stock market data to estimate likely portfolio returns. Another approach is to employ a retirement calculator<ref>[http://firecalc.com FIRECalc: A different kind of retirement calculator<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> that also uses historical stock market modeling, but adds provisions for incorporating [[pension]]s, other retirement income, and changes in spending that may occur during the course of the retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nesteggly.com/retirement-calculator|title=The Ultimate Retirement Calculator}} retirement calculator that incorporates inflation, pensions and social security</ref>

==Life after==
{{see also|Retiree}}
Retirement might coincide with important life changes; a retired worker might move to a new location, for example a [[retirement community]], thereby having less frequent contact with their previous social context and adopting a new lifestyle. Often retirees [[Volunteering|volunteer]] for charities and other community organizations. [[Tourism]] is a common marker of retirement and for some becomes a way of life, such as for so-called [[Tourism#Grey nomads|grey nomads]]. Some retired people even choose to go and live in warmer climates in what is known as retirement migration.

It has been found that Americans have six lifestyle choices as they age: continuing to work full-time, continuing to work part-time, retiring from work and becoming engaged in a variety of leisure activities, retiring from work and becoming involved in a variety of recreational and leisure activities, retiring from work and later returning to work part-time, and retiring from work and later returning to work full-time.<ref name="auto1">Cox, H. (2012). Work/retirement choices and lifestyle patterns of older Americans. In L. Loeppke (Ed.), Annual editions: Aging (24th ed., pp. 74-83). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill</ref> An important note to make from these lifestyle definitions are that four of the six involve working. America is facing an important demographic change in that the Baby Boomer generation is now reaching retirement age. This poses two challenges: whether there will be a sufficient number of skilled workers in the work force, and whether the current pension programs will be sufficient to support the growing number of retired people.<ref>Hardy, M. (2006). Older workers. In R. Binstock & L. George (Eds.), Handbook of aging and the social sciences (6th ed., pp. 201-218). Boston, MA: Academic Press</ref> The reasons that some people choose to never retire, or to return to work after retiring include not only the difficulty of planning for retirement but also wages and fringe benefits, expenditure of physical and mental energy, production of goods and services, social interaction, and social status may interact to influence an individual's work force participation decision.<ref name="auto1"/>

Often retirees are called upon to care for [[grandchildren]] and occasionally aged parents. For many it gives them more time to devote to a [[hobby]] or [[sport]] such as [[golf]] or [[sailing]]. On the other hand, many retirees feel restless and suffer from depression as a result of their new situation. Although it is not scientifically possible to directly show that retirement either causes or contributes to depression, the newly retired are one of the most vulnerable societal groups when it comes to depression most likely due to confluence of increasing age and deteriorating health status.<ref>http://www.retirementjoy.com/ avoiding depression after retirement</ref> Retirement coincides with deterioration of one's health that correlates with increasing age and this likely plays a major role in increased rates of depression in retirees. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have shown that healthy elderly and retired people are as happy or happier and have an equal quality of life as they age as compared to younger employed adults, therefore retirement in and of itself is not likely to contribute to development of depression.

Many people in the later years of their lives, due to failing health, require assistance, sometimes in extremely expensive treatments &ndash; in some countries &ndash; being provided in a [[nursing home]]. Those who need care, but are not in need of constant assistance, may choose to live in a [[retirement home]].
