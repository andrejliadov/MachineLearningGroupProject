In manosphere communities such as men's rights groups and, according to some researchers, in incel communities as well, "taking the red pill" means seeing a world where feminism has given women too much power over men and [[male privilege]] does not exist.<ref name=":29" /><ref name=":45" /><ref name="zuckerberg">{{Cite book|last=Zuckerberg|first=Donna|author-link=Donna Zuckerberg|title=[[Donna Zuckerberg#Not All Dead White Men|Not All Dead White Men: Classics and Misogyny in the Digital Age]]|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=978-0-674-97555-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=11|oclc=1020311558}}</ref><ref name=":46" /> The "black pill" is an extension of the red and blue pill analogy. There is some disagreement among researchers and journalists over which beliefs are "red pill" and which are "black pill", and whether the black pill ideology is a distinguishing belief of incels or if there are incels who do not subscribe to black pill ideas. Some researchers and journalists use the term "red pill" to refer to the set of beliefs commonly held by men's rights’ activists, and the term "black pill" to summarize the incel ideology as a whole.<ref name=":29" /><ref name="spiked" /> Hoffman et al. have said that "'Taking the black pill' is critical to the incel identity, since it means recognizing 'inceldom' as a permanent condition."<ref name=":43" /> Aja Romano writing for ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' has said, "what unites all incels is something known as the black pill."<ref name=":29" /> However, researchers at the Anti-Defamation League write that there are some incels who believe in the red pill and others who believe in the black pill.<ref name=":46" />

Researchers at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have said that incels can also follow the red pill ideology. Those who believe they can improve their chances with women are adherents to the red pill, whereas only incels who believe they have no power to change their position in society or chances with women are blackpilled. The ADL writes that, among incels, the beliefs summarized as "red pill" center around the idea that feminism has unbalanced society to favor women and give them too much power. It includes the belief that 80% of women are attracted to the top 20% of men, an application of the Pareto principle that is referred to among incels as the "80/20 rule", and the belief in "hypergamy", or that women will abandon a man if they are presented with the opportunity to have sex with or enter into a relationship with a more attractive man. "Redpilled" incels believe they have the opportunity to fight back against this system which disadvantages them, which they do by trying to make themselves more attractive to women. Conversely, blackpilled incels are those who believe they can do nothing to change their situation. The ADL writes, "This is where the incel movement takes on characteristics of a [[Destructive cult|death cult]]." Those who have taken the black pill are left with few options, says the ADL: giving up on life (referred to by incels as "LDAR", an abbreviation for "lie down and rot"), committing suicide, or committing mass violence.<ref name=":46" />

On the former incel subreddit /r/braincels, the term "blackpill" was also used to refer to memes (usually images) that users shared to describe a user's thoughts, many of which criticized women as egocentric, cruel, and shallow.<ref name="Hosford" />

Women who identify as incels share some similarities with their male counterparts, such as belief that physical appearance is the most important factor in finding a partner. In other ways they tend to be different; for example, according to journalist Isabelle Kohn, rather than being angry at the men who reject them, they empathize with the men for not wanting to date them. Kohn notes the tendency for female incels to turn their rage inwards, rather than outwards like males.<ref name="KohnFeb2020" /> Journalist Arwa Mahdawi hypothesizes that the fact female incels do not go on violent rampages like some male incels is the most obvious reason why female incels have not received much attention in mainstream media.<ref name ="MahdawiFeb2020"/> As of February 2020, Kohn wrote that she could find "mountains" of academic papers on male incels, but none on female incels. She says the assumption that female incels do not exist adds to their pain.<ref name = "KohnFeb2020"/>

Speaking about incels' feelings of entitlement to sex, Davey said the attitude "can go as far as the justification of rape".<ref name=":15" />

While generally agreeing with critics' concerns about misogyny and other negative characteristics in the incel subculture, some commentators have been more sympathetic towards incels. In April 2018, economist [[Robin Hanson]] wrote a blog post likening access to sex with access to income, writing that he found it puzzling that similar concern had not been shown to incels as to low income individuals. Hanson was criticized by some for discussing sex as if it was a commodity; others wrote more positively about his opinions.<ref name="FTMay2018" /> ''New York Times'' columnist [[Ross Douthat]] wrote a similarly controversial op-ed in May 2018 titled "The Redistribution of Sex" in which he suggested sex robots and [[sex worker]]s would inevitably be called upon to satisfy incels' sexual desires.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/5/4/17314260/incel-sex-robots-sexual-redistribution-ross-douthat-history|title=We're talking about "sex robots" now.
