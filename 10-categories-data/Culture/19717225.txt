{{short description|Stock character type}}
A '''Manic Pixie Dream Girl''' ('''MPDG''') is a [[stock character]] type in films. Film critic [[Nathan Rabin]], who coined the term after observing [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character in ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' (2005), said that the MPDG "exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures."<ref name="rabin">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-case-file-1-elizabethtown-the-bat,15577/ |title=My Year Of Flops, Case File 1: ''Elizabethtown'': The Bataan Death March of Whimsy |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |author-link=Nathan Rabin |date=January 25, 2007 |website=[[The A.V.

The Manic Pixie Dream Girl has been compared to another stock character, the [[Magical Negro]], a [[black people|black]] character who seems to exist only to provide spiritual or mystical help to the [[White savior narrative in film|white savior protagonist]]. In both cases, the stock character has no discernible inner life and usually exists only to provide the protagonist some important life lessons.<ref name="avclub">{{cite web |last1=Bowman |first1=Donna |last2=Gillette |first2=Amelie |last3=Hyden |first3=Steven |last4=Murray |first4=Noel |last5=Pierce |first5=Leonard |last6=Rabin |first6=Nathan |date=August 4, 2008 |title=Wild things: 16 films featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=[[The A.V.

==Examples==
MPDGs are usually [[static characters]] who have eccentric personality quirks and are unabashedly girlish. They invariably serve as the romantic interest for a (most often brooding or depressed) male protagonist. Examples of an MPDG are described below:
*[[Natalie Portman]]'s character in the movie ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'' (2004), written and directed by [[Zach Braff]].<ref name="rabin"/><ref name="welker"/><ref name="salon">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111008100651/http://life.salon.com/2008/08/07/manic_pixie/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 8, 2011 |title=The Natalie Portman problem |last=Berman |first=Judy |date=August 7, 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |access-date=January 5, 2010 }}</ref> In his review of ''Garden State'', [[Roger Ebert]] also described this kind of rather unbelievable "movie creature" as "completely available" and "absolutely desirable".<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden State |first=Roger |last=Ebert |author-link=Roger Ebert |website=Rogerebert.com |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/garden-state-2004 |date=August 6, 2004 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>
*''[[The A.V. Club]]'' points to [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s character in ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938) as one of the earliest examples of the archetype.<ref name="avclub"/> 

===Counterexamples===
*The titular character of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977) is often called a MPDG but is arguably not one, as she has her own goals independent of the male lead.<ref name="kelly">{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Dominic |date=January 9, 2013 |title=Clip joint: Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/09/clip-joint-manic-pixie-dream-girls |access-date=October 27, 2020}}</ref>
*[[Kate Winslet]]'s character Clementine in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004) acknowledges the trope of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and rejects the type, in a remark to [[Jim Carrey]]'s Joel: "Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's lookin' for my own peace of mind; don't assign me yours."<ref name="filmspotting">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |title=Top Five Manic Pixie Dream Girls |website=Filmspotting |date=November 19, 2010 |access-date=June 26, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617034840/http://www.filmspotting.net/reviews/624-fs-326-127-hours-top-5-manic-pixie-dream-girls.html |archive-date=June 17, 2016 }}</ref>
*Although [[Zooey Deschanel]]'s Summer in ''[[500 Days of Summer]]'' (2009) is often identified as a MPDG, the movie can be seen as a deconstruction of the trope because it shows the dangers of idealising women as things, rather than respecting them as real people with their own complex outlooks. Director [[Marc Webb]] stated, "Yes, Summer has elements of the manic pixie dream girl&nbsp;– she is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/500-days-of-summer |title="'Is there such a thing as "the one" - and what happens if you lose her?" |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Wiseman |first=Eva |date=August 16, 2009 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>
*Eve, the lead character of [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]]'s [[musical film]], ''[[God Help the Girl (film)|God Help the Girl]]'' (2014), has also been noted as a subversion of the trope, with actress [[Emily Browning]] approaching the character as "the anti-manic pixie dream girl" and describing her as having "her own inner life" and being "incredibly self-absorbed; [...] Olly wants her to be his muse and she's like, 'No, I'm not having that. I'm gonna go do my own shit.'"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luckymag.com/style/2014/09/emily-browning-god-help-the-girl |first=Laura |last=Morgan |title=Emily Browning On Playing An 'Anti-Manic Pixie Dream Girl' In The New Pop Musical God Help The Girl |website=Lucky Magazine |date=October 13, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013042032/http://www.luckymag.com/style/2014/09/emily-browning-god-help-the-girl |archive-date=October 13, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/01/sundance-stuart-murdoch-belle-and-sebastian-god-help-the-girl.html |first=Jada |last=Juan |title=Sundance: Belle and Sebastian Front Man Stuart Murdoch's Glasgow Musical |publisher=[[Vulture.com]] |date=January 26, 2014 |access-date=January 5, 2015}}</ref>
*Margo Roth Spiegelman in ''[[Paper Towns (film)|Paper Towns]]'' (2015) is a deconstruction of the trope, the author of the book, [[John Green (author)|John Green]], has stated   "''Paper Towns'' is devoted IN ITS ENTIRETY to destroying the lie of the manic pixie dream girl...

==Criticism and debate==
In an interview with Vulture, the entertainment section of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', about her film ''[[Ruby Sparks]]'', actress and screenwriter [[Zoe Kazan]] criticized the term as reductive, [[diminutive]], and [[misogynistic]]. She disagreed that Hepburn's character in ''Bringing Up Baby'' is a MPDG: "I think that to lump together all individual, original quirky women under that rubric is to erase all difference."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/07/zoe-kazan-ruby-sparks-interview.html |title=Zoe Kazan on Writing ''Ruby Sparks'' and Why You Should Never Call Her a 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |first=Patti |last=Greco |publisher=Vulture |date=July 23, 2012 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>

In a December 2012 video, [[AllMovie]] critic Cammila Collar embraced the term as an effective description of one-dimensional female characters who only seek the happiness of the male protagonist, and who do not deal with any complex issues of their own. The pejorative use of the term, then, is mainly directed at writers who do not give these female characters more to do than bolster the spirits of their male partners.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMsrwfbyxMo |title=Semantic Breakdown: The Manic Pixie Dream Bitch |work=[[YouTube]] |date=December 14, 2012 |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>

In December 2012, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Aisha Harris posited that "critiques of the MPDG may have become more common than the archetype itself", suggesting that filmmakers had been forced to become "self-aware about such characters" in the years since Rabin's coining of the phrase and that the trope had largely disappeared from film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Aisha |title=Is the Manic Pixie Dream Girl Dead? |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/05/manic_pixie_prostitute_video_is_the_latest_critique_of_the_manic_pixie_dream.html |website=Slate |publisher=The Slate Group |date=December 5, 2012 |access-date=September 16, 2014}}</ref>

In July 2013, Kat Stoeffel, for ''[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]'', argued that the use of the term had become sexist, in that "it was levied, criminally at [[Diane Keaton]] in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and [[Zooey Deschanel]], the actual person. ''How could a real person's defining trait be a lack of interior life?"''<ref>{{cite web |last=Stoeffel |first=Kat |title=The 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' Has Died |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/07/manic-pixie-dream-girl-has-died.html |website=The Cut |publisher=New York Media LLC. |access-date=September 16, 2014}}</ref>

Similar sentiments were elucidated by Monika Bartyzel for ''[[The Week]]'' in April 2013, who wrote "this once-useful piece of critical shorthand has devolved into laziness and sexism". Bartyzel argues that "[The term] 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' was useful when it commented on the superficiality of female characterizations in male-dominated journeys, but it has since devolved into a pejorative way to deride unique women in fiction and reality."<ref>{{cite web |last=Bartyzel |first=Monika |title=Girls on Film: Why it's time to retire the term 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/243265/girls-on-film-why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-manic-pixie-dream-girl |website=The Week |publisher=The Week Publications, Inc. |date=April 26, 2013 |access-date=September 15, 2014}}</ref>

==Retraction of the term==
In July 2014, for ''Salon'', Rabin offered a retraction of the term "Manic Pixie Dream Girl." He argued that in "giving an idea a fuzzy definition," he inadvertently gave the phrase power it was not intended to have. The trope's popularity, Rabin suggested, led to discussions of a more precise definition, a reduction of the critic's all-encompassing classification of MPDG. While he coined the term to expose the sexist implications in modern culture, the "phrase was increasingly accused of being sexist itself." Backlash occurred when many well-loved female characters were placed under this trope. In response, Rabin suggested that nuanced characters cannot be classified in such a restricted nature, and thus he apologized to pop culture for "creating this unstoppable monster." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/07/15/im_sorry_for_coining_the_phrase_manic_pixie_dream_girl/ |date=July 15, 2014 |title=I'm sorry for coining the phrase "Manic Pixie Dream Girl": In 2007, I invented the term in a review. Then I watched in queasy disbelief as it seemed to take over pop culture |first=Nathan |last=Rabin |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |access-date=June 26, 2016}}</ref>

==Manic Pixie Dream Boy==
A possible male version of this trope, the Manic Pixie Dream Boy or Manic Pixie Dream Guy, was found in Augustus Waters from the film version of ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'' (2014); he was given this title in a 2014 [[Vulture.com|''Vulture'']] article, in which Matt Patches stated, "he's a bad boy, he's a sweetheart, he's a dumb jock, he's a nerd, he's a philosopher, he's a poet, he's a victim, he's a survivor, he's everything everyone wants in their lives, and he's a fallacious notion of what we can ''actually'' have in our lives." <ref>{{cite web |last=Patches |first=Matt |title=He's Perfect, He's Awful: The Case Against The Fault in Our Stars' Gus Waters |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/case-against-fault-in-our-stars-gus-waters-manic-pixie-dream-guy.html |website=Vulture |publisher=New York Magazine|access-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

The Manic Pixie Dream Boy trope has also been pointed out in sitcoms such as ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]].'' The female protagonists of these shows are married to men ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]'s [[Ben Wyatt (Parks and Recreation)|Ben Wyatt]] and [[James Marsden]]'s Criss Chros, respectively), who, according to a 2012 ''[[Grantland]]'' article, "patiently [tamp] down her stubbornness and temper while appreciating her quirks, helping her to become her best possible self." <ref>{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Molly |title=1D Internet Fantasies: Liz Lemon, One Direction, and the Rise of the Manic Pixie Dream Guy |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/1d-internet-fantasies-liz-lemon-one-direction-and-the-rise-of-the-manic-pixie-dream-guy/ |publisher=Grantland |access-date=September 17, 2014}}</ref>

Another version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl is the algorithm-defined fantasy girl. Although the latter is not human, but a robot or artificial intelligence, her function is the same: to fulfill the desires of the male character and to help him in his journey without having any desires or journey of her own. Some examples are Joi in ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' and Samantha in [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Her (film)|Her]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/11/16455282/blade-runner-2049-analysis-ana-de-armas-fantasy-girl|title=Blade Runner 2049 continues questionable trend of the 'algorithm-defined fantasy girl'|first=Julia|last=Alexander|date=11 October 2017|website=Polygon|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Rose |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/15/ex-machina-sexy-female-robots-scifi-film-obsession |title=Ex Machina and sci-fi's obsession with sexy female robots &#124; Film |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>
