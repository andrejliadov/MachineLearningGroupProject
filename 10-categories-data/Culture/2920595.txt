In [[publishing]] and [[library science|library and information science]], the term '''serial''' is applied to materials "in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_S.aspx?#serial |title=Serial |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>

This includes the [[serial (literature)|literary serial]], where a story is published in several parts, but also all kinds of [[Periodical literature|periodicals]] such as magazines and journals.

== Periodicals ==
{{main|Periodical literature}}
In contrast to serials in general, a periodical has been defined as "A serial publication with its own distinctive title, containing a mix of articles  ... by more than one contributor, issued ... at regular stated intervals of less than a year, without prior decision as to when the final issue will appear."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_P.aspx?#periodical |title=Periodical |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref> 
Thus a periodical does not admit irregularly spaced publication times. This includes [[magazines]] and [[academic journals|journals]], but not [[proceedings]]; it also does not include [[newspapers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_N.aspx?#newspaper |title=Newspaper |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}</ref>
