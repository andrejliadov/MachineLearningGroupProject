'''Anarcho-primitivism''' is a political ideology that advocates a return to non-"[[civilized]]" ways of life through [[deindustrialization]], abolition of the [[division of labor]] or specialization and abandonment of large-scale organization [[technologies]]. Anarcho-primitivists critique the origins and progress of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[industrial society]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=el-Ojeili|first1=Chamsy|last2=Taylor|first2=Dylan|date=2020-04-02|title="The Future in the Past": Anarcho-primitivism and the Critique of Civilization Today|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08935696.2020.1727256|journal=Rethinking Marxism|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=168–186|doi=10.1080/08935696.2020.1727256|s2cid=219015323|issn=0893-5696}}</ref> According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to [[agricultural subsistence]] during the [[Neolithic Revolution]] gave rise to [[coercion]], [[social alienation]] and [[social stratification]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jeihouni|first1=Mojtaba|last2=Maleki|first2=Nasser|date=2016-12-12|title=Far from the madding civilization: Anarcho-primitivism and revolt against disintegration in Eugene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape|url=http://revistas.um.es/ijes/article/view/238911|journal=International Journal of English Studies|volume=16|issue=2|pages=61|doi=10.6018/ijes/2016/2/238911|issn=1989-6131}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]], an influential early [[green-anarchist]] work]]
In the United States, anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. In his book ''[[Walden]]'', he advocates [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.<ref name="Thoreau">{{cite web |url= http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html |title=La Insumisión Voluntaria: El Anarquismo Individualista Español Durante La Dictadura Y La Segunda República (1923–1938) |trans-title= Draft Avoidance: Spanish Individualistic Anarchism During the Dictatorship and the Second Republic (1923–1938) |author= Diez, Xavier Diez |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060526224800/http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html|archive-date=26 May 2006|

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por John Zerzan. Para George Woodcock(8), esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.|language=es}}
:Translated: "His most representative work is ''Walden'', published in 1854, although redacted between 1845 and 1847 when Thoreau decided to move to an isolated cabin in the woods and live in intimate contact with nature in a solitary and sober life. His philosophy, from this experience, attempts to transmit the idea that a return to respecting nature is necessary, and that happiness is, above all, a fruit of inner richness and harmony between individuals and the natural environment. Many have seen Thoreau as a precursor to ecologism and anarcho-primitism, actualized by John Zerzan. For Woodcock (8), this attitude can also be motivated by the idea of resistance to progress and the rejection of the increasing materialism that characterized North American society in the mid-19th century."</ref> "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today by [[John Zerzan]].

This tendency was strong enough as to call the attention of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]&ndash;[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] in Spain. [[Daniel Guérin]], in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'', reports how "Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called "[[affinity group]]s". There were many adepts of naturism and vegetarianism among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a stateless society. At the Zaragoza congress, the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, "unsuited to industrialization." As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the Congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the Confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html|title=Anarchism: From theory to practice|author=Guérin, Daniel|author-link=Daniel Guérin}}</ref>

=== Recent themes ===
Anarchists contribute to an [[anti-authoritarian]] push,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jun|first=Nathan|title=Anarchist Philosophy and Working Class Struggle: A Brief History and Commentary|date=September 2009|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1743-4580.2009.00251.x|journal=WorkingUSA|volume=12|issue=3|pages=505–519|doi=10.1111/j.1743-4580.2009.00251.x|issn=1089-7011}}</ref> which challenges all abstract power on a fundamental level, striving for [[egalitarian]] relationships and promoting communities based upon [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guérin, Daniel, 1904-1988.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/81623|title=Anarchism : from theory to practice|date=1970|publisher=Monthly Review Press|others=Paul Avrich Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0-85345-128-1|location=New York|oclc=81623}}</ref> Primitivists, however, extend ideas of non-domination to all life, not just human life, going beyond the traditional anarchist's analysis. Using the work of [[anthropologists]], primitivists look at the origins of civilization so as to understand what they are up against and how current society formed in order to inform a change in direction. Inspired by the [[Luddites]], primitivists rekindle an anti-technological orientation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gardenier|first=Matthijs|date=2016|title=Le courant " anti-tech ", entre anarcho-primitivisme et néo-luddisme|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/soc.131.0097|journal=Sociétés|volume=131|issue=1|pages=97|doi=10.3917/soc.131.0097|issn=0765-3697}}</ref> [[Insurrectionary anarchism|Insurrectionalists]] do not believe in waiting for critiques to be fine-tuned, instead spontaneously attacking civilization's current institutions.

Primitivists may owe much to the [[Situationists]] and their critique of the ideas in ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' and alienation from a commodity-based society. [[Deep ecology]] informs the primitivist perspective with an understanding that the well-being of all life is linked to the awareness of the inherent worth and intrinsic value of the non-human world, independent of its economic value. Primitivists see deep ecology's appreciation for the richness and diversity of life as contributing to the realization that present human interference with the non-human world is coercive and excessive.

[[Bioregionalism|Bioregionalists]] bring the perspective of living within one's bioregion, and being intimately connected to the land, water, climate, plants, animals, and general patterns of their bioregion.<ref>{{Citation|last=Perrin|first=Coline|title=Social Justice in Spatial Planning: How Does Bioregionalism Contribute?|date=2020|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45870-6_6|work=Bioregional Planning and Design: Volume I|pages=97–110|place=Cham|publisher=Springer International Publishing|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-45870-6_6|isbn=978-3-030-45869-0|access-date=2020-10-11}}</ref>

Some primitivists have been influenced by the various [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. Primitivists attempt to learn and incorporate [[sustainable]] techniques for survival and healthier ways of interacting with life. Some are also inspired by the [[Feral (subculture)|feral subculture]], where people abandon domestication and have re-integrate themselves with the wild.

Some theorists posit that the fact that anarcho-primitivism has existed as a political ideology consistently for so long points to a dissatisfaction with civilization and a desire to return to nature felt across cultures and generations. They argue that the width of the divide between civilization and nature, or the perception thereof, is a factor that feeds the desire to destroy civilization, and by extension, supports the continued relevance of anarcho-primitivist thought.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2010-11-30|title=Western Political Science Association 2011 Meeting|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1065912910389134|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=63|issue=4|pages=933|doi=10.1177/1065912910389134|issn=1065-9129}}</ref>

[...] If this is so we can go further and say that since the egalitarian hunting-gathering society is the oldest type of human society and prevailed for the longest period of time – over thousands of decades – then anarchy must be the oldest and one of the most enduring kinds of polity.

Some anarcho-primitivists state that prior to the advent of [[agriculture]] humans lived in small, [[nomad]]ic [[Band society|bands]] which were socially, politically, and economically [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]]. Being without [[hierarchy]], these bands are sometimes viewed as embodying a form of [[anarchism]].

Primitivists hold that following the emergence of agriculture the growing masses of humanity became evermore beholden to [[technology]] ("technoaddiction") <ref>{{cite journal|author=Boyden, Stephen Vickers|title=Biohistory: The interplay between human society and the biosphere, past and present|journal=Man and the Biosphere Series|volume=8|location=Pari|publisher=UNESCO|year=1992|issue= supplement 173|doi=10.1021/es00028a604}}</ref> and abstract power structures arising from the [[division of labor]] and hierarchy. Primitivists disagree over what degree of [[horticulture]] might be present in an anarchist society, with some arguing that [[permaculture]] could have a role but others advocating a strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence.

Primitivism has drawn heavily upon [[cultural anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]. From the 1960s forward, societies once viewed as "[[barbaric]]" were reevaluated by academics, some of whom now hold that early humans lived in relative peace and prosperity in what has been called the "[[original affluent society]]". [[Frank Hole]], an early-agriculture specialist, and [[Kent Flannery]], a specialist in [[Mesoamerican]] civilization, have noted that, "No group on earth has more leisure time than hunters and gatherers, who spend it primarily on games, conversation and relaxing."<ref name="LWUM265">{{cite book |author=Gowdy, John M.|title=Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A Reader on Hunter-Gatherer Economics

Based on evidence that life expectancy has decreased with the adoption of agriculture, the anthropologist [[Mark Nathan Cohen]] has called for the need to revise the traditional idea that civilization represents progress in human well-being.<ref>{{cite book |title=Health and the Rise of Civilization |url=https://archive.org/details/healthriseofcivi0000cohe |url-access=registration |last=Nathan Cohen |first=Mark |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-300-05023-2}}</ref>

Scholars such as [[Karl Polanyi]] and [[Marshall Sahlins]] characterized primitive societies as [[gift economy|gift economies]] with "goods valued for their utility or beauty rather than cost; commodities exchanged more on the basis of need than of [[exchange value]]; distribution to the society at large without regard to labor that members have invested; labor performed without the idea of a wage in return or individual benefit, indeed largely without the notion of 'work' at all."<ref>{{cite book|author=Zerzan, John|title=Future Primitive and Other Essays|publisher=Autonomedia|year=1994|isbn=1-57027-000-7|url=http://www.awok.org/future_primitive/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080945/http://www.awok.org/future_primitive/|archive-date=28 September 2007}}</ref>
[[File:Anarcho Primitivism.jpg|thumb|An Anarcho-primitivist slogan, illustrating the perceived severity of the danger posed by civilization.]]

=== Civilization and violence ===
Anarcho-primitivists view civilization as the [[logic]], [[institution]], and physical apparatus of [[domestication]], control, and domination. They focus primarily on the question of origins. Civilization is seen as the underlying problem or root of oppression, and they believe that civilization should therefore be dismantled or destroyed.

Anarcho-primitivists describe the rise of civilization as the shift over the past 10,000 years from an existence deeply connected to the web of life, to one psychologically separated from and attempting to control the rest of life. They state that prior to civilization, there generally existed ample leisure time, considerable [[gender equality]] and [[social equality]], a non-destructive and uncontrolling approach to the natural world, the absence of organized [[violence]], no mediating or formal institutions, and strong health and robustness. Anarcho-primitivists state that civilization inaugurated mass warfare, the subjugation of women, population growth, busy work, concepts of property, entrenched hierarchies, as well as encouraging the spread of diseases. They claim that civilization begins with and relies on an enforced renunciation of instinctual freedom and that it is impossible to [[reform movement|reform]] away such a renunciation. Based on several anthropological references, they further state that hunter-gatherer societies are less susceptible to war, violence, and disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/sedentism.htm|title=The Consequences of Domestication and Sedentism|author1=Schultz, Emily|author2=Lavenda, Robert|access-date=11 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715184334/http://www.primitivism.com/sedentism.htm|archive-date=15 July 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Service |last=Elman |author-link=Elman Service |title=The Hunters |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1972 |asin=B000JNRGPK}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways |location=Washington |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=1995 |isbn=1-56098-465-1 }}</ref>

However, some—such as Lawrence Keely—contest this, citing that many tribe-based people are more prone to violence than developed states.<ref>{{cite book|title=War Before Civilization: the Myth of the Peaceful Savage|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|author=Keely, Lawrence|isbn=9780199880706}}</ref>
[[File:Domesticated wolf in home.png|thumb|A domesticated wolf.  Just as humans have torn the creature from its roots and unnaturally altered its behavior, Anarcho-Primitivists argue that civilization has done the same to humankind.]]

=== Domestication ===
Anarcho-primitivists, such as John Zerzan, define [[domestication]] as "the will to dominate animals and plants", claiming that domestication is "civilization's defining basis".<ref>{{cite book|author=Zerzan, John|title=Twilight of the Machines|publisher=Feral House|year=2008|isbn=978-1-932595-31-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi-ePQopZAgC&pg=PA55|page=55}}</ref>

They also describe it as the process by which previously [[nomadic]] human populations shifted towards a sedentary or settled existence through [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. They claim that this kind of domestication demands a totalitarian relationship with both the land and the plants and animals being domesticated. They say that whereas, in a state of wildness, all life shares and competes for resources, domestication destroys this balance. Domesticated landscape (e.g. pastoral lands/agricultural fields and, to a lesser degree, [[horticulture]] and [[gardening]]) ends the open sharing of resources; where "this was everyone's," it is now "mine." Anarcho-primitivists state that this notion of ownership laid the foundation for social [[hierarchy]] as property and power emerged. It also involved the destruction, enslavement, or assimilation of other groups of early people who did not make such a transition.

To primitivists, domestication enslaves both the domesticated species as well as the domesticators. Advances in the fields of psychology, anthropology, and sociology allow humans to quantify and objectify themselves, until they too become commodities.

==== Rewilding and reconnection ====
For most primitivist anarchists, rewilding and reconnecting with the earth is a life project. They state that it should not be limited to intellectual comprehension or the practice of primitive skills, but, instead, that it is a deep understanding of the pervasive ways in which we are [[domesticated]], fractured, and dislocated from ourselves, each other, and the world. Rewilding is understood as having a physical component which involves reclaiming skills and developing methods for a sustainable co-existence, including how to feed, shelter, and heal ourselves with the plants, animals, and materials occurring naturally in our [[bioregion]]s. It is also said to include the dismantling of the physical manifestations, apparatus, and infrastructure of civilization.

Rewilding is also described as having an [[emotion]]al component, which involves healing ourselves and each other from what are perceived as 10,000-year-old wounds, learning how to live together in non-hierarchical and non-oppressive communities, and de-constructing the domesticating mindset in our social patterns. To the primitivist, "rewilding includes prioritizing direct experience and passion over mediation and [[Social alienation|alienation]], re-thinking every dynamic and aspect of reality, connecting with our feral fury to defend our lives and to fight for a liberated existence, developing more trust in our intuition and being more connected to our [[instincts]], and regaining the balance that has been virtually destroyed after thousands of years of patriarchal control and domestication. Rewilding is the process of becoming uncivilized."

=== Consumerism and mass society ===
Brian Sheppard asserts that anarcho-primitivism is not a form of anarchism at all. In ''Anarchism vs. Primitivism'' he says: "In recent decades, groups of quasi-religious mystics have begun equating the primitivism they advocate (rejection of science, rationality, and technology often lumped together under a blanket term "technology") with anarchism. In reality, the two have nothing to do with each other."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism|author=Sheppard, Brian|title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism}}</ref>

Andrew Flood agrees with this assertion and points out that primitivism clashes with what he identifies as the fundamental goal of anarchism: "the creation of a free mass society".<ref>{{cite web|author=Flood, Andrew|title=Is primitivism realistic? An anarchist reply to John Zerzan and others|work=Anarchist Newswire|year=2005|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1890}}</ref>

Primitivists do not believe that a "[[mass society]]" can be free. They believe industry and agriculture inevitably lead to hierarchy and alienation. They argue that the [[division of labor]] techno-industrial societies require to function forces people into reliance on factories and the labor of other specialists to produce their food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities and that this dependence forces them to remain a part of this society, whether they like it or not.<ref name=":0">Wilson, Chris (2001).

=== Critique of mechanical time and symbolic culture ===
Some anarcho-primitivists view the shift towards an increasingly [[symbolic culture]] as highly problematic in the sense that it separates us from direct interaction. Often the response to this, by those who assume that it means that primitivists prefer to completely eliminate all forms of symbolic culture, is something to the effect of, "So, you just want to grunt?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenanarchy.org/index.php?action=viewwritingdetail&writingId=283|title=An Introduction to Anti-Civilization Anarchist Thought|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212125446/http://shiftshapers.gnn.tv/blogs/10387/An_Introduction_to_Anti_Civilization_Anarchist_Thought_and_Practice2008-12-12|archive-date=12 December 2008|author=The Green Anarchy Collective}}</ref> However, typically the critique regards the problems inherent within a form of communication and comprehension that relies primarily on symbolic thought at the expense (and even exclusion) of other sensual and unmediated means of comprehension. The emphasis on the symbolic is a departure from direct experience into mediated experience in the form of language, art, number, time, etc.

Anarcho-primitivists state that symbolic culture filters our entire perception through formal and informal [[symbols]] and separates us from direct and unmediated contact with reality. It goes beyond just giving things names, and extends to having an indirect relationship with a distorted image of the world that has passed through the lens of representation. It is debatable whether humans are "hard-wired" for symbolic thought, or if it developed as a cultural change or adaptation, but, according to anarcho-primitivists, the symbolic mode of expression and understanding is limited and deceptive, and over-dependence upon it leads to objectification, alienation, and perceptual [[tunnel vision]]. Many anarcho-primitivists promote and practice getting back in touch with and rekindling dormant and/or underutilized methods of interaction and cognition, such as touch and smell, as well as experimenting with and developing unique and personal modes of comprehension and expression.

Regarding those primitivists who have extended their critique of symbolic culture to language itself, [[Georgetown University]] professor [[Mark Lance]] describes this particular theory of primitivism as "literally insane, for proper communication is necessary to create within the box a means to destroy the box."<ref>Lance, Mark from lecture ''Anarchist Practice, Rational Democracy, and Community'' NCOR (2004).

Notable critics of anarcho-primitivism include [[Post-left anarchism|post-left anarchists]] Wolfi Landstreicher<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/wolfi-landstreicher-a-critique-not-a-program-for-a-non-primitivist-anti-civilization-critique|title=A Critique, Not a Program: For a Non-Primitivist Anti-Civilization Critique|author=Landstreicher, Wolfi|year=2007}}</ref> and [[Jason McQuinn]],<ref name=mcquinn>{{cite book|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/various-authors-a-dialog-on-primitivism#toc3|title=Why I am not a Primitivist|author=McQuinn, Jason|author-link=Jason McQuinn}}</ref> [[Ted Kaczynski]] (the "Unabomber"),<ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org">{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism|title=The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism|author=Kaczynski, Ted|author-link=Ted Kaczynski|quote="It seems obvious, for example, that the politically correct portrayal of hunter-gatherers is motivated in part by an impulse to construct an image of a pure and innocent world existing at the dawn of time, analogous to the [[Garden of Eden]]," and calls the evidence of the violence of hunter-gatherers "incontrovertible."}}</ref> and especially [[libertarian socialist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], as seen in his polemical work entitled ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism]]''.

=== Wording and semantics ===
Activist writer [[Derrick Jensen]] wrote in ''Walking on Water'' that he is often classified as a "[[Luddite#In modern thought|Luddite]]" and "an anarcho-primitivist. Both of these labels fit well enough, I suppose."<ref>{{cite book |title=Walking on Water |author=Jensen, Derrick |page =223 |year=2005|isbn=9781931498784}}</ref> Others, too, have designated his work with the latter term;<ref>{{cite book |title=Integral Ecology: Uniting Multiple Perspectives on the Natural World |author1=Esbjörn-Hargens, Sean |author2=Zimmerman, Michael E.  |year=2009 |page=492|isbn=9781590304662|publisher=Shambhala Publications}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Making a Killing: The Political Economy of Animal Rights |url=https://archive.org/details/makingkillingpol00torr |url-access=limited |author=Torres, Bob |page=[https://archive.org/details/makingkillingpol00torr/page/n82 68] |year=2007|isbn=9781904859673}}</ref> however, more recently, Jensen began to categorically reject the "primitivist" label, describing it as a "racist way to describe indigenous peoples." He prefers to be called "[[indigenism|indigenist]]" or an "ally to the indigenous."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zoeblunt.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/uncivilized/ |title=Uncivilized |first=Zoe |last=Blunt |work=[[Canadian Dimension]] |year=2011 |access-date=24 May 2011}}</ref>

=== Hypocrisy ===
A common criticism is of [[hypocrisy]], i.e. that people rejecting civilization typically maintain a civilized lifestyle themselves, often while still using the very industrial technology that they oppose in order to spread their message. Jensen counters that this criticism merely resorts to an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument, attacking individuals but not the actual validity of their beliefs.<ref name="endgame">{{cite book |last=Jensen|first=Derrick|author-link= Derrick Jensen |series=[[Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|Endgame]]|volume=1|title=The Problem of Civilization |year=2006 |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]] |location=New York City |page=128|isbn=978-1-58322-730-5}}</ref> He further responds that working to entirely avoid such hypocrisy is ineffective, self-serving, and a convenient misdirection of activist energies.<ref>Jensen, 2006, pp. 173–174: "[Although it's] vital to make lifestyle choices to mitigate damage caused by being a member of industrial civilization... to assign primary responsibility to oneself, and to focus primarily on making oneself better, is an immense copout, an abrogation of responsibility. With all the world at stake, it is self-indulgent, self-righteous, and self-important. It is also nearly ubiquitous. And it serves the interests of those in power by keeping our focus off them."</ref> Primitivist John Zerzan admits that living with this hypocrisy is a [[necessary evil]] for continuing to contribute to the larger intellectual conversation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Anarchy in the USA | location=London|date=20 April 2001}}</ref> Jason Godesky holds that the charge of hypocrisy is a generalization, affirming that "not all primitivists are against technology in and of itself; only some. Many primitivists hold a view that technology is ambiguous (...) So, the charge of hypocrisy only holds up if we extend the beliefs of ''some'' primitivists to ''all'' primitivists, or to primitivism itself." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/jason-godesky-5-common-objections-to-primitivism-and-why-they-re-wrong|title=5 Common Objections to Primitivism|website=The Anarchist Library|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

=== Glorification of indigenous societies ===
Wolfi Landstreicher and [[Jason McQuinn]], post-leftists, have both criticized the romanticized exaggerations of indigenous societies and the [[pseudoscientific]] (and even mystical) [[appeal to nature]] they perceive in anarcho-primitivist ideology and [[deep ecology]].<ref name="mcquinn"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wolfi_Landstreicher__The_Network_of_Domination.html#toc11|title=The Network of Domination}}</ref> Zerzan has countered that the anarcho-primitivist view is not idealizing the indigenous, but rather "has been the mainstream view presented in anthropology and archaeology textbooks for the past few decades. It sounds utopian, but it's now the generally accepted paradigm".<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMldzueBcUcC&q="unknown+to+most"|editor=Harmon, James L.|title=Take My Advice: Letters to the Next Generation from People Who Know a Thing or Two|isbn=9780743242875}}</ref>

[[Ted Kaczynski]] has also argued that certain anarcho-primitivists have exaggerated the short working week of primitive society, arguing that they only examine the process of food extraction and not the processing of food, creation of fire and childcare, which adds up to over 40 hours a week.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Primitivism|last=Kaczynski|first=Theodore|year=2008}}</ref>

=== Criticism from social anarchists ===
Besides Murray Bookchin, many [[class struggle]] oriented and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]] criticize primitivism as offering "no way forwards in the struggle for a free society" and that "often its adherents end up undermining that struggle by attacking the very things, like mass organization, that are a requirement to win it".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/library/civilisation-primitivism-anarchism-andrew-flood|title=Civilisation, primitivism and anarchism - Andrew Flood|website=libcom.org|access-date=28 June 2017}}</ref> Other social anarchists have also argued that abandoning technology will have dangerous consequences, pointing out that around 50% of the population of the United Kingdom requires glasses and would be left severely impaired. Radioactive waste would need to be monitored for tens of thousands of years with high-tech equipment to prevent it leaking into ecosystems, that the millions of people who need regular treatment for illnesses would die and that the removal of books, recorded music, medical equipment, central heating and sanitation would result in a rapid dropping of the quality of life. Furthermore, social anarchists contend that without advanced agriculture the Earth's surface would not be able to support billions of people, meaning that building a primitivist society would require the death of billions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/thought/anarcho-primitivism-anti-civilisation-criticism|title=Primitivism, anarcho-primitivism and anti-civilisationism - critique|date=12 October 2006|website=libcom.org}}</ref>
