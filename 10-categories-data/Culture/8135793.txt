'''Cultural framework''' is a term used in [[social science]] to explain [[tradition]]s, [[value system]]s, [[Mythology|myths]] and [[symbol]]s that are common in a given [[society]]. A given society may have multiple cultural frameworks (for example, [[United States]] society has different cultural frameworks for its [[White American|white]] and [[African American]] populations). Usually cultural frameworks are mixed; as certain individuals or entire groups can be familiar with many cultural frameworks.

There is an important relation between cultural frameworks and ideologies, as most successful ideologies are closely connected to cultural frameworks of societies they spread in. Cultural framework should not, however, be confused with [[ideology]], as those concepts are separate. For example, in [[Nazi Germany]], [[Nazism]] was an ideology, while religious beliefs, patriotism and traditions dating back to [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Frankish tribes]] were part of the German cultural framework.
