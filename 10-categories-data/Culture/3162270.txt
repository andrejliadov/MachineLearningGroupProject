In [[Europe]], tourist guides are represented by FEG, the European Federation of Tourist Guide Associations https://www.feg-touristguides.com/cen_definitions.php. In Europe, the tourist guiding qualification is specific to each and every country; in some cases the qualification is national, in some cases it is broken up into regions. In all cases it is embedded in the educational and training ethic of that country. EN15565 is a European Standard for the Training and Qualification of Tourist Guides.

In [[Australia]], tour guides are qualified to a minimum of Certificate III Guiding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/SIT30513 |title= Certificate III Guiding|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref>]. They belong to a couple of organisations, notably the ''Professional Tour Guide Association of Australia'' [PTGAA] and ''Guides of Australia'' [GOA].

In [[Japan]], tour guides are required to pass a certification exam by the Commissioner of the Japan Tourism Agency and register with the relevant prefectures.
