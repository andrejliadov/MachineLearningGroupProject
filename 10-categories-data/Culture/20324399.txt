'''Artificial languages''' are [[language]]s of a typically very limited size which emerge either in computer simulations between artificial agents, robot interactions or controlled psychological experiments with humans. They are different from both [[constructed language]]s and [[formal language]]s in that they have {{em|not}} been consciously devised by an individual or group but are the result of (distributed) conventionalisation processes, much like [[natural language]]s. Opposed to the idea of a central ''designer'', the field of '''artificial language evolution''' in which artificial languages are studied can be regarded as a sub-part of the more general [[cultural evolution]] studies.

==Origin==
The idea of creation of artificial language arose in 17th and 18th century as a result of gradually decreasing international role of Latin. The initial schemes were mainly aimed at the development of a rational language free from inconsistence of living language and based on classification of concepts. The material of living languages also appears later.

== Motivation ==

The lack of empirical evidence in the field of [[evolutionary linguistics]] has led many researchers to adopt computer simulations as a means to investigate the ways in which artificial agents can self-organize languages with natural-like properties.<ref>

By explicitly building all assumptions into computer simulations, this strand of research strives to experimentally investigate the dynamics underlying [[language change]] as well as questions regarding the [[origin of language]] under controlled conditions.

Due to its success the paradigm has also been extended to investigate the emergence of new languages in psychological experiments with humans,<ref>{{cite journal

Because the focus of the investigations lies on the conventionalisation dynamics and higher-level properties of the resulting languages rather than specific details of the conventions, artificially evolved languages are typically not documented or re-used outside the single experiment trial or simulation run in which they emerge. In fact, the limited size and short-lived nature of artificial languages are probably the only things that sets them apart from ''natural'' languages, since ''all'' languages are artificial insofar as they are [[conventional]] (see also [[Constructed language#Planned, constructed, artificial]]).

== Uses ==

Artificial languages have been used in research in developmental psycholinguistics. Because researchers have a great deal of control over artificial languages, they have used these languages in [[statistical language acquisition]] studies, in which it can be helpful to control the linguistic patterns heard by infants.<ref name = "soundtomeaning">{{cite journal | last1 = Hay | first1 = J.
