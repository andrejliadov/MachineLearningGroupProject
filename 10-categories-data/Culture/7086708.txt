'''''The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture''''', edited by [[David Horton (writer)|David Horton]], is an [[encyclopedia|encyclopaedia]] published by the [[Aboriginal Studies Press]] at the [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]] (AIATSIS) in 1994 and available in two volumes or on [[CD-ROM]] covering all aspects of [[Indigenous Australians]] lives and world (such as biography, [[History of Indigenous Australians|history]], [[Indigenous Australian art|art]], [[Aboriginal Australian languages|language]], [[Indigenous Australian sport|sport]], education, [[archaeology]], [[Indigenous Australian literature|literature]], [[Aboriginal title in Australia|land ownership]], social organisation, [[Indigenous health in Australia|health]], [[Indigenous music of Australia|music]], law, technology, media, economy, politics, food and religion). There are 2000 entries and 1000 photographs, with the CD-ROM having 250 sound items and 40 videos.

A map showing all of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal groups]], "based on language, history, self-identification, culture, [and] technology" as in the ''Encyclopaedia'', was created by Horton in 1996 (and later updated).

==Description==
''The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture'' was first published in two volumes, containing 1340 pages of entries and illustrations, in 1994.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Horton, David, 1945- | title=The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture | date=1994 | publisher= Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8020447?selectedversion=NBD57590143 | isbn=978-0-85575-234-7 | accessdate=16 May 2020 }}</ref>

According to Horton, ''The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia'' was "the first significant authoritative and comprehensive reference on all aspects of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture". It covers all major subject categories, including history, art, economy, food, health, land ownership, language, law, literature, and music, as well as more recent political issues and biographies.<ref name=researchgate>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330293198|title=The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia|first1=David|last1=Horton|website=ResearchGate|access-date=16 May 2020}} Note: Includes downloadable PDF of the Introduction.</ref> 

Over 200 contributors wrote articles for the ''Encyclopaedia'', many of them Indigenous writers, activists or scholars. The editor chose to mention [[white people]] in the ''Encyclopaedia'' only where they had some impact on Aboriginal society.<ref>Read, Peter. For the record. In: ''Australian book review''. No. 165, Oct 1994, p. 29-30.</ref> There about 2000 entries and about 1000 photographs, maps and drawings. Two main themes are attributed to every article: Geographic Region and General subject.<ref name=artlink>{{cite web | title=Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia ed David Horton | website=Artlink Magazine|first1=Katrina|last1=Power | date=December 1996 | url=https://www.artlink.com.au/articles/444/encyclopaedia-of-aboriginal-australia-ed-david-hor/ | access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> Prominent Aboriginal Australians [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]], [[David Mowaljarlai]], and [[Galarrwuy Yunupingu]] all wrote endorsements to be printed on the cover of the book.<ref name=researchgate/>

The work is aimed at a wide audience, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and it is written for general as well as academic readers. Most entries are followed by suggestions for further reading, with each work fully cited in the [[bibliography]].<ref name=aaa>{{cite web | title=Review of 'Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture' edited by D.

===Maps===
The map, published separately in 1996 (and with further editions in 1999, 2000, 2008 and 2013<ref>{{cite web|website=Trove|publisher=National Library of Australia|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/6404952?q=exact_creator%3A%22Horton+David+1945%22&l-format=Map&c=map|title=Aboriginal Australia / compiled by David Horton Horton, David, 1945-| access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref>) delineates about 500 groups, divided into 18 geographic regions.<ref name=researchgate/> Horton created the original map "by laying a large piece of transparent paper over the top of a large [[Norman Tindale|Tindale]] map" and then searching for further information from various published works, [[theses]] and work by linguists. The result of his researches led to the creation of the distinctive "fuzzy borders" of his map, which mostly corresponded with Tindale's boundaries. His original hand-drawn version is dated 1993. This version, which he called the "mud map" was used as a basis for the maps in the printed encyclopaedia. The [[Australian Surveying and Land Information Group]] (AUSLIG), a precursor to [[Geoscience Australia]], produced the 1996 version.<ref name=aiatsisdoc>{{cite web|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/catalogue_resources/ms_5086_horton.pdf|website=AIATSIS|title=MS5086: David Horton, papers, including Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia 1984-1999 |first1=Cathryn|last1= Zdanowicz|date=July 2019|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref>

==Reviews==
A 1996 review by an Indigenous reviewer called it a "Dreaming Send", praising the work for representing the Indigenous perspective and for recognising both the diversity as well as the unity among Indigenous Australians. She writes also that it allows white Australians to find information they may not otherwise find, while using a "very concise and easy to absorb style".<ref name=artlink/>

Archaeologist Sharon Wellfare said that the "much admired" work was an "invaluable resource", which she had used extensively in teaching Aboriginal Studies in [[New South Wales]] public schools. She did have some criticisms, notably that the context in which each entry was written relied on self-identification by the author, which was not always evident, as biographies of authors are not supplied.<ref name=aaa/>

The CD-ROM was made available after the launch of the book version in 1994. It was criticised for user-unfriendliness due to the lack of hypertext links. Important details, such as the passing of the ''[[Native Title Act 1993]]'', were missing from the CD-ROM as of 1995.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1= David |last2=Keefe|first2= Kevin|title= Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia CDROM [review]|journal= Aboriginal History.|volume=19|issue= 1–2|date= 1995|jstor= 24046314 |pages= 206–209}} (Requires login - free account)</ref>
