**The 'giraffe-like' stretched necks (sometimes also other organs) of women among the Burmese [[Kayan (Myanmar)|Kayan]] tribe, the result of wearing [[Neck ring|brass coils]] around them.

==Controversy==
"Disfigurement" and "mutilation" (regardless of any appreciation this always applies objectively whenever a bodily function is gravely diminished or lost) are terms used by opponents of body modification to describe certain types of modifications, especially non-consensual ones. Those terms are used fairly uncontroversially to describe the victims of [[torture]], who have endured damage to [[ear]]s, eyes, feet, [[genitalia]], [[hand]]s, [[human nose|noses]], [[teeth]], and/or [[tongue]]s, including [[amputation]], [[burn (injury)|burning]], [[flagellation]], [[piercing]], [[skinning]], and [[breaking wheel|wheeling]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Some invasive procedures that modify human genitals are performed with the [[informed consent]] of the patient, using [[anesthesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0315/p1514.html#sec-2|title=Adult Circumcision|author=John R. Holman-Keith A. Stuessi}}</ref><ref>https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/malecircumcision/who_mc_local_anaesthesia.pdf</ref> The phrase "[[Genital modification and mutilation|Genital mutilation]]" is sometimes used to describe procedures that individuals are forced to undergo without their informed consent, or without anesthesia or sterilised surgical tools.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Rationalising circumcision: from tradition to fashion, from public health to individual freedom—critical notes on cultural persistence of the practice of genital mutilation| pmc=1733870 | pmid=15173357|volume=30| issue=3 |date=June 2004|pages=248–53 | last1 = Hellsten | first1 = SK | journal=J Med Ethics | doi=10.1136/jme.2004.008888}}</ref> The phrase has been applied to involuntary [[castration]], [[male circumcision]], and [[female genital mutilation]]. Intersex campaigners say that childhood modification of genitals of individuals with [[intersex]] conditions without their informed consent is a form of mutilation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilchins|first=Riki|title=A Girl's Right to Choose: Intersex Children and Parents Challenge Narrow Standards of Gender|url=http://www.now.org/nnt/summer-2002/intersex.html|work=NOW Times|publisher=National Organization for Women|access-date=12 September 2012}}</ref>

Many use body modification and self-mutilation interchangeably.{{cn|date=August 2020}} In many ways self-mutilation is very different than body-modification. Body modification gives one the feeling of pride and excitement, giving one something to show off to others.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bradley University: Body Modification & Body Image|url = http://www.bradley.edu/sites/bodyproject/disability/modification/|website = www.bradley.edu|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> Alternately, those who self-mutilate typically are ashamed of what they've done and want to hide any evidence of harm. Body modification is explored for adornment, self-expression, and an array of many other positive reasons, while self-mutilation is inflicted because of mental or emotional stress and the inability to cope with psychological pain. Those who self-mutilate do so in order to punish themselves, express internal turmoil, and reduce severe anxiety.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Self-injury/cutting Causes - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/self-injury/basics/causes/con-20025897|website = www.mayoclinic.org|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref>
