'''Sharism''' is a philosophy on [[sharing]] content and ideas, developed by [[Isaac Mao]]. Inspired by [[user-generated content]], sharism states that the act of sharing something within a community produces a proper value for each of its participants: "the more you share, the more you receive".<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Jon|title=Sharism: The more you share, the more you receive|url=http://www.slideshare.net/rejon/sharism-the-more-you-share-the-more-you-receive|access-date=May 28, 2012|location=Slideshare|date=2010-10-12}}</ref> As knowledge is produced through [[crowdsourcing]], this new kind of shared ownership leads to the production of goods and services where value is distributed through the contributions of everyone involved.

== History ==
''Sharism'' was coined by [[Isaac Mao]] in the essay "Sharism: A Mind Revolution" which was originally published in the book ''[[Freesouls]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://freesouls.cc/essays/07-isaac-mao-sharism.html | title=Sharism: A Mind Revolution}}</ref> Mao draws a comparison between the open distribution model of online information sharing and the neurological networks of the human brain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ito |first1=Joi |last2=Mao |first2=Isaac |first3=Christopher (ed.) |last3=Adams |title=Freesouls Captured and Released by Joi Ito|publisher=Freesouls.cc |date=December 12, 2008 |orig-year=1st.

Sharism has been particularly focused in [[China]] in order to promote the [[Open Web]] and combat Internet censorship.<ref>{{cite web| title=We Share. We Do Not Censor|url=http://www.we-magazine.net/we-volume-03/we-share-we-do-not-censor/| access-date=May 24, 2012}}</ref> Notable proponents of sharism as both a term and practice have included [[Larry Lessig]] and [[Ou Ning]]. In 2010 during a [[Creative Commons]] lecture in [[Beijing]], Lessig mentioned sharism in the context of openness and innovation in creative industries and intellectual property law in China.<ref>{{cite speech |title=Openness and Innovation - 开放与创新 |first=Larry |last=Lessig |work=Renmin University of China Law School, Intellectual Property Institute |location=Renmin University of China, Beijing |date=November 14, 2010 |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/10/30/1-8/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185120/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/10/30/1-8/ |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} See also {{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/11/17/1-10/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185552/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/11/17/1-10/ |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}, {{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2011/05/20/4-4/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-05-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111848/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2011/05/20/4-4/ |archive-date=February 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}.</ref> Also in 2010, Ou in his role as a curator choose sharism as the unifying theme for the [[Shanghai]] biennale exhibition "Get It Louder".<ref>{{cite web|title= Get It Louder: Sharism Forum Introduction| url=http://2010.getitlouder.com/enChair.aspx?ID=84| access-date=October 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= "Get It Louder" Exhibition Blasts Beijing and Shanghai with Contemporary Art |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/35868/get-it-louder-exhibition-blasts-beijing-and-shanghai-with-contemporary-art| access-date=September 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Get It Louder: China's Most Influential and {{sic|hide=y|Closely|-}}Watched Exhibition of Emerging, Young Talent|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&int_new=41009| access-date=May 24, 2012}}</ref> In an interview about the exhibition, Ou discussed sharism at length and described it as an "Internet concept" that explores the increasingly convoluted relationship between public and private realms."<ref>{{cite web| title=Ou Ning on Get it Louder – new voice in China's visual arts scene| url=http://artradarjournal.com/2010/12/22/ou-ning-on-get-it-louder-new-voice-in-chinas-visual-arts-scene/| access-date=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

Sharism Lab was created in 2012 with the purpose of providing experimental and theoretical background for a [[reality|real-world]] implementation of sharism.<ref>[http://sharismlab.com/ Sharism Lab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529221341/http://sharismlab.com/ |date=May 29, 2012 }}</ref>

== Events and by-products ==
{{verify source|date=April 2014}}

Several types of sharism events have been created for people to meet and share things they like or things they make. Sharism Forum was held in October 2010 at the Get It Louder festival in Shanghai, and gathered international speakers, practitioners and activists to discuss the idea of sharism. 

Another event called "Sharism Presents" offers an informal setup for people to share whatever they want with the attending audience. Since 2010, Sharism Presents have been hosted in many cities throughout the world, included: Amsterdam, Shanghai, Beijing, Madrid, Barcelona, Brussels, Berlin, Montreal, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.

Sharism Workshops provide a framework for collective production through the act of sharing. Workshops have been held in Beijing, Doha and Warsaw and have included musicians, digital artists, and designers.

In order to offer an easy way to share any kind of work online, the Sharing Agreement has been created in order to work around the increasing complexity of [[licenses]].

== Criticism ==
Many academics point to the downsides of such uncritical belief in the transformative power of technology. User generated content has been reframed as "Loser Generated Content", as the value of this sharing often ends up with companies, and not in the [[public domain]].<ref>[http://www.firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2141/1948 Loser Generated Content: from participation to exploitation]</ref>
Within the art world, it has been suggested that there are "dangers of 'sharism", which "lead people to believe that whatever is contemporary must also be avantgarde."<ref>[http://leapleapleap.com/2012/05/interpreting-theory-two-models-for-importation/ Interpreting Theory: Two Models For Importation]</ref>
