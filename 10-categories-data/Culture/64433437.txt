==Origin==
The writer [[Horace Walpole]] is credited with the first recorded English use of ''conversazione'' in a letter written (from Italy) on 11 November 1739 to Richard West (1716-1742) in which he writes, "After the play we were introduced to the assembly, which they [viz., the Italians] call the ''conversazione''".<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mJJAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false (Letter to Richard West, sent from Turin, 11 November 1739), in ''The Letters of Horace Walpole, … Volume I'', Lea and Blanchard, (Philadelphia), 1842, pp.138-140; at p.140.]</ref><ref>The term is derived from the  [[Italian language|Italian]] ''conversazione'' (“conversation”). The word has two plural forms in English: ''conversaziones'' and ''conversazioni''.</ref>

== Historical usage in Britain ==
[[File:A scientific conversazione.jpg|thumb|350px|A scientific conversazione on microscopy held at Apothecaries' Hall London on 11 April 1855.]]
In Italy, the term generally refers to a gathering for conversation; and was first used in English to identify the sort of private social gathering more generally known today as an "At Home".<ref>For example, in her diary entry for Sunday, 10 November 1782, [[Frances Burney|Fanny Burney, a.k.a. Madame d'Arbay]] noted that "The Honourable Miss Monckton [was] one of those who stand foremost in collecting all extraordinary or curious people to her London conversaziones, which, like those of [[Elizabeth Vesey|Mrs. Vesey]], mix the rank and the literature, and exclude all beside."

In England, however, it soon came to be far more widely used to denote the gatherings of a far more intellectual character, and was applied in the more specific sense of a scientific, artistic, or literary assembly/[[soirée]],<ref>See, for example, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=VrhWgChISWUC&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=%22conversazione%22,+%27soiree%22&source=bl&ots=vLtvTTHk0U&sig=ACfU3U18rqhUrZkebu_Ign4FUz5ExyFZbw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvvZDtirfqAhWY63MBHZOQCC0Q6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22conversazione%22&f=false ''The British and Foreign Institute's'' "Programme of the Lectures, Conversazione, Soirees, & Discussions, for the Season of 1845", reprinted in ''The Edinburgh Review'', No.164, (December 1844), p.304] and, also, [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=D3DnNCgoyFAC&pg=PA350#v=onepage&q&f=false The Month: Science and Arts, ''Chambers's Journal of popular Literature'', No.282, (Saturday, 28 May 1859), pp.350-352.]</ref> generally held at night.<ref>[https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsnr.1958.0007 Bluhm, R.K., "A Note on the Origin of the Society's Conversaziones", ''Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London'', Vol.30, No.1, (30 June 1958), pp.61-63.] </ref><ref>According to Alberti (2003), p.217, the implicit demand for formal dress suggests that it tended to exclude the [[Lower middle class|lower middle-]] and [[working-class]] and, thereby, tended to ensure that only well-off audiences attended such gatherings.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-04-10|title=Conversazione: Science and Art|url=https://karenwestendorf2.wordpress.com/illustrations-in-focus/conversazione-science-and-art/|access-date=2020-07-01|website=Richard Doyle's Bird's-Eye Views of Society|language=en}}</ref>

In its report on the first ''conversazione'' ever conducted by the ''Lambeth Literary Institution'' (on 22 June 1836), ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' noted that,
::the principal object [of the Lambeth Literary Institution's inaugural ''conversazione''] has been—by the collection of articles of [[Virtù#Artistic value|virtù]], antiquity, science, or art, and by the reading of original papers, conversation, and music,— to unite its members, at stated periods, into one focus of neighbourly community; where all may be on a footing of social equality,—the aristocracy of mind, united with urbanity of manners, alone maintaining its ascendancy here; where the high attainments of the classical scholar,—the lofty imaginings of the poet,—the deep researches of the man of science,—and the sturdy intelligence of the skilful [[artisan|artizan]] [sic], may all be amalgamated under one roof; and the rough energies of manly intellect be thus softened and refined by the amenities of the social circle.<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=eruxnZbxQAIC&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false Literary and Scientific Intelligence: Learned Societies: Conversazione of the Lambeth Literary Institution, ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Vol.6, New Series, (August 1836), pp.187-189, at p.189.]</ref>

==Knowledge dissemination==
According to Yeates (2018):
::In Victorian England, the ''conversazione'' was one of the most important educational, cultural, and recreational means through which scientific knowledge was disseminated and explanations of technical innovation were delivered to the general public.<br>Conducted by individuals, institutions, or learned bodies, a (usually mixed amateur/expert, male/female) audience was enlightened by explanations, two-way interactions with participants, experiments, demonstrations, hands-on displays of equipment, and/or the exhibition of specimens (see Alberti, 2003; and Plunkett & Sullivan, 2012).<br>The conversazione’s lectures/explanations delivered ''[[Descriptive knowledge|knowledge by description]]'', and its experiments, demonstrations, hands-on displays of equipment, and exhibition of specimens delivered ''[[knowledge by acquaintance]]'' (with the concomitant ''[[Ownership (psychology)|psychological ownership]]'' of the knowledge so-acquired).<ref>Yeates (2018), pp.42-43.</ref>
