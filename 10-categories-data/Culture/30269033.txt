==Market characteristics==
Chinese luxury goods consumers are younger than their [[Europe]]an counterparts, belonging to the 18-50 age group, compared to Europe's consumers who are generally in the over 40 age group. For this reason, China's luxury goods market is expected to grow faster than that of Europe's.<ref name="korea it times"/> Many of the young luxury goods buyers are self-employed or professionals. According to the consulting firm [[McKinsey & Company]], 80% of Chinese luxury goods buyers are under 45, compared with 30% of luxury goods buyers in the United States and 19% in Japan.<ref name="China appetite">[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30670835 China still has an appetite for luxury goods]</ref> Retail sales in China account for only 7% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods; however, Chinese buyers account for 25% of global retail sales of luxury consumer goods. Many shops in international travel destinations have specialized staff devoted to Chinese customers.<ref name=Caixin022613 />

==Luxury cars==
Major global luxury brands like [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Lexus]] have operations in China. Audi, which has dominated China's luxury car market for more than two decades, is the market leader in the luxury car segment, with China being Audi's second largest market in the world. However Audi's market share in this category is gradually falling as BMW and Mercedes-Benz are adopting new strategies to boost sales. According to data from [[Global Insight]], Audi's market share in China decreased from 66% in 2004 to 42% in 2009, while the market share of BMW and Mercedes-Benz increased from 7% to 23%, and 9% to 16%, respectively. BMW is enlarging its current plant in China and building a second one.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-21/audi-s-two-decade-china-dominance-threatened-by-bmw-mercedes.html Audi’s Two-Decade China Dominance Threatened by BMW, Mercedes], April 21, 2010.</ref>

Audi is still the dominant choice of car in the government fleet market.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/global/in-china-car-brands-evoke-an-unexpected-set-of-stereotypes.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title=In China, Car Brands Evoke an Unexpected Set of Stereotypes|author=ANDREW JACOBS|author2=ADAM CENTURY  |date= November 14, 2011}}</ref> BMW sales are growing but is perceived to be for the newly rich.<ref name=nyt/> Mercedes is seen to be for old folks.<ref name=nyt/> Brands such as BMW and Audi are designing customized cars for the Chinese luxury car market.

According to Stephan Winkelmann, CEO of [[Lamborghini]], "China's super car market is growing faster than our expectations, while the Western markets are declining. The strong demand will soon make China our second biggest market after the United States. If the high taxes on luxury cars are removed, China could very well become the biggest market."<ref name="Rich Chinese">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6967022.html Rich Chinese fueling luxury car market growth], ''[[People's Daily Online]]'', April 29, 2010.</ref>

As of 2013 the trend continued as the number of luxury cars and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s shown expanded at the Shanghai auto show and plans were announced by both foreign and domestic auto manufacturers to introduce new models in China and increase production of larger cars.<ref name=NYT42113>{{cite news|title=Chinese Auto Buyers Grow Hungry for Larger Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/automobiles/autoshow/chinese-auto-market-shifts-toward-larger-cars.html|accessdate=April 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2013|author=Keith Bradsher}}</ref>
