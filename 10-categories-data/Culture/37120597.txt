Tovmas Terzian is famed mainly for his poetry and plays. His most important play being, ''Arshak II'' (1871) which was loosely based on the life of the 4th century [[Armenia]]n king [[Arshak II]].<ref name="books.google"/> The play written in both Italian and Armenian was intended as an opera libretto. The music for this opera was composed by the [[Armenia]]n composer [[Dikran Tchouhadjian]]<ref name="books.google"/> who used the Italian version of the play Arsace II.
Terzian never saw his play on stage either in its operatic form or as a straight play. The Soviet version of the opera Arshak II which first appeared on stage in 1941 at the [[Yerevan Opera House]] was a big success.<ref name="Hacikyan"/> However, beyond the title and names of some of the characters, it had very little in common with Terzian's play.
