The '''aish tamid''' ({{lang-he|אֵשׁ תָּמִיד}}, ''continuous fire'') is the eternal flame that was to burn upon the [[Altar (Bible)|altar]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] and never be extinguished. It is not to be confused with the [[Ner tamid]], the eternal light that is kept in front of the [[Holy Ark]] in the [[synagogue]]. In modern Jewish practice, the aish tamid is symbolically kept alive through daily prayer and the study of [[Torah]].

[[Matisyahu]], an American Jewish reggae artist, who has made the term popular among pop culture produced a song entitled "Aish Tamid." In the song, he sings, "Aish tamid eternally, fire burns continuously." (full lyrics to the song can be found here [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181256/http://www.popular-lyrics.com/lyrics/matisyahu/aish-tamid-8707.html].)
