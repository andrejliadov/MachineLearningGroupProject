{{short description|Representations of the Western world}}
'''Occidentalism''' refers to and identifies [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of [[the Western world]] (the Occident) in two ways: (i) as dehumanizing [[stereotype]]s of the Western world, (broadly defined as consisting of [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]]); and (ii) as ideological representations of the West, as applied in the works: ''Occidentalism: A Theory of Counter-Discourse in Post-Mao China'' (1995), by Chen Xiaomei; ''Occidentalism: Images of the West'' (1995), by James G. Carrier; and ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies'' (2004), [[Ian Buruma]] and [[Avishai Margalit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/jalees-rehman/occidentophobia-the-elephant-in-the-room_b_2460380.html |first=Jalees |last=Rehman |title='Occidentophobia': The Elephant in the Room |work=Huffingtonpost.com |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref> Occidentalism is often a counterpart to the term [[orientalism]] as used by [[Edward Said]] in his [[Orientalism (book)|book]] of that title, which refers to and identifies Western stereotypes of the [[Eastern world]], the Orient.

==Occidental representations==
In China "Traditions Regarding Western Countries" became a regular part of the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' from the 5th century CE, when commentary about The West concentrated upon on an area that did not extend farther than [[Syria]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bonnett|2004}}</ref> The extension of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries established, represented, and defined the existence of an "Eastern world" and of a "Western world". Western stereotypes appear in works of [[Indian art|Indian]], [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] art of those times.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hilton |first=Isabel |url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/chinese-adaptations-western-classics-shakespeare-pinter-ibsen-edinburgh-international-festival/ |title=Occidentalism |work=Prospect Magazine |date=20 July 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref> At the same time, Western influence in politics, culture, economics and science came to be constructed through an imaginative geography of West and East.

==Occidentalism debated==
In ''Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies'' (2004), Buruma and Margalit said that nationalist and nativist resistance to the West replicates Eastern-world responses against the socio-economic forces of [[modernization]], which originated in Western culture, among [[utopian]] radicals and conservative nationalists who viewed [[capitalism]], [[liberalism]], and [[secularism]] as forces destructive of their societies and cultures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hari |first=Johann |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/preformoccidentalism-by-ian-buruma--avishai-margalitpreform-6163816.html |title=Occidentalism by Ian Buruma & Avishai Margalit |work=The Independent |date=2004-08-15 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref> While the early responses to the West were a genuine encounter between alien cultures, many of the later manifestations of ''Occidentalism'' betray the influence of Western ideas upon Eastern [[intellectual]]s, such as the supremacy of the [[nation-state]], the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejection of rationality, and the spiritual impoverishment of the citizenry of liberal democracies.

Buruma and Margalit trace that resistance to [[German Romanticism]] and to the debates, between the Westernisers and the [[Slavophiles]] in 19th-century [[Russia]], and show that like arguments appear in the ideologies of [[Zionism]], [[Maoism]], [[Islamism]], and Imperial [[Japanese nationalism]]. Nonetheless, Alastair Bonnett rejects the analyses of Buruma and Margalit as Eurocentric, and said that the field of Occidentalism emerged from the interconnection of Eastern and Western intellectual traditions.<ref>{{cite news|date=July 2, 2005 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GG02Ak01.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105005835/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GG02Ak01.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2019 |last=Shlapentokh|first= Dmitry |title=Changing perceptions|work=Asia Times|accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Martin Jacques |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/04/society |title=Review: Occidentalism by Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit |work=The Guardian |date=2004-09-04 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2002/jan/17/occidentalism/?pagination=false |title=Occidentalism by Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit |work= The New York Review of Books |date=2002-01-17 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}</ref>
