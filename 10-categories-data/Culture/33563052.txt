== Applications ==
[[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "[[Oedipus Rex]]" are early examples of the use of this quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref> In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals. There is a claim that a part of [[freemasonry]], particularly during the 18th century, could also be considered anthropotechnic in the sense that it acted as a [[caste]] of [[Technocracy|technocrats]] managing society and the human sphere.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Information and the World Stage: From Philosophy to Science, the World of Forms and Communications|last=Dugué|first=Bernard|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781786301383|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=64}}</ref>
