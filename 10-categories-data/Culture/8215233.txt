An '''independent scientist''' (modern gender-neutral term historically also known as '''gentleman scientist''') is a [[private income|financially independent]] [[scientist]] who pursues [[science|scientific study]] without direct affiliation to a public institution such as a university or government-run [[research and development]] body. The expression "gentleman scientist" arose in post-[[Renaissance]] [[Europe]],<ref>J. C. Segen (1992). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FbSlyyshjOoC&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=dictionary+%22gentleman+scientist%22&source=bl&ots=juVfcRDdrx&sig=8VsuQLxjLd0kks-vQphH0W5ffOY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Dictionary of Modern Medicine]''. p. 246. {{ISBN|1-85070-321-3}}</ref> but became less common in the 20th century as government and private funding increased.

Most independent scientists have at some point in their career been affiliated with some academic institution, such as [[Charles Darwin]], who was affiliated with the [[Geological Society of London]].

==History==
Self-funded scientists practiced more commonly [[History of science policy#Self-funded science|from the Renaissance until the late 19th century]], including the [[Victorian era]], especially in [[England]], before large-scale government and corporate funding was available.  Many early fellows of the [[Royal Society]] in [[London]] were independent scientists.

==Benefits and drawbacks==
Self-funding has the disadvantage that funds may be more restricted; however, it has the advantage of eliminating a number of inconveniences such as teaching obligations, administrative duties, and writing [[Grant (money)|grant]] requests to funding bodies. It also permits the scientist to have greater control over research directions, as funding bodies direct grants towards interests that may not coincide with that of the scientist. Furthermore, [[intellectual property]] of the inventions belongs to the inventor and not the employer.

Modern science requires competence and may require access to scientific equipment. However, independent scientists may have past careers as funded scientists, cooperate with funded colleagues, obtain partial equipment-only grants or choose directions where the most expensive resource required is the researcher's time. If the research succeeds, independent scientists may publish results in the same peer-reviewed journals as funded scientists do.

Scientists may choose to work on unusual projects with high risk of failure also when the grant system does not fund them. A scientist could be attributed the status of independent scientist if they work on such projects during a gap between two academic positions, for example.

==Modern-day independent scientists==
Modern-day independent scientists who fund their own research on an independent basis include, for example, [[Stephen Wolfram]] who funds his research through the sale of [[Mathematica]] software, [[Julian Barbour]], [[Aubrey de Grey]], [[Barrington Moore]], [[Susan Blackmore]],<ref name="Blackmore">{{cite web|author=Susan Blackmore |authorlink=Susan Blackmore|date=Oct 24, 2008 |url=http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/story/solo-science |title=Solo Science: Tinkering Outside The Tower |publisher=More Intelligent Life |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref> [[James Lovelock]],<ref name="Blackmore"/> and [[John Wilkinson (scientist)|John Wilkinson]] who funds his research on "molecular synergism in nature" by running a regulatory scientific consultancy in natural products.

Peter Rich said of [[Peter D. Mitchell]]: "I think he would have found it difficult to have gotten funding because his ideas were rather radical."<ref name="ReferenceA">Cohen (1998).</ref> Mitchell went on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1978. Chemist [[Luis Leloir]] funded the research institute he headed, the [[Leloir Institute|Institute for Biochemical Research]], in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/ |title=All Nobel Prizes in Chemistry |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>

There are today several virtual research institutes for independent scientists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dance|first=Amber|date=2017-03-30|title=Flexible working: Solo scientist|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=543|issue=7647|pages=747–749|doi=10.1038/nj7647-747a}}</ref>
