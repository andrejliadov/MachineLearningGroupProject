{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the [[Arabs]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]] and [[mysticism]] are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beauty in Arabic culture|last=Doris|first=Behrens-Abouseif|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=978-1558761995|oclc=40043536}}</ref>

The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions depending on different cultures, dialects and traditions including:

• [[Levant|The Levant]]: [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]].

• [[Egypt]].

• [[Mesopotamia]]: [[Iraq]].

• [[Arabian Peninsula|The Arabian Peninsula]]: [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Khuzestan Province|Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

• [[Sudan]].

• [[Maghreb|The Maghreb]]: [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Mauritania]].

==Literature==
{{main|Arabic literature}}
[[Arabic literature]] is the writing produced, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], by speakers of the [[Arabic language]]. It does not include works written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] but not in the Arabic language such as [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Urdu literature]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''[[Arab (literature)|adab]]'' which is derived from a word meaning "to invite someone for a meal" and implies politeness, culture and enrichment. Arabic literature emerged in the 6th century, with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], from the 7th century, had the greatest and longest-lasting effect on Arabic culture and literature. [[Al-Khansa]], a female contemporary of Muhammad, was an acclaimed Arab poet.

===Mu'allaqat===
{{Main| Muallaqat}}
The [[Mu'allaqat]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المعلقات, {{IPA-ar|al-muʕallaqaːt|}}) is the name given to a series of seven Arabic poems or [[qasida]] that originated before the time of Islam. Each poem in the set has a different author, and is considered to be their best work. Mu'allaqat means "The Suspended Odes" or "The Hanging Poems," and comes from the poems being hung on the wall in the Kaaba at Mecca.

The seven authors, who span a period of around 100 years, are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa]], [[Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma|Zuhayr]], [[Labīd]], [['Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [['Amr ibn Kulthum]], and [[Harith ibn Hilliza]]. All of the Mu’allaqats contain stories from the authors’ lives and tribe politics. This is because poetry was used in pre-Islamic time to advertise the strength of a tribe's king, wealth and people.

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة}} ''ʾAlf layla wa-layla''<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|edition=3rd|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|editor=Kate Fleet |editor2=Gudrun Krämer |editor3=Denis Matringe |editor4=John Nawas |editor5=Everett Rowson|doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021}}</ref>), is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade, a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar (Šahryār), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Music==
{{main|Arabic music}}
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], [[Syria]], [[Ummayad]] [[caliphs]] Palace, built in the early 7th century]]
[[Arabic music]] is the [[music]] of [[Arabs|Arab people]], especially those centered around the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from [[Tunisia]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. Regional styles of [[popular music]] include Iraqi el Maqaam, [[Algeria]]n ''[[raï]]'', [[Kuwait]]i ''[[sawt (music)|sawt]]'' and [[Egypt]]ian ''[[el gil]]''.

"The common style that developed is usually called 'Islamic' or 'Arab', though in fact it transcends religious, ethnic, geographical, and linguistic boundaries" and it is suggested that it be called the [[Near East]] (from Morocco to India) style ([[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] 1989, p.&nbsp;9).

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] (1996, p.xix-xx) lists "five components" which "characterize the music of the Arabs:
# The [[Arab tone system]] (a [[musical tuning]] system) with specific interval structures, invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century (p.&nbsp;170).
# [[Rhythmic-temporal structures]] that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'', used to accompany the metered vocal and instrumental genres and give them form.
# [[Musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arabian world and that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with standardized performance techniques, and exhibit similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts for the making of music, whereby [[Music genre|musical genres]] can be classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants).
# A musical mentality that is responsible for the aesthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures in Arabian music, whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]. The Arab's musical mentality is defined by:
## The maqām phenomenon.
## The predominance of vocal music.
## The predilection for small instrumental ensembles.
## The mosaiclike stringing together of musical form elements, that is, the arrangement in a sequence of small and smallest melodic elements, and their repetition, combination, and permutation within the framework of the tonal-spatial model.
## The absence of polyphony, polyrhythm, and motivic development. Arabian music is, however, very familiar with the ostinato, as well as with a more instinctive heterophonic way of making music.
## The alternation between a free rhythmic-temporal and fixed tonal-spatial organization on the one hand and a fixed rhythmic-temporal and free tonal-spatial structure on the other. This alternation... results in exciting contrasts."

Much Arab music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]] rather than [[harmony]]. Thus much Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]] in nature. Some genres of Arab music are [[polyphonic]]—as the instrument [[Kanun (instrument)|Kanoun]] is based upon the idea of playing two-note [[chord (music)|chords]]—but quintessentially, Arabic music is melodic.

It would be incorrect though to call it [[Musical mode|modal]], for the Arabic system is more complex than that of the [[Greece|Greek]] modes. The basis of the Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The maqam has a "[[tonality|tonal]]" note on which the piece must end (unless modulation occurs).

[[File:Riqq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[riq]] is widely used in Arabic music]]

The maqam consists of at least two jins, or scale segments. "Jins" in Arabic comes from the ancient Greek word "genus," meaning type. In practice, a jins (pl. ajnas) is either a [[trichord]], a [[tetrachord]], or a [[pentachord]]. The trichord is three notes, the tetrachord four, and the pentachord five. The maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (two jins), but sometimes it covers more than one octave. Like the [[Minor scale|melodic minor]] scale and Indian ragas, some maqamat have different ajnas, and thus notes, while descending or ascending. Because of the continuous innovation of jins and because most music scholars don't agree on the existing number anyway, it's hard to give an accurate number of the jins. Nonetheless, in practice most musicians would agree on the 8 most frequently used ajnas: Rast, Bayat, Sikah, Hijaz, Saba, Kurd, Nahawand, and Ajam — and a few of the most commonly used variants of those: Nakriz, Athar Kurd, Sikah Beladi, Saba Zamzama. Mukhalif is a rare jins used exclusively in Iraq, and it does not occur in combination with other ajnas.

The main difference between the western [[chromatic scale]] and the Arabic scales is the existence of many in-between notes, which are sometimes referred to as [[quarter tone]]s for the sake of practicality. However, while in some treatments of theory the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969) in practice there are many fewer tones (Touma 1996, p.&nbsp;170).

In fact, the situation is much more complicated than that. In 1932, at International Convention on Arabic music held in Cairo, Egypt (attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]), experiments were done which determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale, and furthermore that the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq). The commission's recommendation is as follows: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are..." (translated in Maalouf 2002, p.&nbsp;220). Both in modern practice, and based on the evidence from recorded music over the course of the last century, there are several differently tuned "E"s in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale, depending on the maqam or jins in use, and depending on the region.

Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as "quarter-tones" ("half-flat" or "half-sharp") for ease of nomenclature, but perform and teach the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Touma's comment above, that these "quarter-tones" are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]], and so the most commonly used "quarter tones" are on E (between E-flat and E-natural), A, B, D, F (between F-natural and F-sharp) and C.

The prototypical Arab ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], which includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[qanun (instrument)|qanún]], [[Rebab|rabab]], nay, [[violin]] (which was introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santur]]—with [[riq]] and [[dumbek]].

== Media ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Arabiya Reporter.jpg|thumb|right|An anchor on [[Al-Arabiya]] Television, in Jerusalem]]

Prior to the Islamic Era, [[poetry]] was regarded as the main means of communication on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It related the achievements of tribes and defeats of enemies and also served as a tool for [[propaganda]]. After the arrival of [[Islam]] other forms of communication replaced poetry as the primary form of communication. [[Imams]] (preachers) played a role in disseminating information and relating news from the authorities to the people. The suq or marketplace gossip and interpersonal relationships played an important role in the spreading of news, and this form of communication among [[Arabs]] continues today. Before the introduction of the [[printing press]] [[Muslims]] obtained most of their news from the imams at the [[mosque]], friends or in the marketplace. [[Colonial powers]] and [[Christian Missionaries]] in [[Lebanon]] were responsible for the introduction of the printing press. It was not until the 19th century that the first newspapers began to appear, mainly in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], which had the most newspapers per capita.

During [[France|French]] rule in [[Egypt]] in the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the first newspaper was published, in French. There is debate over when the first Arabic language newspaper was published; according to Arab scholar Abu Bakr, it was ''Al Tanbeeh'' (1800), published in Egypt, or it was ''Junral Al Iraq'' (1816), published in [[Iraq]], according to other researchers. In the mid-19th century the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] dominated the first newspapers.

The first newspapers were limited to official content and included accounts of relations with other countries and civil trials. In the following decades Arab media blossomed due to [[journalist]]s mainly from Syria and Lebanon, who were intellectuals and published their newspapers without the intention of making a profit. Because of the restrictions by most governments, these intellectuals were forced to flee their respective countries but had gained a following and because of their popularity in this field of work other intellectuals began to take interest in the field.
The first émigré Arab newspaper, ''Mar’at al Ahwal'', was published in Turkey in 1855 by Rizqallah Hassoun Al Halabi. It was criticized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shut down after only one year. Intellectuals in the [[Arab world]] soon realized the power of the press. Some countries' newspapers were government-run and had political agendas in mind. Independent newspapers began to spring up which expressed opinions and were a place for the public to out their views on the state. Illiteracy rates in the Arab world played a role in the formation of media, and due to the low reader rates newspapers were forced to get political parties to subsidize their publications, giving them input to editorial policy.

Freedoms that have branched through the introduction of the Internet in [[Middle East]] are creating a stir politically, culturally, and socially. There is an increasing divide between the generations. The Arab world is in conflict internally. The internet has brought economic prosperity and development, but [[blog]]gers have been incarcerated all around in the Middle East for their opinions and views on their regimes, the same consequence which was once given to those who publicly expressed themselves without anonymity. But the power of the internet has provided also a public shield for these bloggers since they have the ability to engage public sympathy on such a large scale. This is creating a dilemma that shakes the foundation of Arab culture, government, religious interpretation, economic prosperity, and personal integrity.

Each country or region in the Arab world has varying colloquial languages which are used for everyday speech, yet its presence in the media world is discouraged. Prior to the establishment of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), during the 19th century, the language of the media was stylized and resembled literary language of the time, proving to be ineffective in relaying information. Currently MSA is used by Arab media, including newspapers, books and some television stations, in addition to all formal writing. Vernaculars are however present in certain forms of media including satires, dramas, music videos and other local programs.

=== Media values ===

Journalism ethics is a system of values that determines what constitutes "good" and "bad" journalism.<ref name="Power and Weakness">{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Kai|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=147–64|author-link=The Unknown Desire for "Objectivity": Journalism Ethics in Arab (and Western) Journalism|editor=Kai Hafez}}</ref>  A system of media values consists of and is constructed by journalists'  and other actors'  decisions about issues like what is "newsworthy," how to frame the news, and whether to observe topical "red lines."<ref>{{cite book|last=Itule|first=Bruce|title=News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|author2=Douglas Anderson}}</ref>  Such a system of values varies over space and time, and is embedded within the existing social, political, and economic structures in a society. William Rugh states, "There is an intimate, organic relationship between media institutions and society in the way that those institutions are organized and controlled. Neither the institution nor the society in which it functions can be understood properly without reference to the other. This is certainly true in the Arab world."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/arabmassmedianew00rugh|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}</ref>   Media values in the Arab world therefore vary between and within countries. In the words of Lawrence Pintak and Jeremy Ginges, “The Arab media are not a monolith.”<ref name="Mission">{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=2008|volume=13|issue=3|page=219|doi=10.1177/1940161208317142|s2cid=145067689}}</ref>

Journalists in the Arab world hold many of the same values with their news generation as do journalists in the [[Western world]]. Journalists in the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of journalist training programs in North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rampal|first=Kuldip Roy|title=Professionals in Search of Professionalism: Journalists' Dilemma in Four Maghreb States|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/001654929605800102}}</ref>   Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.”<ref name="Function">{{cite journal|last=Ramaprasad|first=Jyotika|author2=Naila Nabil Hamdy|title=Functions of Egyptian Journalists: Perceived Importance and Actual Importance|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=2006|volume=68|issue=2|pages=167–85|doi=10.1177/1748048506062233|s2cid=144729341}}</ref>   Further, many journalists in the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 journalists in the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.<ref name=Mission />

Important differences between journalists in the Arab world and their Western counterparts are also apparent.  Some journalists in the Arab world see no conflict between objectivity and support for political causes.<ref name="Inside Arab Newsroom">{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=Inside the Arab Newsroom|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=2|page=173|doi=10.1080/14616700802337800|s2cid=96478415}}</ref>   Ramprasad and Hamdy's sample of 112 Egyptian journalists gave the highest importance to supporting [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]] and Arab values, which included injunctions such as “defend Islamic societies, traditions and values” and “support the cause of the Palestinians.” Sustaining democracy through “examining government policies and decisions critically,” ranked a close second.<ref name=Function />

Other journalists reject the notion of media ethics altogether because they see it as a mechanism of control. Kai Hafez states, “Many governments in the Arab world have tried to hijack the issue of media ethics and have used it as yet another controlling device, with the result that many Arab journalists, while they love to speak about the challenges of their profession, hate performing under the label of media ethics.”<ref name="Power and Weakness" />

Historically, news in the Arab world was used to inform, guide, and publicize the actions of political practitioners rather than being just a consumer product. The power of news as political tool was discovered in the early 19th century, with the purchase of shares from Le Temps a French newspaper by Ismail the grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Doing so allowed Ismail to publicize his policies.<ref name=Ayalon>{{cite book|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|title=The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}</ref> Arab Media coming to modernity flourished and with it its responsibilities to the political figures that have governed its role. Ami Ayalon argues in his history of the press in the Arab Middle East that, “Private journalism began as an enterprise with very modest objectives, seeking not to defy authority but rather to serve it, to collaborate and coexist cordially with it. The demand for freedom of expression, as well as for individual political freedom, a true challenge to the existing order, came only later, and hesitantly at that, and was met by a public response that can best be described as faint." <ref name=Ayalon />

<blockquote>
Media researchers stress that the moral and social responsibility of newspeople dictates that they should not agitate public opinion, but rather should keep the status quo. It is also important to preserve national unity by not stirring up ethnic or religious conflict.<ref name="Mellor, Noha 2005">Mellor, Noha. The Making of Arab News.

</blockquote>

The values of media in the Arab world have started to change with the emergence of “new media." Examples of new media include news websites, blogs, and satellite television stations like [[Al Arabiya]]. The founding of the Qatari [[Al Jazeera]] network in 1996 especially affected media values. Some scholars believe that the network has blurred the line between private- and state- run news. Mohamed Zayani and Sofiane Sabraoui state, “Al Jazeera is owned by the government, but has an independent editorial policy; it is publicly funded, but independent minded.”<ref name="Culture of Al Jazeera">{{cite book|last=Zayani|first=Mohamed|title=The Culture of Al Jazeera: Inside an Arab Media Giant|date=2007|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jefferson, NC|author2=Sofiane Sahroui}}</ref>   The Al Jazeera media network espouses a clear mission and strategy, and was one of the first news organizations in the Arab world to release a code of ethics.<ref>"Code of Ethics." Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera Media Network, 07 Nov. 2010. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/2006/11/2008525185733692771.html.</ref> Despite its government ties, it seeks to “give no priority to commercial or political over professional consideration” and to “cooperate with Arab and international journalistic unions and associations to defend freedom of the press.” With a motto of “the view and the other view,” it purports to “present the diverse points of view and opinions without bias and partiality.” It has sought to fuse these ostensibly Western media norms with a wider “Arab orientation,” evocative of the social responsibility discussed by scholars such as Noha Mellor above.

Some more recent assessments of Al Jazeera have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized]] it for a lack of credibility in the wake of the Arab Spring. Criticism has come from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Jillian|title=Syrian TV Station Accuses Al Jazeera of Fabricating Uprising|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/syrian-tv-station-accuses-al-jazeera-of-fabricating-uprising/|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 March 2014|date=2011-09-14}}</ref> Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=In Syria, al Jazeera's Credibility Implodes|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/05/in-syria-al-jazeeras-credibility-implodes/|publisher=CounterPunch|access-date=22 March 2014}}</ref>

Media values are not the only variable that affects news output in Arab society. Hafez states, “The interaction of political, economic, and social environments with individual and collective professional ethics is the driving force behind journalism.”<ref name="Power and Weakness" /> In most Arab countries, newspapers cannot be published without a government-issued license. Most Arab countries also have press laws, which impose boundaries on what can and cannot be said in print.

Censorship plays a significant role in journalism in the Arab world. Censorship comes in a variety of forms: [[Self-censorship]], Government [[Censorship]] (governments struggle to control through technological advances in ex. the internet), [[Ideology]]/Religious Censorship, and Tribal/Family/Alliances Censorship. Because [[Journalism]] in the Arab world comes with a range of dangers – journalists throughout the Arab world can be imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in their line of work – self-censorship is extremely important for many Arab journalists. A study conducted by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in Jordan, for example, found that the majority of Jordanian journalists exercise self-censorship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hazaimeh |first=Hani |title=Majority of Jordanian Journalists Exercise Self-censorship – Survey |url=http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |publisher=The Jordan Times |access-date=22 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083856/http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |archivedate=8 July 2014 }}</ref> [[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] found that 34 journalists were killed in the region in 2012, 72 were imprisoned on December 1, 2012, and 126 were in exile from 2007 to 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the Front Lines in 2012|url=http://cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-mideast.php|publisher=Committee for the Protection of Journalists|access-date=22 March 2014}}</ref>

A related point is that media owners and patrons have effects on the values of their outlets. Newspapers in the Arab world can be divided into three categories: government owned, [[partisan (military)|partisan]] owned, and independently owned. Newspaper, radio, and television patronization in the Arab world has heretofore been primarily a function of governments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/arabmassmedianew00rugh|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|page=[https://archive.org/details/arabmassmedianew00rugh/page/9 9]}}</ref>   "Now, newspaper ownership has been consolidated in the hands of powerful chains and groups. Yet, [[profit (economics)|profit]] is not the driving force behind the launching of newspapers; [[publishers]] may establish a newspaper to ensure a platform for their political opinions, although it is claimed that this doesn't necessarily influence the news content".<ref>Pintak, Lawrence. "Arab Media: Not Quite Utopia"</ref> In the Arab world, as far as content is concerned, news is politics. Arab states are intimately involved in the economic well-being of many Arab news organizations so they apply pressure in several ways, most notably through ownership or advertising.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Justin D. |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102479/Investigative-Journalism-in-the-Arab-World.aspx |title=Nieman Reports &#124; Investigative Journalism in the Arab World |publisher=Nieman.harvard.edu |access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref>

Some analysts hold that cultural and societal pressures determine journalists' news output in the Arab world. For example, to the extent that family reputation and personal reputation are fundamental principles in Arabian civilization, exposes of corruption, examples of weak moral fiber in governors and policy makers, and [[investigative journalism]] may have massive consequences. In fact, some journalists and media trainers in the Arab world nevertheless actively promote the centrality of investigative journalism to the media's larger [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] function. In Jordan, for example, where the degree of government and security service interference in the media is high, non-governmental organizations such as the Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) train journalists to undertake investigative journalism projects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pies|first=Judith|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=165–81|chapter=Agents of Change? Journalism Ethics in Lebanese and Jordanian Journalism Education.|editor=Kai Hafez}}</ref>

[[File:Jordan Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists sign.JPG|thumb|The Jordanian Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) posted this sign in protest of the country's 2012 Press and Publications law. It reads, "The right to obtain information is a right for all people".]]

Some Saudi journalists stress the importance of enhancing Islam through the media. The developmental role of media was acknowledged by an overwhelming majority of Saudi journalists, while giving the readers what they want was not regarded as a priority.<ref>Tash, Abdulkader. A Profile of Professional Journalists Working in the Saudi Arabian Daily Press. Diss. Southern Illinois University, 1983. Print.</ref> However, journalism codes, as an important source for the study of media values, complicate this notion. Kai Hafez states, “The possible hypothesis that Islamic countries might not be interested in ‘truth’ and would rather propagate ‘Islam’ as the single truth cannot be verified completely because even a code that limits journalists’ freedom of expression to Islamic objectives and values, the Saudi Arabian code, demands that journalists present real facts.”<ref name="Power and Weakness" /> In addition, [[Media of Saudi Arabia|Saudi journalists]] operate in an environment in which anti-religious talk is likely to be met with censorship.

Patterns of consumption also affect media values. People in the Arab world rely on newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet to differing degrees and to meet a variety of ends. For Rugh, the proportion of radio and television receivers to Arab populations relative to UNESCO minimum standards suggests that radio and television are the most widely consumed media. He estimates that television reaches well over 100 million people in the region, and this number has likely grown since 2004. By contrast, he supposes that Arab newspapers are designed more for elite-consumption on the basis of their low circulation. He states, "Only five Arab countries have daily newspapers which distribute over 60,000 copies and some have dailies only in the under-10,000 range. Only Egypt has dailies which distribute more than a half million copies."<ref>{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/arabmassmedianew00rugh|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=[https://archive.org/details/arabmassmedianew00rugh/page/4 4–5]}}</ref> Estimating newspaper readership is complicated, however, by the fact that single newspapers can change hands many times in a day. Finally, the internet continues to be a fairly common denominator in Arab societies. A report by the Dubai School of Government and Bayt.com estimates that there are more than 125 million Internet users in the region, and that more than 53 million of them actively use social media. They caution, however, that while "the internet has wide-ranging benefits, these benefits do not reach large segments of societies in the Arab region. The digital divide remains a significant barrier for many people. In many parts of the Arab world levels of educational attainment, economic activity, standards of living and internet costs still determine a person's access to life-changing technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arab World Online: Trends in Internet Usage in the Arab Region|url=http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/dsg-gip_bayt_report_final_16822_EN.pdf|publisher=The Dubai School of Government with Bayt.com|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref> Further, according to Leo Gher and Hussein Amin, the Internet and other modern telecommunication services may serve to counter the effects of private and public ownership and patronage of the press. They state, "Modern international telecommunications services now assist in the free flow of information, and neither inter-Arab conflicts nor differences among groups will affect the direct exchange of services provided by global cyberspace networks."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gher|first=Leo A.|author2=Hussein Y. Amin|title=New and Old Media Access and Ownership in the Arab World|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1999|volume=61|series=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/0016549299061001004|s2cid=144676746}}</ref>

=== Magazines ===
In most Arabian countries, [[magazines]] cannot be published without a government-issued license. Magazines in the Arabian world, like many of the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women. However, the number of magazines in the Arab world is significantly smaller than that of the Western world. The Arab world is not as advertisement driven as the Western world. Advertisers fuel the funding for most Western magazines to exist. Thus, a lesser emphasis on [[advertisement]] in the Arabian world plays into the low number of magazines.

=== Radio ===
There are 40 private radio stations throughout [[the Middle East]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090215152107/http://newarabia.net/arabic_radio_stations.php list of private radio stations in the Arab world])

Arab radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, but only a few Arab countries had their own broadcasting stations before [[World War II]]. After 1945, most Arab states began to create their own radio broadcasting systems, although it was not until 1970, when [[Oman]] opened its radio transmissions, that every one of them had its own radio station.

Among Arab countries, [[Egypt]] has been a leader in radio broadcasting from the beginning. Broadcasting began in Egypt in the 1920s with private commercial radio. In 1947, however, the Egyptian government declared radio a government monopoly and began investing in its expansion.

By the 1970s, Egyptian radio had fourteen different broadcast services with a total air time of 1,200 hours per week. Egypt is ranked third in the world among radio broadcasters. The programs were all government controlled, and much of the motivation for the government's investment in radio was due to the aspirations of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to be the recognized leader of the Arab world.

Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" station, which targeted other Arab countries with a constant stream of news and political features and commentaries, became the most widely heard station in the region. Only after the [[June 1967 war]], when it was revealed that this station had misinformed the public about what was happening, did it lose some credibility; nevertheless it retained a large listenership.

On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], radio was slower to develop. In [[Saudi Arabia]], radio broadcasts started in the [[Jidda]]-[[Mecca]] area in 1948, but they did not start in the central or eastern provinces until the 1960s. Neighboring [[Bahrain]] had radio by 1955, but [[Qatar]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Oman]] did not start indigenous radio broadcasting until nearly a quarter century later.

===Television===
Almost all television channels in the Arab world were [[government]]-owned and strictly controlled prior to the 1990s. In the 1990s the spread of satellite television began changing television in Arab countries. Often noted as a pioneer, [[Al Jazeera]] represents a shift towards a more professional approach to news and current affairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |title=Arab media: television |publisher=Al-bab.com |access-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505045604/http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 }}</ref> Financed by the [[Qatar]] government and established in 1996, Al Jazeera was the first Arabic channel to deliver extensive live news coverage, going so far as to send reporters to "unthinkable" places like Israel. Breaking the mold in more ways than one, Al Jazeera's discussion programs raised subjects that had long been prohibited. However, in 2008, [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] called for a meeting to approve a charter to regulate [[satellite]] [[broadcasting]]. The [[Arab League]] Satellite Broadcasting Charter (2008) lays out principles for regulating satellite broadcasting in the Arab world.<ref>Arab Media & Society (March, 2008):[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (Unofficial Translation)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021045806/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf |date=2012-10-21}} Retrieved 6 February 2013</ref><ref>''Arab Media & Society'' (March, 2008): [http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (in Arabic)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021045853/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf |date=2012-10-21}} Retrieved 6 February 2013</ref>

Other satellite channels:
* [[Al Arabiya]]: established in 2003; based in Dubai; offshoot of MBC
* [[Alhurra]] ("The Free One"): established in 2004 by the United States; counter-perceives biases in Arab news media
* Al Manar: owned by Hezbollah; Lebanese-based; highly controversial

"Across the [[Middle East]], new [[television stations]], [[radio stations]] and [[websites]] are sprouting like incongruous electronic mushrooms in what was once a media desert. Meanwhile [[newspapers]] are aggressively probing the red lines that have long contained them".<ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007">Pintak, Lawrence. "Reporting a Revolution: the Changing Arab Media Landscape." ''Arab Media & Society'' (February, 2007)</ref> [[Technology]] is playing a significant role in the changing Arab media. Pintak furthers, "Now, there are 263 free-to-air (FTA) satellite television stations in the region, according to Arab Advisors Group. That's double the figure as of just two years ago".<ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007" /> [[Freedom of speech]] and money have little to do with why [[satellite television]] is sprouting up everywhere. Instead, "A desire for political influence is probably the biggest factor driving channel growth. But ego is a close second".<ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007" /> The influence of the West is very apparent in Arab media, especially in television. [[Arab soap operas]] and the emerging popularity of [[reality TV]] are evidence of this notion.

"In the wake of controversy triggered by ''Super Star'' and ''Star Academy'', some observers have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |title=Arab Media & Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |access-date=2011-04-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405121157/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |archivedate=5 April 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Star Academy]]'' in [[Lebanon]] is strikingly similar to ''[[American Idol]]'' mixed with ''[[The Real World (TV series)|The Real World]]''. ''Star Academy'' began in 2003 in the Arab world. "Reality television entered Arab public discourse in the last five years at a time of significant turmoil in the region: escalating violence in [[Iraq]], contested elections in Egypt, the struggle for women's political rights in [[Kuwait]], [[political assassination]]s in [[Lebanon]], and the protracted [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]. This geo-political crisis environment that currently frames Arab politics and Arab–Western relations is the backdrop to the controversy surrounding the social and political impact of Arab reality television, which assumes religious, cultural or moral manifestations."<ref>Kraidy, Marwan M. Reality Television and Politics in the Arab World: Preliminary Observations. Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 15 (Fall/ Winter, 2006)</ref>

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Arab cinema}}
Most Arab countries did not produce films before independence. In [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], production is even now confined to short films or television. [[Bahrain]] witnessed the production of its first and only full-length feature film in 1989. In [[Jordan]], national production has barely exceeded half a dozen feature films. [[Iraq]] has produced approximately 100 films and [[Syria]] some 150. [[Lebanon]], owing to an increased production during the 1950s and 1960s, has made some 180 feature films. Only [[Egypt]] has far exceeded these countries, with a production of more than 2,500 feature films (all meant for cinema, not television).<ref name="ReferenceB">Shafik, Viola. Arab Cinema: History and Cultural Identity.</ref> As with most aspects of [[Arab media]], censorship plays a large art of creating and distributing films. "In most Arab countries, film projects must first pass a state committee, which grants or denies permission to shoot. Once this permission is obtained, another official license, a so-called visa, is necessary in order to exploit the film commercially. This is normally approved by a committee of the Ministry of Information or a special censorship authority".<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The most significant taboo topics under state supervision are consistent with those of other forms of media: [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[politics]].

=== Internet ===
The [[Internet]] in the Arab world is powerful source of expression and information as it is in other places in the world. While some believe that it is the harbinger of freedom in media to the [[Middle East]], others think that it is a new medium for [[censorship]]. Both are true. The Internet has created a new arena for discussion and the dissemination of information for the Arab world just as it has in the rest of the world. The youth in particular are accessing and utilizing the tools. People are encouraged and enabled to join in political discussion and critique in a manner that was not previously possible. Those same people are also discouraged and blocked from those debates as the differing regimes try to restrict access based on religious and state objections to certain material.

This was posted on a website operated by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]:<blockquote>
The internet in the Arab world has a snowball effect; now that the snowball is rolling, it can no longer be stopped. Getting bigger and stronger, it is bound to crush down all obstacles. In addition, to the stress caused by the Arab bloggers, a new forum was opened for Arab activists; Facebook. Arab activists have been using Facebook in the utmost creative way to support the democracy movement in the region, a region that has one of the highest rates of repression in the world. Unlike other regions where oppressive countries (like China, Iran and Burma) represent the exception, oppression can be found everywhere in the Arab world. The number of Arab internet users interested in political affairs does not exceed a few thousands, mainly represented by internet activists and bloggers, out of 58 million internet users in the Arab world. As few as they are, they have succeeded in shedding some light on the corruption and repression of the Arab governments and dictatorships.<ref>How the Internet has snowballed in the Arab world. <http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470> {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929043556/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470 |date=September 29, 2011 }}.</ref>
</blockquote>

Public Internet use began in the US in the 1980s. Internet access began in the early 1990s in the Arab world, with [[Tunisia]] being first in 1991 according to Dr. Deborah L. Wheeler. The years of the Internet's introduction in the various Arab countries are reported differently. Wheeler reports that [[Kuwait]] joined in 1992, and in 1993, [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] and the [[UAE]] came online. In 1994 [[Jordan]] joined the Internet, and [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Syria]] followed in the late 1990s. Financial considerations and the lack of widespread availability of services are factors in the slower growth in the Arab world, but taking into consideration the popularity of [[internet cafe]]s, the numbers [[online]] are much larger than the subscription numbers would reveal.<ref>Hofheinz, Albrecht. "The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization." (n.d.): 96</ref>

The people most commonly utilizing the Internet in the Arab world are youths. The [[café]] users in particular tend to be under 30, single and have a variety of levels of [[education]] and language proficiency. Despite reports that use of the internet was curtailed by lack of [[English language|English]] skills, Dr. Wheeler found that people were able to search with [[Arabic]]. Searching for jobs, the unemployed frequently fill cafes in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. They are [[men]] and [[women]] equally. Most of them chat and they have email. In a survey conducted by Dr. Deborah Wheeler, she found them to almost all to have been taught to use the Internet by a friend or family member. They all felt their lives to have been significantly changed by the use of the Internet. The use of the Internet in the Arab world is very political in the nature of the posts and of the sites read and visited. The Internet has brought a medium to Arabs that allows for a [[free will|freedom]] of expression not allowed or accepted before. For those who can get online, there are blogs to read and write and access to worldwide outlets of information once unobtainable. With this access, regimes have attempted to curtail what people are able to read, but the Internet is a medium not as easily manipulated as telling a [[newspaper]] what it can or cannot [[publish]]. The Internet can be reached via [[proxy server]], mirror, and other means. Those who are thwarted with one method will find 12 more methods around the blocked site. As [[journalists]] suffer and are imprisoned in traditional media, the Internet is no different with [[bloggers]] regularly being imprisoned for expressing their views for the world to read. The difference is that there is a worldwide audience witnessing this crackdown and watching as [[laws]] are created and recreated to attempt to control the vastness of the Internet.<ref>Rinnawi, Khalil. "The Internet and the Arab world as a virtual public shpere." (n.d.): 23.</ref>

[[Jihadists]] are using the Internet to reach a greater audience. Just as a simple citizen can now have a worldwide voice, so can a movement. Groups are using the Internet to share video, photos, programs and any kind of information imaginable. Standard media may not report what the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would say on their site. However, for the interested, the Internet is a tool that is utilized with great skill by those who wish to be heard. A file uploaded to 100 sites and placed in multiple forums will reach millions instantly. Information on the Internet can be thwarted, slowed, even redirected, but it cannot be stopped if someone wants it out there on the Internet.

The efforts by the various regimes to control the information are all falling apart gradually. Those fighting crime online have devised methods of tracking and catching criminals. Unfortunately those same tools are being used to arrest bloggers and those who would just wish to be heard. The Internet is a vast and seemingly endless source of information. Arabs are using it more than perhaps the world is aware and it is changing the media.

==Society==
[[File:Cairo Cafe.JPG|thumb|right|A café in [[Cairo]]]]
Social loyalty is of great importance in Arab culture. Family is one of the most important aspects of the Arab society. While self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.  "Unlike the extreme individualism we see in North America (every person for him or herself, individual rights, families living on their own away from relatives, and so on), Arab society emphasizes the importance of the group. Arab culture teaches that the needs of the group are more important than the needs of one person."<ref>J. Esherick, Women in the Arab World (Philadelphia: Mason Crest Publishers, 2006), 68</ref> In the Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, "intense feelings of loyalty and dependence are fostered and preserved"<ref>M. J. Gannon, Understanding Global Culture: Metaphorical Journeys Through 28 Nations, 3rd Edition, (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 70</ref> by the family.<ref>L. A. Samovar, et al., Communication Between Cultures, 7th Ed., (Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2010), 70</ref>  Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times'', writes "family loyalty and obligations take precedence over loyalty to friends or demands of a job."<ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006">M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times, 4th Ed., (Boston: Intercultural Press, 2006), 71</ref>  She goes on to state that "members of a family are expected to support each other in disputes with outsiders. Regardless of personal antipathy among relatives, they must defend each other's honor, counter criticism, and display group cohesion..."<ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/>  Of all members of the family, however, the most revered member is the mother.

Family honor is one of the most important characteristics in the Arab family. According to Margaret Nydell, social exchanges between men and women happen very seldom outside of the work place.<ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/> Men and women refrain from being alone together. They have to be very careful in social situations because those interactions can be interpreted negatively and cause gossip, which can tarnish the reputation of women. Women are able to socialize freely with other women and male family members, but have to have family members present to socialize with men that are not part of the family.<ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/> These conservative practices are put into place to protect the reputation of women. Bad behavior not only affects women but her family's honor. Practices differ between countries and families. Saudi Arabia has stricter practices when it comes to men and women and will even require marriage documents if a woman and man are seen together alone.<ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/>

'''Arab values'''
One of the characteristics of Arabs is generosity and they usually show it by being courteous with each other. Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times' <ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/>  '' says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite. Tarek Mahfouz explains in the book "Arab Culture" <ref name="ReferenceA">Mahfouz, Tarek. Arab Culture, Vol. 1: An In-depth Look at Arab Culture Through Cartoons and Popular Art (English and Arabic Edition). Ed. Thane Floreth. 2011 ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.</ref> that it is common for Arabs in dinner situations to insist on guests to eat the last piece of the meal or to fight over who will pay the bill at a restaurant for generosity.''

==Sports==

===Pan Arab Games===
{{Main|Pan Arab Games}}
The Pan Arab Games are a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab world. The first Games were held in 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties has made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985. By the [[2007 Pan Arab Games|11th Pan Arab Games]], the number of countries participating reached all 22 members of the [[Arab League]], with roughly over 8,000 Arab athletes participating, it was considered the largest in the Games' history, with the [[2011 Pan Arab Games|Doha Games]] in 2011 expected to exceed that number.

===Arab women in sports===
Women around the world have struggled in the professional world of sports since it has been something that has been dominated by men. When looking at the Arab world currently there is an emergence of Arab women playing sports, something that for the most part is not much discussed but is of great importance. Muslim Arab women are taking part in playing on futsal, football (soccer), softball, basketball, and various other teams. Some women are participating in boxing, archery, running, swimming, tennis and other individual sports. Because more Muslim women are playing sports, sportswear is being developed so that a woman can still be able to participate in sports like swimming without limiting their participation due to the way they choose to dress. Although women have received great support from family members in playing sports, there is still much criticism towards female athletes in the Arab world. Many conservative men have criticized that sports and women do not go together and that a woman would not be able to wear her headscarf or should not wear shorts while playing sports.

Some people do not see Islam and women playing sports as being compatible. Despite the various criticisms Arab women around the Arab world face, it has not stopped the popularity of women's participation in sports. Football is one of the sports that has exploded in popularity with women in the Arab world. With the coming of the Women's World Cup in 2011, there is a Women's Football Cup Arabia occurring in Bahrain which is bringing together women's teams from all over the Arab world to play in competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com/2010/10/womens-football-cup-arabia-2010-on-road.html |title=Muslim Women in SPORTS: WOMEN'S FOOTBALL CUP ARABIA 2010 – on the road to Germany |publisher=Muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-28 |access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> There are teams in Syria, Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Egypt, Libya and Jordan and events like this show that, as said by Dr. Sahar al Hawary who is a member of FIFA's Women's Committee from Egypt, "women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world... women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=90760.html |title=Princess champions game for Arab women |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2004-02-11 |access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref>

Arab women are also challenging and becoming a part of sports that even outside of the Arab world are considered not for women. There are Arab women who are participating in boxing, even reaching international competition levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cY2p8fjX1s |title=Everywoman – Sport and playing for gold – 30 May 08 – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> Arab women are not limiting themselves and although they receive criticism from some of society, their families and communities have been very supportive while still considering themselves conservative and faithful to Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2jYLCloFo&feature=channel |title=Everywoman – Sport and playing for gold – 30 May 08 – Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2011-04-05}}</ref> These women and their families are challenging the very narrow view that society at times has of the capabilities of women and have inspired women all around the Arab world to not limit themselves. Despite this occurring in the Arab world, what these Arab female athletes are doing is an inspiration to women all over the globe.

==Cuisine==
{{Main|Arab cuisine}}
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of Jordanian [[Meze|mezze]], appetizers or small dishes, in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of [[date palm|dates]], wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, with a heavy emphasis on yoghurt products, such as [[leben (food)|leben]] (لبن) (yoghurt without butterfat). Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, spanning the Arab world and incorporating [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], Egyptian, and others. It has also been influenced to a degree by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Berber, and others. In an average Arab household in [[Eastern Arabia]], a visitor might expect a dinner consisting of a very large platter, shared commonly, with a vast mountain of rice, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both, as separate dishes, with various stewed vegetables, heavily spiced, sometimes with a tomato sauce. Most likely, there would be several other items on the side, less hearty. [[Tea]] would certainly accompany the meal, as it is almost constantly consumed. [[Coffee]] would be included as well.

===Tea culture===

== Dress ==

===Men===
Arab dress for men ranges from the traditional flowing robes to blue jeans, T-shirts and business suits. The robes allow for maximum circulation of air around the body to help keep it cool, and the head dress provides protection from the sun. At times, Arabs mix the traditional garb with clothes.<ref>https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf</ref>

'''Thobe'''
In the [[Arabian Peninsula]] men usually wear their national dress that is called "thobe" but can be also called "Dishdasha" in Kuwait or "Kandoura" (UAE). "Thobes" differ slightly from state to state within the Gulf, but the basic ones are white. This is the traditional attire that Arabs wear in formal occasions.

'''Headdress'''
The male headdress is also known as [[Keffiyeh]]. Headdress pattern might be an indicator of which tribe, clan, or family the wearer comes from. However, this is not always the case. While in one village, a tribe or clan might have a unique headdress, in the next town over an unrelated tribe or clan might wear the same headdress.

'''Guthra (headdress) in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]'''
The male headdress in the Gulf states is called Guthra and it is different in each country (size and shape). It is usually worn with a black cord called "agal" that keeps the guthra on the wearer's head.
* The Qatari guthra is heavily starched and it is known for its "cobra" shape.
* The Saudi guthra is a square shaped cotton fabric. The traditional is white but the white and red (shemagh) is also very common in Saudi Arabia.
* The Emirati guthra is usually white and can be used as a wrapped turban or traditionally with the black agal.

===Women===
Adherence to traditional dress varies across Arab societies. [[Saudi Arabia]] is more traditional, while [[Egypt]] is less so. Traditional Arab dress features the full length body cover ([[abaya]], [[jilbāb]], or [[chador]]) and veil ([[hijab]]). Women are only required to wear ''[[abaya]]s'' in Saudi Arabia, although that restriction has been eased since 2015. In most countries, like [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]], the veil is not as prevalent.
