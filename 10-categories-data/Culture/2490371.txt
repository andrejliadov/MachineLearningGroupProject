'''"Low culture"''' is a derogatory term for forms of [[popular culture]] that have [[Commoner|mass appeal]]. Its contrast is "[[high culture]]", which can also be derogatory. It has been said by [[culture theory|culture theorists]] that both high culture and low culture are [[subculture]]s.

== Standards and definitions of low culture ==

In his book ''Popular Culture and High Culture'', [[Herbert J. Gans]] gives a definition of how to identify and create low culture:
{{quote|Aesthetic standards of low culture stress substance, form being totally subservient, and there is no explicit concern with abstract ideas or even with fictional forms of contemporary social problems and issues. ... Low culture emphasizes morality but limits itself to familial and individual problems and [the] values, which apply to such problems. Low culture is content to depict traditional working class values winning out over the temptation to give into conflicting impulses and behavior patterns.|Herbert Gans|<ref>{{cite book|first=Herbert|last=Gans|authorlink=Herbert J. Gans|title=Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste|url=https://archive.org/details/popularculturehi00gans_0|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York City|origyear=1958|year=1999|isbn= 978-0465026098|page=[https://archive.org/details/popularculturehi00gans_0/page/115 115]}}</ref>}}

== Culture as class ==
Herbert Gans states in his book ''Popular Culture and High Culture'' that the different classes of culture are linked correspondingly to socio-economic and educational classes.<ref>Gans, pg. 7</ref> For any given socio-economic class, there is a culture for that class. Hence the terms high and low culture and the manifestation of those terms as they appeal to their respective constituents.

== Mass media ==

=== Audience ===
All cultural products (especially high culture) have a certain demographic to which they appeal most. Low culture appeals to very simple and basic human needs plus offers a perceived return to innocence,<ref>{{cite book|first=Anna|last=Tomasino|title=Discovering Popular Culture|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=London, England|date=2006|isbn=978-0321355966|page=211}}</ref> the escape from real world problems, or the experience of living vicariously through viewing someone else’s life on television.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Eric|last1=Mazur|first2=Tara K.|last2=Koda|chapter=The Happiest Place on Earth: Disney’s America and the Commodiﬁcation of Religion|title=God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture|editor1-first=Eric|editor1-last=Mazur|editor2-first=Kate|editor2-last=McCarthy|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=Abingdon, England|date=2000|isbn=978-0415485371|page=307}}</ref>

==== Stereotypes ====
Low culture can be formulaic, employing [[Trope (literature)|trope conventions]], [[stock character]]s and character [[archetype]]s in a manner that can be perceived as more simplistic, crude, emotive, unbalanced, or blunt compared to high culture's implementations&mdash;which may be perceived as more subtle, balanced, or refined and open for interpretations.
