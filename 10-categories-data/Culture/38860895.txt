===Emerging activism===
Ali first became politically active in his teens, taking part in opposition to the [[History of Pakistan#Post 1971 history|military dictatorship of Pakistan]]. An uncle who worked in the Pakistani military intelligence<ref name='frontline2013' /> warned his parents that Ali could not be protected.<ref name="jamescampbell"/> His parents therefore decided to get him out of Pakistan and sent him to England to study at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]].<ref name="jamescampbell"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/feature_tariqali.shtml |title=Tariq Ali profile |access-date=26 April 2007 |work=[[BBC Four]] Documentary article |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917223148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/feature_tariqali.shtml |archive-date=17 September 2007 }}</ref> He was elected President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1965.

==Career==
[[File:Tariq Ali.jpg|thumb|Ali, [[Imperial College London|Imperial College, London]], 2003]]
His public profile began to grow during the [[Vietnam War]], when he engaged in debates against the war with such figures as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]]. He testified at the [[Russell Tribunal]] over [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|US involvement in Vietnam]]. As time passed, Ali became increasingly critical of [[Foreign policy of the United States|American]] and [[Foreign relations of Israel|Israeli foreign policies]]. He was also a vigorous opponent of American relations with Pakistan that tended to back [[military dictatorship]]s over democracy. He was one of the marchers on the [[U.S. Embassy, London|American embassy in London]] in 1968 in a demonstration against the [[Vietnam war]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/22/vietnamwar|last=Ali|first=Tariq|title=Where has all the rage gone?|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 March 2008|access-date=6 January 2011}}</ref>
 
Active in the [[New Left]] of the 1960s, he has long been associated with the ''[[New Left Review]]''. Ali inserted himself into politics through his involvement with ''[[The Black Dwarf (Ali)|The Black Dwarf]]'' newspaper, he joined the [[International Marxist Group]] (IMG) in 1968. He was recruited to the leadership of the IMG and became a member of the International Executive Committee of the (reunified) [[Reunified Fourth International|Fourth International]]. He also befriended influential figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/5/29/1968_40_years_later_tariq_ali |title=1968, Forty Years Later: Tariq Ali Looks Back on a Pivotal Year in the Global Struggle for Social Justice |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=29 May 2008

In 1967, Ali was in [[Camiri]], [[Bolivia]], not far from where [[Che Guevara]] was captured, to observe the trial of [[Régis Debray]]. He was accused of being a [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Cuban revolutionary]] by authorities. Ali then said: "If you torture me the whole night and I can speak Spanish in the morning I'll be grateful to you for the rest of my life."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSe-6XkzZhs |title=From Vietnam To Iraq To Bolivia-Tariq Ali |publisher=YouTube |access-date=3 August 2012}}</ref>

During this period he was an [[International Marxist Group|IMG]] candidate in [[Sheffield Attercliffe (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Attercliffe]] at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] and was co-author of ''Trotsky for Beginners'', a cartoon book. In 1981, Ali quit the IMG and joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to support [[Tony Benn]] in his bid to become deputy leader of the Labour Party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1981/12/ali.htm|title=Tariq Ali: Why I'm Joining the Labour Party (December 1981)|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>
[[File:Encuentros Averroes Córdoba. El paradigma de Córdoba (2011).jpg|thumb|Ali presenting Spanish version of ''Conversations with Edward Said'', [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], 2010]]
In 1990, he published the satire ''[[Redemption (1990 novel)|Redemption]]'', on the inability of the Trotskyists to handle the downfall of the [[Eastern bloc]]. The book contains parodies of many well-known figures in the Trotskyist movement. In 1999 Ali strongly criticised US and UK interventions in the [[Balkans]] in the piece ''Springtime for NATO'',<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = Tariq | title = Springtime for NATO | journal =New Left Review| volume = I | issue = 234 | date = March–April 1999 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/234/tariq-ali-springtime-for-nato }}</ref> and book ''"Masters of the Universe?

His book, ''Clash of Fundamentalisms'', aimed to put the events of the [[September 11 attacks]] in historical [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]]. He followed that with ''[[Bush in Babylon]]'', which criticised the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by American president [[George W. Bush]]. The book uses poetry and critical essays in portraying the [[war in Iraq]] as a failure. Ali believes that the new [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] will fail.

Ali has remained a [[Neoliberalism#Criticism|critic]] of modern [[neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] and was present at the 2005 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil, where he was one of 19 to sign the [[Porto Alegre Manifesto]]. He supports the model of [[Bolivarian Revolution]] in Venezuela.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://versouk.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/oliver-stone-tariq-ali-and-mark-weisbrot-respond-to-ny-times-attack-on-south-of-the-border/ |title=Oliver Stone, Tariq Ali and Mark Weisbrot respond to NY Times attack on South of the Border " Verso UK's Blog |publisher=Versouk.wordpress.com |date=30 June 2010 |access-date=3 August 2012}}</ref>

He has been described as "the alleged inspiration" for the [[Rolling Stones]]' song "[[Street Fighting Man]]", recorded in 1968.<ref>Hazou, Christopher Hazou, [https://archive.today/20120524150633/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2007/092707/news2.html "Journalism and jingoism: Ownership and gullibility are two recurring problems for the Western press, says author and activist Tariq Ali"], ''Montreal Mirror''.

Ali participated in the [[The Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time 2012|2012 ''Sight & Sound'' critics' poll]], where he listed his ten favourite films as follows: ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'', ''[[Charulata]]'', ''[[Crimson Gold]]'', ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'', ''[[Entranced Earth]]'', ''[[If...

Ali has also written in favour of [[Scottish independence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/13/scots-undo-union-of-rogues-independence-1707-honour|title=Scots, undo this union of rogues.

During the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], Ali supported a [[Brexit|Leave]] vote on [[Lexit|left-wing grounds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2015/s4473089.htm |title=Lateline – 31/05/2016: Interview: Tariq Ali, British writer and commentator |website=Abc.net.au |date=31 May 2016 |access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2020, Ali was a member of the [[Belmarsh Tribunal]] organized by [[Progressive International]], investigating and evaluating the war crimes committed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] in the 21st century.

In November 2020, a British public inquiry into the work of undercover police officers was provided with evidence that Ali had been spied upon by at least 14 undercover police officers over a period of decades. The surveillance began in 1965 when he became president of the [[Oxford Union]], and continued until at least 2003, when Ali was on the national committee of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] trying to prevent the invasion of Iraq. Ali said "It is incredible to think that after 35 years, in 2003, under the Tony Blair Labour government, that Special Branch were still engaging in the same anti-democratic activity as they had been at the outset".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Rob |title=Tariq Ali spied on by at least 14 undercover officers, inquiry hears |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/11/tariq-ali-spied-on-14-undercover-officers-spy-cops-inquiry-hears |access-date=14 November 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=11 November 2020}}</ref>

==Screenplay==
Tariq Ali's ''The Leopard and The Fox'', first written as a [[BBC]] screenplay in 1985, is about the last days of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]. Never previously produced because of a censorship controversy, it was finally premiered in New York in October 2007, the day before former Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] returned to her home country after eight years in exile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alteregoproductions.org/blog/2007/07/the_leopard_and_the_fox_our_ne.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820013744/http://www.alteregoproductions.org/blog/2007/07/the_leopard_and_the_fox_our_ne.htm |archive-date=20 August 2007 }}</ref>

In 2009, Ali, alongside [[Mark Weisbrot]] wrote the screenplay to the [[Oliver Stone]] documentary ''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southoftheborderdoc.com/cast-credits/ |title=Cast & Credits " South of the Border – a film by Oliver Stone |publisher=Southoftheborderdoc.com |access-date=3 August 2012}}</ref> This gave a favourable account of Hugo Chávez and other left-wing Latin American leaders.  Interviewed in the documentary, Ali explained the role that Bolivian water privatisation and the [[2000 Cochabamba protests]] played in eventually bringing [[Evo Morales]] to power.

==Personal life==
Ali currently lives in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], north London, with his partner Susan Watkins, editor of the ''[[New Left Review]]''. He has three children: Natasha from a previous relationship, and Chengiz and Aisha with Watkins. He grew up in a secular family that was more [[Cultural Muslim|culturally Muslim]] than religious, and describes himself as an [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-hunter-davies-interview-for-you-tariq-ali-the-revolution-is-over-the-sixties-marxist-bogeyman-has-matured-into-a-minor-media-mogul----and-he-has-managed-to-acquire-a-sense-of-humour-1395731.html|title=The Independent interview with Hunter Davies|website=Independent.co.uk|date=22 February 1994|access-date=28 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Tariq Ali |title=This is the real outrage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/13/muhammadcartoons.comment |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |access-date=21 October 2020 |date=February 13, 2006 |quote=I am an atheist and do not know the meaning of the "religious pain" that is felt by believers of every case when what they believe in is insulted.}}</ref>
