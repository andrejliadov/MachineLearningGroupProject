=== Interoceptive ===

[[Interoception]] involves the conscious and unconscious sense of the internal state of the body, and it has an important role in [[homeostasis]] and regulation of emotions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khalsa SS, Adolphs R, Cameron OG, Critchley HD, Davenport PW, Feinstein JS, Feusner JD, Garfinkel SN, Lane RD, Mehling WE, Meuret AE, Nemeroff CB, Oppenheimer S, Petzschner FH, Pollatos O, Rhudy JL, Schramm LP, Simmons WK, Stein MB, Stephan KE, Van den Bergh O, Van Diest I, von Leupoldt A, Paulus MP | display-authors = 6 | title = Interoception and Mental Health: A Roadmap | journal = Biological Psychiatry.

Interoceptive awareness and emotion are deeply intertwined, and could mutually impact each other in abnormalities.<ref name=Bos2015 /> Anorexia patients also exhibit emotional regulation difficulties that ignite emotionally-cued eating behaviors, such as restricting food or excessive exercising.<ref name=Bos2015 /> Impaired interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness can lead anorexia patients to adapt distorted interpretations of weight gain that are cued by physical sensations related to digestion (e.g., fullness).<ref name=Bos2015 /> Combined, these interoceptive and emotional elements could together trigger maladaptive and negatively reinforced behavioral responses that assist in the maintenance of anorexia.<ref name=Bos2015 /> In addition to metacognition, people with anorexia also have difficulty with social cognition including interpreting others’ emotions, and demonstrating empathy.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kasperek-Zimowska BJ, Zimowski JG, Biernacka K, Kucharska-Pietura K, Rybakowski F | title = Impaired social cognition processes in Asperger syndrome and anorexia nervosa.

=== Media effects ===
Persistent exposure to media that presents body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. The cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic, V-shaped muscular men. A 2002 review found that, of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years, those read by men, unlike those read by women, were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Labre MP | title = Adolescent boys and the muscular male body ideal | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–42 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11927235 | doi = 10.1016/S1054-139X(01)00413-X }}</ref> Body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Izydorczyk|first1=Bernadetta|last2=Sitnik-Warchulska|first2=Katarzyna|date=2018-03-29|title=Sociocultural Appearance Standards and Risk Factors for Eating Disorders in Adolescents and Women of Various Ages|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=9|page=429|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00429|issn=1664-1078|pmc=5885084|pmid=29651268}}</ref>

Websites that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors, lifestyle descriptions, "thinspiration" or "fitspiration" (inspirational photo galleries and quotes that aim to serve as motivators for attainment of body ideals).<ref name=Norris>{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris ML, Boydell KM, Pinhas L, Katzman DK | title = Ana and the Internet: a review of pro-anorexia websites | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 443–7 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16721839 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20305 }}</ref> Pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment.<ref name=Norris />

The media portray a false view of what people truly look like. In magazines and movies and even on billboards most of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. People then strive to look like these "perfect" role models when in reality they are not near perfection themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1521/jscp.20.3.289.22303 |title=Ourselves, Our Bodies: Thin-Ideal Media, Self-Discrepancies, and Eating Disorder Symptomatology in Adolescents |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=289–323 |year=2001 |last1=Harrison |first1=Kristen }}</ref>

== Mechanisms ==
Evidence from physiological, pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest [[serotonin]] (also called 5-HT) may play a role in anorexia. While acutely ill, metabolic changes may produce a number of biological findings in people with anorexia that are not necessarily causative of the anorexic behavior. For example, abnormal hormonal responses to challenges with serotonergic agents have been observed during acute illness, but not recovery. Nevertheless, increased [[cerebrospinal fluid]] concentrations of [[5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid|5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] (a metabolite of serotonin), and changes in anorectic behavior in response to [[acute tryptophan depletion]] ([[tryptophan]] is a metabolic precursor to serotonin) support a role in anorexia. The activity of the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors]] has been reported to be lower in patients with anorexia in a number of cortical regions, evidenced by lower [[binding potential]] of this receptor as measured by [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]], independent of the state of illness. While these findings may be confounded by comorbid psychiatric disorders, taken as a whole they indicate serotonin in anorexia.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaye WH, Frank GK, Bailer UF, Henry SE, Meltzer CC, Price JC, Mathis CA, Wagner A | display-authors = 6 | title = Serotonin alterations in anorexia and bulimia nervosa: new insights from imaging studies | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–81 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15869768 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.013 | s2cid = 25676759 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaye WH, Bailer UF, Frank GK, Wagner A, Henry SE | title = Brain imaging of serotonin after recovery from anorexia and bulimia nervosa | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 86 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 15–7 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16102788 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.06.019 | s2cid = 17250708 }}</ref> These alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Neuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function. Alterations in networks related to the [[anterior cingulate cortex|dorsal anterior cingulate cortex]] may be related to excessive cognitive control of eating related behaviors. Similarly, altered somatosensory integration and introspection may relate to abnormal body image.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaudio S, Wiemerslage L, Brooks SJ, Schiöth HB | title = A systematic review of resting-state functional-MRI studies in anorexia nervosa: Evidence for functional connectivity impairment in cognitive control and visuospatial and body-signal integration | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 71 | pages = 578–589 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27725172 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.09.032 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A review of functional neuroimaging studies reported reduced activations in "bottom up" limbic region and increased activations in "top down" cortical regions which may play a role in restrictive eating.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fuglset TS, Landrø NI, Reas DL, Rø Ø | title = Functional brain alterations in anorexia nervosa: a scoping review | journal = Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 4 | pages = 32 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27933159 | pmc = 5125031 | doi = 10.1186/s40337-016-0118-y }}</ref>

Compared to controls, recovered anorexics show reduced activation in the [[reward system]] in response to food, and reduced correlation between self reported liking of a sugary drink and activity in the [[striatum]] and [[anterior cingulate cortex]]. Increased binding potential of [[Isotopes of carbon#Carbon-11|<sup>11</sup>C]] radiolabelled [[raclopride]] in the striatum, interpreted as reflecting decreased endogenous [[dopamine]] due to competitive displacement, has also been observed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Adan|first1=Roger|last2=Kaye|first2=Walter | name-list-style = vanc |title=Behavioral Neurobiology of Eating Disorders: 6 (Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences)|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|chapter=Neurocircuitry of Eating Disorders}}</ref>

Structural neuroimaging studies have found global reductions in both gray matter and white matter, as well as increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Regional decreases in the left [[hypothalamus]], left inferior [[parietal lobe]], right [[lentiform nucleus]] and right [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] have also been reported<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Titova OE, Hjorth OC, Schiöth HB, Brooks SJ | title = Anorexia nervosa is linked to reduced brain structure in reward and somatosensory regions: a meta-analysis of VBM studies | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 13 | pages = 110 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23570420 | pmc = 3664070 | doi = 10.1186/1471-244X-13-110 }}</ref> in acutely ill patients.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnostic assessment includes the person's current circumstances, biographical history, current symptoms, and family history. The assessment also includes a [[mental state examination]], which is an assessment of the person's current mood and thought content, focusing on views on weight and patterns of eating.

=== DSM-5 ===

Anorexia nervosa is classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders in the latest revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM 5). There is no specific BMI cutoff that defines low weight required for the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.<ref name="NEJM Mitchell" /><ref name="DSM5book" />

The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (all of which needing to be met for diagnosis) include:<ref name="DSM5" />

*Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to a low body weight.
*Intense fear of gaining weight or persistent behaviors that interfere with gaining weight.
*Disturbance in the way a person's weight or body shape is experienced or a lack of recognition about the risks of the low body weight.

Relative to the previous version of the DSM ([[DSM-IV-TR]]), the 2013 revision (DSM5) reflects changes in the criteria for anorexia nervosa, most notably that of the [[amenorrhea]] criterion being removed.<ref name=DSM5>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/eating%20disorders%20fact%20sheet.pdf |title=Feeding and eating disorders |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |date=2013 |access-date=9 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501013951/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Eating%20Disorders%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |archive-date=1 May 2015 }}</ref><ref name= Estour>{{cite journal | vauthors = Estour B, Galusca B, Germain N | title = Constitutional thinness and anorexia nervosa: a possible misdiagnosis? | journal = Frontiers in Endocrinology | volume = 5 | pages = 175 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25368605 | pmc = 4202249 | doi = 10.3389/fendo.2014.00175 }}</ref> Amenorrhea was removed for several reasons: it does not apply to males, it is not applicable for females before or after the age of menstruation or taking birth control pills, and some women who meet the other criteria for AN still report some menstrual activity.<ref name=DSM5 />

==== Subtypes ====
There are two subtypes of AN:<ref name=Strumia /><ref name=Peat>{{cite journal | vauthors = Peat C, Mitchell JE, Hoek HW, Wonderlich SA | title = Validity and utility of subtyping anorexia nervosa | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 590–4 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19598270 | pmc = 2844095 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20717 }}</ref>
* Binge-eating/purging type: the individual utilizes binge eating or displays purging behavior as a means for losing weight.<ref name=Peat /> It is different from [[bulimia nervosa]] in terms of the individual's weight. An individual with binge-eating/purging type anorexia can maintain a healthy or normal weight, but is usually significantly underweight. People with [[bulimia nervosa]] on the other hand can sometimes be overweight.<ref name=Nolen339 />
* Restricting type: the individual uses restricting food intake, fasting, diet pills, or exercise as a means for losing weight;<ref name=Strumia /> they may exercise excessively to keep off weight or prevent weight gain, and some individuals eat only enough to stay alive.<ref name=Strumia /><ref name=Nolen339 /> In the restrictive type, there are no recurrent episodes of binge-eating or purging present.<ref name="NEJM Mitchell" />

==== Levels of severity ====

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) is used by the DSM-5 as an indicator of the level of severity of anorexia nervosa. The DSM-5 states these as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Primary Care, Second Edition: An Interprofessional Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jJCKBQAAQBAJ&q=anorexia%20nervosa%20%20body%20mass%20index%20%20DSM-v%20levels%20of%20severity&pg=PA826|publisher = Springer Publishing Company|date = 12 November 2014|access-date = 9 April 2015|isbn = 978-0-8261-7147-4|first = Joanne K.|last = Singleton}}</ref>

* Mild: BMI of greater than 17
* Moderate: BMI of 16–16.99
* Severe: BMI of 15–15.99
* Extreme: BMI of less than 15

=== Investigations ===
Medical tests to check for signs of physical deterioration in anorexia nervosa may be performed by a general physician or psychiatrist, including:

* [[Complete Blood Count]] (CBC): a test of the [[white blood cells]], [[red blood cells]] and [[platelets]] used to assess the presence of various disorders such as [[leukocytosis]], [[leukopenia]], [[thrombocytosis]] and [[anemia]] which may result from [[malnutrition]].<ref name="Medline Plus">{{cite web|title=CBC|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003642.htm|publisher=MedlinePlus : U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=31 May 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525021411/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003642.htm|archive-date=25 May 2013}}</ref>

=== Differential diagnoses ===
{{Main|Anorexia nervosa (differential diagnoses)}}
A variety of medical and psychological conditions have been misdiagnosed as anorexia nervosa; in some cases the correct diagnosis was not made for more than ten years.

The distinction between the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[eating disorder not otherwise specified]] (EDNOS) is often difficult to make as there is considerable overlap between people diagnosed with these conditions. Seemingly minor changes in people's overall behavior or attitude can change a diagnosis from anorexia: binge-eating type to bulimia nervosa. A main factor differentiating binge-purge anorexia from bulimia is the gap in physical weight. Someone with bulimia nervosa is ordinarily at a healthy weight, or slightly overweight. Someone with binge-purge anorexia is commonly underweight.<ref name=Nolen341>{{cite book|author=Nolen-Hoeksema S|title=Abnormal Psychology |edition= Sixth|year=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-803538-8|page=341 |chapter=Eating disorders}}</ref> People with the binge-purging subtype of AN may be significantly underweight and typically do not binge-eat large amounts of food, yet they purge the small amount of food they eat.<ref name=Nolen341 /> In contrast, those with bulimia nervosa tend to be at normal weight or overweight and binge large amounts of food.<ref name=Nolen341 /> It is not unusual for a person with an eating disorder to "move through" various diagnoses as their behavior and beliefs change over time.<ref name=Zucker1 />

== Treatment ==
There is no conclusive evidence that any particular treatment for anorexia nervosa works better than others; however, there is enough evidence to suggest that early intervention and treatment are more effective.<ref name=LockFitzpatrick2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lock JD, Fitzpatrick KK | title = Anorexia nervosa | journal = BMJ Clinical Evidence | volume = 2009 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19445758 | pmc = 2907776 }}</ref> Treatment for anorexia nervosa tries to address three main areas.
* Restoring the person to a healthy weight;
* Treating the psychological disorders related to the illness;
* Reducing or eliminating behaviours or thoughts that originally led to the disordered eating.<ref>{{Cite web |author=National Institute of Mental Health |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml |title=Eating disorders |access-date=23 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323185427/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=23 March 2015 }}</ref>
Although restoring the person's weight is the primary task at hand, optimal treatment also includes and monitors behavioral change in the individual as well.<ref>National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2004).

=== Nutrition ===
The rate of refeeding can be difficult to establish, because the fear of [[refeeding syndrome]] (RFS) can lead to underfeeding.  It is thought that RFS, with falling phosphate and potassium levels,  is more likely to occur when BMI is very low, and when medical comorbidities such as infection or cardiac failure, are present.  In those circumstances, it is recommended to start refeeding slowly but to build up rapidly as long as RFS does not occur.  Recommendations on energy requirements vary, from 5–10 kcal/kg/day in the most medically compromised patients, who appear to have the highest risk of RFS, to 1900 kcal/day.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Connor G, Nicholls D | title = Refeeding hypophosphatemia in adolescents with anorexia nervosa: a systematic review | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 358–64 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23459608 | pmc = 4108292 | doi = 10.1177/0884533613476892 }}</ref><ref>http://%5Bhttps{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance#what-to-give-in-hospital-and-the-community%20NICE%20guideline%20on%20Nutrition%20support%5D {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804193212/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg32/chapter/1-Guidance |date=4 August 2017 }}</ref>

[[Alexithymia]] influences treatment outcome.<ref name=Pinna /> Recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria, individuals can have a good, intermediate, or poor outcome. Even when a person is classified as having a "good" outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average, and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean a return to normal.{{mcn|date=March 2015}}

=== Complications ===
Anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation, or the attainment of [[peak bone mass]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Donaldson AA, Gordon CM | title = Skeletal Complications of Eating Disorders

Growth retardation may occur, as height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. In such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as [[hypogonadism]] may partially counteract the effects of undernutrition on height by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} Appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing [[adipose tissue]] levels compared to premorbid levels.{{mcn|date=March 2015}} In some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.<ref name="CG9FullGuideline">{{cite journal |journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health |year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327055429/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2014  }}</ref>

Anorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a [[secondary amenorrhea|cessation of menstruation]] in women who are past puberty. In patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation.<ref name="pmid18574232">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vyver E, Steinegger C, Katzman DK | title = Eating disorders and menstrual dysfunction in adolescents | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1135 | issue = 1 | pages = 253–64 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18574232 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1429.013 | bibcode = 2008NYASA1135..253V }}</ref> Anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland.

The most common gastrointestinal complications of anorexia nervosa are [[Gastroparesis|delayed stomach emptying]] and [[constipation]], but also include elevated [[liver function tests]], [[diarrhea]], [[acute pancreatitis]], [[gastroesophageal reflux disease|heartburn]], [[dysphagia|difficulty swallowing]], and, rarely, [[superior mesenteric artery syndrome]].<ref name="pmid26407541">{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris ML, Harrison ME, Isserlin L, Robinson A, Feder S, Sampson M | title = Gastrointestinal complications associated with anorexia nervosa: A systematic review | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–37 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26407541 | doi = 10.1002/eat.22462 }}</ref> Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; the most common symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting.

====Cardiac complications====
Anorexia nervosa increases the risk of [[sudden cardiac death]], though the precise cause is unknown. Cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart.<ref name="pmid26710932">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs KV, Harnke B, Mehler PS, Krantz MJ | title = Cardiovascular complications of anorexia nervosa: A systematic review | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–48 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26710932 | doi = 10.1002/eat.22481 }}</ref> Some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment, while others may be life-threatening. Cardiac complications can include [[cardiac arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], [[bradycardia|abnormally slow heart beat]], [[low blood pressure]], decreased size of the heart muscle, reduced heart volume, [[mitral valve prolapse]], [[myocardial fibrosis]], and [[pericardial effusion]].<ref name="pmid26710932"/>

Abnormalities in conduction and repolarization of the heart that can result from anorexia nervosa include [[QT prolongation]], increased [[QT interval|QT dispersion]], conduction delays,  and [[junctional escape rhythms]].<ref name="pmid26710932"/> Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly [[hypokalemia]] and [[hypomagnesemia]], can cause anomalies in the electrical activity of the heart, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]] or near-fainting.<ref name="pmid26710932"/> Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization.<ref name="pmid26710932"/>  Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes [[atrophy]] of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased [[cardiac output|ability to pump blood]], a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue.<ref name="pmid3335466"/>

Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery.<ref name="pmid3335466">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldberg SJ, Comerci GD, Feldman L | title = Cardiac output and regional myocardial contraction in anorexia nervosa | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health Care | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 1988 | pmid = 3335466 | doi = 10.1016/0197-0070(88)90013-7 }}</ref> Atrophy of the [[myocardium|heart muscle]] is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death.<ref name="pmid26710932"/> Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or [[palpitations]]; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the [[mitral valve]] remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent.<ref name="pmid3460535">{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson GL, Humphries LL, Shirley PB, Mazzoleni A, Noonan JA | title = Mitral valve prolapse in patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 8 | pages = 1525–9 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3460535 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.1986.00360200083014 }}</ref> It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.<ref name="pmid26710932"/>

== Epidemiology ==
Anorexia is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in Western countries at some point in their life.<ref name="Sm2012" /> About 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur three to ten times less commonly in males.<ref name=DSM5book /><ref name=Sm2012 /><ref name=Hasan /> Rates in most of the developing world are unclear.<ref name=DSM5book /> Often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood.<ref name=NIH2015 />

The lifetime rate of [[atypical anorexia nervosa]], a form of [[ED-NOS]] in which the person loses a significant amount of weight and is at risk for serious medical complications despite having a higher body-mass index, is much higher, at 5–12%.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zanetti T|chapter=Epidemiology of Eating Disorders|title=Eating Disorders and the Skin|year=2013|pages=9–15|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29136-4_2|isbn=978-3-642-29135-7}}</ref>

While anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis.<ref name=Attia2010 /> Most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of AN in adult women is fairly constant, while there is some indication that the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20.<ref name=Sm2012 /> According to researcher [[Ben Radford]] who wrote in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' "I found many examples of flawed, misleading, and sometimes completely wrong information and data being copied and widely disseminated among eating disorder organizations and educators without anyone bothering to consult the original research to verify its accuracy". Radford states that misleading statistics and data have been ignored by organizations like the National Eating Disorder Association who has not released data for "incidence of anorexia from 1984–2017" he states that each agency continues to report incorrect numbers assuming that someone else has checked the accuracy.<ref name="Radford 2018">{{cite journal|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|author-link=Ben Radford|date=2018|title=Medical Misinformation in the Media: Is Anorexia on the Rise?|url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2019/03/SI-JF-18.pdf#page=46|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquirer|volume=42|issue=1|pages=46–49}}</ref>

=== Underrepresentation ===
Eating disorders are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in Western countries. In Africa, not including South Africa, the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence.

{{Main|History of anorexia nervosa}}
[[File:Anorexia case-1900-Nouvelle icononographie de la Salpetriere.jpg|thumb|Two images of an anorexic woman published in 1900 in "Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salpêtrière". The case was titled "Un cas d'anorexie hysterique" (A case of hysteric anorexia).]]

The term "anorexia nervosa" was coined in 1873 by [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of [[Queen Victoria]]'s personal physicians.<ref name="pmid9385628" /> The history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic era]]<ref name=Pearce>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pearce JM | title = Richard Morton: origins of anorexia nervosa | journal = European Neurology | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 191–2 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15539770 | doi = 10.1159/000082033 | s2cid = 30482453 }}</ref> and continuing into the medieval period. The medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as ''[[anorexia mirabilis]].''<ref name=Espi>{{cite journal | vauthors = Espi Forcen F | title = Anorexia mirabilis: the practice of fasting by Saint Catherine of Siena in the late Middle Ages | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 170 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–1 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23545792 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12111457 }}</ref><ref name=Harris>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris JC | title = Anorexia nervosa and anorexia mirabilis: Miss K.

The earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to English physician [[Richard Morton (physician)|Richard Morton]] in 1689.<ref name=Pearce /> Case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309">{{cite book|author=Gull, Sir William Withey|editor=T D Acland |year=1894|page= 309|title=Medical Papers}}</ref>

In the late 19th century anorexia nervosa became widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. In 1873, [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], one of Queen Victoria's personal physicians, published a seminal paper which coined the term "anorexia nervosa" and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments.<ref name="Medical Papers, Sir William Withey Gull, edited by T D Acland 1894 309" /> In the same year, French physician [[Charles Lasègue|Ernest-Charles Lasègue]] similarly published details of a number of cases in a paper entitled ''De l'Anorexie hystérique''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lasègue E|title=On Hysterical Anorexia|publisher=Medical Times and Gazette|date=6 September 1873}} See also {{cite journal | vauthors = Laségue | title = On hysterical anorexia (a). 1873 | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 492–7 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9385627 | doi = 10.1002/j.1550-8528.1997.tb00676.x }}</ref>

Awareness of the condition was largely limited to the medical profession until the latter part of the 20th century, when German-American psychoanalyst [[Hilde Bruch]] published ''The Golden Cage: the Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa'' in 1978.  Despite major advances in neuroscience,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book | last = Arnold | first = Carrie | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2012 | title = Decoding Anorexia: How Breakthroughs in Science Offer Hope for Eating Disorders | publisher = Routledge Press | isbn = 978-0-415-89867-6}}</ref> Bruch's theories tend to dominate popular thinking. A further important event was the death of the popular singer and drummer [[Karen Carpenter]] in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders.<ref>{{cite news | last = Arnold | first = Carrie | name-list-style = vanc  |title=Anorexia: you don't just grow out of it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it|access-date=29 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329055732/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/anorexia-you-dont-just-grow-out-of-it|archive-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The term is of Greek origin: ''an-'' (ἀν-, prefix denoting negation) and ''orexis'' (ὄρεξις, "appetite"), translating literally to a nervous loss of appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein DA, Walsh BT | title = Eating disorders: clinical features and pathophysiology | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 81 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–74 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15159176 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.02.009 | s2cid = 29361114 }}</ref>
