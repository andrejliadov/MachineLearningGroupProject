{{short description|Movement that seeks to protect the public domain}}
'''Cultural environmentalism''' is the movement that seeks to protect the [[public domain]]. The term was coined by [[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], professor at [[Duke University]] and contributor to the [[Financial Times]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/cc8e24ce-a242-11da-9096-0000779e2340.html FT.com / Comment & analysis / FT Columnists - James Boyle: Cultural environmentalism?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The term stems from Boyle's argument that those who seek to protect the public domain are working towards a similar ends as [[environmentalists]]. Boyle's contention is that whereas the environmentalist movement illuminated the effects that social decisions can have upon ecology, cultural environmentalists seek to illuminate the effects that [[intellectual property]] laws can have upon culture.
