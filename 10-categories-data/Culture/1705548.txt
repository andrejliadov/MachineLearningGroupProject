The '''culture in Africa''' is varied and manifold, consisting of a mixture of countries with various tribes that each have their own unique characteristic from the continent of [[Africa]]. It is a product of the diverse populations that today inhabit the continent of Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. African culture is expressed in its arts and crafts, folklore and religion, clothing, cuisine, music and languages.<ref>{{Cite web|title = African Culture and People|url = http://goafrica.about.com/od/peopleandculture/|website = About.com Travel|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref> Expressions of culture are abundant within Africa, with large amounts of cultural diversity being found not only across different countries but also within single countries. Even though African cultures are widely diverse, they are also, when closely studied, seen to have many similarities; for example, the morals they uphold, their love and respect for their culture as well as the strong respect they hold for the aged and the important, i.e. [[Monarchies in Africa|kings]] and chiefs.

Africa has influenced and been influenced by other continents. This can be portrayed in the willingness to adapt to the ever-changing modern world rather than staying rooted to their static culture. The Westernized few, persuaded by American culture and Christianity, first denied African traditional culture, but with the increase of African [[nationalism]], a cultural recovery occurred. The governments of most African nations encourage national dance and music groups, museums, and to a lower degree, artists and writers.

==Historical overview==
[[File:Egypt bookofthedead.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sample of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[scribe]] Nebqed, c. [[1300 BC]]]]
Africa is divided into a great number of ethnic cultures.<ref name="Khair El-Din Haseeb et al.">Khair El-Din Haseeb et al., ''The Future of the Arab Nation: Challenges and Options'', 1 edition (Routledge: 1991), p.54</ref><ref name="Halimrakat">Halim Barakat, ''The Arab World: Society, Culture, and State'', ([[University of California Press]]: 1993), p.80</ref><ref name="Tajudeen Abdul Raheem 1996">Tajudeen Abdul Raheem, ed., Pan Africanism: Politics, Economy and Social Change in the Twenty-First Century, Pluto Press, London, 1996.</ref> The continent's cultural regeneration has also been an integral aspect of post-independence nation-building on the continent, with a recognition of the need to harness the cultural resources of Africa to enrich the process of education, requiring the creation of an enabling environment in a number of ways. In recent times, the call for a much greater emphasis on the cultural dimension in all aspects of development has become increasingly vocal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocpa.irmo.hr/resources/docs/COMEDAFII_Unesco_EdCultRole-en.pdf |title=Education And Culture In Africa'S Quest For Development |website=Ocpa.irmo.hr |access-date=2015-10-14}}</ref> During the Roman colonization of North Africa, (parts of Algeria, Libya, Egypt and the whole of Tunisia) provinces such as Tripolitania became major producers of food for the republic and the empire, this generated much wealth in these places for their 400 years of occupation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/scheidel/010902.pdf|title=Princeton/Stanford Working Papers in Classics : Economy and quality of life in the Roman world|date=January 2009|author=Walter Scheidel |website=Princeton.edu|access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref> During [[colonialism in Africa]], Europeans possessed attitudes of superiority and a sense of mission. The French were able to accept an African as French if that person gave up their African culture and adopted French ways. Knowledge of the Portuguese language and culture and abandonment of traditional African ways defined one as civilized.<ref>Khapoya, op. cit. p. 126f</ref> [[Kenya]]n social commentator Mwiti Mugambi argues that the future of Africa can only be forged from accepting and mending the sociocultural present. For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away. However, [[Maulana Karenga]] states:
{{Quotation|Our culture provides us with an ethos we must honor in both thought and practice. By ethos, we mean a people's self-understanding as well as its self-presentation in the world through its thought and practice in the other six areas of culture. It is above all a cultural challenge.

==African arts and crafts==

Africa has a rich tradition of [[art]]s and [[craft]]s. African arts and crafts find expression in a variety of [[woodcarving]]s, [[brass]] and [[leather]] art works. African arts and crafts also include [[sculpture]], [[painting]]s, [[pottery]], [[ceremonial]] and [[religious]] [[headgear]] and [[Clothing|dress]]. [[Maulana Karenga]] states that in African art, the object was not as important as the soul force behind the creation of the object. He also states that All art must be revolutionary and in being revolutionary it must be collective, committing, and functional.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Masques BaKongo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kongo people|BaKongo]] masks from the [[Bas-Congo|Kongo Central region]]]]
Certain African cultures have always placed emphasis on personal appearance and [[jewelry]] has remained an important personal [[Fashion accessory|accessory]]. Many pieces of such jewelry are made of [[cowry]] shells and similar materials. Similarly, [[mask]]s are made with elaborate designs and are an important part of some cultures in Africa. Masks are used in various ceremonies depicting ancestors and spirits, mythological characters and deities.
[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|A terra-cotta head sculpture (1100-1500) of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], showing extraordinary naturalism. This head represents the oni, or king of [[Ife]].]]
In many traditional arts and craft traditions in Africa, certain themes significant to those particular cultures recur, including a couple, a woman with a child, a male with a weapon or animal, and an outsider or a stranger. Couples may represent ancestors, community founder, married couple or twins. The couple theme rarely exhibits intimacy of men and women. The mother with the child or children reveals intense desire of the women to have children. The theme is also representative of mother mars and the people as her children. The man with the weapon or animal theme symbolizes honor and power. A stranger may be from some other tribe or someone from a different country, and more distorted portrayal of the stranger indicates proportionately greater gap from the stranger.

==Folklore and religion==

Like all human cultures, African folklore and religion represents a variety of social facets of the various cultures in Africa.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Like almost all civilizations and cultures, flood myths have been circulating in different parts of Africa. Culture and religion share space and are deeply intertwined in African cultures. In Ethiopia, Christianity and Islam form the core aspects of Ethiopian culture and inform dietary customs as well as rituals and rites.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, 1997, `History of the Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History, Lawrenceville, New Jersey.</ref> According to a [[Pygmy]] myth, Chameleon, hearing a strange noise in a tree, cut open its trunk and water came out in a great flood that spread all over the land.

[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenya]]n boys and girls performing a traditional folklore dance]]
Folktales also play an important role in many African cultures. Stories reflect a group cultural identity and preserving the stories of Africa will help preserve an entire culture. Storytelling affirms pride and identity in a culture. In Africa, stories are created by and for the ethnic group telling them. Different ethnic groups in Africa have different rituals or ceremonies for storytelling, which creates a sense of belonging to a cultural group. To outsiders hearing an ethnic group's stories, it provides an insight into the community's beliefs, views, and customs. For people within the community, it allows them to encompass their group's uniqueness. They show the human desires and fears of a group, such as love, marriage, and death. Folktales are also seen as a tool for education and entertainment. They provide a way for children to understand the material and social environment. Every story has a moral to teach people, such as goodwill prevail over evil. For entertainment, stories are set in fantastic, non-human worlds. Often, the main character of the story would be a talking animal or something unnatural would happen to a human character. Even though folktales are for entertainment, they bring a sense of belonging and pride to communities in Africa.<ref>Florence, Namulundah. The Bukusu of Kenya: Folktales, Culture and Social Identities. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic, 2011. Print.</ref>

There are different types of African stories: animal tales and day-to-day tales. Animal tales more oriented towards entertainment, but still have morals and lessons to them. Animal tales are normally divided into trickster tales and ogre tales. In the animal tales, a certain animal would always have the same character or role in each story so the audience does not have to worry about characterization. The Hare was always the trickster, clever and cunning, while the Hyena was always being tricked by the Hare. Ogres are always cruel, greedy monsters. The messengers in all the stories were the Birds. Day-to-Day tales are the most serious tales, never including humor, that explained the everyday life and struggles of an African community. These tales take on matters such as famine, escape from death, courtship, and family matters, using a song form when the climax of the story was being told.

African stories all have a certain structure to them. Villagers would gather around a common meeting place at the end of the day to listen and tell their stories. Storytellers had certain commands to start and end the stories, "Ugai Itha" to get the audience's attention and begin the story, and "Rukirika" to signal the end of a tale. Each scene of a story is depicted with two characters at a time, so the audience does not get overwhelmed. In each story, victims are able to overcome their predators and take justice out on the culprit. Certain tools were used in African folktales. For example, idiophones, such as drums, were used to make the sounds of different animals. Repetition and call-back techniques in the form of prose or poem were also used to get the audience involved in the stories.<ref>Mwangi, Rose. Kikuyu Folktales.

[[File:KangaSiyu1.jpg|thumb|A woman in [[Kenya]] wearing [[Kanga (African garment)|kanga]]]]

Women's traditional clothes in [[Ethiopia]] are made from [[cloth]] called ''shemma''{{which lang|date=July 2020}} and are used to make ''[[habesha kemis]]''. The latter garment is basically cotton cloth, about 90&nbsp; cm wide, woven in long strips which are then sewn together. Sometimes shiny threads are woven into the [[Textile|fabric]] for an elegant effect. Men wear pants and a knee-length shirt with a white [[collar (clothing)|collar]], and perhaps a sweater. Men often wear knee-high socks, while women might not wear socks at all. Men as well as women wear shawls, the ''netela''.
[[File:Traditional Maasai Dance.jpg|thumb|right|Maasai wearing traditional clothes named ''Matavuvale'' while performing [[African dance#Examples|Adumu]], a traditional dance]]

Zulus wear a variety of attire, both traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions. Traditional male clothing is usually light, consisting of a two-part apron (similar to a loincloth) used to cover the genitals and buttocks. The front piece is called the ''umutsha'' (pronounced {{IPA-zu|umtifash}}), and is usually made of [[Springbok (antelope)|springbok]] or other animal hide twisted into different bands which cover the genitals. The rear piece, called the ''ibheshu'' {{IPA|[ibeːʃu]}}, is made of a single piece of springbok or [[cattle]] hide, and its length is usually used as an indicator of age and social position; longer amabheshu (plural of ibheshu) are worn by older men. Married men will usually also wear a headband, called the ''umqhele'' {{IPA|[umǃʰɛle]}}, which is usually also made of springbok hide, or [[leopard]] hide by men of higher social status, such as chiefs. Zulu men will also wear cow tails as bracelets and anklets called ''imishokobezi'' {{IPA|[imiʃoɠoɓɛːzi]}} during ceremonies and rituals, such as weddings or dances.

In the Muslim parts of Africa, daily attire also often reflects Islamic tradition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Cuisine==
{{Main|African cuisine}}
[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fufu]]'' (right) is a staple meal in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. It is served here with some [[peanut soup]].]]
The various cuisines of Africa use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |access-date=2008-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However it is important to consider the affordability of and access of these products on daily basis.

In [[Central Africa]], the basic ingredients are plantains and cassava. [[Fufu]]-like starchy foods (usually made from fermented cassava roots) are served with grilled meat and sauces. A variety of local ingredients are used while preparing other dishes like [[spinach]] stew, cooked with tomato, peppers, chillis, onions, and peanut butter. Cassava plants are also consumed as cooked [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. Groundnut (peanut) stew is also prepared, containing [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[okra]], [[ginger]], and other spices. Another favorite is Bambara, a [[porridge]] of rice, peanut butter, and sugar. Beef and chicken are favorite meat dishes, but game meat preparations containing [[crocodile]], [[monkey]], [[antelope]] and [[warthog]] are also served occasionally.

The cuisine of the [[African Great Lakes]] region varies from area to area. In the inland savannah, the traditional cuisine of cattle-keeping peoples is distinctive in that meat products are generally absent. [[Cattle]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s were regarded as a form of [[currency]] and a store of wealth, and are not generally consumed as food. In some areas, traditional peoples consume the milk and blood of cattle, but rarely the meat. Elsewhere, other peoples are farmers who grow a variety of grains and vegetables. [[Maize]] (corn) is the basis of [[ugali]], the East African version of West Africa's [[fufu]]. Ugali is a starch dish eaten with meats or stews. In [[Uganda]], steamed, green [[banana]]s called [[matoke]] provide the starch filler of many meals.

In the [[Horn of Africa]], the main traditional dishes in [[Ethiopian cuisine]] and [[Eritrean cuisine]] are ''[[Wat (food)|tsebhis]]'' (stews) served with ''[[injera]]''<ref name="webcitation">[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/WARSAISANDIEGO/our_culture.htm&date=2009-10-25+11:44:57 "Eritrean Food Practices."] [https://www.webcitation.org Webcitation.org]. Accessed July 2011.</ref> (flatbread made from [[teff]],<ref name="webcitation"/> [[wheat]], or [[sorghum]]), and hilbet (paste made from [[legume]]s, mainly [[lentil]], [[Vicia faba|faba beans]]). Eritrean and [[Ethiopian cuisine]] (especially in the northern half) are very similar, given the shared history of the two countries. The related [[Somali cuisine]] consists of an exotic [[Fusion cuisine|fusion]] of diverse culinary influences. Varieties of ''bariis'' (rice), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually serve as the main dish. ''Xalwo'' (halwo) or [[halva]] is a popular confection served during special occasions such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions.<ref>Barlin Ali, ''Somali Cuisine'', (AuthorHouse: 2007), p.79</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan''){{which lang|date=July 2020}} or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''){{which lang|date=July 2020}}, which is prepared inside an [[Censer|incense burner]] referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''. All food is served [[halal]].
[[File:Potjiekos2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''[[Potjiekos]]'' is a traditional [[Afrikaner]] stew made with meat and vegetables and cooked over coals in [[cast-iron]] pots.]]

The roots of [[North African cuisine]] can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa, particularly in Egypt where many of the country's dishes and culinary traditions date back to ancient Egypt. Over several centuries traders, travelers, invaders, migrants and immigrants all have influenced the cuisine of North Africa. Most of the North African countries today have several similar dishes, sometimes almost the same dish with a different name (the Moroccan ''tangia'' and the Tunisian ''coucha'' are both essentially the same dish: a meat stew prepared in an [[urn]] and cooked overnight in a public oven), sometimes with a slight change in ingredients and cooking style. To add to the confusion, two completely different dishes may also share the same name (for example, a "tajine" dish is a slow-cooked stew in Morocco, whereas the Tunisian "tajine" is a baked [[omelette]]/[[quiche]]-like dish). There are noticeable differences between the cooking styles of different nations – there's the sophisticated, full-bodied flavours of [[Moroccan cuisine|Moroccan palace cookery]], the fiery dishes of [[Tunisian cuisine]], and the humbler, simpler cuisines of [[Egypt]] and [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Foods of North Africa |url=http://www.specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |first=Paula |last=Wolfert |publisher=[[National Association for the Specialty Food Trade]], Inc. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021074848/http://specialtyfood.com/do/news/ViewNewsArticle?id=2402 |archive-date=2007-10-21 }}</ref>

The cooking of Southern Africa is sometimes called 'rainbow cuisine', as the food in this region is a blend of many culinary traditions, including those of the [[Khoisan people|Khoisan]], [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[European cuisine|European]] and [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] populations. Basic ingredients include seafood, meat products (including wild game), poultry, as well as grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. Fruits include [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, [[mango]]es, [[banana]]s and [[papaya]]s, [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[peach]]es and [[apricot]]s. Desserts may simply be fruit. However, there are some more western style puddings, such as the Angolan [[Cocada amarela]], which was inspired by [[Portuguese cuisine]]. Meat products include lamb, as well as game like [[venison]], [[ostrich]], and [[impala]]. The seafood includes a wide variety such as [[crayfish]], [[prawn]]s, [[tuna]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, calamari, [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]]. There are also several types of traditional and modern [[alcoholic beverage]]s including many European-style [[beer]]s.

A typical West African meal is heavy with [[starch]]y items, meat, spices, and flavors. A wide array of staples are eaten across the region, including those of Fufu, [[Banku]] and [[Kenkey]] (originating from [[Ghana]]), Foutou, [[Couscous]], Tô, and [[Garri]], which are served alongside soups and stews. Fufu is often made from starchy [[root vegetable]]s such as [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[Xanthosoma|cocoyams]], or [[cassava]], but also from cereal grains like millet, sorghum or plantains. The staple grain or starch varies region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group, although corn has gained significant ground as it is cheap, swells to greater volumes and creates a beautiful white final product that is greatly desired. Banku and Kenkey are maize dough staples, and Gari is made from dried grated cassavas. Rice-dishes are also widely eaten in the region, especially in the dry [[Sahel]] belt inland. Examples of these include [[Benachin]] from [[The Gambia]] and [[Jollof rice]], a pan-West African rice dish similar to Arab [[kabsah]].

[[File:Kwarastatedrummers.jpg|thumb|[[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] [[drum]]mers at celebration in Ojumo Oro, [[Kwara State]], [[Nigeria]]]]
Traditional Sub-Saharan African music is as diverse as the region's various populations. The common perception of Sub-Saharan African music is that it is rhythmic music centered on the drums, and indeed, a large part of Sub-Saharan music, mainly among speakers of [[Niger–Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], is rhythmic and centered on the drum. Sub-Saharan music is polyrhythmic, usually consisting of multiple rhythms in one composition. Dance involves moving multiple body parts. These aspects of Sub-Saharan music were transferred to the new world by enslaved Sub-Saharan Africans and can be seen in its influence on music forms as [[Samba]], [[Jazz]], [[Rhythm and Blues]], [[Rock & Roll]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]], and [[Rap]] music.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bowden, Rob(2007). Africa South of the Sahara. Coughlan Publishing: p. 40, {{ISBN|1-4034-9910-1}}.</ref>

Other African musical traditions also involve strings, horns, and very little poly-rhythms. Music from the eastern Sahel and along the Nile, among the [[Nilo-Saharan]], made extensive use of strings and horns in ancient times. Dancing involve swaying body movements and footwork. Among the [[Khoisan]]s extensive use of string instruments with emphasis on footwork.<ref>[[Christopher Ehret]], (2002). The Civilizations of Africa. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, p. 103, {{ISBN|0-8139-2085-X}}.</ref>

Modern Sub-Saharan African music has been influenced by music from the New World (Jazz, Salsa, Rhythm and Blues etc.). Popular styles include [[Mbalax]] in [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]], [[Highlife]] in [[Ghana]], [[Zoblazo]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Makossa]] in [[Cameroon]], [[Soukous]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Kizomba]] in [[Angola]], and [[Mbaqanga]] in [[South Africa]]. New World styles like Salsa, R&B/Rap, Reggae, and Zouk also have widespread popularity.

The region's art music has for centuries followed the outline of [[Arab classical music|Arabic]] and [[Andalusian classical music]]. Its popular contemporary genres include the [[Music of Algeria|Algerian]] [[Raï]]. [[Music of Somalia|Somali music]] is typically [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]], using five [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale such as the [[major scale]].<ref name="Mdacacos"/> In [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]], the music of the highlands uses a fundamental modal system called ''[[qenet]]'', of which there are four main modes: ''tezeta'', ''bati'', ''[[Ambassel scale|ambassel]]'', and ''anchihoy''.{{which lang|date=July 2020}}<ref name=Grove356>{{cite NewGrove2001|title=Ethiopia|last=Shelemay|first=Kay Kaufman|volume=viii|page=356}}</ref> Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor.<ref name="Barihun">[[Abatte Barihun]], liner notes of the album Ras Deshen, 200.</ref> Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as [[tizita]], a song of reminiscence.<ref name=Grove356 />

==Languages==
{{Main|Languages of Africa}}
The main ethnolinguistic divisions in Africa are [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] (North Africa, Horn of Africa), [[Niger–Congo]] (including speakers from the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branch) in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, [[Nilo-Saharan]] in parts of the [[Sahara]] and the [[Sahel]] and parts of [[Eastern Africa]], and [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] (indigenous minorities of [[Southern Africa]]).<ref>Greenberg, Joseph H. (1966). The Languages of Africa (2nd ed.). Bloomington: Indiana University.</ref> The continent of Africa speaks hundreds of languages, and if dialects spoken by various ethnic groups are also included, the number is much higher. These languages and dialects do not have the same importance: some are spoken by only few hundred people, others are spoken by millions. Among the most prominent languages spoken are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Very few countries of Africa use any single language and for this reason, several official languages coexist, African and European. Some Africans speak various European languages such as English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German and Dutch.
