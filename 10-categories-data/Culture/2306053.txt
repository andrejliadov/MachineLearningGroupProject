"'''Bart Sells His Soul'''" is the fourth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 8, 1995. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] scornfully dismisses the concept of the [[soul]], and to show he is serious in his [[skepticism]] he agrees to sell his soul to [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]]. However, after several strange events make him think he really has lost his soul, he desperately tries to regain it.

"Bart Sells His Soul" was written by [[Greg Daniels]], who was inspired by an experience from his youth where he had purchased a bully's soul. Director [[Wesley Archer]] and his team of animators visited [[Chili's]] for examples to use in Moe's family restaurant. The episode includes cultural references to the song "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]", by [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Chile]]an poet [[Pablo Neruda]], and a [[parody]] of [[Judy Blume]]'s book ''[[Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.]]''

Writers from the fields of [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[popular culture]], and [[psychology]] cited the episode in books discussing ''The Simpsons'' and the show's approach to the nature of the soul. 

The episode was positively received by the media, and is regarded as one of the series' best. The creative team of ''The Simpsons'' puts the episode among the top five best episodes of the series, and series creator [[Matt Groening]] cited "Bart Sells His Soul" as one of his favorite episodes. It has been used by secondary schools in religious education courses as a teaching tool.

==Plot==
As punishment for changing the church's opening hymn to "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida|In the Garden of Eden]]" by [[Iron Butterfly|I. Ron Butterfly]], [[Reverend Lovejoy]] makes [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] clean the [[Pipe organ|organ]] pipes; [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] is forced to help for snitching on Bart. After proclaiming there is no such thing as a [[soul]], Bart agrees to sell his to Milhouse for $5 on a piece of paper which reads "Bart Simpson's soul". [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] warns Bart that he will regret selling his soul, but he dismisses her fears.

Bart experiences several unusual phenomena, such as [[automatic door]]s refusing to open for him and no longer finding any humor in [[Itchy and Scratchy]]. He begins to fear that he really has lost his soul and tries to get it back from Milhouse, who refuses to return it for less than $50. After having a nightmare and being taunted by Lisa, Bart again desperately tries to persuade Milhouse to return his soul. Milhouse informs Bart that he traded the paper to [[Comic Book Guy]] at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop|Android's Dungeon]].

The next morning, Comic Book Guy tells Bart that he sold the piece of paper but refuses to reveal its new owner. Saddened, Bart walks home in the rain and prays to God for his soul in his bedroom. When a piece of paper with the words "Bart Simpson's soul" floats down from above, Bart discovers that Lisa bought his soul to return it to him. While she explains philosophers' views on the human soul, Bart eats the piece of paper, overjoyed at getting his soul back.

In the subplot, [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] tries to expand his [[customer base]] by turning his bar into a [[Types of restaurants#Family style|family]] [[theme restaurant]]. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him, and he soon snaps at a little girl. The horrified customers abandon the restaurant, forcing Moe's to revert to a run-down tavern.

==Production==
"Bart Sells His Soul" was the second episode to have [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] as executive producers. Oakley and Weinstein wanted to start the season with episodes that had an emotional bias in an effort to center the Simpson family.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode was written by [[Greg Daniels]], who originally had an idea for a plot that dealt with racism in Springfield. The writers did not think ''The Simpsons'' was the right forum for it, so Daniels suggested the idea of selling someone's soul, which originated in his childhood.<ref name="Weinstein"/> In [[high school]], Daniels encouraged a bully to sell him his soul for 50 cents, and then convinced classmates to frighten the bully into buying his soul back for an inflated price. Daniels repeated this ploy, but stopped when he realized that the only other person in history who has profited off others' souls was [[Satan]], and that "scared" him.<ref name="Daniels">{{cite video | people=Daniels, Greg|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In the opening scene of the episode, the congregation of the First Church of Springfield are tricked into singing "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In a Gadda Da Vida]]" by [[Iron Butterfly]]. Daniels had originally intended for the song to be "[[Jesus He Knows Me]]" by British rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], but the producers were unable to obtain the rights for it to be featured in the episode.<ref name="Daniels"/>

The episode was directed by [[Wesley Archer]]. Archer and his team of animators went to the restaurant chain [[Chili's]] to get inspiration for the background designs of Moe's family restaurant. He said it was "quite a task" to transform Moe's Tavern into a family-oriented establishment. Archer added that he was not "quite happy" with the result, and that they could have designed it "a little better".<ref name="Archer">{{cite video | people=Archer, Wesley|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Weinstein recalled that there was contention between the animators about the way Moe looked in the episode. Moe's original design includes a missing tooth, but Weinstein and Oakley felt that it did not "look right" because Moe was such a prominent character in the episode.<ref name="Weinstein" /> Archer showed the original design of Moe from the first season to the show runners, and said: "Here, look. He's got a missing tooth!", but the scenes that had Moe with a missing tooth in them were still reanimated.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Sells His Soul"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Archer was disappointed with the dream sequence in which Bart sees his friends playing with their souls. Archer said that he had forgotten to tell the animators to make the souls transparent, so they were painted blue instead.<ref name="Archer"/> [[George Meyer]] pitched the joke restaurant title "The Texas Cheesecake Depository."<ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=73|location=New York City}}</ref>

==Themes==
Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'' that "a good deal of enjoyment" is to be had from the episode, due to "the exposure of the hypocrisy behind 'the finance of salvation' and the ambivalent operations of the commercial world".<ref name="alberti">{{cite book  | last =Koenigsberger  | first =Kurt M.  | editor =Alberti, John  | title =[[Leaving Springfield: the Simpsons and the possibility of oppositional culture]]  | publisher =Wayne State University Press  | year =2003  | pages =[https://archive.org/details/leavingspringfie00albe/page/49 49, 55]  | isbn =0-8143-2849-0  }}</ref> [[Don Cupitt]], a fellow of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], believes that when Lisa lectures Bart about the soul, she "shows a degree of theological sophistication which is simply not tolerated in Britain."<ref name="cupitt">{{cite news   | last =Cupitt  | first =Don  | title =Face to Faith: The Simpsons in search of Jesus  | work =[[The Guardian]]  | date =February 24, 2001  }}</ref> Paul Bloom and David Pizarro wrote in ''[[The Psychology of The Simpsons]]'' that although Lisa does show "healthy religious skepticism" she still believes in an eternal soul.<ref name="brown" /> However, Lisa tells Bart at the end of the episode, "some philosophers believe that no one is born with a soul, you have to earn one through suffering".<ref name="brown" /> Bloom and Pizarro acknowledge: "Indeed, some philosophers and theologians say that without belief in a soul, one cannot make sense of the social concepts on which we rely, such as [[Moral responsibility|personal responsibility]] and [[Free will|freedom of the will]]."<ref name="brown">{{cite book  | last =Brown  | first =Alan S.  |author2=Chris Logan  | title =[[The Psychology of The Simpsons: D'oh!]]  | publisher =BenBella Books, Inc.  | year =2006  | page =73  | isbn = 1-932100-70-9}}</ref>

He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that "life suddenly feels empty and incomplete" without a soul, which suggests "either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction".<ref name="booker" /> Mark I.

In ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] quotes Bart's revelation to Lisa that he sold his soul to Milhouse for five dollars and used the money to buy sponges shaped like dinosaurs.{{sfn|Turner|2005|p=125}} After Lisa criticizes Bart for selling his soul, Bart responds: "Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks."{{sfn|Turner|2005|p=125}} Turner comments: "Here Bart is the epitome of the world-weary hipster, using the degraded language of modern marketing to sell off the most sacred parts of himself because he knows that some cheap sponge is more real, hence more valuable, than even the loftiest of abstract principles."{{sfn|Turner|2005|p=125}}

==Cultural references==
On the DVD [[audio commentary]] for the episode, writer Greg Daniels cited [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1985 film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' as an influence on Bart's night-time trek to retrieve his soul from Milhouse, only to experience a series of unusual encounters.<ref name="Daniels" /> Reverend Lovejoy leads his congregation in a hymnal version of the song "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]", by [[Iron Butterfly]],<ref name="goldmark">{{cite book  | last =Goldmark  | first =Daniel  |author2=Yuval Taylor  | title =The cartoon music book  | publisher =Chicago Review Press  | year =2002  | page =254  | isbn =1-55652-473-0 }}</ref> titled "In the Garden of Eden", by "I.

During an argument between Lisa and Bart, while discussing the relationship between laughter and the soul, Lisa quotes [[Chile]]an poet [[Pablo Neruda]], and Bart responds "I am ''familiar'' with the works of Pablo Neruda."<ref name="alberti" /> Kurt M. Koenigsberger comments in ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'': "While Bart may be familiar with the canon of Chilean poetry, the joke takes its force in part from the probability that ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> viewers are not."<ref name="alberti" /> Bart begins a prayer to God with "Are you there, God? It's me, Bart Simpson". This is an allusion to the book ''[[Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.]]'', by [[Judy Blume]].<ref name="alberti" /> During a piggyback fight with [[Dolph Starbeam]], [[Jimbo Jones]] exclaims, “I’m Master Blaster,” referencing the fearsome Thunderdome athlete from [[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|Mad Max III]].
The chalkboard gag is a reference to the advertising slogan of the lean mean grilling machine by George Foreman. 
The title of the ''[[The Itchy and Scratchy Show|Itchy and Scratchy Show]]'' episode “Skinless in Seattle” is a reference to the film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''.
