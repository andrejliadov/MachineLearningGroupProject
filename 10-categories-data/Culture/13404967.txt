'''Bashkeer Alighmani''' literally means German Towel or more precisely German Hand Towel. It is usually a [[cotton]] [[cloth]] measuring about 30&nbsp;cm by 90&nbsp;cm with black background and very colorful flowery design. It is worn as a head cover for women of some towns in [[Hauran]], specifically [[Ar Ramtha]] in North [[Jordan]]. 
It is thought to have been brought back from Germany in the 1970s when many Ramthan used to import used [[Mercedes-Benz]] cars from Germany. {{Dubious|date=January 2019}}
