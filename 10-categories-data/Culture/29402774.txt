The '''Arts Lab''' was an alternative arts centre, founded in 1967 by [[Jim Haynes]] at 182 [[Drury Lane]], London. Although only active for two years, it was influential in inspiring many similar centres in the UK, continental Europe and Australia, including the expanded [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) in London, the Milky Way/[[Melkweg]] in [[Amsterdam]] (where Jack Henry Moore was one of the founders),<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/23/jack-henry-moore-obituary Jack Henry Moore obituary], ''The Guardian'', 23 April 2014.</ref> the [[Frédéric Mitterrand|Entrepôt]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Yellow House Artist Collective]] founded by [[Martin Sharp]] in [[Sydney]].

==Drury Lane Arts Lab==
The Lab contained a 'soft floor' cinema in the basement designed and run by David Curtis. In the entrance there was a gallery space co-curated by Biddy Peppin (Curtis's partner) and [[Pamela Zoline]]. In a separate (but connected) warehouse was the theatre, designed by Jack Henry Moore, who initially co-directed the activities there. Both the cinema and theatre were constructed by David Jeffrey, whose partner, Philippa James, was closely involved in the Lab's day-to-day running. Upstairs, the space in front initially housed a film workshop put together by [[Malcolm Le Grice]] and students from [[St. Martin's School of Art]] and the [[London School of Film Technique]], and subsequently a restaurant run by [[Sue Miles|Susan Miles]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/13/sue-miles-obituary Sue Miles obituary], ''The Guardian'', 13 October 2010.</ref> Haynes lived in the back above the storage and dressing rooms. A number of other people lived in various corners of the building, and the all-night cinema was often seen as a cheap crash-pad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jim-haynes.com/life/index.htm |title=Jim Haynes biography. |access-date=29 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502062039/http://www.jim-haynes.com/life/index.htm |archive-date=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Such amenities made it perfect for live events and "[[happenings]]", and helped establish it as a centre of the London counterculture.

==Arts Lab movement==
One of the most significant features of the Arts Lab was that it encouraged similar establishments to create other independent centres, many of which outlived Haynes' original, which closed in the autumn of 1969. On 18 December 1968 the [[Bagism|Alchemical Wedding]] benefit for the Arts Lab and [[BIT (alternative information centre)|BIT alternative information centre]] took place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], and following it, on 25–26 January 1969, the Arts Lab Conference in [[Cambridge]] emphasized the strength of the Arts Lab movement, listing 50 such centres across the whole country, including the [[Birmingham Arts Lab]], [[Brighton Combination]]<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/sep/23/noel-greig-obituary Noel Greig obituary], ''The Guardian'', 23 September 2009.</ref> and centres in [[Exeter]], [[Farnham]], [[Guildford]], [[Huddersfield]], [[Loughborough]], [[Manchester]], [[Southampton]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Swindon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCLOIhHTAE4C&pg=PA96&dq=%22jim+haynes%22+%22arts+lab+conference%22&hl=en&ei=xu7LTN_hNNHPjAeek-jWBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22jim%20haynes%22%20%22arts%20lab%20conference%22&f=false "Summer of love: psychedelic art, social crisis and counterculture in the 1960s"  By Christoph Grunenberg, Jonathan Harris, Tate Gallery Liverpool]</ref>

In London, a [[New Arts Lab]] (also titled 'Institute for Research in Art and Technology') was founded by a breakaway group of original members and others, including the [[London Film-Makers' Co-op]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxonline.org.uk/history/1960-1969/drury_lane_arts_lab.html |title=LuxOnline - Drury Lane Arts Lab + IRAT |access-date=30 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618174809/http://www.luxonline.org.uk/history/1960-1969/drury_lane_arts_lab.html |archive-date=18 June 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Housed between 1969 and 1971 in a short-life factory building in Robert Street, London NW1, it contained a cinema run by David Curtis, theatre and gallery spaces, the London Film Makers' Co-op workshop, [[John Hopkins (political activist)|John Hopkins]]'s TVX, and a printing workshop run by John Collins.
