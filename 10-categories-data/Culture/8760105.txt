The '''raven banner''' ({{lang-non|hrafnsmerki}}; {{lang-enm|hravenlandeye}}) was a [[flag]], possibly [[totem]]ic in nature, flown by various [[Viking]] chieftains and other [[Scandinavia]]n rulers during the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries. The flag, as depicted in [[Norse art]]work, was roughly triangular, with a rounded outside edge on which there hung a series of tabs or tassels. It bore a resemblance to ornately carved "weather-vanes" used aboard Viking [[longship]]s.

Scholars conjecture that the  raven flag was a symbol of [[Odin]], who was often depicted accompanied by two ravens named [[Huginn and Muninn]].  Its intent may have been to strike fear in one's enemies by [[invocation|invoking]] the power of Odin. As one scholar notes regarding encounters between the [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity|Christian]] [[Anglo-Saxons]] and the invading [[Norse paganism|pagan]] Scandinavians:

{{quote|The Anglo-Saxons probably thought that the banners were imbued with the evil powers of [[idolatry|pagan idols]], since the Anglo-Saxons were aware of the significance of Óðinn and his ravens in [[Norse mythology]].<ref>Hrafnhildur Bodvarsdottir (1976) p. 112.</ref>}}

The [[raven]] is a common iconic figure in [[Norse mythology]]. The highest god [[Odin]] had two ravens named Huginn and Muninn ("[[thought]]" and "[[memory]]" respectively) who flew around the world bringing back tidings to their master. Therefore, one of [[List of names of Odin|Odin's many names]] was the "raven god" (''Hrafnaguð''). In ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' (c. 1220), the medieval Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] explains:
<br />
{|cellpadding=3
| lang="non" style="font-style: italic;" |
Hrafnar tveir sitja á öxlum honum ok segja í eyru honum öll tíðendi, þau er þeir sjá eða heyra. Þeir heita svá, Huginn ok Muninn. Þá sendir hann í dagan at fljúga um heim allan, ok koma þeir aftr at dögurðarmáli. Þar af verðr hann margra tíðenda víss. Því kalla menn hann Hrafnaguð, svá sem sagt er:
: Huginn ok Muninn
: fljúga hverjan dag
: jörmungrund yfir;
: óumk ek Hugin,
: at hann aftr né komi,
: þó sjáumk ek meir of Munin."<ref>[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/snorre/gylfaginning.php ''Gylfaginning'' at «Norrøne Tekster og Kvad»] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20070508181728/http%3A//www.heimskringla.no/original/snorre/gylfaginning.php |date=2007-05-08 }}, Norway.</ref>

Two ravens sit on Odin's shoulders, and bring to his ears all that they hear and see. Their names are Huginn and Muninn. At dawn he sends them out to fly over the whole world, and they come back at breakfast time. Thus he gets information about many things, and hence he is called Rafnagud (raven-god). As is here said:
: Huginn and Muninn
: Fly every day
: Over the great earth.
: I fear for Hugin
: That he may not return,
: Yet more am I anxious for Munin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose2/012.php|title=Rasmus B. Anderson's translation at the Northvegr foundation.}}</ref>

Odin was also closely linked to ravens because in Norse myths he received the fallen warriors at [[Valhalla]], and ravens were linked with death and war due to their predilection for [[carrion]]. It is consequently likely that they were regarded as manifestations of the [[Valkyrie]]s, goddesses who chose the valiant dead for military service in Valhalla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/valkyrie.shtml|title=Viking Answer Lady Webpage - Valkyries, Wish-Maidens, and Swan-Maids|website=www.vikinganswerlady.com}}</ref>
A further connection between ravens and Valkyries was indicated in the [[shapeshifting]] abilities of goddesses and Valkyries, who could appear in the form of birds.<ref>Examples of this occur in ''[[Þrymskviða]]'', stanzas 3 and 4, when [[Freya]] lends her bird fetch to [[Loki]]; and in the Valkyrie Kára of whom an account survives in ''[[Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''.</ref>

The raven appears in almost every [[skaldic poetry|skaldic poem]] describing warfare.<ref name="Hjelmquist1">Hjelmquist 142.</ref> To make war was to feed and please the raven (''hrafna seðja'', ''hrafna gleðja'').<ref name="Hjelmquist1"/> An example of this is found in ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'', where [[Regin]] recites the following poem after [[Sigurd]] kills the sons of [[Helgi Hundingsbane|Hunding]]:

[[File:Isle of Man coat of arms.svg|thumb|The [[coat of arms of the Isle of Man]], a formerly Norse-dominated kingdom; note the supporting raven on the right.]]
Above all, [[kenning]]s used in Norse poetry identify the raven as the bird of blood, corpses and battle;<ref name="Hjelmquist2">Hjelmquist 143.</ref> he is the gull of the wave of the heap of corpses, who screams dashed with hail and craves morning steak as he arrives at the sea of corpses (''{{lang|non|Hlakkar hagli stokkin már valkastar báru, krefr morginbráðar er kemr at hræs sævi}}'').<ref name="Hjelmquist3">Hjelmquist citing ''Fornmanna sögur III'' p. 148, in Hjelmquist 143.</ref>

In black flocks, the ravens hover over the corpses and the [[skald]] asks where they are heading (''{{lang|non|Hvert stefni þér hrafnar hart með flokk hinn svarta}}'').<ref name="Hjelmquist4">In a poem by Þórðr in ''[[Bjarnar Saga Hitdælakappa]]'', p. 67, cited in Hjelmquist 143.</ref> The raven goes forth in the blood of those fallen in battle (''{{lang|non|Ód hrafn í valblóði}}'').<ref name="Hjelmquist5">Stanza 2, in ''[[Krákumál]]'', cited in Hjelmquist 143.</ref> He flies from the field of battle with blood on his beak, human flesh in his talons and the reek of corpses from his mouth (''{{lang|non|Með dreyrgu nefi, hold loðir í klóum en hræs þefr ór munni}}'').<ref name="Hjelmquist6">Stanza 2 and 3, in ''[[Haraldskvæði]]'', cited in Hjelmquist 143.</ref>
The ravens who were the messengers of the highest god, [[Huginn and Muninn]], increasingly had hellish connotations, and as early as in the Christian ''[[Sólarljóð]]'', stanza 67, the ravens of [[Hel (location)|Hel(l)]] (''heljar hrafnar'') who tear the eyes off backtalkers are mentioned.<ref name="Hjelmquist2"/> Two curses in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' say "may ravens tear your heart asunder" (''{{lang|non|Þit skyli hjarta rafnar slíta}}'').<ref>in stanza 8 of ''[[Guðrúnarkviða II]]'' cited in Hjelmquist 144.</ref> and "the ravens shall tear out your eyes in the high gallows" (''{{lang|non|Hrafnar skulu þér á hám galga slíta sjónir ór}}'').<ref>In stanza 45 in ''[[Fjölsvinnsmál]]'' cited in Hjelmquist 144.</ref> Ravens are thus seen as instruments of divine (if harsh and unpleasant) [[Divine judgment|justice]].

Despite the violent imagery associated with them, early Scandinavians regarded the raven as a largely positive figure; battle and harsh justice were viewed favorably in Norse culture.<ref>''E.g., Woolf 63–81; Poole ''passim''.</ref> Many [[Old Norse]] personal names referred to the raven, such as Hrafn,<ref>''E.g., [[Gunnlaugs saga]] passim; [[Reykdæla saga ok Víga-Skútu]]'' §13.</ref> Hrafnkel<ref>''E.g., [[Hrafnkels saga]] passim''.</ref> and Hrafnhild.<ref>''E.g., [[Ketils saga hœngs]] § 3.''</ref>

==Usage==
===Late 9th century===
The raven banner was used by a number of Viking warlords regarded in [[Saga|Norse tradition]] as the sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]]. The first mention of a Viking force carrying a raven banner is in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''. For the year 878, the ''Chronicle'' relates:
<blockquote>And in the winter of this same year the brother of [[Ivar the Boneless|Ivar]] and [[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] landed in [[Wessex]], in [[Devon]]shire, with 23 ships, and there was he slain, and 800 men with him, and 40 of his army. There also was taken the war-flag ([[Gonfalon|guðfani]]), which they called "Raven".</blockquote>
The 12th-century ''[[Annals of St Neots]]'' claims that a raven banner was present with the [[Great Heathen Army]] and adds insight into its [[seiðr]]- (witchcraft-) influenced creation and totemic and [[oracle|oracular]] nature:
{|
| lang="la" style="font-style: italic;" |
Dicunt enim quod tres sorores Hynguari et Hubbe, filie uidelicet Lodebrochi, illud uexillum tex'u'erunt et totum parauerunt illud uno meridiano tempore. Dicunt etiam quod, in omni bello ubi praecederet idem signum, si uictoriam adepturi essent, appareret in medio signi quasi coruus uiuus uolitans; si uero uincendi in futuro fuissent, penderet directe nichil mouens — et hoc sepe probatum est<ref>''Annals of St Neots'' (878), ed. Dumville and Lapidge, p. 78.</ref>
|
It is said that three sisters of Hingwar and Habba [Ivar and [[Ubba|Ubbe]]], i.e., the daughters of [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Loðbrok]], had woven that banner and gotten it ready during one single midday's time. Further it is said that if they were going to win a battle in which they followed that signum, there was to be seen, in the center of the signum, a raven, gaily flapping its wings. But if they were going to be defeated, the raven dropped motionless. And this always proved true.<ref>Lukman 141</ref><ref>Cf. Grimm's earlier edition and translation: {{lang|la|[V]exillum quod reafan vocant. Dicunt enim quod tres sorores Hungari et Habbae, filiae videlicet Lodebrochi illud vexillum texuerunt, et totum paraverunt illud uno meridiano tempore. Dicunt etiam quod in omni bello, ubi praecederet idem signum, si victoriam adepturi essent, appareret in medio signi quasi corvus vivus volitans; sin vero vincendi in futuro fuissent, penderet directe nihil movens: et hoc saepe probatum est.}} "The daughters of Loðbrók had woven that banner and finished it during one single midday's time. It also is said that in any battle where the ''signum'' was borne before them, if they were to win victory one would see in the middle of the signum a living raven flying; but if they were about to be defeated, it hung straight and still." Grimm ch. 35</ref>

[[Geoffrey Gaimar|Geffrei Gaimar]]'s ''[[Estoire des Engleis|Estorie des Engles]]'' (written around 1140) mentions the Hrafnsmerki being borne by the army of [[Ubba|Ubbe]] at the [[Battle of Cynwit]] (878): "[t]he Raven was Ubbe's banner (gumfanun). He was the brother of Iware; he was buried by the vikings in a very big mound in Devonshire, called Ubbelawe."<ref>Lukman, 141–42.</ref>

===10th century===
[[File:Penny (Triqueta and Raven Banner) of Amlaib Cuaran.png|thumb|Possible depiction of the raven banner on the reverse of a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran (940s).{{cn|date=September 2013}}]]
[[File:Penny Raven Amlaib Cuaran.png|thumb|150px|A "raven, wings displayed" on a [[Raven Banner Penny|penny]]  minted by Olaf Cuaran (940s), "appears to represent the Viking war standard, the ''raven'', probably derived from the Roman ''[[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]]''."<ref>Herbert Appold Grueber, ''Handbook of the coins of Great Britain and Ireland in the British Museum''. London/Oxford: British Museum. Dept. of Coins and Medals & the Clarendon Press, 1899, p. 20 (no. 117). </ref>]]

In the 10th century, the raven banner seems to have been adopted by [[Norse–Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] kings of  [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[Kings of Northumbria#Kings of Northumbria in the Norse era|Northumbria]].{{or|date=September 2013}}
Many of the Norse-Gaelic dynasts in Britain and Ireland were of the [[Uí Ímair]] clan, which claimed descent from Ragnar Lodbrok through his son Ivar.
A triangular banner appearing to depict a bird (possibly a raven){{or|date=September 2013}} appears on a [[penny]] minted by [[Olaf Cuaran]] around 940. The coin features a roughly [[Special right triangles#45–45–90 triangle|right isosceles triangular]] standard, with the two [[equilateral]] sides situated at the top and staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by what appears to be a [[Christian cross|cross]];{{or|date=September 2013}} this may indicate a fusion of [[Norse paganism|pagan]] and Christian symbolism.{{or|date=September 2013}}

The raven banner was also a [[War flag|standard]] used by the Norse [[Earl of Orkney|Jarls of Orkney]]. According to the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', it was made for [[Sigurd the Stout]] by his mother, a [[völva]] or shamanic seeress. She told him that the banner would "bring victory to the man it's carried before, but death to the one who carries it." The saga describes the flag as "a finely made banner, very cleverly embroidered with the figure of a raven, and when the banner fluttered in the breeze, the raven seemed to be flying ahead." Sigurd's mother's prediction came true when, according to the sagas, all of the bearers of the standard met untimely ends.<ref>''Orkneyinga Saga'' § 11.</ref> The "curse" of the banner ultimately fell on Jarl Sigurd himself at the [[Battle of Clontarf]]:
<blockquote>
Earl Sigurd had a hard battle against [[Kerthialfad]], and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all who were in the front rank, and he broke the array of Earl Sigurd right up to his banner, and slew the banner-bearer. Then he got another man to bear the banner, and there was again a hard fight. Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of [[Hall of Sida]], to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then [[Asmund the White]] said, "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." "[[Hrafn the Red]]!" called out Earl Sigurd, "bear thou the banner." "Bear thine own devil thyself," answered Hrafn. Then the earl said, "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" and with that he took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak. A little after Asmund the White was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear.<ref name="Njal's Saga §156">Njal's Saga §156.</ref>
</blockquote>

===Early 11th century===
[[File:Raven banner (Bayeux Tapestry).jpg|thumb|Detail from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], showing a Norman knight carrying what appears to be a raven banner.]]
The army of King [[Cnut the Great]] of England, Norway and Denmark bore a raven banner made from white [[silk]] at the [[Battle of Ashingdon]] in 1016. The ''[[Encomium Emmae]]'' reports that Cnut had
<blockquote>a banner which gave a wonderful omen. I am well aware that this may seem incredible to the reader, but nevertheless I insert it in my veracious work because it is true: This banner was woven of the cleanest and whitest silk and no picture of any figures was found on it. In case of war, however, a raven was always to be seen, as if it were woven into it. If the Danes were going to win the battle, the raven appeared, beak wide open, flapping its wings and restless on its feet. If they were going to be defeated, the raven did not stir at all, and its limbs hung motionless.<ref>Trætteberg 549–55.</ref> </blockquote>

The ''Lives of [[Waltheof, 1st Earl of Northampton|Waltheof]] and his Father [[Siward, Earl of Northumbria|Sivard Digri]] (The Stout), the Earl of Northumberland'', written by a monk of [[Crowland Abbey]] (possibly the [[English people|English]] historian [[William of Ramsey]]), reports that the [[Danish people|Danish]] [[Jarl (title)|jarl]] of [[Northumbria]], Sigurd, was given a banner by an unidentified old sage. The banner was called ''Ravenlandeye.''<ref>Lukman 148. The Crowland author comments on the name of the banner, ''"quod interpretatur corvus terrae terror,"'' "which means Raven, terror of the land."</ref>

According to the [[Heimskringla]], [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardrada]] had a standard called ''Landøyðan'' or "Land-waster." This is often assumed to be a raven banner based on the similarity of its name to Sigurd of Northumbria's "''Ravenlandeye,''" though there is no direct evidence connecting Harald's standard with ravens. In a conversation between Harald and King [[Sweyn II of Denmark]],

<blockquote>
Sveinn asked Haraldr which of his possessions of his he valued most highly. He answered that it was his banner (merki), ''Landøyðan''. Thereupon Sveinn asked what virtue it had to be accounted so valuable. Haraldr replied that it was prophesied that victory would be his before whom this banner was borne; and added that this had been the case ever since he had obtained it. Thereupon Sveinn said, "I shall believe that your flag has this virtue if you fight three battles with King Magnús, your kinsman, and are victorious in all."<ref>''Haralds saga Sigurðarsonar'' § 22.</ref>
</blockquote>
Years later, during Harald's invasion of [[England]], Harald fought a pitched battle against two English earls outside [[York]]. Harald's Saga relates that
<blockquote>
when King Haraldr saw that the battle array of the English had come down along the ditch right opposite them, he had the trumpets blown and sharply urged his men to the attack, raising his banner called Landøyðan. And there so strong an attack was made by him that nothing held against it.<ref>''Haralds saga Sigurðarsonar'' § 85.</ref>
</blockquote>
[[File:Bayeux raven banner 2.png|thumb|Detail from the Bayeux tapestry, showing a broken raven banner lying on the ground.]]

Harald's army flew the banner at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], where it was carried by a warrior named Frírek. After Harald was struck by an arrow and killed, his army fought fiercely for possession of the banner, and some of them went [[berserkr|berserk]] in their frenzy to secure the flag. In the end the "magic" of the banner failed, and the bulk of the Norwegian army was slaughtered, with only a few escaping to their ships.<ref>''Haralds saga Sigurðarsonar'' § 88.</ref>

Other than the dragon banner of [[Olaf II of Norway]], the ''Landøyðan'' of Harald Hardrada is the only early Norwegian royal standard described by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the Heimskringla.<ref>Cappelen 34–37.</ref>

In two panels of the famous [[Bayeux tapestry]], standards are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by [[Bishop Odo]], the half-brother of [[William the Conqueror]]; as one of the combatants at the [[Battle of Hastings]], Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman [[cavalry charge]] against an English [[shield-wall]], a charging [[Normans|Norman]] knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of [[Harold Godwinson]]'s brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in [[Anglo-Saxon England]]) or whether they reflect an undocumented [[Norsemen|Norse]] presence in either the Norman or English army.<ref>Barraclough ''passim''. It should, of course, be noted that by 1066, all of the armies involved in hostilities in the [[British Isles]], Norwegian, English and Norman, were at least nominally Christian. The Normans were in many ways, including [[Norman language|linguistically]], quite far removed from their Norse origins.</ref>

==Modern reception==
Despite claims that the Hrafnsmerki was "the first European flag in the [[New World]]", there is no indication that it was ever carried as a universal flag of Scandinavians, and no source assigns it to the [[Vinland]] settlers (or any other [[Iceland]]ic or [[Greenland]]ic group).<ref>Engene 1–2; ''see also'' Barraclough ''passim''.</ref>

It is still used by some Danish army regiments, such as the shoulder sleeve insignia on the [[Guard Hussar Regiment (Denmark)|Guard Hussar Regiment]]'s 1st Battalion 1st Tank Squadron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sleeve Insignia GHR|url=https://www.arma-dania.dk/public/timeline/_md_genstande_view.php?editid1=1480|website=arma-dania.dk|access-date=19 February 2016|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1st Panzerbataljon|url=http://bojac.dk/stofm%C3%A6rker/gardehussarregimentet/1.%20panserbataljon.html|website=bojac.dk/|access-date=19 February 2016|language=da}}</ref>

The coat of arms of the [[Norwegian Intelligence Service]] features two ravens representing [[Huginn and Muninn]], the ravens providing the god Odin with information.<ref>[https://forsvaret.no/fakta/organisasjon/Etterretningstjenesten Norwegian Intelligence Service website, ''in Norwegian'']</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/09/09/546330.html |title=Mange vil bli spion |first=Kristoffer |last=Egeberg |date=10 September 2008 |work=Dagbladet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403015712/http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/09/09/546330.html |archive-date=3 April 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref>

In [[Shetland]] an alternative form of the banner (black raven on a rectangular, red field) is used as the symbol of [[Up Helly Aa]], a festival that celebrates the Islands' Norse heritage.

The Eastern Counties [[RFU]] adopted the raven as its badge in 1926. It was chosen as representing the heritage of the constituent counties – then Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex; now  Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire – as part of the [[Danelaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecrurugby.com/page/about-us/history/the-ecru-raven-8657/|title=About Us - History - The ECRU Raven|website=www.ecrurugby.com}}</ref>
