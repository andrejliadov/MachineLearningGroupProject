Bengali has developed over the course of more than 1,300 years. [[Bengali literature]], with its [[History of Bengali literature|millennium-old literary history]], has extensively developed since the [[Bengali Renaissance]] and is one of the most prolific and diverse literary traditions in Asia. The [[Bengali language movement]] from 1948 to 1956 demanding Bengali to be an official language of Pakistan fostered [[Bengali nationalism]] in [[East Bengal]]<!--Please note, the province was called "East Bengal," not "East Pakistan," at the time, during the Bengali Language Movement.--> leading to the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1999, [[UNESCO]] recognised [[Language Movement Day|21 February]] as [[International Mother Language Day]] in recognition of the language movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001177/117709E.pdf|title=Amendment to the Draft Programme and Budget for 2000–2001 (30 C/5)|year=1999|work=General Conference, 30th Session, Draft Resolution|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=27 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521161342/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001177/117709E.pdf|archive-date=21 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D28672%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html|title=Resolution adopted by the 30th Session of UNESCO's General Conference (1999)|work=International Mother Language Day|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=27 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601025416/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D28672%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html|archive-date=1 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Bengali language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and binds together a [[Culture of Bengal|culturally diverse]] region.

==History==
[[File:East-magadhan-proto-languages.png|thumb|left|width=500px|The descent of proto-Gauda, the ancestor of the modern Bengali language, from the proto-Gauda-Kamarupa line of the proto-Magadhan(Magadhi Prakrit).<ref>{{harvcol|Toulmin|2009|p=220}}</ref>]]

===Ancient===
Although [[Sanskrit]] was practised by Hindu [[Brahmins]] in [[Bengal]] since the [[first millennium BCE]], the local [[Buddhist]] population were speaking in some varieties of the [[Prakrit|Prakrita languages]]. These varieties generally referred to as "eastern [[Magadhi Prakrit]]", as coined by linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]],{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} as the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|Middle Indo-Aryan dialects]] were influential in the [[first millennium]] when Bengal was a part of the [[Magadha]]n realm. The local varieties had no official status during the [[Gupta Empire]], and with Bengal increasingly becoming a hub of [[Sanskrit literature]] for Hindu priests, the vernacular of Bengal gained a lot of influence from Sanskrit.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Bangla Script|author=Shariful Islam}}</ref> [[Magadhi Prakrit]] was also spoken in modern-day [[Bihar]] and [[Assam]], and this vernacular eventually evolved into [[Ardha Magadhi]].<ref name=jain>{{Harvnb|Shah|1998|p=11}}</ref><ref name=keith>{{Harvnb|Keith|1998|p=187}}</ref> Ardha Magadhi began to give way to what is known as [[Apabhraṃśa]], by the end of the first millennium. The Bengali language evolved as a distinct language by the course of time.<ref name="tb">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000
}}</ref>

===Early===
Along with other [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]], Bengali evolved circa 1000–1200 CE from Sanskrit and Magadhi Prakrit.<ref name="Oberlies2007">Oberlies, Thomas (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA161 "Chapter Five: Aśokan Prakrit and Pāli"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507095601/https://books.google.com/books?id=OtCPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA161 |date=7 May 2016 }}.

Some argue that the points of divergence occurred much earlier – going back to even 500, many argue the literature was lost during the medieval times, resulting in many words adopting silent letters. Including many vegetables.<ref>{{Harv|Sen|Siddhanta|1996}}</ref> but the language was not static: different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects in this period. For example, Ardhamagadhi is believed to have evolved into Abahatta around the 6th century, which competed with the ancestor of Bengali for some time.<ref name="abahatta">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php|title=Banglapedia|website=En.banglapedia.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> Proto-Bengali was the language of the [[Pala Empire]] and the [[Sena dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.britannica.com/topic/Pala-dynasty|title=Pala dynasty – Indian dynasty|website=Global.britannica.com|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305002609/https://global.britannica.com/topic/Pala-dynasty|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/dynasty/paladynasty.html|title=Pala Dynasty, Pala Empire, Pala empire in India, Pala School of Sculptures|last=nimmi|website=Indianmirror.com|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028151905/http://www.indianmirror.com/dynasty/paladynasty.html|archive-date=28 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Medieval===

During the medieval period, Middle Bengali was characterised by the [[elision]] of word-final {{lang|bn|অ}} ''ô'', the spread of compound verbs, and influence from the [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Turkic languages]]. The arrival of merchants and traders from the [[Middle East]] and [[Turkestan]] into the [[Buddhist]]-ruling [[Pala Empire]], from as early as the 7th century, gave birth to Islamic influence in the region. Starting with [[Bakhtiyar Khalji]]'s conquest in the 13th century, the subsequent Muslim expeditions to Bengal greatly encouraged the migratory movements of [[Arab Muslims]] and [[Turco-Persian tradition|Turco-Persian]]s, who heavily influenced the local vernacular by settling among the native population. Bengali became an official court language, for the first time ever, under the [[Sultans of Bengal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/cover-story/news/evolution-bangla-1705177|title=Evolution of Bangla|date=2019-02-21|website=The Daily Star|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> The Muslim rulers actively promoted the literary development of Bengali,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/DUJL/article/view/3344|title=Politics and Literary Activities in the Bengali Language during the Independent Sultanate of Bengal|first=AKM Golam|last=Rabbani|date=7 November 2017|journal=Dhaka University Journal of Linguistics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=151–166|accessdate=7 November 2017|via=www.banglajol.info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011123110/https://www.banglajol.info/index.php/DUJL/article/view/3344|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> allowing it to become the most spoken [[vernacular]] language in the Sultanate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=Richard M. |year=1993 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204–1760 |url=https://archive.org/details/riseofislambenga00eato |publisher=University of California |isbn=978-0-520-20507-9 |access-date=13 July 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Bengali gained many vocabulary from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], which cultivated a manifestation of [[Islamic culture]] on the language. Major texts of Middle Bengali (1400–1800) include [[Yusuf-Zulekha]] by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] and [[Shreekrishna Kirtana]] by the [[Chandidas]] poets.

===Modern===
The modern literary form of Bengali was developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries based on the dialect spoken in the [[Nadia district|Nadia region]], a west-central Bengali dialect. Bengali presents a strong case of [[diglossia]], with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language.<ref name="cornell">{{cite web |url=http://lrc.cornell.edu/asian/courses/bengali |title=Bengali Language at Cornell |website=Department of Asian Studies |publisher=Cornell University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115131805/http://lrc.cornell.edu/asian/courses/bengali |archive-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> The modern [[Bengali vocabulary]] contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, also [[tatsama]]s and reborrowings from Sanskrit and other major borrowings from [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Austroasiatic languages]] and other languages in contact with.

During this period, there were two main forms of written Bengali:
* {{lang|bn|চলিতভাষা}} ''Chôlitôbhasha''; colloquial form of Bengali using simplified inflections
* {{lang|bn|সাধুভাষা}} ''[[Sadhu bhasha|Sadhubhasha]]''; Sanskritised form of Bengali.<ref name="SKumar">{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/translation/articles/bengali-language.html|title=The Bengali Language and Translation|accessdate= 19 November 2006|last=Ray|first=S Kumar|work=Translation Articles|publisher=Kwintessential|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925204904/http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/translation/articles/bengali-language.html|archive-date=25 September 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Bengali language is native to the region of [[Bengal]], which comprises the present-day nation of [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].

Besides the native region it is also spoken by the Bengalis living in [[Tripura]], southern [[Assam]] and the Bengali population in the Indian union territory of [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Bengali is also spoken in the neighbouring states of [[Odisha]], [[Bihar]], and [[Jharkhand]], and sizeable minorities of Bengali speakers reside in Indian cities outside Bengal, including [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Thane]], [[Varanasi]], and [[Vrindavan]].

Regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a [[dialect continuum]]. Linguist [[Suniti Kumar Chattopadhyay]] grouped the dialects of eastern Magadhan languages into four large clusters that included Assamese and Oriya – [[Rarhi dialect|Rarh]], [[Bangali dialect|Banga]], [[Kamarupi Prakrit|Kamarupi]] and [[Varendri dialect|Varendra]];<ref name="huq_sarkar"/><ref>"Note that Chatterji’s classification of ‘Bengali dialects’ includes lects ancestral to both Asamiya and Oriya. However, Chatterji does not intend to classify these lects as dialects of Bangla. Therefore, Chatterji’s four dialects—Rāḍha, Varêndra, Vaŋga, and Kāmrupa—should not be termed ‘dialects of Bengali’ but rather, ‘dialects [in the sense of historical
derivatives] of eastern Magadhan’ (cf. Chatterji 1926:92ff.)." {{harvcol|Toulmin|2009|p=218}}</ref> but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.<ref name="morshed">{{cite web

In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh ([[Barisal Division|Barisal]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] and [[Sylhet Division]]s of Bangladesh), many of the stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] heard in [[West Bengal]] are pronounced as [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]. Western [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal affricates]] {{lang|bn|চ}} {{IPAblink|tɕ|tɕɔ}}, {{lang|bn|ছ}} {{IPAblink|ʰ|tɕʰɔ}}, {{lang|bn|জ}} {{IPAblink|dʑ|dʑɔ}} correspond to eastern {{lang|bn|চ}} {{IPA|[tsɔ]}}, {{lang|bn|ছ}} {{IPA|[tsʰɔ~sɔ]}}, {{lang|bn|জ}} {{IPA|[dzɔ~zɔ]}}. The influence of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalised vowels and an alveolar articulation of what are categorised as the "cerebral" consonants (as opposed to the postalveolar articulation of [[West Bengal]]). Some variants of Bengali, particularly [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] and [[Chakma language|Chakma]], have contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri]], Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, [[Hajong language|Hajong]] is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.<ref name="hajong">{{cite web

During the standardisation of Bengali in the 19th century and early 20th century, the cultural center of Bengal was in the city of [[Kolkata]], founded by the British. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the [[Rarhi dialect|West-Central dialect]] of [[Nadia District]], located next to the border of Bangladesh.<ref name="daniul">{{cite web

# ''[[Shadhu-bhasha]]'' ({{lang|bn|সাধুভাষা}} "uptight language") was the written language, with longer verb inflections and more of a [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]]-derived ''[[Tatsama]]'' vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' (by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) were composed in Shadhubhasha. However, use of Shadhubhasha in modern writing is uncommon, restricted to some official signs and documents in Bangladesh as well as for achieving particular literary effects.
# ''Cholito-bhasha'' ({{lang|bn|চলিতভাষা}} "running language"), known by linguists as Standard Colloquial Bengali, is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance of colloquial idiom and shortened verb forms, and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of [[Peary Chand Mitra]] (''[[Alaler Gharer Dulal]]'', 1857),<ref name="alal">{{cite web

It is modelled on the dialect spoken in the [[Shantipur]] region in [[Nadia district]], West Bengal. This form of Bengali is often referred to as the "Nadia standard", "Nadia dialect", "Southwestern/West-Central dialect" or "Shantipuri Bangla".<ref name="morshed"/>

Linguist [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] categorises the language as:
* Madhya Rādhi dialect
* Kanthi (Contai) dialect
* Kolkata dialect
* Shantipuri (Nadia) dialect
* Maldahiya (Jangipuri) dialect
* Barendri dialect
* Rangpuriya dialect
* Sylheti dialect
* Dhakaiya (Bikrampuri) dialect
* Jessor/Jessoriya dialect
* Barisal (Chandradwip) dialect
* Chattal (Chittagong) dialect

While most writing is in Standard Colloquial Bengali (SCB), spoken dialects exhibit a greater variety. People in southeastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in SCB. Other dialects, with minor variations from Standard Colloquial, are used in other parts of West Bengal and western Bangladesh, such as the [[Midnapore]] dialect, characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, a majority in Bangladesh speak in dialects notably different from SCB. Some dialects, particularly those of the [[Chittagong]] region, bear only a superficial resemblance to SCB.<ref name="ray89">{{Harvnb|Ray|Hai|Ray|1966|p=89}}</ref> The dialect in the Chittagong region is least widely understood by the general body of Bengalis.<ref name="ray89" /> The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] – often, speakers are fluent in ''Cholitobhasha'' (SCB) and one or more regional dialects.<ref name="SKumar" />

Even in SCB, the vocabulary may differ according to the speaker's religion: Muslims are more likely to use words of Persian and Arabic origin, along with more native words respectively whereas Hindus are more likely to use [[tatsama|words derived from Sanskrit]].<ref name=ray80>{{Harvnb|Ray|Hai|Ray|1966|p=80}}</ref> For example:<ref name=Banglabetelco>{{cite web

Bengali is known for its wide variety of [[diphthongs]], combinations of [[vowel]]s occurring within the same [[syllable]].<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=116}}</ref> Two of these, {{IPA|/oi̯/}} and {{IPA|/ou̯/}}, are the only ones with representation in script, as {{lang|bn|ঐ}} and {{lang|bn|ঔ}} respectively. {{IPA|/e̯ i̯ o̯ u̯/}} may all form the glide part of a diphthong. The total number of diphthongs is not established, with bounds at 17 and 31. An incomplete chart is given by Sarkar (1985) of the following:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Pabitra|title=Bangla diswar dhoni|date=1985|location=Bhasa}}</ref>

===Stress===
In standard Bengali, [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all [[trochee|trochaic]]; the primary stress falls on the initial [[syllable]] of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in {{lang|bn|সহযোগিতা}} '''''shô'''-hô-'''jo'''-gi-'''ta''''' "cooperation", where the '''boldface''' represents primary and secondary stress.

===Consonant clusters===
{{Main|Bengali consonant clusters}}

Native Bengali words do not allow initial [[consonant cluster]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Masica|1991|pp=125}}</ref> the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as {{lang|bn|গেরাম}} ''geram'' (CV.CVC) for {{lang|bn|গ্রাম}} ''gram'' (CCVC) "village" or {{lang|bn|ইস্কুল}} ''iskul'' (VC.CVC) for {{lang|bn|স্কুল}} ''skul'' (CCVC) "school".

=== Number system ===
Bengali numbers are written as follows.

[[Bengali-Assamese script]] is an [[abugida]], a script with letters for consonants, diacritics for vowels, and in which an [[inherent vowel]] (অ ''ô'') is assumed for consonants if no vowel is marked.<ref name="it46">{{cite web | url=http://www.it46.se/docs/courses/ICT4D_localization_software_primer_it46_v1.5.pdf | author=Escudero Pascual Alberto | title=Writing Systems/ Scripts | date=23 October 2005 | accessdate=20 November 2006 | work=Primer to Localization of Software | publisher=it46.se | archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090319013436/http://www.it46.se/docs/courses/ICT4D_localization_software_primer_it46_v1.5.pdf | archive-date=19 March 2009 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Bengali alphabet]] is used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India (Assam, West Bengal, Tripura). The Bengali alphabet is believed to have evolved from a modified [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic script]] around 1000 CE (or 10th–11th century).<ref name="akhor">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangalah Bangalah] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705234223/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangalah |date=5 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Note that despite Bangladesh being majority Muslim, it uses the Bengali alphabet rather than an [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic-based one]] like the [[Shahmukhi script]] used in Pakistan. However, throughout history there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in [[Perso-Arabic]]. The use of the [[Sylheti Nagari]] script also emerged in the [[Sylhet region]] of the Bengal.<ref name="bpedia" />

The Bengali script is a [[cursive]] script with eleven [[grapheme]]s or signs denoting nine vowels and two [[diphthong]]s, and thirty-nine graphemes representing [[consonant]]s and other modifiers.<ref name="akhor" /> There are no distinct [[Letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms. The letters run from left to right and spaces are used to separate [[Word#Orthography|orthographic words]]. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the graphemes that links them together called {{lang|bn|মাত্রা}} ''matra''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://banglasemantics.net/ |title=banglasemantics.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224112403/http://banglasemantics.net/ |archive-date=24 December 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Since the Bengali script is an abugida, its consonant graphemes usually do not represent phonetic [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], but carry an "inherent" vowel and thus are [[Syllable|syllabic]] in nature. The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either {{IPA|[ɔ]}} as in {{lang|bn|মত}} {{IPA|[m'''ɔ'''t]}} "opinion" or {{IPA|[o]}}, as in {{lang|bn|মন}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} "mind", with variants like the more open {{IPA|[ɒ]}}. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the ''[[virama|hôsôntô]]'' {{lang|bn|(্)}}, may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in {{lang|bn|ম্}} {{IPA|[m]}}). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a ''hôsôntô'', may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final {{lang|bn|ন}} in {{lang|bn|মন}} {{IPA|[m'''o'''n]}} or the medial {{lang|bn|ম}} in {{lang|bn|গামলা}} {{IPA|[ɡamla]}}).

A consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent {{IPA|[ɔ]}} is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel [[allography|allographs]] above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel [[typographic ligature]]s. These allographs, called {{lang|bn|কার}} ''kar'', are [[diacritic]]al vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph {{lang|bn|মি}} {{IPA|[mi]}} represents the consonant {{IPA|[m]}} followed by the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, where {{IPA|[i]}} is represented as the diacritical allograph{{lang|bn| ি}} (called {{lang|bn|ই-কার}} ''i-kar'') and is placed ''before'' the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs {{lang|bn|মা}} {{IPA|[ma]}}, {{lang|bn|মী}} {{IPA|[mi]}}, {{lang|bn|মু}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|মূ}} {{IPA|[mu]}}, {{lang|bn|মৃ}} {{IPA|[mri]}}, {{lang|bn|মে}} {{IPA|[me~mɛ]}}, {{lang|bn|মৈ}} {{IPA|[moj]}}, {{lang|bn|মো}} {{IPA|[mo]}} and {{lang|bn|মৌ}} {{IPA|[mow]}} represent the same consonant {{lang|bn|ম}} combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called "inherent" vowel {{IPA|[ɔ]}} is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign {{lang|bn|ম}} {{IPA|[mɔ]}}.

The vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in {{lang|bn|মই}} {{IPA|[moj]}} "ladder" and in {{lang|bn|ইলিশ}} {{IPA|[iliʃ]}} "Hilsa fish", the independent form of the vowel {{lang|bn|ই}} is used (cf. the dependent form{{lang|bn| ি)}}. A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.

In addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing ''hôsôntô'', three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed ''chôndrôbindu'' {{lang|bn|(ঁ)}}, denoting a suprasegmental for [[nasalisation]] of vowels (as in {{lang|bn|চাঁদ}} {{IPA|[tʃãd]}} "moon"), the postposed ''ônusbar'' {{lang|bn|(ং)}} indicating the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (as in {{lang|bn|বাংলা}} {{IPA|[baŋla]}} "Bengali") and the postposed ''bisôrgô'' {{lang|bn|(ঃ)}} indicating the [[voiceless glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[h]}} (as in {{lang|bn|উঃ!}} {{IPA|[uh]}} "ouch!") or the [[gemination]] of the following consonant (as in {{lang|bn|দুঃখ}} {{IPA|[dukʰːɔ]}} "sorrow").

The [[Bengali consonant clusters]] ({{lang|bn|যুক্তব্যঞ্জন}} ''juktôbênjôn'') are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist [[Bengali alphabet#Consonant conjuncts|a few visual formulas]] to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more "transparent" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new "transparent" and the old "opaque" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.

Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke {{lang|bn|।}} ''daṛi'' – the Bengali equivalent of a [[full stop]] – have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.<ref name="huq_sarkar" />

Unlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called {{lang|bn|মাত্রা}} ''matra''. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter {{lang|bn|ত}} ''tô'' and the numeral {{lang|bn|৩}} "3" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the ''matra'', as is the case between the consonant cluster {{lang|bn|ত্র}} ''trô'' and the independent vowel {{lang|bn|এ}} ''e''. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).

There is yet to be a uniform standard [[collating sequence]] (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.

===Orthographic depth===
The Bengali script in general has a comparatively [[orthographic depth|shallow orthography]], i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.

One kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,<ref name="huq_sarkar" /> and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters ({{lang|bn|শ}}, {{lang|bn|ষ}}, and {{lang|bn|স}}) for the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, although the letter {{lang|bn|স}} retains the [[voiceless alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|স্খলন}} {{IPA|[skʰɔlon]}} "fall", {{lang|bn|স্পন্দন}} {{IPA|[spɔndon]}} "beat", etc. The letter {{lang|bn|ষ}} also retains the [[voiceless retroflex sibilant]] {{IPA|[ʂ]}} sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in {{lang|bn|কষ্ট}} {{IPA|[kɔʂʈɔ]}} "suffering", {{lang|bn|গোষ্ঠী}} {{IPA|[ɡoʂʈʰi]}} "clan", etc. Similarly, there are two letters ({{lang|bn|জ}} and {{lang|bn|য}}) for the [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[dʒ]}}. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal {{lang|bn|ণ}} {{IPA|[ɳ]}} is now pronounced as an alveolar {{IPA|[n]}} when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another [[retroflex consonant]] such as {{lang|bn|ট}}, {{lang|bn|ঠ}}, {{lang|bn|ড}} and {{lang|bn|ঢ}}), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: {{lang|bn|এত}} {{IPA|[ɛto]}} "so much", {{lang|bn|এ্যাকাডেমী}} {{IPA|[ɛkademi]}} "academy", {{lang|bn|অ্যামিবা}} {{IPA|[ɛmiba]}} "amoeba", {{lang|bn|দেখা}} {{IPA|[dɛkʰa]}} "to see", {{lang|bn|ব্যস্ত}} {{IPA|[bɛsto]}} "busy", {{lang|bn|ব্যাকরণ}} {{IPA|[bɛkorɔn]}} "grammar".

Another kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or {{IPA|[o]}} depending on [[vowel harmony]] ({{lang|bn|স্বরসঙ্গতি}}) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in {{lang|bn|কম}} {{IPA|[kɔm]}} "less", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.

Many consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants {{lang|bn|ক্}} {{IPA|[k]}} and {{lang|bn|ষ}} {{IPA|[ʂ]}} is graphically realised as {{lang|bn|ক্ষ}} and is pronounced {{IPA|[kkʰɔ]}} (as in {{lang|bn|রুক্ষ}} {{IPA|[rukkʰo]}} "coarse") or {{IPA|[kkʰo]}} (as in {{lang|bn|ক্ষতি}} {{IPA|[kkʰoti]}} "harm") or even {{IPA|[kkʰɔ]}} (as in {{lang|bn|ক্ষমতা}} {{IPA|[kkʰɔmota]}} "capability"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.

===Uses===
The script used for Bengali, Assamese and other languages is known as [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. The script is known as the [[Bengali alphabet]] for Bengali and its dialects and the [[Assamese alphabet]] for [[Assamese language]] with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like the [[Meitei language]] in the Indian state of [[Manipur]], where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali alphabet for centuries, though the [[Meitei script]] has been promoted in recent times.

===Romanisation===
{{Main|Romanisation of Bengali}}

There are various Romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]] or IAST system (based on diacritics),<ref name="IAST1">{{cite web

In the context of Bengali [[romanisation]], it is important to distinguish [[transliteration]] from [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).

Although it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a [[phonemic orthography|phonemic transcription]], where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.

The most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, ''Abol Tabol'', ''Hasi Khusi'' and ''Sahoj Path'' in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Bengali grammar}}

Bengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives ([[inflection]]). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately [[declension|declined]] (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four [[grammatical case|cases]] while verbs are heavily [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.

===Word order===
As a [[Head-directionality parameter|head-final]] language, Bengali follows [[subject–object–verb]] [[word order]], although variations to this theme are common.<ref name="tb16">{{Harv|Bhattacharya|2000|pp=16}}</ref> Bengali makes use of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]], as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. [[Determiner]]s follow the [[noun]], while numerals, [[adjective]]s, and [[possession (linguistics)|possessors]] precede the noun.<ref name="UCLA1">{{cite web

 }}</ref>

Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional [[grammatical particle|particles]] (e.g. {{lang|bn|কি}} ''-ki'', {{lang|bn|না}} ''-na'', etc.) are often [[clitic|encliticised]] onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.

Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.

===Nouns===
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for [[declension|case]], including [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|objective]], [[genitive case|genitive (possessive)]], and [[locative case|locative]].<ref name="tb" /> The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of [[animacy]]. When a [[article (grammar)|definite article]] such as {{lang|bn|-টা}} ''-ṭa'' (singular) or {{lang|bn|-গুলো}} ''-gulo'' (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for [[grammatical number|number]].

In most of the Bengali grammar books, cases are divided into 6 categories and an additional possessive case (possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in terms of usages, cases are generally grouped into only 4 categories.

When counted, nouns take one of a small set of [[measure word]]s. Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word ('''MW'''), a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]], must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]] are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word {{lang|bn|-টা}} ''-ṭa'', though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. {{lang|bn|-জন}} ''-jôn'' for humans). There is also the classifier ''-khana,'' and its diminutive form ''-khani'', which attach only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descriptive grammar of Bangla|last=Boyle David|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2015|pages=141–142}}</ref>

Measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. {{lang|bn|আট বিড়াল}} ''aṭ biṛal'' instead of {{lang|bn|আট'''টা''' বিড়াল}} ''aṭ-'''ṭa''' biṛal'' "eight cats") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. {{lang|bn|শুধু এক'''জন''' থাকবে।}} ''Shudhu êk-'''jôn''' thakbe.'' (lit. "Only one-'''MW''' will remain.") would be understood to mean "Only one '''person''' will remain.", given the semantic class implicit in {{lang|bn|-জন}} ''-jôn''.

In this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to [[mass noun]]s.

===Verbs===
There are two classes of verbs: [[finite verb|finite]] and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (present, past, future), [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] (simple, perfect, progressive), and [[honorific|honour]] (intimate, familiar, and formal), but ''not'' for number. [[conditional mood|Conditional]], imperative, and other special inflections for [[grammatical mood|mood]] can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.

[[Inflection]]al suffixes in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in [[syntax]].

Bengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the [[zero copula]], where the [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] or connective ''be'' is often missing in the present tense.<ref name="huq_sarkar">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language Bangla language] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706032246/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Language |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Thus, "he is a teacher" is {{lang|bn|সে শিক্ষক}} ''se shikkhôk'', (literally "he teacher").<ref name="hacce-bangali">Among Bengali speakers brought up in neighbouring linguistic regions (e.g. Hindi), the lost copula may surface in utterances such as ''she shikkhôk hocche''. This is viewed as ungrammatical by other speakers, and speakers of this variety are sometimes (humorously) referred as "hocche-Bangali".</ref> In this respect, Bengali is similar to Russian and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]. [[Romani language|Romani]] grammar is also the closest to Bengali grammar.<ref name="hub1995">

==Vocabulary==
[[File:Bengali Vocabulary2.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Sources of modern literary Bengali words{{Legend|#FFCC99|67% native}}{{Legend|#993300|25% Sanskrit reborrowings}}{{Legend|#FF6666|8% indigenous and foreign loans}}]]
{{Main|Bengali vocabulary}}

Bengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 are considered [[Tadbhava]]s, 21,100 are [[Tatsama]]s and the remainder [[loanword]]s from [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] and other foreign languages.

However, these figures do not take into account the large proportion of archaic or highly technical words that are very rarely used. Furthermore, different dialects use more [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] vocabulary especially in different areas of Bangladesh and Muslim majority areas of [[West Bengal]]. Hindus, on the other hand, use more Sanskrit vocabulary than Muslims. While standard Bengali is based on the [[Bengali dialects|Nadia dialect]] spoken in the Hindu majority states of West Bengal, about 90% of Bengalis in Bangladesh (ca. 148 million) and 27% of Bengalis in West Bengal and 10% in Assam (ca. 36&nbsp;million) are Muslim and speak a more "persio-arabised" version of Bengali instead of the more Sanskrit influenced Standard [[Bengali dialects|Nadia dialect]]. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of tadbhavas, while tatsamas make up only 25% of the total.<ref name="bhoumick">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tatsama Tatsama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706010902/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tatsama |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref><ref name="bhoumick1">[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tadbhaba Tadbhaba] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706052525/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Tadbhaba |date=6 July 2015 }} in {{Harvnb|Asiatic Society of Bangladesh|2003}}</ref> Loanwords from non-Indic languages account for the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern [[Bengali literature]].

According to [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]], dictionaries from the early 20th century attributed about 50% of the Bengali vocabulary to native words (i.e., naturally modified [[Prakrit]] words, corrupted forms of [[Aryan]] words, and non-Indo-European languages). About 45% percent of Bengali words are unmodified Sanskrit, and the remaining words are from foreign languages.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bengali-language|title=Bengali language|access-date=2 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011103133/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bengali-language|archive-date=11 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Dominant in the last group was [[Persian language|Persian]], which was also the source of some grammatical forms. More recent studies suggest that the use of native and foreign words has been increasing, mainly because of the preference of Bengali speakers for the colloquial style.<ref name=":02" /> Because of centuries of contact with [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[Turkic peoples]], and [[Persians]], Bengali has absorbed numerous words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these borrowings into the core vocabulary.

The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. After close contact with several indigenous Austroasiatic languages,<ref>[[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] ''A Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali'', K.P.

Later, East Asian travellers and lately European [[colonialism]] brought words from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], French, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and most significantly English during the [[British Raj|colonial period]].
