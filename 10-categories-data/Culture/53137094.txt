==Content==
''The Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture'' deals with the issues of [[women's rights]] and the wearing of the [[hijab]] by [[Muslim]] women according to Islamic teachings and traditions. According to [[Babar Awan]], this is a "controversial subject" and has various effects both within Islamic societies and the West.<ref name="PK"/> It addresses the importance of [[hijab]] for Islamic societies and argues that a "society's culture determines its dress style".<ref name="Shahidian">{{cite book|last1=Shahidian|first1=Hammed|title=Women in Iran: Gender Politics in the Islamic republic|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=9780313314766|url=https://archive.org/details/womeniniran0000shah|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/womeniniran0000shah/page/195 195]|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|year=2002}}</ref> ''The Culture of Nakedness and the Nakedness of Culture'' discusses the effects of various factors on the form and size of clothing, without investigating those effects or discussing the quality and limits of clothing from a religious viewpoint. The relationship between Western clothing and culture, [[capitalism]] and clothing, historical backgrounds on nudity, the relationship between the hijab and Islamic culture, and the [[Westernization]] of traditional Japanese clothing, are among the subjects discussed in the book.<ref name="Fars">{{cite news|title=The book 'Culture of Nudity and Nudity of Culture' reached its 23th print|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13930318000731|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=Fars News}}</ref> Comparing "the dress philosophy in post-[[Renaissance]] Europe and non-Western societies", Haddad-Adel argues that "Western clothes are short and tight", while Eastern clothing is "long and loose", because these societies have "divergent notions of humankind".<ref name="Shahidian"/>

==Reception==
The book's launch event was held by the National Language Authority of [[Pakistan]]. According to Fateh Malik, Dean of Faculty, Islamic University of Pakistan, the book was much needed in Pakistan’s present socio-cultural environment.<ref name="PK"/> The book is described by Zahra Pamela Karimi, a professor of art history at [[UMass Dartmouth]],<ref name="FP">{{cite news|last1=Marya|first1=Hannun|title=A guide to Iran’s elite eight presidential candidates|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/23/a-guide-to-irans-elite-eight-presidential-candidates/|access-date=9 February 2017|work=[[Foreign Policy]]}}</ref> as one of the best examples articulating the anti "Western Pahlavi reforms and global influences" in Iran whose ideas were based on the "dichotomies of 'public' and 'private' and 'foreign' and 'local'".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Karimi|first1=Zahra Pamela|title=Domesticity and Consumer Culture in Iran: Interior Revolutions of the Modern Era|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780415781831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gRKGSjBwcwC&pg=PA156|access-date=6 February 2017|language=en|year=2013}}</ref> Haddad-Adel supports "the concealment of women's bodies as a way to protect the larger society from the manipulation of capitalism and imperialism", according to Pamela Karimi.
