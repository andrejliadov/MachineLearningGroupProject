'''Blue in Judaism''' is used to symbolise [[divinity]], because [[blue]] is the color of the sky and sea. It can also represent equilibrium, since its hue suggests a shade midway between white and black, day and evening.<ref>[[s:Translation:Mishnah/Seder Zeraim/Tractate Berakhot/Chapter 1/2|Mishnah Zeraim 1:2]]</ref>

==History==
From ancient times, blue has been considered a lucky color among the peoples of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. Not unlike their Arab neighbors, Jews of this region have painted their doorposts, heads, and other parts of their bodies with blue dyes; have ornamented their children with blue ribbons and markings; and have used this color in protective amulets.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PASL_g8JDqsC&q=doorposts%252C%2520heads%252C%2520and%2520other%2520parts%2520of%2520their%2520bodies&pg=PA22 |title=The Encyclopedia of Jewish Symbols |last1=Frankel |first1=Ellen |last2=Teutsch |first2=Betsy Platkin |date=1992 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9780876685945 |language=en}}</ref> Blue has been considered especially effective against the [[evil eye]].

In the [[Torah]], the [[Israelites]] were commanded to make tassels, ''[[tzitzit]]'', on the corners of their garments, and to weave within these tassles a "twisted thread of blue-violet ([[Tekhelet]])."<ref>[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 15:38.</ref> The [[Oral Torah|oral law]] requires that this blue thread be made from a dye extracted from a sea creature known in [[rabbinic literature]] as the ''á¸¤ilazon''. [[Maimonides]] claimed that this blue was the color of "the clear noonday sky"; [[Rashi]], the color of the evening sky.<ref>''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Tzitzit'' 2:1; Commentary on Numbers 15:38.</ref>

According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the color of God's Glory.<ref>''[[Numbers Rabbah]]'' 14:3; ''[[Hullin]]'' 89a.</ref>  Staring at this color aids in meditation, bringing us a glimpse of the "pavement of sapphire, like the very sky for purity," which is a likeness of the Throne of God.<ref>[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 24:10; [[Ezekiel]] 1:26; ''[[Hullin]]'' 89a.</ref> Many items in the ''[[Mishkan]]'', the portable sanctuary in the wilderness, such as the ''[[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]'', many of the vessels, and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], were covered with blue-violet cloth when transported from place to place.<ref>[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:6-12. None of the leading poskim, such as Rabbi [[Chaim Kanievsky]] have given their approval to the claims of the Ptil Tekhelet organisation. Many famous Jewish sages such as the Chazon Ish have maintained that the real colour will be rediscovered at certain time in human history. See "The Twelfth Article of Faith" by Maimonides.</ref>

According to the [[Zohar]] all colors that one sees in their dream are a good sign, except if they see the shade of blue that matches Tekhelet.<ref>Zohar I 51b</ref>

==In modern times==
The [[Flag of Israel]] has two blue stripes and a blue [[Star of David]] against a white background. An early [[Zionist]] poem explains that the color white symbolizes great faith; blue the appearance of the firmament.<ref>''"Zivei Eretz Yehudah"'' (1860), [[Ludwig August von Frankl]].</ref> Because of its association with the [[State of Israel]], blue has become very popular in contemporary Jewish design. Modern tallitot, especially those used by [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist]] Jews, often have blue stripes on a white background instead of black stripes common in [[Haredi]] communities.
