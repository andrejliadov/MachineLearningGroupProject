The '''Cambridge Ritualists''' were a recognised group of [[classical scholar]]s, mostly in [[Cambridge]], England, including [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], [[F.M. Cornford]], [[Gilbert Murray]] (actually from the [[University of Oxford]]), [[A. B. Cook]], and others. They earned this title because of their shared interest in [[ritual]], specifically their attempts to explain [[mythology|myth]] and early forms of [[classical drama]] as [[myth and ritual|originating in ritual]], mainly the ritual seasonal killings of ''eniautos daimon'', or the [[Year-King]].<ref>R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651</ref>  They are also sometimes referred to as the '''myth and ritual school''', or as the [[Classical Anthropologists]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/2152/24%282%29%2090-92.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|title=Folklore Forum|website=scholarworks.iu.edu}}</ref>

==Sacrifice and drama==
Inspired by ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', Gilbert Murray in 1913 proclaimed the killing of the year spirit as the "orthodox view of the origins of tragedy.  The year Daimon waxes proud and is slain by his enemy, who becomes thereby a murderer, and must in turn perish".<ref>Quoted in R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651</ref> A decade later, however, the excessively rigid application of Frazer's thesis to Greek tragedy had already begun to be challenged;<ref>R Fraser ed., ''The Golden Bough'' (Oxford 2009) p. 651</ref> and by the Sixties [[Robert Fagles]] could state that "The ritual origins of tragedy are totally in doubt, often hotly debated".<ref>R Fagles trans., ''The Oresteia'' (Penguin 1981) p. 18</ref>

==Influences==

Through their work in classical [[philology]], they exerted profound influence not only on the Classics, but on literary critics, such as [[Stanley Edgar Hyman]] or [[Northrop Frye]].<ref>N Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 108-9 and p. 171</ref> Particularly affected by [[Émile Durkheim]] was [[F. M. Cornford]], who used the French sociologist's notion of collective representations to analyze social forms of religious, artistic, philosophical, and scientific expression in [[classical Greece]]. Other significant influences on the group, particularly on Harrison, were [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[James Frazer]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calder |first1=William M. |title=Review of Robert Ackerman, ''The Myth and Ritual School: J.
