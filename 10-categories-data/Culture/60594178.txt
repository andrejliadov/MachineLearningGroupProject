{{short description|Type of restaurant}}
An '''all-day café''' is a dining establishment that generally serves distinct menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, switching from a casual, work-friendly atmosphere for breakfast and lunch to a more formal menu and setting in the evening.<ref name=bon>{{cite magazine |last1=Muhlke |first1=Christine |title=All Day Cafes Are Changing the Way We Eat Out |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/story/all-day-cafes-changing-the-way-we-eat |accessdate=26 April 2019 |magazine=[[Bon Appétit]] |date=15 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Burton |first1=Monica |title=Why All-Day Dining Is the Breakout Trend of 2017 |url=https://www.eater.com/2017/7/12/15927952/all-day-dining-restaurant-trends-2017 |accessdate=26 April 2019 |publisher=[[Eater (website)|Eater]] |date=12 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Crowley |first1=Chris |title=Why Do New York's Most Interesting New Restaurants All Feel Like Coffee Shops? |url=http://www.grubstreet.com/2017/08/nyc-all-day-restaurants.html |accessdate=26 April 2019 |publisher=Grub Street |date=17 August 2017}}</ref> The restaurants remain open between courses, offering drinks including coffee and food including pastries and small plates. All-day cafés tend to serve health-conscious menus, with an emphasis on vegetables. Several founders of all-day establishments have expressed a desire to provide a communal "[[third place]]" where, for instance, [[freelancers]] would feel comfortable.<ref name=TNY>{{cite magazine |last1=Goldfield |first1=Hannah |title=New York's All-Day Cafés Feed the Needs of the Gig Economy |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-diverse-pleasures-of-the-all-day-cafe |accessdate=26 April 2019 |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=27 March 2018}}</ref>
