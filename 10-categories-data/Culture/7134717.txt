{{Assamese/Asamiya literature}}'''Assamese literature''' ({{lang-as|অসমীয়া সাহিত্য|translit=ɔxɔmiya xaɦitjɔ|}}) is the entire corpus of poetry, novels, short stories, plays, documents and other writings in the [[Assamese language]]. It also includes the literary works in the older forms of the language during its evolution to the contemporary form and its cultural heritage and tradition. The literary heritage of the [[Assamese language]] can be traced back to the c. 9-10th century in the ''[[Charyapada]]'', where the earliest elements of the language can be discerned.<ref>"(T)he Charyapadas or ''dohas'' may be taken to be the starting point of Assamese language and literature." {{harvcol|Sarma|1976|p=44}}</ref>

Bani Kanta Kakti divides the history of Assamese literature into three prominent eras—[[Early Assamese]], [[Middle Assamese]] and [[Modern Assamese]]<ref>{{harvcol|Kakati|1953|pp=5–7}}</ref>—which is generally accepted.

{{Culture of Assam}}
{{main|Kamarupi Prakrit}}
The first reference to the language of Assam was found in the account of famous Chinese monk-cum-traveler [[Xuanzang]]. He visited the [[Kamarupa Kingdom]] during the reign of [[Kumar Bhaskara Varman]] of [[Varman dynasty]]. While visiting Kamrupa in seventh century, [[Xuanzang]] noted that the language of the region was slightly different from the language of Middle India ([[Magadha]]). He was able to identify the phonetic differences evident in the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Asamiya Sahityar Ruprekha (10th ed.)|last=Neog|first=Maheswar|publisher=Chandra Prakash|year=2008|location=Guwahati}}</ref> Even though systematic errors in the Sanskrit of [[Kamarupa inscriptions]] betray an [[Kamarupi Prakrit|underlying Pakrit]] in the pre-12th century period,<ref>{{Harv|Sharma|1978|pp=0.24-0.29}}</ref> scarce examples of the language exist.  The ''[[Charyapada]]''s, the Buddhist ballads of 8th-10th century some of whose composers were from [[Kamarupa]] and the language of which bear strong [[Charyapada#Affinities with Assamese|affitinities with Assamese]] (besides [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]]), are considered the first examples of Assamese literature.  The spirit of the ''Charyapadas'' are found in later-day ''Deh-Bicaror Geet'' and other aphorisms; and some of the ragas found their way to the 15th-16th century ''[[Borgeet]]s''.<ref name="Saikia 1997 5">{{Harv|Saikia|1997|p=5}}</ref> In the 12th-14th century period the works of Ramai Pundit (''Sunya Puran''), [[Boru Chandidas]] (''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana|Krishna Kirtan]]''), Sukur Mamud (''Gopichandrar Gan''), Durllava Mullik (''Gobindachandrar Git'') and Bhavani Das (''Mainamatir Gan'') bear strong grammatical relationship to Assamese; and their expressions and their use of ''adi-rasa'' are found in the later Panchali works of Mankar and Pitambar.<ref name="Saikia 1997 5"/>  These works are claimed as examples of [[Bengali literature]] as well. After this period of shared legacy, a fully differentiated Assamese literature finally emerged in the 14th century.

=== Medieval era ===
{{main|Early Assamese}}

==== Pre-Shankari literature (1300-1490 AD) ====
This period saw the flourishing of two kinds of literary activity: translations and adaptations, and choral songs.

=====Translations and adaptations=====
The earliest known Assamese writer of this period was [[Hema Saraswati]], whose well known works include ''Prahlad Charita'' and ''Hara Gauri Samvada.''<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Axomiya Xahityar Xamixhyatmak Itibritta (9th ed.)|last=Sarma|first=Satyendranath|publisher=Saumar Prakash|year=2009|location=Guwahati}}</ref> The story of the ''Prahlad Charita'' is taken from the [[Vamana Purana]] and the ''Hara Gouri Samvada'' includes the myth of Hara-Gouri marriage, birth of Kartik etc. Kaviratna Saravati's ''Jayadratha-vadha''; [[Rudra Kandali]]'s ''Satyaki-pravesa'' are prominent works of this era. [[Harivara Vipra]], a court poet of [[Kamata Kingdom]], composed ''Vavruvahanar Yuddha'' (based on the Mahabharata),<ref>example of language:<br>''age yena manusye laware kharatari <br> chaga buli baghar galata ache dhari <br> manusye erante galara nere baghe'' <br>"if a man runs fast <br> and catches hold of the neck of a tiger thinking it is only a goat <br> and then tries to leave it, the tiger would not let him go"</ref> ''Lava-Kushar Yuddha'' (based on the Ramayana) and ''Tamradwajar Yudha''. Though translated works, they contain local descriptions and embellishments, a feature that describes all translated work of this period. His ''Vavruvahanar Yuddha'', for instance makes references to articles of the [[Ahom kingdom]],<ref>References to ''camua'' (verse 176), ''cor'' (verse 57), and ''phura'' (verse 70) indicated that Vipra was either acquainted with the Ahom Kingdom, or even belonged there. {{harv|Neog|1953|p=34}}</ref> which at that time was a small kingdom in the east, and describes the undivided [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]] region,<ref>{{harv|Neog|1953|p=35}}</ref> and in ''Lava-Kushar Yuddha'' he departs from the original and describes local customs for Rama and Sita's ''[[pumsavana]]'' ceremony.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1953|p=39}}</ref>  All these works are associated with Durlabhanarayan of [[Kamata kingdom|Kamata]] and his immediate successors.{{History of literature by region or country}}The major work from this period that left a lasting impression is ''[[Saptakanda Ramayana]]'', composed by [[Madhava Kandali]] in verse, and recited<ref>The text indicates change overs from time to time (''madhava bolanta aita acho ehimana'', let me leave this here) and that the poet directed the course of the narration as the courtiers desired {{harv|Neog|1953|p=27}}.</ref> in the court of a 14th-century Barahi-Kachari king Mahamanikya (Mahamanikpha) who ruled either in the Nagaon or the Golaghat region.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1953|pp=24–26}}</ref>  In chronology, among vernacular translations of the original Sanskrit, Kandali's Ramayana comes after [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]]'s ([[Ramavataram|Tamil]], 12th century), and ahead of [[Krittibas Ojha|Kirttivas]]' ([[Krittivasi Ramayan|Bengali]], 15th century), [[Tulsidas]]' ([[Ramacharitamanasa|Awadhi]], 16th century), Balaram Das' (Oriya) etc.<ref>{{Harv|Saikia|1997|p=7}}</ref> Thus the [[Saptakanda Ramayana]] becomes the first rendition of the [[Ramayana]] into an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] in the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rāmāyaṇa from Gangā to Brahmaputra|last=Goswāmī, Māmaṇi Raẏachama, 1942-2011.|date=1996|publisher=B.R.

That his work was a major influence can be inferred from [[Sankardev]]a's tribute to the "Opromadi Kobi/ অপ্ৰমাদী কবি''" (''"unerring predecessor poet").<ref>''purvakavi apramadi madhav kandali adi''<br>
''        pade virachila rama katha''<br>
''hastira dekhiya lada sasa yena phure marga''<br>
''        mora bhaila tenhaya avastha.''</ref>
The ''pada'' form of metrical verse (14 syllables in each verse with identical two syllables at the end of each foot in a couplet) became a standard in Assamese ''kavya'' works, something that continued till the modern times.  Though a translated work, it is infused with local color, and instead of the heroic, Kandali instead emphasized the homely issues of relationships etc. Among the two kinds of ''alamkara's'', ''arthalankara''s were used extensively, with similes and metaphors taken from the local milieu even though the original works are set in foreign lands; whereas the ''shabdalankara'' (alliteration etc.) were rarely used.<ref>{{Harv|Sastry|1988|p=1694}}</ref>

In the pre-shankari era, a renowned mathematician, [[Bakul Kayastha]] from [[Kamarupa Kingdom]], compiled ''Kitabat Manjari(1434)'', which was a translation of the [[Līlāvatī]] by [[Bhāskara II]] into [[Assamese language|Assamese]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of India – Volume 23|last=Chopra|first=Pran Nath|publisher=Rima Publishing House|year=1992|pages=157}}</ref> ''Kitabat Manjari'' is a poetical treatise on [[Arithmetic]], [[Surveying]] and [[Bookkeeping]]. The book teaches how accounts are to be kept under different heads and how stores belonging to the royal treasury are to be classified and entered into a stock book. The works of [[Bakul Kayastha]] were regarded as standards in his time to be followed by other [[Kayastha]]s in maintaining royal accounts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings and transactions of the All-India oriental conference – Volume 23|year=1969|pages=174}}</ref>

===== Choral songs =====
Choral songs composed for a popular form of narration-performances called [[Ojapali|Oja-Pali]], a precursor to theater and theatrical performances, came to be known as ''Panchali'' works.<ref name="Saikia 1997 8">{{harv|Saikia|1997|p=8}}</ref> Though some of these works are contemporaneous to Sankardeva's, they hark back to older forms free of Sankardeva's influences and so are considered pre-Sankardeva literature.<ref>{{harv|Neog|1953|p=46}}</ref>  The ''Oja-palis'' follow two different traditions: ''biyah-gowa'' which tells stories from the Mahabharata and ''Maroi'', which tells stories on the snake goddess [[Manasa]].<ref name="Saikia 1997 8"/> The poets&mdash;Pitambar, Durgabar, Mankar and Sukavi Narayan&mdash;are well known for the compositions.<ref name="Saikia 1997 8"/>

{{Indian literature}}

In Assamese literature, the era of [[Sankardev|Shankardeva]] or Shankari era, incorporates the literary works that were produced mostly as pertinent to the [[Neo-Vaishnavism|Neo-Vaishnavite]] movement which propagated the [[Ekasarana Dharma|Ekasarana Nama-Dharma]]. Sankardeva’s contribution to Assamese literature is multidimensional and spread through different genres of literature. He is credited with building on past cultural relics and devising new forms of music ([[Borgeet]]), theatrical performance ([[Ankia Naat]], [[Bhaona]]), dance ([[Sattriya]]), literary language ([[Brajavali]]). Sankardev produced a large body of work. Though there were others before him who wrote in the language of the common man, it was Sankardev who opened the floodgates and inspired others like [[Madhavdev]] to carry on where he left off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atributetosankaradeva.org/mahapurusiya.htm|title=Mahapurusism; name of religion preached by Sankaradeva is Eka-Sarana Hari-Nām Dharma, also referred to as Mahapurusism or Assam Vaisnavism.

[[Madhavdev]]a, a disciple of [[Sankardev]]a, has a large scale contribution to Assamese literature. His [[Magnum opus]], [[Naam Ghosa]] is based chiefly on the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. The Naam-Ghosa is known by the name of Hajari Ghosa as well, as it contains one thousand verses (''ghosas'').His ''Guru Bhatima,'' a long poem of praise to his Guru Sankardev, is also popular. ''Bhakti-Ratnavali'' is another notable work, rendered by Madhavadeva from the original work by Visnupuri in Sanskrit. Other prominent works include ''Naam Maalikaa, [[Assamese language|Assamese]]'' rendering of the Adi Kanda of Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], ''Janma Rahasya,'' 191 [[Borgeet]]s and several plays.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atributetosankaradeva.org/namghosa.htm|title=The Nama Ghosa of Madhavadeva (Madhabdeva, Madhavdev) :: ATributeToSankaradeva|website=www.atributetosankaradeva.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Madhava_guru_ratnavali.htm|title=The Bhakti Ratnavali of Madhavadeva :: ATributeToSankaradeva|website=atributetosankaradeva.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://istore.chennaimath.org/product/bhakti-ratnavali/|title=Buy Bhakti Ratnavali from Chennaimath.org at lowest price|website=Ramakrishna Math iStore|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/Madhava_guru_lit.htm|title=The Literary Output of Madhavadeva (Madhabdeva, Madhavdev) :: ATributeToSankaradeva|website=atributetosankaradeva.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atributetosankaradeva.org/guru_bhatima.htm|title=The Guru Bhatima of Madhavadeva :: ATributeToSankaradeva|website=atributetosankaradeva.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>

After Sankardev and Madhavdev, several other writers emerged and contributed to Assamese literature. [[Ananta Kandali]]'s ''Mahiravana Vadha'', ''Harihara Yuddha'', ''Vrttrasura Vadha, Kumara Harana and Sahasra Nama Vrttanta;'' [[Rama Saraswati]]'s translation of the [[Mahabharata]], ''Geeta Govinda'' and ''Vadha Kavyas;'' a part of [[Naam Ghosa]] by Ratnakar Kandali; [[Sridhar Kandali]]'s ''Kumara Harana''; ''Janmajatra'', ''Nandutsav, Gopi-Uddhab Sambad'' and ''Sitar Patal Pravesh by'' [[Gopaldev]]; compilation of [[Kirtan Ghoxa|Kirtan Ghosha]] by Ramcharan Thakur; ''Nava Ghosha, Santasaar, Burha-Bhashya'' by Purushottam Thakur etc. are notable of the period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gogoi|first=Biswadip|title=Translation in Assamese: A Brief Account|url=https://www.academia.edu/34604056|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sua1AAAAIAAJ&q=Gopaldev+assam|title=The Truth unites: essays in tribute to Samar Sen|last=Sen|first=Samar Ranjan|date=1985|publisher=Subarnarekha|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=A study on Kāmrūpī, a dialect of Assamese.|last=Goswami, Upendranath.|date=1970|publisher=Dept. of Historical Antiquarian Studies, Assam|oclc=5354680}}</ref>

==== Post-Shankari literature (1700-1826 AD) ====
Along with the expansion of power and border of the [[Ahom kingdom]], literary works other than Neo-vaishnavite centric started gaining momentum in the 18th century. However the tradition of composing works based on Sanskrit scriptures still continued. Raghunath Mahanta was one of the most important figures of this period whose well known works include Katha-Ramayana, Adbhut Ramayana and Satrunjoy- all of them are based on the [[Ramayana]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Devlok with Devdutt Pattanaik: 3|last=Pattanaik|first=Devdutt|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|year=2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Adbhuta Ramayana|last=Mahanta|first=Raghunatha|publisher=Gauhati University Press|year=1972|location=Gauhati}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|last=Paniker|first=K.

Among translation of texts related to practical knowledge include translation of Srihastha Muktavali on [[Dance]] and mudra by Suchand Ojha, translations of Kaamratna- Tantra, Bhaswati by Kaviraj Chakraborti. [[Hastividyarnava]], commissioned under the patronage of king [[Siva Singha]] and translated by Sukumar Barkaith, is based on the Sanskrit text ''Gajendra-Chintamoni'' by Sambhunath. Books like Ghora Nidaan, Aswanidaan by Surjyakhari Daivajna were also compiled during this period.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw_oDQAAQBAJ&q=Kabiraj+Chakravarti%E2%80%99s+translation+of+Brahmavaivarta+Puran&pg=PA305|title=UGC NET/JRF/SET History (Paper II & III) Facts At a Glance|last=Mishra|first=Dr Mani Bhushan|date=2015-01-23|publisher=Upkar Prakashan|isbn=9789350133231|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lisindia.ciil.org/Assamese/Assa_lite.html|title=Assamese Literature|website=lisindia.ciil.org|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Asomiya Sahityar Buranji, Pratham Khanda (2nd ed.)|last=Hazarika|first=Bisweswar|publisher=Anandaram Borooah Institute of Language, Art and Culture|year=2016|location=Guwahati}}</ref>

===Modern era===
{{main|Modern Assamese}}
This is a period of the prose chronicles (''[[Buranji]]'') of the [[Ahom Kingdom|Ahom court]]. The Ahoms had brought with them an instinct for historical writings. In the Ahom court, historical chronicles were at first composed in their original [[Tai-Kadai language]], but when the Ahom rulers adopted Assamese as the court language, historical chronicles began to be written in Assamese. From the beginning of the 17th century onwards, court chronicles were written in large numbers. These chronicles or buranjis, as they were called by the Ahoms, broke away from the style of the religious writers. The language is essentially modern except for slight alterations in grammar and spelling.

==== Effect of British rule ====
The British imposed [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in 1836 in Assam after the state was occupied and annexed with the [[Bengal Presidency]]. As a result of this language imposition, the progress of education in Assam remained not only slow but highly defected and a lot of Bengalis were imported and employed in the different schools of Assam. Writing of text books in Assamese for school children did not get any encouragement and Assamese literature naturally suffered in its growth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social History of Assam.|last=Bose|first=M.L.|publisher=Ashok Kumar Mittal Concept Publishing Company|year=1989|location=New Delhi|pages=91}}</ref> Due to a sustained campaign, Assamese was reinstated in 1873 as the state language. Since the initial printing and literary activity occurred in eastern Assam, the Eastern dialect was introduced in schools, courts, and offices and soon came to be formally recognized as the Standard Assamese. In recent times, with the growth of [[Guwahati]] as the political and commercial center of Assam, the Standard Assamese has moved away from its roots in the Eastern dialect.

==== Influence of missionaries ====
The modern Assamese period began with the publication of the [[Bible]] in Assamese prose by the American [[Baptist]] [[missionaries]] in 1819.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Asomiya Sahityar Buranji,Sastha Khanda (3rd ed.)|last=Borgohain|first=Homen|publisher=Anandaram BorooahInstitute of Language, Art and Culture|year=2015|location=Guwahati}}</ref> The currently prevalent standard [[Asamiya]] has its roots in the Sibsagar dialect of Eastern Assam. As mentioned in Bani Kanta Kakati's "Assamese, its Formation and Development" (1941, Published by Sree Khagendra Narayan Dutta Baruah, LBS Publications, G.N. Bordoloi Road, Gauhati-1, Assam, India) – "The Missionaries made Sibsagar in Eastern Assam the centre of their activities and used the dialect of Sibsagar for their literary purposes". The American Baptist Missionaries were the first to use this dialect in translating the Bible in 1813.

The missionaries established the first [[printing press]] in [[Sibsagar]] in 1836 and started using the local Asamiya dialect for writing purposes. In 1846 they started a monthly periodical called ''[[Arunodoi]]'', and in 1848, [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]] published the first book on Assamese grammar. The Missionaries published the first Assamese-English Dictionary compiled by M. Bronson in 1867. 
One of the major contributions of the American Baptist missionaries to the [[Assamese language]] is the reintroduction of Assamese as the official language in [[Assam]]. In 1848 missionary [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]] published a treatise on the Assamese language.<ref>Brown, Nathan (1848). Grammatical Notices of the Assamese Language. American Baptist Missionary Press, Sibsagor, Assam</ref> This treatise gave a strong impetus towards reintroducing Assamese the official language in Assam. In his 1853 official report on the province of Assam, [[United Kingdom|British]] official Moffat Mills wrote:

{{cquote|...the people complain, and in my opinion with much reason, of the substitution of Bengalee for the Vernacular Assamese. Bengalee is the language of the court, not of their popular books and shashtras, and there is a strong prejudice to its general use. …Assamese is described by Mr. Brown, the best scholar in the province, as a beautiful, simple language, differing in more respects from, than agreeing with, Bengalee, and I think we made a great mistake in directing that all business should be transacted in Bengalee, and that the Assamese must acquire it. It is too late now to retrace our steps, but I would strongly recommend Anandaram Phukan’s proposition to the favourable consideration of the Council of Education, viz., the substitution of the vernacular language in lieu of Bengalee, and completion of the course of the Vernacular education in Bengalee. I feel persuaded that a youth will, under this system of tuition, learn more in two than he now acquires in four years. An English youth is not taught in Latin until he is well grounded in English, and in the same manner, an Assamese should not be taught in a foreign language until he knows his own.<ref>Mills, A.G. Moffat (1853). Report of A.G. Moffat Mills, Judge, Sudder Court, Mymensingh dated 24th July 1853, on the province of Assam</ref>

The period of modern literature began with the publication the Assamese journal ''[[Jonaki (magazine)|Jonaki]]'' (জোনাকী) (1889), which introduced the short story form first by [[Lakshminath Bezbaroa]].  Thus began the Jonaki period of Assamese literature. In 1894 Rajanikanta Bordoloi published the first Assamese novel ''[[Mirijiyori]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/indiareg/bordolr.htm|title=Miri Jiyori - Rajanikanta Bordoloi|website=www.complete-review.com|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>

The modern Assamese literature has been enriched by the works of [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwala|Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla]], [[Birinchi Kumar Barua]], [[Hem Barua]], [[Atul Chandra Hazarika]], [[Mafizuddin Ahmed Hazarika]], [[Nalini Bala Devi]], [[Navakanta Barua]], [[Syed Abdul Malik]], [[Mamoni Raisom Goswami]], [[Bhabendra Nath Saikia]], [[Homen Borgohain]], [[Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya]], [[D. K. Barooah]], Nirupama Borgohain, [[Kanchan Baruah]], [[Saurabh Kumar Chaliha]], [[Raihan Shah]] and others. Moreover, as regards the spreading of Assamese literature outside Assam, the complete work of [[Jyoti Prasad Agarwala]] has been translated into Hindi to reach a wider audience by [[Devi Prasad Bagrodia]]. Bagrodia has also translated [[Sankardev|Shrimanta Shankardev]]'s 'Gunamala' into Hindi.
