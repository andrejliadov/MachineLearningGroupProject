'''Chai''' ({{lang-he|[[wikt:חַי|חַי]]}} "living" ''{{transl|he|ḥay}}'') figures prominently in modern [[Jewish culture]]; the Hebrew letters of the word are often used as a visual symbol.

==History==
According to ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', its use as an amulet originates in 18th century Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/165445/exploring-chai-culture/?p=all|title=Exploring 'Chai' Culture|date=11 November 2012|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref> Chai as a symbol goes back to [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval Spain]]. Letters as symbols in [[Jewish culture]] go back to the earliest Jewish roots, the [[Talmud]] states that the world was created from Hebrew letters which form verses of the [[Torah]]. In medieval [[Kabbalah]], Chai is the lowest (closest to the physical plane) emanation of God.<ref name=tco>Pelaia, Ariela. "[https://www.thoughtco.com/chai-in-judaism-2076800 What Does the Chai Symbol Signify for Jews?]" ThoughtCo. (accessed March 9, 2018).</ref> According to 16th century Greek rabbi [[Shlomo HaKohen of Greece|Shlomo Hacohen Soloniki]], in his commentary on the [[Zohar]], Chai as a symbol has its linkage in the Kabbalah texts to God's attribute of 'Ratzon', or motivation, will, muse.<ref>Sheat Ratzon al ha-Zohar 35</ref>  The Jewish commentaries give an especially long treatment to certain verses in the Torah with the word as their central theme. Three examples are Leviticus 18:5 {{Hebrew|וָחַי בָּהֶם}} 'Chai Bahem', 'and you shall live by [this faith]' (as opposed to just doing it), this is part of the section dealing with the legacy of Moses Our Teacher following his death. Deuteronomy 30:15 {{Hebrew|רְאֵה נָתַתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ הַיּוֹם, אֶת-הַחַיִּים וְאֶת-הַטּוֹב, וְאֶת-הַמָּוֶת, וְאֶת-הָרָע.	}} "Verily, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, in that I command thee this day to love the {{LORD}} thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His ordinances; then thou shalt live." There is nary an ancient Jewish commentator who does not comment on that verse. The [[Shema]] prayer as well speaks of the importance of Chai, to live and walk in the Jewish cultural lifestyle.

Two common Jewish names used since Talmudic times, are based on this symbol, Chaya feminine, Chayim masculine.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The Jewish toast (on alcoholic beverages such as wine) is l'chaim, 'to life'.<ref name=tco/>

On a spiritual (and historical) level, chai stands for being alive in front of God as opposed to being (spiritually) dead. This is derived from [[Tenach]], Deuteronomy 30:19-20 where (the) heaven(s) and the earth are depicted as a witness for the fact that there is life and death, blessing and curse and that you (therefore) should choose Life (God), in order to live.

==Linguistics==
The word is made up of two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] - [[Heth (letter)|Chet]] ({{Hebrew|ח}}) and [[Yodh|Yod]] ({{Hebrew|י}}), forming the word "chai", meaning "alive", or "living".<ref name=tco/> The most common spelling in [[Latin script]] is "Chai", but the word is occasionally also spelled "Hai". The usual modern pronunciation of this word is {{IPA-he|χai̯|}}, while a transcription of the [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical]] and [[Mishnaic Hebrew language|Mishnaic]] pronunciation would have likely been {{IPA|[ħai̯]}} (with a [[pharyngeal consonant]]).

In Hebrew, the related word ''chaya'' ({{Hebrew|חיה}}) means "living thing" or "animal", and is derived from the Hebrew word ''chai'' ({{Hebrew|חי}}), meaning "life".

==Numerology==
There have been various mystical [[numerological]] speculations about the fact that, according to the system of [[gematria]], the letters of ''chai'' add up to 18<ref name=tco/> (see [[Tzadikim Nistarim#Lamedvavnik/s|"Lamedvavniks"]] etc.). For this reason, [[18 (number)|18]] is a spiritual number in Judaism, and many Jews give gifts of money in multiples of 18 as a result.<ref name=tco/>

==In Jewish culture==

The Chai symbol can be worn by Jews as a medallion around the neck, similarly to other Jewish symbols, such as the [[Star of David]] and the [[Hamsa]].<ref name=tco/>

Jews often give gifts and donations in multiples of 18, which is called "giving chai". Mailings from Jewish charities usually suggest the amounts to give in multiples of chai (18, 36, 54 dollars, etc.) rather than the usual multiples of 25.<ref name=tco/>

It appears in the slogan "''{{transl|he|[[Am Yisrael Chai|ʿam yisraʾel ḥay]]}}!''" ({{Hebrew|עַם יִשְרָאֵל חַי}}, "The people of Israel lives!").<ref>{{cite web|title="Am Yisrael Chai" - Eternal Nation|url=http://www.aish.com/sh/s/48967201.html|website=aish.com|accessdate=8 December 2016}}</ref>

It is heard in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20140729011002/http://soundportraits.org/on-air/bergen-belsen/transcript.php BBC recording] from April 20, 1945 of Jewish survivors of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] five days after their liberation. This was the first Sabbath ceremony openly conducted on German soil since the beginning of the war. With people still dying around them, the survivors sang what would become the Israeli national anthem, "[[Hatikvah]]". At the end of "Hatikvah", British Army Chaplain [[Leslie Hardman]] shouts out, ''Am Yisrael Chai!'' ("The people of Israel is alive!")<ref>[http://israblog.nana.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=213241&blogcode=3921211 Nana.co.il] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520091127/http://israblog.nana.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=213241&blogcode=3921211 |date=May 20, 2007 }}, original Site with Newspaper Article {{in lang|he}}</ref>

In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983]], which was held in Germany four decades after [[Shoah]], Israel was represented with the song "[[Hi (Ofra Haza song)|Chai]]", performed by [[Ofra Haza]], which includes the line ''Am Yisra'el chai''.

Several Jewish radio stations have the word in their names, including [[Kol Chai]] (Israel), [[Radio Jai]] (Argentina), and [[ChaiFM]] (South Africa).
