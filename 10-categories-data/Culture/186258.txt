==Plot==
An angry-depressed 16-year-old, (Holden Caulfield) lives in an unspecified institution in California after the end of [[World War II]]. After his discharge within a month, he intends to go live with his brother D.B., an author and war veteran with whom Holden is angry for becoming a [[Hollywood]] [[screenwriter]]. 

Holden recalls the events of the previous Christmas, beginning at Pencey Preparatory Academy, a [[boarding school]] in Pennsylvania. Holden has just learned that he won't be allowed back at Pencey after the Christmas break, because he had failed all classes except English. After forfeiting a [[fencing]] match in New York by forgetting the equipment on the subway, he says goodbye to his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, who is a well-meaning but long-winded old man. Spencer offers him advice but simultaneously embarrasses Holden by criticizing his history exam.

Back at his dorm, Holden's dorm neighbor, Robert Ackley, who is unpopular among his peers, disturbs Holden with his impolite questioning and mannerisms. Holden, who feels sorry for Ackley, tolerates his presence. Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is leaving for a date. Holden and Stradlater normally hang out well together, and Holden admires Stradlater's physique. He is distressed to learn that Stradlater's date is Jane Gallagher, with whom Holden was infatuated and feels the need to protect. That night, Holden decides to go to a [[Cary Grant]] comedy with Mal Brossard and Ackley. Since Ackley and Mal had already seen the film, they end up just playing pinball and returning to Pencey. When Stradlater returns hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden wrote for him about the baseball glove of Holden's late brother Allie and refuses to say whether he slept with Jane. Enraged, Holden punches him, and Stradlater easily wins the fight. When Holden continues insulting him, Stradlater leaves him lying on the floor with a bloody nose. He goes to the room of Ackley, who is already asleep, and doesn't give him any attention. Fed up with the "phonies" at Pencey Prep, Holden decides to leave Pencey early and catches a train to New York. Holden intends to stay away from his home until Wednesday when his parents would have received notification of his expulsion. Aboard the train, Holden meets the mother of a wealthy, obnoxious Pencey student, Ernest Morrow, and makes up nice but false stories about her son.

In a [[taxicab]], Holden asks the driver whether the ducks in the [[Central Park]] lagoon migrate during winter, a subject he brings up often, but the man barely responds. Holden checks into the Edmont Hotel and spends an evening dancing with three tourists at the hotel lounge. Holden is disappointed that they are unable to hold a conversation. Following an unpromising visit to a nightclub, Holden becomes preoccupied with his internal angst and agrees to have a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] named Sunny visit his room. His attitude toward the girl changes when she enters the room and takes off her clothes. Holden, who is a virgin, says he only wants to talk, which annoys her and causes her to leave. Even though he maintains that he paid her the right amount for her time, she returns with her [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] Maurice and demands more money. Holden insults Maurice, Sunny takes money from Holden's wallet, and Maurice snaps his fingers on Holden's groin and punches him in the stomach. Afterward, Holden imagines that he has been shot by Maurice and pictures murdering him with an [[automatic firearm|automatic]] pistol.

The next morning, Holden, becoming increasingly depressed and in need of personal connection, calls Sally Hayes, a familiar date. Although Holden claims that she is "the queen of all phonies," they agree to meet that afternoon to attend a play at the [[Samuel J. Friedman Theatre|Biltmore Theater]]. Holden shops for a special [[Phonograph record|record]], "Little Shirley Beans", for his 10-year-old sister Phoebe. He spots a small boy singing "[[Comin' Thro' the Rye|If a body catch a body coming through the rye]]," which lifts his mood. After the play, Holden and Sally go ice skating at [[Rockefeller Center]], where Holden suddenly begins ranting against society and frightens Sally. He impulsively invites Sally to run away with him that night to live in the wilderness of [[New England]], but she is uninterested in his hastily conceived plan and declines. The conversation turns sour, and the two angrily part ways.

Holden decides to meet his old classmate, Carl Luce, for drinks at the Wicker Bar. Holden annoys Carl, whom Holden suspects of being [[gay]], by insistently questioning him about his sex life. Before leaving, Luce says that Holden should go see a [[psychiatrist]], to better understand himself. After Luce leaves, Holden gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, and calls an icy Sally. Exhausted and out of money, Holden wanders over to Central Park to investigate the ducks, accidentally breaking Phoebe's record on the way. Nostalgic, he heads home to see his sister Phoebe. He sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out, and wakes up Phoebe — the only person with whom he seems to be able to communicate his true feelings. Although Phoebe is happy to see Holden, she quickly deduces that he has been expelled, and chastises him for his aimlessness and his apparent disdain for everything. When asked if he cares about anything, Holden shares a selfless fantasy he has been thinking about (based on a [[Mondegreen|mishearing]] of [[Robert Burns]]'s ''[[Comin' Thro' the Rye|Comin' Through the Rye]]''), in which he imagines himself as making a job of saving children running through a field of rye by catching them before they fell off a nearby cliff (a "catcher in the rye").

When his parents return home, Holden slips out and visits his former and much-admired English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who expresses concern that Holden is headed for "a terrible fall". Mr. Antolini advises him to begin applying himself and provides Holden with a place to sleep. Holden is upset when he wakes up to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] advance. He leaves and spends the rest of the night in a waiting room at [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]], where he sinks further into despair and expresses regret over leaving Mr. Antolini. He spends most of the morning wandering [[Fifth Avenue]].

Losing hope of finding belonging or companionship in the city, Holden impulsively decides that he will head out [[Western United States|west]] and live a reclusive lifestyle in a log cabin. He decides to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say goodbye. While visiting Phoebe's school, Holden sees graffiti containing a curse word and becomes distressed by the thought of children learning the word's meaning and tarnishing their innocence. When he meets Phoebe at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him, even though she was looking forward to acting as [[Benedict Arnold]] in a play that Friday. Holden refuses to let her come with him, which upsets Phoebe. He tries to cheer her up by allowing her to skip school and taking her to the [[Central Park Zoo]], but she remains angry. They eventually reach the zoo's [[carousel]], where Phoebe reconciles with Holden after he buys her a ticket. Holden is finally filled with happiness and joy at the sight of Phoebe riding the carousel.

Holden finally alludes to encountering his parents that night and "getting sick", mentioning that he will be attending another school in September. Holden says that he doesn't want to tell anything more because talking about them has made him find himself missing his former classmates.

==History==
Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in ''The Catcher in the Rye''. While at [[Columbia University]], Salinger wrote a [[short story]] called "[[The Young Folks]]" in [[Whit Burnett]]'s class; one character from this story has been described as a "thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes". In November 1941 he sold the story "[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]", which featured Holden Caulfield, to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', but it wasn't published until December 21, 1946, due to [[World War II]]. The story "[[I'm Crazy]]", which was published in the December 22, 1945 issue of ''[[Collier's]]'', contained material that was later used in ''The Catcher in the Rye''.

In 1946, ''The New Yorker'' accepted a 90-page [[manuscript]] about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Jack |year=1991 |title=New essays on the Catcher in the Rye |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9780521377980 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521377980/page/3 3] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521377980|url-access=registration }}</ref>

==Writing style==
''The Catcher in the Rye'' is narrated in a [[First-person narrative|subjective]] style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, [[Stream of consciousness|following his exact thought processes]]. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.

Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage [[colloquialism|colloquial]] speech of the time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Costello |first=Donald P. |date=October 1959 |title=The Language of 'The Catcher in the Rye' |journal=American Speech |doi=10.2307/454038 |jstor=454038 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=172–182 |quote=Most critics who glared at ''The Catcher in the Rye'' at the time of its publication thought that its language was a true and authentic rendering of teenage colloquial speech.}}</ref> Words and phrases that appear frequently include:
* "Old" – term of familiarity or endearment
* "Phony" – superficially acting a certain way only to change others’ perceptions
* "That killed me" – one found that hilarious or astonishing
* "Flit" – [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]
* "Crumbum" or "crumby" – inadequate, insufficient, disappointing
* "Snowing" – sweet-talking
* "I got a bang out of that" – one found it hilarious or exciting
* "Shoot the bull" – have a conversation containing false elements
* "Give her the time" – [[sexual intercourse]]
* "Necking" – passionate kissing especially on the neck (clothes on)
* "Chew the fat" or "chew the rag" – [[Small talk|small-talk]]
* "Rubbering" or "rubbernecks" – idle onlooking/onlookers
* "The Can" – the bathroom
* "Prince of a guy" – fine fellow (however often used sarcastically)
* "Prostitute" – sellout or phony (e.g. in regard to his brother D.B. who is a writer: "Now he's out in Hollywood being a prostitute")

==Interpretations==
[[Bruce Brooks]] held that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from [[young adult fiction]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Brooks |date=May 1, 2004 |title=Holden at sixteen |work=[[Horn Book Magazine]] |url=http://archive.hbook.com/magazine/articles/2004/may04_brooks.asp |accessdate=December 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071221100107/http://archive.hbook.com/magazine/articles/2004/may04_brooks.asp |archive-date=December 21, 2007}}</ref>
In contrast, [[Louis Menand]] thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that "alienation is just a phase."<ref>{{cite news |last=Menand |first=Louis |author-link=Louis Menand |date=September 27, 2001 |title=Holden at fifty |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2001/10/01/011001fa_FACT3?currentPage=all |accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.<ref name="Onstad" /><ref>Graham, 33.</ref> Holden is quick to become emotional. "I felt sorry as hell for..." is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try and grab it.<ref name="Onstad">{{cite news |last=Onstad |first=Katrina |date=February 22, 2008 |title=Beholden to Holden |work=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/bartlett.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225165543/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/bartlett.html |archive-date=February 25, 2008}}</ref>

Peter Beidler, in his ''A Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye"'', identifies the movie that the prostitute "Sunny" refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy falls off a boat. The movie is ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937), starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. Sunny says that Holden looks like the boy who fell off the boat. Beidler shows (page 28) a still of the boy, played by child-actor [[Freddie Bartholomew]].

Each Caulfield child has literary talent. D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood;<ref>{{harvtxt|Salinger|1969|p=67}}</ref> Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill (Holden's own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in "phony" as the writer has no space for his own imagination and describes D.B.'s move to Hollywood to write for films as "prostituting himself"; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove;<ref>{{harvtxt|Salinger|1969|p=38}}</ref> and Phoebe is a diarist.<ref>{{harvtxt|Salinger|1969|p=160}}</ref>
This "catcher in the rye" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he often struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the "catcher" and the "fallen"; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.<ref>{{cite news |author=Yasuhiro Takeuchi |date=Fall 2002 |title=The Burning Carousel and the Carnivalesque: Subversion and Transcendence at the Close of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=320–337}}</ref>

In their [[Salinger (book)|biography of Salinger]], [[David Shields]] and [[Shane Salerno]] argue that: "''The Catcher in the Rye'' can best be understood as a disguised [[war novel]]." Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, "took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shields |first1=David |last2=Salerno |first2=Shane |date=2013 |title=Salinger |edition=Hardcover |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=xvi |id={{ASIN|1476744831|country=ca}} |quote=The Catcher in the Rye can best be understood as a disguised war novel. Salinger emerged from the war incapable of believing in the heroic, noble ideals we like to think our cultural institutions uphold. Instead of producing a combat novel, like Norman Mailer, James Jones, and Joseph Heller did, Salinger took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.}}</ref>

==Reception==
''The Catcher in the Rye'' has been consistently listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, in an article for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nash K. Burger called it "an unusually brilliant novel,"<ref>{{cite news |last=Burger |first=Nash K. |date=July 16, 1951 |title=Books of The Times |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-rye02.html |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}</ref> while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stern |first=James |date=July 15, 1951 |title=Aw, the World's a Crumby Place |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-rye01.html |accessdate=March 18, 2009}}</ref> [[George H.

''The New Yorker'', February 8, 2010, p. 21</ref> In an appraisal of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' written after the death of J. D. Salinger, Jeff Pruchnic says the novel has retained its appeal for many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a “teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come.”<ref>Pruchnic, Jeff. "Holden at Sixty: Reading Catcher After the Age of Irony." Critical Insights: ------------The Catcher in The Rye (2011): 49–63. Literary Reference Center. Web. February 2, 2015.</ref> [[Bill Gates]] said that ''The Catcher in the Rye'' is one of his favorite books.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2013 |title=The Best Books I Read in 2013 |last=Gates |first=Bill |work=gatesnotes.com|access-date=August 7, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

However, not all reception has been positive. The book has had its share of critics, and many contemporary readers "just cannot understand what the fuss is about". According to Rohrer, who writes, "many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in. J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. That is to say, he has done nothing."<ref name="finlo rohrer" /> Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it "captures existential teenage angst" and has a "complex central character" and "accessible conversational style"; while at the same time some readers may dislike the "use of 1940s New York vernacular" and the excessive "whining" of the "self-obsessed character".

==Censorship and use in schools==
In 1960, a teacher in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] was fired for assigning the novel in class; however, she was later reinstated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dutra |first=Fernando |date=September 25, 2006 |title=U.

Several shootings have been [[The Catcher in the Rye in popular culture#Shootings|associated]] with Salinger's novel, including [[Robert John Bardo]]'s murder of [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] and [[John Hinckley Jr.]]'s [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|assassination attempt]] on [[Ronald Reagan]]. Additionally, after [[Murder of John Lennon|fatally shooting]] [[John Lennon]], the delusional fanatic [[Mark David Chapman]] was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day, inside of which he had written: "To Holden Caulfield, From Holden Caulfield, ''This'' is my statement". <ref>{{cite web |last=Weeks |first=Linton |date=September 10, 2000 |title=Telling on Dad |work=[[Amarillo Globe-News]] |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/091000/boo_tellingondad.shtml |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005125/http://amarillo.com/stories/091000/boo_tellingondad.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date = June 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Doyle |first=Aidan |date=December 15, 2003 |title=When books kill |work=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/12/15/books_kill/index1.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105025510/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/12/15/books_kill/index1.html |archive-date=November 5, 2007}}</ref>

==Attempted adaptations==

===In film===
Early in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Ian |author-link=Ian Hamilton (critic) |title=In Search of J. D. Salinger |url=https://archive.org/details/insearchofjdsali0000hami |url-access=registration |year=1988 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-394-53468-9}} p. 75.</ref> In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story "[[Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut]]" was released; renamed ''[[My Foolish Heart (film)|My Foolish Heart]]'', the film took great liberties with Salinger's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work.<ref name="Onstad" /><ref name="berg">Berg, A. Scott. ''Goldwyn: A Biography''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989. {{ISBN|1-57322-723-4}}. p. 446.</ref> The enduring success of ''The Catcher in the Rye'', however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel's screen rights.<ref>See Dr. Peter Beidler's A'' Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's the Catcher in the Rye'', Chapter 7.</ref>

When ''The Catcher in the Rye'' was first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one from [[Samuel Goldwyn]], producer of ''My Foolish Heart''.<ref name="berg" /> In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite [[Margaret O'Brien]], and, if he couldn't play the part himself, to "forget about it." Almost 50 years later, the writer [[Joyce Maynard]] definitively concluded, "The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger."<ref name="mayn">{{cite book |last=Maynard |first=Joyce |author-link=Joyce Maynard |title=At Home in the World |url=https://archive.org/details/athomeinworld00joyc |url-access=registration |year=1998 |publisher=Picador |location=New York |isbn=0-312-19556-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/athomeinworld00joyc/page/93 93]}}</ref>

Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s that [[Jerry Lewis]] "tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,"<ref name="mayn" /> the protagonist in the novel which Lewis had not read until he was in his thirties.<ref name="Whitfield" /> Film industry figures including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Tobey Maguire]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] have tried to make a film adaptation.<ref>{{cite web |year=2004 |title=News & Features |work=IFILM: The Internet Movie Guide |url=http://vgn.ifilm.com/db/static_text/0,1699,5784,00.html |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040906121952/http://vgn.ifilm.com/db/static_text/0,1699,5784,00.html |archive-date=September 6, 2004}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', [[John Cusack]] commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-director [[Billy Wilder]] recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel's rights:

{{cquote|Of course I read ''The Catcher in the Rye''... Wonderful book. I loved it. I pursued it. I wanted to make a picture out of it. And then one day a young man came to the office of [[Leland Hayward]], my agent, in New York, and said, 'Please tell Mr. Leland Hayward to lay off. He's very, very insensitive.' And he walked out. That was the entire speech. I never saw him. That was J. D. Salinger and that was ''Catcher in the Rye''.<ref>Crowe, Cameron, ed. ''Conversations with Wilder''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999. {{ISBN|0-375-40660-3}}. p. 299.</ref>}}

In 1961, Salinger denied [[Elia Kazan]] permission to direct a stage adaptation of ''Catcher'' for [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].<ref name="guard">{{cite news |last=McAllister |first=David |date=November 11, 2003 |title=Will J.

In 2003, the [[BBC]] television program ''[[Big Read|The Big Read]]'' featured ''The Catcher in the Rye'', interspersing discussions of the novel with "a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger's adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield."<ref name="guard" /> The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a "literary review", and no major charges were filed.

After Salinger died in 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at [[Harold Ober]] Associates, stated that nothing has changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works.<ref>{{cite web |title=Slim chance of Catcher in the Rye movie – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=ABCnet.au |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/29/2805400.htm?section=justin |accessdate=January 30, 2010}}</ref> A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' released after his death. He wrote: "Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction." Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's [[first-person narrative]] into [[voice-over]] and dialogue would be contrived.<ref>{{cite news |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |date=January 29, 2010 |title=Could 'Catcher in the Rye' finally make it to the big screen?

In 2020, [[Don Hahn]] revealed that Disney had almost made an animated movie titled ''Dufus'' which would have been an adaptation of ''Catcher in the Rye'' "with [[German Shepherd|German shepherds]]", most likely akin to ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. The idea came from then CEO [[Michael Eisner]] who loved the book and wanted to do an adaptation. After being told that J. D. Salinger would not agree to sell the film rights, Eisner stated "Well, let's just do that kind of story, that kind of growing up, coming of age story."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/disney-catcher-in-the-rye-animated-movie-explained/|title=Disney Once Tried to Make an Animated ‘Catcher in the Rye’ — But Wait, There’s More|website=Collider|last=Taylor|first=Drew|date=August 3, 2020|accessdate=August 3, 2020}}</ref>

===Banned fan sequel===
In 2009, the year before he died, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man.<ref name="finlo rohrer" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Gross |first=Doug |date=June 3, 2009 |title=Lawsuit targets 'rip-off' of 'Catcher in the Rye' |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/06/03/salinger.catcher.lawsuit/index.html |accessdate=June 3, 2009}}</ref> The novel's author, [[John David California|Fredrik Colting]], commented: "call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books".<ref>Fogel, Karl.
