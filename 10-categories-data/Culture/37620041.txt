'''Hipster racism''' is engaging in behaviors typically regarded as [[racism|racist]] and defending them as being performed [[irony|ironically]] or [[satire|satirically]]. Rachel Dubrofsky and Megan W. Wood have described it as being supposedly "too hip and self-aware to actually mean the racist stuff one expresses".{{sfn|Dubrofsky|Wood|2014|p=285}} This might include wearing [[blackface]] and other performances of stereotyped [[African Americans]], use of the word ''[[nigger]]'', and [[Cultural appropriation|appropriating cultural dress]].<ref name="Pearce 2012">{{cite news |last=Pearce |first=Matt |date=1 May 2012 |title=Trayvon Martin, Kony 2012, L.A. riots – and Now 'Hipster Racism' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/01/nation/la-na-nn-hipster-racism-20120501 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=15 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=West |first=Lindy |author-link=Lindy West |date=26 April 2012 |title=A Complete Guide to 'Hipster Racism' |url=http://jezebel.com/5905291/a-complete-guide-to-hipster-racism |website=Jezebel |location=New York |publisher=Gawker Media|access-date=17 December 2013}}</ref> Talia Meer argues that hipster racism is rooted in what she calls "hipster exceptionalism", meaning "the idea that something ordinarily offensive or prejudiced is miraculously transformed into something clever, funny and socially relevant, by the assertion that said ordinarily offensive thing is ironic or satirical."<ref>{{cite web |last=Meer |first=Talia |date=2 January 2013 |title=Die Antwoord — Are We Missing the Misogyny? |url=http://thoughtleader.co.za/taliameer/2013/01/02/die-antwoord-are-we-missing-the-misogyny/ |website=Thought Leader |location=Johannesburg |publisher=M&G Media |access-date=26 October 2017}}</ref> As Leslie A.

==History==
Carmen Van Kerckhove coined the term ''hipster racism'' in the article "The 10 Biggest Race and Pop Culture Trends of 2006", citing "Kill Whitey" Parties and "Blackface Jesus" as examples.<ref>{{cite web |last=Van Kerckhove |first=Carmen |date=15 January 2007 |title=The 10 Biggest Race and Pop Culture Trends of 2006: Part 1 of 3 |url=http://www.racialicious.com/2007/01/15/the-10-biggest-race-and-pop-culture-trends-of-2006-part-1-of-3/ |website=Racialicious |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302044555/http://www.racialicious.com/2007/01/15/the-10-biggest-race-and-pop-culture-trends-of-2006-part-1-of-3/ |archive-date=2 March 2013 |access-date=12 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{sfnm |1a1=Current |1a2=Tillotson |1p=4 |2a1=Threadgold |2y=2018}} "Kill Whitey" parties, as described by ''[[The Washington Post]]'', were parties held for [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], by Jeremy Parker, a [[disc jockey]] who goes by the name The Pumpsta, in an attempt to "kill the whiteness inside". These were parties in which white hipsters mocked the black [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] industry, and essentially a part of [[African-American culture]], for the sake of irony.<ref>{{cite news |last=Garcia |first=Michelle |date=26 August 2005 |title=Deejay's Appeal: 'Kill The Whiteness Inside' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/25/AR2005082501818.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref> Van Kerckhove also regarded the use of blackface by [[white people]] and the [[normalization (sociology)|normalization]] and acceptance of such use from other individuals as hipster racism. Van Kerckhove contends, quoting Debra Dickerson, that the use of blackface by individuals such as these was an effort to satirize [[political correctness]] and racism.<ref>{{cite web |last=Van Kerckhove |first=Carmen |date=9 December 2005 |title=Dude, Where's My White Privilege?

Matt Pearce of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' characterized the appropriation of [[cultural artifact]]s as fashion without recognizing the significance of the article as hipster racism. Examples include wearing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[headdress]]es, or more specifically, [[Urban Outfitters]] selling clothes with [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and other Aboriginal and African tribal prints without giving tribute, acknowledgement, or compensation.<ref name="Pearce 2012" /> Television producer [[Lena Dunham]] was described as a hipster racist when Dunham issued a statement defending a male colleague who was accused of rape by a woman of mixed race.<ref>{{cite news | last=D'Zurilla | first=Christie | date=20 November 2017 | title=Lena Dunham accused of 'hipster racism' after she initially defended 'Girls' writer | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-lena-dunham-accused-of-hipster-racism-1511203068-htmlstory.html | access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Mahdawi | first=Arwa | date=25 November 2017 | title=Is Lena Dunham's 'hipster racism' just old-fashioned prejudice? | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/hipster-racism-lena-dunham-prejudice | access-date=25 November 2017 }}</ref>
