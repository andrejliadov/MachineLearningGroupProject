==Philosophy==
A faith literate individual understands the key effects of each religion/belief system by means of the values, attitudes and influence it causes in individuals, families and communities. Faith literates believe in recognizing religious and secular worldviews in practice and thoughts and take hold of what makes each religion/belief system what it is. IT involves understanding and knowing the fundamental formative attribute of all religions.
