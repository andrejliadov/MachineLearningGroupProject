'''European Culture and Economy''', shortened as '''ECUE''', is an interdisciplinary postgraduate program that is distinct from [[European studies|European Studies]]. Both focus on European politics and developments.

==History==
The [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany is currently the only university to offer European Culture and Economy as a path of study.<ref>http://studieren.de/hochschule.0.html?&tx_assearchengine_pi2</ref> It is a small branch, approximately 30 students are accepted each year. It was first introduced in the winter term of 1999/2000 and has since become an established [[Master's degree|Masters]]<nowiki />programme. Initially, ECUE was a way of giving arts scholars a fundamental understanding of economics, politics and intercultural competences. In its early stages, the program was supported financially by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) as well as [[German Rectors' Conference]] (HRK).<ref>http://www.nordrheinwestfalendirekt.de/broschuerenservice/download/173/auslandserfahrung.pdf p.76</ref> In 2007, its level of quality was confirmed by ACQUIN,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&standort=&hochschule=&sonstiger_hochschulname=&fachausschuesse= |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210646/http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&standort=&hochschule=&sonstiger_hochschulname=&fachausschuesse= |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> a German Quality Assurance Institute. Students of ECUE are intended to qualify as ''specialized generalist'' and be prepared for careers in international companies and institutions. The expected duration of study is four terms.

Next to interdisciplinary, ECUE stresses international relations. Many of the available places are assigned to foreign students.<ref>Handbuch Europa in NRW (p. 59,60)</ref> So far, students of 30 different nations (Africa, U.S.A., Asia, many European countries) were able to successfully complete the program.
