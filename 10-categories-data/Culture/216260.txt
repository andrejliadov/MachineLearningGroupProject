{{short description|Agriculture of plants}}
'''Horticulture''' is the [[agriculture]] of plants, mainly for food, materials, comfort and beauty for decoration.<ref>Arteca, R. 2015, Introduction to Horticultural Science, 2nd ed., Gengage Learning, Stamford, USA, p.[ ayo baca dengan keras] 584. {{ISBN|978-1-111-31279-4}}[apa gak kedengeran:^ ;^]</ref> Horticulturists apply [[knowledge]], skills, and technologies to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and for personal or social needs. Their work involves [[plant propagation]] and cultivation with the aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, [[nutritional value]] and resistance to insects, diseases and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture.

==Etymology==
The word ''horticulture'' is modeled after ''[[agriculture]]'', and comes from the Latin ''hortus'' "garden"<ref>{{L&S|hortus|ref}}</ref> and ''cultura'' "cultivation", from ''cultus'', the perfect passive [[participle]] of the verb ''colō'' "I cultivate".<ref>{{OEtymD|horticulture}}</ref> ''Hortus'' is [[cognate]] with the native English word ''yard'' (in the meaning of land associated with a building) and also the borrowed word ''garden''.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/yard Entry for ''yard''] Dictionary.com (presenting information supposedly from Random House Dictionary)</ref>

==Definition==
According to American horticulturist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], "Horticulture is the growing of flowers, fruits and vegetables, and of plants for ornament and fancy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://horticulture.umn.edu/students/why-horticulture|title=Why Horticulture?|website=Department of Horticultural Science|publisher=University of Minnesota|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502082101/https://horticulture.umn.edu/students/why-horticulture|archive-date=2019-05-02|url-status=dead|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> A more precise definition can be given  "The cultivation, processing, and sale of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and ornamental plants as well as many additional services".<ref>Shyr, C.L. & Reily, H.E. 2017. Introductory Horticulture, 9th ed. Gengage Learning, Stamford, USA, p. 5. {{ISBN|978-12854-2472-9}}</ref> It also includes [[conservation biology|plant conservation]], [[restoration ecology|landscape restoration]], [[soil management]], [[Landscape design|landscape]] and [[garden design|garden]] design, construction and maintenance, and [[arboriculture]]. In contrast to [[agriculture]], horticulture does not include [[Intensive crop farming|large-scale crop production]] or [[animal husbandry]].
At present, horticulture can be defined as the science and technique of production, processing and merchandising of fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, plantations medicinal and aromatic crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greendoctor.club/|title=Green Doctor}}</ref>

==History==

Horticulture has a very long history.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Purdue University |author=Jules Janick |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/default.html |title=History of Horticulture |accessdate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910033023/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/default.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012 }}</ref>  The study and science of horticulture dates all the way back to the times of [[Cyrus the Great]] of ancient Persia, and has been going on ever since, with present-day horticulturists such as Freeman S. Howlett and [[Luther Burbank]]. The practice of horticulture can be retraced for many thousands of years. The cultivation of taro and yam in Papua New Guinea dates back to at least 6950–6440 cal BP.<ref>Fullagar, Richard, Judith Field, Tim Denham, and Carol Lentfer (2006) ''Early and mid Holocene tool-use and processing of taro (Colocasia esculenta), yam (Dioscorea sp.) and other plants at Kuk Swamp in the highlands of Papua New Guinea'' Journal of Archaeological Science 33: 595–614</ref> The origins of horticulture lie in the transition of human communities from nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s to sedentary or semi-sedentary horticultural communities, cultivating a variety of crops on a small scale around their dwellings or in specialized plots visited occasionally during migrations from one area to the next (such as the "[[milpa]]" or maize field of [[Mesoamerican]] cultures).<ref>von Hagen, V.W. (1957) The Ancient Sun Kingdoms Of The Americas. Ohio: The World Publishing Company</ref> In the Pre-Columbian Amazon Rainforest, natives are believed to have used [[Biochar#History|biochar]] to enhance soil productivity by smoldering plant waste.<ref>Solomon, Dawit, Johannes Lehmann, Janice Thies, Thorsten Schafer, Biqing Liang, James Kinyangi, Eduardo Neves, James Petersen, Flavio Luizao, and Jan Skjemstad, ''Molecular signature and sources of biochemical recalcitrance of organic carbone in Amazonian Dark Earths'', Geochemica et cosmochemica ACTA 71.9 2285–2286 (2007) ("Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) are a unique type of soils apparently developed between 500 and 9000 years B.P. through intense anthropogenic activities such as biomass-burning and high-intensity nutrient depositions on pre-Columbian Amerindian settlements that transformed the original soils into Fimic Anthrosols throughout the Brazilian Amazon Basin.") (internal citations omitted)</ref> European settlers called it [[Terra preta|''Terra Preta de Indio'']].<ref>Glaser, Bruno, Johannes Lehmann, and Wolfgang Zech,'' Ameliorating physical and chemical properties of highly weathered soils in the tropics with charcoal – a review'', Biology and Fertility of Soils 35.4 219-220 (2002) ("These so called Terra Preta do Indio (Terra Preta) characterize the settlements of pre-Columbian Indios. In Terra Preta soils large amounts of black C indicate a high and prolonged input of carbonized organic matter probably due to the production of charcoal in hearths, whereas only low amounts of charcoal are added to soils as a result of forest fires and slash-and-burn techniques.") (internal citations omitted)</ref> In forest areas such horticulture is often carried out in [[swidden]]s ("[[slash and burn]]" areas).<ref>McGee, J.R. and Kruse, M. (1986) Swidden horticulture among the Lacandon Maya [videorecording (29 mins.)]. University of California, Berkeley: Extension Media Center</ref> A characteristic of horticultural communities is that useful trees are often to be found planted around communities or specially retained from the natural ecosystem.

Horticulture primarily differs from agriculture in two ways. First, it generally encompasses a smaller scale of cultivation, using small plots of mixed crops rather than large fields of single crops. Secondly, horticultural cultivations generally include a wide variety of crops, even including fruit trees with ground crops. Agricultural cultivations however as a rule focus on one primary crop. In pre-contact North America the semi-sedentary horticultural communities of the Eastern Woodlands (growing maize, squash and sunflower) contrasted markedly with the mobile [[hunter-gatherer]] communities of the [[Plains Indians|Plains people]]. In Central America, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] horticulture involved augmentation of the forest with useful trees such as [[papaya]], [[avocado]], [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]], [[ceiba]] and [[sapodilla]]. In the cornfields, multiple crops were grown such as beans (using cornstalks as supports), squash, pumpkins and chilli peppers, in some cultures tended mainly or exclusively by women.<ref>Thompson, S.I. (1977) Women, Horticulture, and Society in Tropical America. American Anthropologist, N.S., 79: 908–10</ref>
