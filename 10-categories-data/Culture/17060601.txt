'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.<ref name="Gudykunst">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/theorizingabouti0000unse|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=viii|language=en}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2019}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that the individuals within the intercultural encounter are stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.<ref name="Berger&Calabrese">{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99–112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on human thought processes and their approach to social situations in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from human attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"<ref name=":0" /> during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so.<ref name=":0" /> URT highlights three core motivations in reducing this uncertainty: the human anticipates other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward, and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant way which is unexpected.<ref name="Berger2">Berger, C. 1979. ''The contact hypothesis in ethnic relations''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.</ref>

Berger identified 7 axioms (evident truths)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/axiom?s=t|title=The definition of axiom|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref> and 21 theorems within URT<ref name=":0" /> (theoretical statements which are generally accepted, but are used to observe behaviours in need of more proof<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2014-03-20}}</ref>.) Because of these theorems, we have seen significant growth to the theory, leading to research into AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating human anxiety management within social situations as well as their uncertainty management.<ref name=":0" /> AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-on-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.<ref name="Gudykunst3">{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|issn=0270-6075}}</ref>

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan<ref name="Stephan&Stephan" /> on anxiety to expand URT to incorporate intergroup communications.<ref name="Stephan&Stephan">{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}</ref> AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, highlighting the major difference between URT and AUM. The intended outcome of URT is simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome is for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum, while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they do not feel secure and they are not sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individual distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another, moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].<ref name="Doise">{{Cite book|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris|oclc = 13004532}}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

• The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).<ref name="Doise"/>

• The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).<ref name="Doise"/>

• The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).<ref name="Doise"/>

• The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependent on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).<ref name="Doise"/>

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"<ref name="Deutsch">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/resolutionofconf00deut|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=en}}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".<ref name="Griffin" /> Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfslide.net/documents/anxietyuncertainty-management-theory-302009-01-26a-bill-gudykunsts-anxietyuncertainty.html|title=ANXIETY/UNCERTAINTY MANAGEMENT THEORY - 302009-01-26A. Bill Gudykunsts anxiety/uncertainty management theory ... Anxiety can reach a point where people become paralyzed with fear. ... A communication researcher at California State University, Fullerton|website=pdfslide.net|language=en|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we are misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we are misinterpreting others' behavior but do not do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"<ref name="Blalock">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/theoryconstructi0000blal|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=en}}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory<ref name="Reynolds">Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}</ref> A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are “basic causes” influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these “superficial causes” on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|oclc=651907062}}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}<ref name="Gudykunst"/>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}<ref name="Gudykunst"/>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}<ref name="Gudykunst"/>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}</ref>  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

|}<ref name="Gudykunst"/>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}</ref> Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|location=Boston, MA|oclc=914195352}}</ref> For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.<ref>Devine, P., Evett, S., & Vasquez-Suson, K.

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members<ref>{{Cite book|title=Individualism And Collectivism|author-link1=Harry C.

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino<ref name="Huber">Huber, G., & Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino & E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;591–619). New York: Guilford.</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certainty–oriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."<ref name="Critique">.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177–193}} </ref>

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.<ref name="Critique"/>

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''<ref name="Critique"/>
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.<ref name="Critique"/>

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".<ref name="Critique"/>

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as “noise” that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.<ref name="Critique"/>

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.<ref name="Critique"/>

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.<ref name="Critique"/>
