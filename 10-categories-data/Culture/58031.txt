'''Bourgeoisie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|ʊər|ʒ|.|w|ɑː|ˈ|z|iː}}; {{IPA-fr|buʁʒwazi|lang}}) is a [[Polysemy|polysemous]] French term that can mean:

* a sociologically defined [[social class]], especially in contemporary times, referring to people with a certain [[Cultural capital|cultural]] and [[financial capital]] belonging to the middle or [[upper middle class]]: the upper (''haute''), middle (''moyenne''), and [[Petite bourgeoisie|petty]] (''petite'') bourgeoisie (which are collectively designated "the bourgeoisie"); an affluent and often opulent stratum of the [[middle class]] who stand opposite the [[proletariat]] class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/bourgeoisie.aspx|title=bourgeoisie Facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about bourgeoisie|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}</ref>
* originally and generally, "those who live in the [[borough]]", that is to say, the people of the city (including merchants and craftsmen), as opposed to those of [[rural area]]s; in this sense, the bourgeoisie began to grow in Europe from the 11th century and particularly during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]] (i.e., the onset of the High Middle Ages), with the first developments of [[Rural flight|rural exodus]] and [[urbanization]].
* a legally defined [[Social class|class]] of the [[Middle Ages]] to the end of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' (Old Regime) in French-speaking Europe, that of inhabitants' having the rights of citizenship and political rights in a [[city]] (comparable to the German term ''Bürgertum'' and ''[[wikt:Bürger|Bürger]]''; see also "[[Burgher (title)|Burgher]]", and to the British term "[[Burgess (title)|Burgess]]").

The "bourgeoisie" in its original sense is intimately linked to the existence of cities recognized as such by their urban charters (e.g., [[municipal charter]], [[town privileges]], [[German town law]]), so there was no bourgeoisie  "outside the walls of the city" beyond which the people were "[[peasant]]s" submitted to the stately courts and [[manorialism]] (except for the traveling "[[fair]] bourgeoisie" living outside urban territories, who retained their city rights and [[Domicile (law)|domicile]]).

In [[Marxist philosophy]], the bourgeoisie is the social class that came to own the [[means of production]] during modern [[industrialization]] and whose societal concerns are the value of [[property]] and the preservation of capital to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/b/o.htm#bourgeois-society Bourgeois Society]</ref>

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] saw the incorporation of new elements into an expanding bourgeoisie, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of [[creative destruction]],  as the driving force behind the capitalist engine.<ref>Joseph A. Schumpeter, ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy'', pages 83–84, 134</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[Modern French]] word ''bourgeois'' ({{IPA-fr|buʁʒwa|lang}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|'|b|u@r|Z|.|w|a:|,_|,|b|u@r|'|Z|w|a:}}) derived from the [[Old French]] ''burgeis'' (walled city), which derived from ''bourg'' ([[market town]]), from the [[Old Frankish]] ''burg'' (town); in other European languages, the etymologic derivations include the [[Middle English]] ''burgeis'', the [[Middle Dutch]] ''burgher'', the German ''Bürger'', the [[Modern English]] ''[[Burgess (title)|burgess]]'', the Spanish ''burgués'', the Portuguese ''burguês'', and the Polish ''burżuazja'', which occasionally is synonymous with the "[[intelligentsia]]".<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' C. T. Onions, Editor (1995) p. 110.</ref> In its literal sense, ''bourgeois'' in Old French (''burgeis, borjois'') means "town dweller".

In English, the word "bourgeoisie" (a French citizen-class) identified{{when|date=February 2018}} a social class oriented to [[economic materialism]] and [[hedonism]], and to upholding the extreme political and economic interests of the capitalist ruling-class.<ref>''Oxford English Reference Dictionary'' Second Edition (1996) p. 196.</ref> In the 18th century, before the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), in the French [[feudalism|feudal order]], the masculine and feminine terms ''bourgeois'' and ''bourgeoise'' identified the rich men and women who were members of the urban and rural [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] – the common people of the French realm, who violently deposed the [[absolute monarchy]] of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] King [[Louis XVI]] (r. 1774–91), his clergy, and his [[French nobility|aristocrats]] in the [[French Revolution]] of 1789–1799. Hence, since the 19th century, the term "bourgeoisie" usually is politically and sociologically synonymous with the ruling upper-class of a capitalist society.<ref>''Dictionary of Historical Terms'', Chris Cook, Editor (1983), p. 267.</ref>

Historically, the medieval French word ''bourgeois'' denoted the inhabitants of the ''bourgs'' (walled market-towns), the [[craft]]smen, [[artisan]]s, [[merchant]]s, and others, who constituted "the bourgeoisie". They were the socio-economic class between the peasants and the landlords, between the [[Working class|workers]] and the owners of the [[means of production]]. As the economic [[manager]]s of the (raw) materials, the goods, and the services, and thus the [[capital (economics)|capital]] (money) produced by the feudal economy, the term "bourgeoisie" evolved to also denote the middle class – the businessmen and businesswomen who accumulated, administered, and controlled the capital that made possible the development of the bourgs into cities.<ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia 1994">"Bourgeoisie", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994) p. 0000.</ref>{{qn|date=February 2018}}

Contemporarily, the terms "bourgeoisie" and "bourgeois" (noun) identify the ruling class in capitalist societies, as a social stratum; while "bourgeois" (adjective / noun modifier) describes the ''Weltanschauung'' ([[worldview]]) of men and women whose way of thinking is socially and culturally determined by their economic [[materialism]] and [[philistinism]], a social identity famously mocked in [[Molière]]'s comedy ''[[Le Bourgeois gentilhomme]]'' (1670), which satirizes buying the trappings of a noble-birth identity as the means of climbing the social ladder.{{sfn|Benét|1987|p=118, 759}}{{sfn|Molière|1899}}{{page number missing|date=October 2020}} The 18th century saw a partial rehabilitation of bourgeois values in genres such as the ''drame bourgeois'' (bourgeois drama) and "[[bourgeois tragedy]]".

==History==

=== Origins and rise ===
{{Further|History of capitalism#Origins of capitalism|Trade#History}}[[File:Fuggerkontor.jpg|thumb|upright|The 16th-century German banker [[Jakob Fugger]] and his principal accountant, M. Schwarz, registering an entry to a ledger. The background shows a file cabinet indicating the European cities where the Fugger Bank conducts business. (1517)]]The bourgeoisie emerged as a historical and political phenomenon in the 11th century when the ''bourgs'' of Central and Western Europe developed into cities dedicated to commerce. This urban expansion was possible thanks to economic concentration due to the appearance of protective self-organisation into [[guilds]]. Guilds arose when individual businessmen (such as craftsmen, artisans and merchants) conflicted with their [[rent-seeking]] feudal [[Feudal land tenure|landlord]]s who demanded greater [[Economic rent|rent]]s than previously agreed.

In the event, by the end of the [[Middle Ages]] (c. AD 1500), under régimes of the early national monarchies of Western Europe, the bourgeoisie acted in self-interest, and politically supported the king or queen against [[Legitimacy (political)|legal]] and financial disorder caused by the greed of the feudal lords.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} In the late-16th and early 17th centuries, the bourgeoisies of England and the Netherlands had become the financial – thus political – forces that deposed the feudal order; [[economic power]] had vanquished military power in the realm of politics.<ref name="The Columbia Encyclopedia 1994"/>

===From progress to reaction (in the Marxist view)===
According to the Marxist view of history, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the bourgeoisie were the politically [[Progressivism|progressive]] social class who supported the principles of [[Constitution|constitutional government]] and of [[natural right]], against the [[Law of Privilege]] and the claims of [[Divine right of kings|rule by divine right]] that the [[nobility|nobles]] and [[prelate]]s had autonomously exercised during the feudal order.

The [[English Civil War]] (1642–51), the [[American War of Independence]] (1775–83), and [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) were partly motivated by the desire of the bourgeoisie to rid themselves of the feudal and royal encroachments on their personal liberty, commercial prospects, and the ownership of [[property]]. In the 19th century, the bourgeoisie propounded liberalism, and gained political rights, religious rights, and civil liberties for themselves and the lower social classes; thus the bourgeoisie was a progressive philosophic and political force in Western societies.

After the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1750–1850), by the mid-19th century the great expansion of the bourgeoisie social class caused its [[social stratification|stratification]] – by business activity and by economic function – into the ''haute bourgeoisie'' (bankers and industrialists) and the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' ([[Tradesman|tradesmen]] and [[white-collar worker]]s). Moreover, by the end of the 19th century, the capitalists (the original bourgeoisie) had ascended to the upper class, while the developments of technology and [[Trade (occupation)|technical occupations]] allowed the rise of working-class men and women to the lower strata of the bourgeoisie; yet the social progress was incidental.

== Denotations ==
===Marxist theory ===
[[File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|thumb|Karl Marx]]
According to [[Karl Marx]], the bourgeois during Middle Ages usually was a self-employed businessman – such as a merchant, banker, or entrepreneur – whose economic role in society was being the financial intermediary to the [[feudal]] [[landlord]] and the [[peasant]] who worked the [[fief]], the land of the lord. Yet, by the 18th century, the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1750–1850) and of industrial capitalism, the bourgeoisie had become the economic ruling class who owned the means of production (capital and land), and who controlled the means of coercion (armed forces and legal system, police forces and prison system).

In such a society, the bourgeoisie's ownership of the means of production allowed them to employ and exploit the wage-earning working class (urban and rural), people whose only economic means is labour; and the bourgeois control of the means of coercion suppressed the sociopolitical challenges by the lower classes, and so preserved the economic status quo; workers remained workers, and employers remained employers.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1850/class-struggles-france/index.htm The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850], Works of [[Karl Marx]], 1850</ref>

In the 19th century, Marx distinguished two types of bourgeois capitalist: (i) the functional capitalists, who are business administrators of the means of production; and (ii) rentier capitalists whose livelihoods derive either from the [[Economic rent|rent]] of property or from the [[interest]]-income produced by finance capital, or both.<ref>''A Dictionary of Marxist Thought'', T.B. Bottomore, p. 272</ref> In the course of economic relations, the working class and the bourgeoisie continually engage in [[class struggle]], where the capitalists [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] the workers, while the workers resist their economic exploitation, which occurs because the worker owns no means of production, and, to earn a living, seeks employment from the bourgeois capitalist; the worker produces goods and services that are property of the employer, who sells them for a price.

Besides describing the [[social class]] who owns the [[means of production]], the Marxist use of the term "bourgeois" also describes the [[Consumerism|consumerist]] style of life derived from the ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[real property]]. Marx acknowledged the bourgeois industriousness that created wealth, but criticised the moral hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie when they ignored the alleged origins of their wealth: the exploitation of the proletariat, the urban and rural workers. Further sense denotations of "bourgeois" describe ideological concepts such as "bourgeois freedom", which is thought to be opposed to substantive forms of freedom; "bourgeois independence"; "bourgeois personal individuality"; the "bourgeois family"; et cetera, all derived from owning capital and property (see ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', 1848).

===France and French-speaking countries===
In English, the term ''bourgeoisie'' is often used to denote the middle classes. In fact, the French term encompasses both the upper and middle classes,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AHZMAiFx2EC&q=bourgeoisie+French+term&pg=PA23|title=French Bourgeois Culture |author= Béatrix Le Wita, J. A. Underwood |isbn=9780521466264 |date=1994-06-16 }}</ref> a misunderstanding which has occurred in other languages as well. The bourgeoisie in France and many French-speaking countries consists of four evolving social layers: ''petite bourgeoisie'', ''moyenne bourgeoisie'', ''grande bourgeoisie'', and ''haute bourgeoisie''.

====''Petite bourgeoisie''====
{{Main|Petite Bourgeoisie}}
The ''petite bourgeoisie'' is the equivalent of the modern-day middle class, or refers to "a social class between the middle class and the lower class: the lower middle class".<ref>{{cite web|title=the petite bourgeoisie |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20petite%20bourgeoisie |website=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=26 January 2018}}</ref>

====''Moyenne bourgeoisie''====
The ''moyenne bourgeoisie'' or middle bourgeoisie contains people who have solid incomes and assets, but not the aura of those who have become established at a higher level. They tend to belong to a family that has been bourgeois for three or more generations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some members of this class may have relatives from similar backgrounds, or may even have aristocratic connections. The ''moyenne bourgeoisie'' is the equivalent of the British and American upper-middle classes.

====''Grande bourgeoisie''====
The ''grande bourgeoisie'' are families that have been bourgeois since the 19th century, or for at least four or five generations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Members of these families tend to marry with the aristocracy or make other advantageous marriages. This bourgeois family has acquired an established historical and cultural heritage over the decades. The names of these families are generally known in the city where they reside, and their ancestors have often contributed to the region's history. These families are respected and revered. They belong to the upper class, and in the British class system are considered part of the gentry. {{citation needed span|In the French-speaking countries, they are sometimes referred ''la petite haute bourgeoisie''.|date=December 2016}}

====''Haute bourgeoisie''====
The ''haute bourgeoisie'' is a social rank in the bourgeoisie that can only be acquired through time. In France, it is composed of bourgeois families that have existed since the French Revolution.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} They hold only honourable professions and have experienced many illustrious marriages in their family's history. They have rich cultural and historical heritages, and their financial means are more than secure.

These families exude an aura of nobility, which prevents them from certain marriages or occupations. They differ from nobility only in that because of circumstances, the lack of opportunity, and/or political regime, they have not been ennobled. These people nevertheless live lavishly, enjoying the company of the great artists of the time. In France, the families of the ''haute bourgeoisie'' are also referred to as ''les 200 familles'', a term coined in the first half of the 20th century. Michel Pinçon and Monique Pinçon-Charlot studied the lifestyle of the French bourgeoisie, and how they boldly guard their world from the ''nouveau riche'', or newly rich.

In the French language, the term ''bourgeoisie'' almost designates a caste by itself, even though social mobility into this socio-economic group is possible. Nevertheless, the ''bourgeoisie'' is differentiated from ''la classe moyenne'', or the middle class, which consists mostly of white-collar employees, by holding a profession referred to as a ''profession libérale'', which ''la classe moyenne'', in its definition does not hold.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Yet, in English the definition of a white-collar job encompasses the ''profession libérale''.

===Nazism===

[[Nazism]] rejected the [[Marxist]] concept of [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] [[class struggle]], but supported the "class struggle between nations", and sought to resolve internal class struggle in the nation while it identified Germany as a [[proletariat]] nation fighting against [[plutocratic]] nations.{{sfn|Nicholls|Nicholls|2000|p=245}}

The [[Nazi Party]] had many working-class supporters and members, and a strong appeal to the [[middle class]]. The financial collapse of the [[White-collar worker|white collar]] middle-class of the 1920s figures much in their strong support of Nazism.<ref name="Burleigh, 2000. p. 77">Burleigh, Michael. ''The Third Reich: A New History'', New York, USA: Hill and Wang, 2000. p. 77.</ref> In the poor country that was the [[Weimar Republic]] of the early 1930s, the Nazi Party realised their social policies with food and shelter for the unemployed and the homeless—who were later recruited into the Brownshirt ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA – Storm Detachments).<ref name="Burleigh, 2000. p. 77"/>

Hitler was impressed by the [[Populism|populist]] [[antisemitism]] and the anti-liberal bourgeois agitation of [[Karl Lueger]], who as the mayor of Vienna during Hitler's time in the city, used a rabble-rousing style of oratory that appealed to the wider masses.{{sfn|Nicholls|Nicholls|2000|pp=159–160}} When asked whether he supported the "bourgeois right-wing", [[Adolf Hitler]] claimed that [[Nazism]] was not exclusively for any [[Nazism#Social class|class]], and he also indicated that it favoured neither the [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor the [[right-wing politics|right]], but preserved "pure" elements from both "camps", stating: "From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism".<ref name="commentary">Adolf Hitler, Max Domarus. ''The Essential Hitler: Speeches and Commentary''. pp. 171, 172–173.</ref>

Hitler distrusted capitalism for being unreliable due to its [[egotism]], and he preferred a state-directed economy that is subordinated to the interests of the ''[[Volk]]''.{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=399}}

Hitler told a party leader in 1934, "The economic system of our day is the creation of the Jews".{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=399}} Hitler said to [[Benito Mussolini]] that capitalism had "run its course".{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=399}} Hitler also said that the business bourgeoisie "know nothing except their profit. 'Fatherland' is only a word for them."{{sfn|Overy|2004|p=230}} Hitler was personally disgusted with the ruling bourgeois elites of Germany during the period of the Weimar Republic, who he referred to as "cowardly shits".<ref>Kritika: explorations in Russian and Eurasian history, Volume 7, Issue 4. Slavica Publishers, 2006. Pp. 922.</ref>

==Modern history in Italy==
Because of their ascribed cultural excellence as a social class, the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascist]] régime (1922–45) of Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] regarded the bourgeoisie as an obstacle to [[Modernism]].<ref name="Bellassai05">Bellassai, Sandro (2005) "The Masculine Mystique: Anti-Modernism and Virility in Fascist Italy", ''Journal of Modern Italian Studies'', 3, pp. 314–335.</ref> Nonetheless, the Fascist State ideologically exploited the Italian bourgeoisie and their materialistic, middle-class spirit, for the more efficient cultural manipulation of the upper (aristocratic) and the lower (working) classes of Italy.

In 1938, Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech wherein he established a clear ideological distinction between capitalism (the social function of the bourgeoisie) and the bourgeoisie (as a social class), whom he dehumanised by reducing them into high-level abstractions: a moral category and a state of mind.<ref name="Bellassai05" /> Culturally and philosophically, Mussolini isolated the bourgeoisie from Italian society by portraying them as social parasites upon the fascist Italian state and "The People"; as a social class who drained the human potential of Italian society, in general, and of the working class, in particular; as exploiters who victimised the Italian nation with an approach to life characterised by [[hedonism]] and [[Consumption (economics)|materialism]].<ref name="Bellassai05" /> Nevertheless, despite the slogan ''The Fascist Man Disdains the ″Comfortable″ Life'', which epitomised the anti-bourgeois principle, in its final years of power, for mutual benefit and profit, the Mussolini fascist régime transcended ideology to merge the political and financial interests of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini with the political and financial interests of the bourgeoisie, the Catholic social circles who constituted the [[ruling class]] of Italy.

Philosophically, as a [[Materialism|materialist]] creature, the bourgeois man was stereotyped as irreligious; thus, to establish an [[Existentialism|existential]] distinction between the supernatural faith of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the materialist faith of temporal religion; in ''The Autarchy of Culture: Intellectuals and Fascism in the 1930s'', the priest Giuseppe Marino said that:

{{quote|Christianity is essentially anti-bourgeois. ... A Christian, a true Christian, and thus a [[Catholic (Christian terminology)#Use by the Catholic Church|Catholic]], is the opposite of a bourgeois.<ref>Marino, Giuseppe Carlo (1983) ''L'autarchia della cultura. Intellettuali e fascismo negli anni trenta'', Roma: [[Editori Riuniti]].</ref>}}

Culturally, the bourgeois man may be considered effeminate, infantile, or acting in a pretentious manner; describing his [[philistinism]] in ''Bonifica antiborghese'' (1939), Roberto Paravese comments on the:

{{quote|Middle class, middle man, incapable of great virtue or great vice: and there would be nothing wrong with that, if only he would be willing to remain as such; but, when his child-like or feminine tendency to camouflage pushes him to dream of grandeur, honours, and thus riches, which he cannot achieve honestly with his own "second-rate" powers, then the average man compensates with cunning, schemes, and mischief; he kicks out ethics, and becomes a bourgeois.

The bourgeois is the average man who does not accept to remain such, and who, lacking the strength sufficient for the conquest of essential values—those of the spirit—opts for material ones, for appearances.<ref name=paravese39>Paravese, Roberto (1939) "Bonifica antiborghese", in Edgardo Sulis (ed.), ''Processo alla borghesia'', Roma: Edizioni Roma, pp. 51–70.</ref>}}

The economic security, [[discretionary income|financial freedom]], and social mobility of the bourgeoisie threatened the philosophic integrity of [[Italian fascism]], the [[ideology|ideological monolith]] that was the [[fascist regime|régime]] of Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. Any assumption of [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] political power (government and rule) by the bourgeoisie represented a fascist loss of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state power for social control through political unity—one people, one nation, and one leader. Sociologically, to the fascist man, to become a bourgeois was a character flaw inherent to the masculine mystique; therefore, the ideology of Italian fascism scornfully defined the bourgeois man as "spiritually castrated".<ref name="paravese39" />

==Bourgeois culture==

=== Cultural hegemony ===
Karl Marx said that the culture of a society is dominated by the [[Cultural hegemony|mores of the ruling-class]], wherein their superimposed [[value system]] is abided by each social class (the upper, the middle, the lower) regardless of the socio-economic results it yields to them. In that sense, contemporary societies are bourgeois to the degree that they practice the [[mores]] of the small-business "shop culture" of early modern France; which the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902) [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistically]] presented, analysed, and ridiculed in the twenty-two-novel series (1871–1893) about ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'' family; the thematic thrust is the necessity for social progress, by subordinating the economic sphere to the social sphere of life.<ref>Émile Zola, ''Le Rougon-Macquart'' (1871–1893).</ref>

=== Conspicuous consumption ===
[[File:Żywiecki strój mieszczański 01.jpg|thumb|Clothing worn by ladies belonging to the bourgeoisie of Żywiec, Poland, 19th century (collection of the Żywiec City Museum)]]
The critical analyses of the bourgeois mentality by the German intellectual [[Walter Benjamin]] (1892–1940) indicated that the shop culture of the [[petite bourgeoisie]] established the sitting room as the centre of personal and family life; as such, the English bourgeois culture is, he alleges, a sitting-room culture of [[social class|prestige]] through [[conspicuous consumption]]. The [[Consumerism|material culture]] of the bourgeoisie concentrated on mass-produced [[luxury goods]] of high quality; between generations, the only variance was the materials with which the goods were manufactured.

In the early part of the 19th century, the bourgeois house contained a home that first was stocked and decorated with hand-painted [[porcelain]], machine-printed cotton fabrics, machine-printed [[wallpaper]], and Sheffield steel ([[crucible steel|crucible]] and [[stainless steel|stainless]]). The [[utility]] of these things was inherent to their practical functions. By the latter part of the 19th century, the bourgeois house contained a home that had been remodelled by conspicuous consumption. Here, Benjamin argues, the goods were bought to display wealth ([[discretionary income]]), rather than for their practical utility. The bourgeoisie had transposed the wares of the shop window to the sitting room, where the clutter of display signalled bourgeois success.<ref name="Benjamin">[[Walter Benjamin]], ''The Halles Project''.</ref> (See: ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'', 1869.)

Two spatial constructs manifest the bourgeois mentality: (i) the shop-window display, and (ii) the sitting room. In English, the term "sitting-room culture" is synonymous for "bourgeois mentality", a "[[Philistinism|philistine]]" cultural perspective from the [[Victorian Era]] (1837–1901), especially characterised by the repression of emotion and of sexual desire; and by the construction of a regulated social-space where "[[Victorian morality|propriety]]" is the key personality trait desired in men and women.<ref name="Benjamin" />

Nonetheless, from such a psychologically constricted [[worldview]], regarding the rearing of children, contemporary sociologists claim to have identified "progressive" middle-class values, such as respect for non-conformity, self-direction, [[autonomy]], [[gender equality]] and the encouragement of innovation; as in the Victorian Era, the transposition to the US of the bourgeois system of social values has been identified as a requisite for employment success in the professions.<ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | id = 0-534-50520-1}}</ref><ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian |author2=Stacey C.

Bourgeois values are dependent on [[rationalism]], which began with the economic sphere and moves into every sphere of life which is formulated by Max Weber.<ref name="General economic history">{{cite book | last = Weber | first = Max | author-link = Max Weber| year = 1927 | title = General economic history | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = UK: London | id = 1306359007 }}</ref> The beginning of rationalism is commonly called the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]. Much like the Marxist critics of that period, Weber was concerned with the growing ability of large corporations and nations to increase their power and reach throughout the world.

Yet, in the children of Buddenbrook Jr., the materially comfortable style of life provided by the dedication to solid, middle-class [[Value system|values]] elicits decadence: The fickle daughter, Toni, lacks and does not seek a purpose in life; son Christian is honestly decadent, and lives the life of a ne'er-do-well; and the businessman son, Thomas, who assumes command of the Buddenbrook family fortune, occasionally falters from middle-class solidity by being interested in art and philosophy, the impractical [[Intellectualism|life of the mind]], which, to the bourgeoisie, is the epitome of social, moral, and material decadence.{{sfn|Benét|1987|p=118, 137}}<ref>Charles Neider, ''The Stature of Thomas Mann'' (1968)</ref><ref>Wolfgang Beutin, ''A history of German Literature: From the Beginnings to the Present Day'' (1993) Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-415-06034-6}}, p. 433.</ref>

''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'' (1922), by [[Sinclair Lewis]] (1885–1951), satirizes the American bourgeois George Follansbee Babbitt, a middle-aged [[realtor]], [[Boosterism|booster]], and joiner in the Midwestern city of Zenith, who – despite being unimaginative, self-important, and hopelessly conformist and middle-class – is aware that there must be more to life than money and the [[Conspicuous consumption|consumption]] of the best things that money can buy. Nevertheless, he fears [[Ostracism|being excluded]] from the mainstream of society more than he does living for himself, by [[Authenticity (philosophy)|being true to himself]] – his heart-felt flirtations with independence (dabbling in [[Liberalism|liberal politics]] and a love affair with a pretty widow) come to naught because he is existentially afraid.[[File:Luis Buñuel.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The Spanish cinéast [[Luis Buñuel]] (1900–83) depicted the tortuous mentality and self-destructive hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie]]

Yet, George F. Babbitt sublimates his desire for self-respect, and encourages his son to rebel against the conformity that results from bourgeois prosperity, by recommending that he be true to himself:
