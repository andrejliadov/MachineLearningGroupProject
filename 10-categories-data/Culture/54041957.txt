'''Engineering biology''' is the set of methods for designing, building, and testing engineered [[biological system]]s which have been used to manipulate information, construct materials, process chemicals, produce energy, provide food, and help maintain or enhance human health and environment.<ref>Endy, D. (2005). Foundations for engineering biology. ''Nature'', 438(7067), 449-453. doi:[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7067/abs/nature04342.html 10.1038/nature04342]</ref>

== History ==
Rapid advances in the ability to [[Genetic engineering|genetically modify]] biological organisms have advanced a new engineering discipline, commonly referred to as [[synthetic biology]]. This approach seeks to harness the power of living systems for a variety of manufacturing applications, such as advanced therapeutics, [[Sustainability|sustainable]] fuels, chemical feedstocks, and advanced materials. To date, research in synthetic biology has typically relied on trial-and-error approaches, which are costly, laborious, and inefficient.<ref>Hutchison, C. A., Chuang, R. Y., Noskov, V. N., Assad-Garcia, N., Deerinck, T. J., Ellisman, M. H., ... & Pelletier, J. F. (2016). Design and synthesis of a minimal bacterial genome. Science, 351(6280), aad6253. doi: [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/aad6253 10.1126/science.aad6253]</ref>
