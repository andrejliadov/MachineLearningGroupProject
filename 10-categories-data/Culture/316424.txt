The '''Three Kingdoms of Korea''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=삼국시대|hanja=三國時代}}) refers to the three kingdoms of [[Goguryeo]] (고구려, 高句麗), [[Baekje]] (백제, 百濟), and [[Silla]] (신라, 新羅). [[Goguryeo]] was later known as Goryeo (고려, 高麗), from which the modern name ''[[Korea]]'' is derived. The Three Kingdoms period is defined as being from 57 BC to 668 AD (but there existed about 78 tribal states in the southern region of the Korean Peninsula and relatively big states like [[Okjeo]], [[Buyeo]], and [[Dongye]] in its northern part and Manchuria).

The three kingdoms occupied the entire [[Korean Peninsula]] and roughly half of [[Manchuria]], located in present-day [[China]] and [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kotkin|first1=Stephen|last2=Wolff|first2=David|title=Rediscovering Russia in Asia: Siberia and the Russian Far East: Siberia and the Russian Far East|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317461296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_DqBgAAQBAJ&q=Koguryo+Siberia+Russia%27s|accessdate=15 July 2016|language=en|date=2015-03-04}}</ref> The kingdoms of Baekje and Silla dominated the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and [[Tamna]] ([[Jeju Island]]), whereas Goguryeo controlled the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Manchuria]] and the northern half of the Korean Peninsula. Baekje and Goguryeo shared founding myths which likely originated from [[Buyeo]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=The National Folk Museum of Korea (South Korea)|title=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Literature: Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture Vol. III|date=2014|publisher=길잡이미디어|isbn=9788928900848|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DsR3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In the 7th century, allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Silla]] unified the Korean Peninsula for the first time in Korean history, allowing for the first united Korean national identity. After the fall of Baekje and Goguryeo, the [[Tang dynasty]] established a short-lived [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East|military government]] to administer parts of the Korean peninsula. However, as a result of the [[Silla–Tang War]] (≈670–676 AD), Silla forces expelled the Protectorate armies from the peninsula in 676 AD. The following period is known as the Unified Silla or Later Silla (668–935 AD).

Subsequently, [[Go of Balhae]], a former Goguryeo general, founded [[Balhae]] in the former territory of Goguryeo after defeating the [[Tang dynasty]] at the [[Battle of Tianmenling]].

The predecessor period, before the development of the full-fledged kingdoms, is sometimes called [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea|Proto–Three Kingdoms period]].

Main primary sources for this period include ''[[Samguk sagi]]'' and ''[[Samguk yusa]]'' in Korea, and the "Eastern Barbarians" section (東夷傳) from the ''Book of Wei'' (魏書) of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in China.

==Names==
{{See also|Names of Korea}}
Beginning in the 7th century, the name "[[Samhan]]" became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The "Han" in the names of the [[Korean Empire]], ''Daehan Jeguk'', and the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea), ''Daehan Minguk'' or ''Hanguk'', are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.<ref name="kyunghyang">{{cite web |last1=이기환 |title=[이기환의 흔적의 역사]국호논쟁의 전말…대한민국이냐 고려공화국이냐 |url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201708300913001&code=960100&www |website=경향신문 |publisher=The Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |date=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref name="chosun">{{cite web |last1=이덕일 |title=[이덕일 사랑] 대~한민국 |url=http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/08/14/2008081401512.html |website=조선닷컴 |publisher=Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Samguk sagi]]'' and ''[[Samguk yusa]]'', [[Silla]] implemented a national policy, "Samhan Unification" ({{Korean|삼한일통|三韓一統|labels=no}}), to integrate [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] refugees. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in [[Cheongju]] with an inscription: "The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded."<ref name="kyunghyang" /> During the [[Later Silla]] period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged.<ref name="kyunghyang" /> In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, [[Choe Chiwon]] equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo.<ref name="chosun" /> By the [[Goryeo]] period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea.<ref name="kyunghyang" /> In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, [[Wang Geon]] declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.<ref name="kyunghyang" /><ref name="chosun" /> Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the [[Joseon]] period and was widely referenced in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].<ref name="kyunghyang" />

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century.<ref name="National">{{cite web |title=고현묘지명(高玄墓誌銘) |url=http://gsm.nricp.go.kr/_third/user/frame.jsp?View=search&No=4&ksmno=7190 |website=한국금석문 종합영상정보시스템 |publisher=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage |accessdate=10 September 2018}}</ref> The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref name="kwon">{{cite journal |last1=Deok-young |first1=Kwon |title=An inquiry into the name of Three Kingdom(三國) inscribed on the epitaph of T'ang(唐) period |journal=The Journal of Korean Ancient History |date=2014 |volume=75 |pages=105–137 |url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02486618 |accessdate=2 July 2018 |language=ko |issn=1226-6213}}</ref> Goguryeo was alternately called [[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]] by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals "Mahan leaders" ({{Korean|마한추장|馬韓酋長|labels=no}}) in 645.<ref name="National" /> In 651, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan.<ref name="kyunghyang" /> Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea "Samhan", especially Goguryeo.<ref name="kwon" /> For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon ({{Korean|고현|高玄|labels=no}}), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a "Liaodong Samhan man" ({{Korean|요동 삼한인|遼東 三韓人|labels=no}}).<ref name="National" /> The [[History of Liao]] equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.<ref name="chosun" />

The name "Three Kingdoms" was used in the titles of the Korean histories ''[[Samguk sagi]]'' (12th&nbsp;century) and ''[[Samguk yusa]]'' (13th&nbsp;century), and should not be confused with the [[Three Kingdoms]] of China.

==Background==
[[File:7th century painting of Koreans.png|thumb|left|7th century Tang dynasty painting of envoys from the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla]]
The Three Kingdoms were founded after the fall of [[Wiman Joseon]], and gradually conquered and absorbed various other small states and confederacies. After the fall of Gojoseon, the [[Han dynasty]] established four [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] in present [[Liaoning]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/5880-2-5623.pdf |title=The Puyeo-Koguryeo Ye-maek the Sushen-Yilou Tungus, and the Xianbei Yan |author=Hong, Wontack |pages=1–7 |journal=East Asian History: A Korean Perspective |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=2005}}</ref> Three fell quickly to the [[Samhan]], and the last was destroyed by Goguryeo in 313.

The nascent precursors of [[Baekje]] and [[Silla]] expanded within the web of statelets during the [[Proto Three Kingdoms]] Period, and [[Goguryeo]] conquered neighboring state like [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]] in [[Manchuria]] and chiefdoms in [[Okjeo]], [[Dongye]] which occupied the northeastern Korean peninsula. The three polities made the transition from walled-town state to full-fledged state-level societies between 1st – 3rd century AD.

All three kingdoms shared a similar culture and language. Their original religions appear to have been [[shamanism|shamanistic]], but they were increasingly influenced by Chinese culture, particularly [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]. In the 4th century, [[Buddhism]] was introduced to the peninsula and spread rapidly, briefly becoming the official religion of all three kingdoms.

==Goguryeo==
{{main|Goguryeo}}
{{see also|Military history of Goguryeo}}

[[File:Goguryeo tomb mural.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Goguryeo tomb mural]]
[[Goguryeo]] emerged on the north and south banks of the [[Yalu River|Yalu (Amrok)]] River, in the wake of [[Gojoseon]]'s fall. The first mention of Goguryeo in Chinese records dates from 75 BC in reference to a commandery established by the Chinese [[Han dynasty]], although even earlier mentions of "Guri" (구리) may be of the same state. Evidence indicates Goguryeo was the most advanced, and likely the first established, of the three kingdoms.

Goguryeo, eventually the largest of the three kingdoms, had several capitals in alternation: two capitals in the upper Yalu area, and later Nangrang (''[[Lelang]]'' in Chinese) which is now part of [[Pyongyang]]. At the beginning, the state was located on the border with [[China]]; it gradually expanded into Manchuria and destroyed the Chinese [[Lelang commandery]] in 313. The cultural influence of the Chinese continued as Buddhism was adopted as the official religion in 372.

Goguryeo was a highly militaristic state;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=Ki-baek|title=A New History of Korea|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674615762|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&pg=PA23|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|year=1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Hugh Dyson|title=East Asia: A New History|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477265161|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z3a0NU4RHMC&q=%22Citizens+of+Koguryo+concentrated+on+maintaining+their+military+strength%2C+being+similar+in+this+respect+to+the+ancient+Greek+city-state+Sparta.%22|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=November 2012}}</ref> it was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in [[East Asia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=John Morris|last2=Westad|first2=Odd Arne|title=The History of the World|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199936762|page=443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2cfZkU5aQgC&q=koguryo+powerful+empire|accessdate=15 July 2016|language=en|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Hall|title=Averting Global War: Regional Challenges, Overextension, and Options for American Strategy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230608733|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acvGAAAAQBAJ&q=great+powers|accessdate=15 July 2016|language=en|date=2007-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Laet|first1=Sigfried J. de|title=History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=9789231028137|page=1133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&pg=PA1133|accessdate=10 October 2016|language=en|year=1994}}</ref><ref name="Walker">{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Hugh Dyson|title=East Asia: A New History|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477265178|pages=6–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBvRs-za0CIC&pg=PA6|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=2012-11-20}}</ref> The state was at its zenith in the fifth century, during the rule of [[Gwanggaeto the Great|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] and his son [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]], and particularly during their campaign in Manchuria.

Goguryeo controlled not only Koreans but also Chinese and Tungusic tribes in Manchuria. After the establishment of the [[Sui Dynasty]] and later the [[Tang Dynasty]] in China, the state continued to take aggressive actions against China, Silla, and Baekje until it was conquered by allied Silla–Tang forces in 668. Most of its territory was absorbed by Tang Dynasty of China and the territory of Baekje was absorbed by Silla.

==Baekje==
{{main|Baekje}} 
[[Baekje]] was founded as a member of the [[Mahan confederacy]]. Two sons of the [[Dongmyeong of Goguryeo|founder of Goguryeo]] are recorded to have fled a succession conflict, to establish Baekje around the present [[Seoul]] area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Chairman Department of East Asian Studies Keith|last2=Pratt|first2=Keith|last3=Rutt|first3=Richard|title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136793936|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r15cAgAAQBAJ&q=%22prince+of+Koguryo%22|accessdate=22 July 2016|language=en|date=2013-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Chai-Shin|title=The New History of Korean Civilization|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462055593|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYKNdiDCGLAC&pg=PA27|accessdate=22 July 2016|language=en|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Jinwung|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253000781|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFPsi3IK8gcC&q=%22son+of+Chumong%22|accessdate=22 July 2016|language=en|date=2012-11-05}}</ref>

Baekje absorbed or conquered other Mahan chiefdoms and, at its peak in the 4th century, controlled most of the western Korean peninsula. Buddhism was introduced to Baekje in 384 from Goguryeo, which Baekje welcomed.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Baekje exerted its political influence on [[Tamna]], a kingdom that ruled [[Jejudo]]. Baekje maintained a close relationship with and extracted tribute from Tamna. Baekje's religious and artistic culture influenced [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]].

Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of [[Geunchogo of Baekje|Geunchogo]],<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Korea|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|isbn=9788973006199|pages=29–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-WlUd3cjh0C&pg=PT29|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=2005-01-01}}</ref> but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto and declined.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Chai-Shin|title=The New History of Korean Civilization|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781462055593|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYKNdiDCGLAC&pg=PA27|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|year=2012}}</ref>

In the late 5th century, under attack from Goguryeo, the capital of Baekje was moved south to Ungjin (present-day [[Gongju]]) and later further south to [[Sabi (Korea)|Sabi]] (present-day [[Buyeo County|Buyeo]]).

==Silla==
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], 7th century]]
{{main|Silla}}
According to Korean records, in 57 BC, Seorabeol (or Saro, later [[Silla]]) in the southeast of the peninsula unified and expanded the confederation of city-states known as [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]]. Although ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'' records that Silla was the earliest-founded of the three kingdoms, other written and archaeological records indicate that Silla was likely the last of the three to establish a centralized government.

Silla was the smallest and weakest of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its great advantage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Jinwung|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253000248|pages=44–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2EVi-MpnUsC&pg=PA44|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Korea: Outline of a Civilisation|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004300057|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zoLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18|accessdate=12 September 2016|language=en|date=2015-07-03}}</ref>

Renamed from Saro to Silla in 503, the kingdom annexed the [[Gaya confederacy]] (which in turn had absorbed [[Byeonhan confederacy|Byeonhan]] earlier) in the first half of the 6th century. Goguryeo and Baekje responded by forming an alliance. To cope with invasions from Goguryeo and Baekje, Silla deepened its relations with the Tang Dynasty, with her newly gained access to the Yellow Sea making direct contact with the Tang possible. After the conquest of Goguryeo and Baekje with her Tang allies, the Silla kingdom drove the Tang forces out of the peninsula and occupied the lands south of Pyongyang.

The capital of Silla was Seorabeol (now [[Gyeongju]]; "Seorabeol", "서라벌", is hypothesized to have been the ancient Korean term for "capital"). [[Buddhism]] became the official religion in 528. The remaining material culture from the kingdom of Silla including unique gold metalwork shows influence from the northern nomadic steppes, differentiating it from the culture of Goguryeo and Baekje where Chinese influence was more pronounced.

==Other states==
Other smaller states or regions existed in Korea before and during this period:
*[[Gaya confederacy]], until annexed by Silla and Baekje<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Shoki</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2020}}
*[[Dongye]], [[Okjeo]], and [[Buyeo (state)|Buyeo]], all three conquered by Goguryeo
*[[Usan-guk|Usan]] ([[Ulleung-do]]) tributary of Silla
*[[Tamna]] ([[Jeju-do]]) tributary of Baekje
[[File:Korea-Gaya Warrior.jpg|thumb|right|A Gaya soldier.]]

==Fate==
Allied with [[China]] under the [[Tang dynasty]], Silla conquered Goguryeo in 668, after having already conquered Gaya in 562 and Baekje in 660, thus ushering in the North-South states period with [[Unified Silla|Later Silla]] to the south and [[Balhae]] to the north, when [[Dae Jo-young]], a former Goguryeo military officer, revolted against Tang Chinese rule and began reconquering former Goguryeo territories.

==Archaeological perspectives==
[[File:Pressapochista15.jpg|thumb|left|140px|An unusual drinking vessel excavated from a Gaya mounded burial.]] 
Archaeologists use [[Archaeological theory|theoretical]] guidelines derived from [[anthropology]], [[ethnology]], analogy, and [[ethnohistory]] to the concept of what defines a [[Sociocultural evolution|state-level society]]. This is different from the concept of state (''guk'' or [[Chinese language|Sino]] ko: 國, walled-town state, etc.) in the discipline of Korean History.

In anthropological [[archaeology]] the presence of urban centres (especially capitals), monumental architecture, craft specialization and standardization of production, ostentatious burials, [[Writing system|writing or recording systems]], [[bureaucracy]], demonstrated political control of geographical areas that are usually larger in area than a single river valley, etc. make up some of these correlates that define states.<ref name="Rhee">{{cite journal|author1=Rhee, S.N.  |author2=Choi, M.L. |name-list-style=amp |title=Emergence of complex society in Korea|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=6|pages=51–95|doi=10.1007/BF00997585|year=1992|s2cid=145722584 }}</ref> Among the archaeology sites dating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, hundreds of cemeteries with thousands of [[burial]]s have been excavated.

Some individual correlates of complex societies are found in the chiefdoms of Korea that date back to c. 700 BC (e.g. see [[Igeum-dong]], [[Songguk-ri]]).<ref name=Rhee/><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bale, Martin T.  |author2=Ko, Min-jung  |name-list-style=amp |year=2006|title= Craft Production and Social Change in Mumun Pottery Period Korea|journal=Asian Perspectives|volume=45|issue=2|pages=159–187|doi=10.1353/asi.2006.0019|hdl=10125/17250  |s2cid=55944795 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> However, the best evidence from the archaeological record in Korea indicates that states formed between 300 BC and 300/400 AD.<ref name=Kang1995/><ref name=Kang2000/><ref>Barnes, Gina L.

The correlates of state-level societies did not develop as a package, but rather in spurts and starts and at various points in time. It was some time between 100–400 AD that individual correlates of state societies had developed to a sufficient number and scale that state-level societies can be confidently identified using archaeological data.

===Burials===

Lee Sung-joo analyzed variability in many of the [[elite]] cemeteries of the territories of Silla and Gaya polities and found that as late as the 2nd century there was intra-cemetery variation in the distribution of prestige [[grave goods]], but there was an absence of hierarchical differences on a regional scale between cemeteries. Near the end of the 2nd century AD, interior space in elite burials increased in size, and wooden chamber burial construction techniques were increasingly used by elites. In the 3rd century, a pattern developed in which single elite cemeteries that were the highest in status compared to all the other cemeteries were built. Such cemeteries were established at high elevations along ridgelines and on hilltops. Furthermore, the uppermost elite were buried in large-scale tombs established at the highest point of a given cemetery.<ref name=Lee/> Cemeteries with 'uppermost elite' mounded burials such as Okseong-ri, Yangdong-ri, Daeseong-dong, and Bokcheon-dong display this pattern.

===Factory-scale production of pottery and roof-tiles===

Lee Sung-joo proposed that, in addition to the development of regional political hierarchies as seen through analysis of burials, variation in types of pottery production gradually disappeared and full-time specialization was the only recognizable kind of pottery production from the end of the 4th century A.D. At the same time the production centers for pottery became highly centralized and vessels became [[standardized]].<ref name=Lee/>

[[Centralisation]] and elite control of production is demonstrated by the results of the archaeological excavations at Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ni in [[Gyeongju]]. These sites are part of what was an interconnected and sprawling ancient industrial complex on the northeast outskirts of the Silla capital. Songok-dong and Mulcheon-ri are an example of the large-scale of specialized [[factory]]-style production in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla Periods. The site was excavated in the late 1990s, and archaeologists found the remains of many production features such as [[pottery]] [[kiln]]s, roof-tile kilns, [[charcoal]] kilns, as well as the remains of buildings and [[workshop]]s associated with production.

===Capital cities, elite precincts, and monumental architecture===

Since the establishment of Goguryeo, its early history is well attested archaeologically: The first and second [[Capital Cities and Tombs of the Ancient Koguryo Kingdom|capital cities]], [[Wunü Mountain|Jolbon]] and [[Gungnae Fortress|Gungnae]] city, are located in and around today's [[Ji'an, Jilin]]. In 2004, the site was designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. Since 1976, continuing archaeological excavations concentrated in the southeastern part of modern [[Gyeongju]] have revealed parts of the so-called ''Silla Wanggyeong'' (Silla royal capital). A number of excavations over the years have revealed [[Buddhist temple|temples]] such as [[Hwangnyongsa]], Bunhwangsa, Heungryunsa, and 30 other sites. Signs of Baekje's capitals have also been excavated at the Mongchon Fortress and the [[Pungnap Toseong|Pungnap Fortress]] in [[Seoul]].
