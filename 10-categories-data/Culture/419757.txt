{{nihongo|'''''Gekiga'''''|劇画}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for [[comics]] that literally means "dramatic pictures". It describes comics aimed at adult audiences with a cinematic style and more mature themes. The name ''gekiga'' was coined in 1957 by [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]] and adopted by other more serious Japanese cartoonists, who did not want their trade to be known by the more common term [[manga]] or "whimsical pictures". It is akin to English speakers who prefer the term "[[graphic novel]]", as opposed to "[[comic book]]".

==History==

In the 1950s, mainstream manga came from Tokyo and was aimed at children, led by the work of [[Osamu Tezuka]].<ref name="FT">{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Leo|url=https://www.ft.com/content/734f95c0-7260-11e5-a129-3fcc4f641d98|title=Interview: 'Golgo 13' creator Takao Saito|date=2015-10-16|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref> Before Tezuka moved to Tokyo, he lived in Osaka and mentored artists such as [[Yoshihiro Tatsumi]] and Masahiko Matsumoto who admired him.<ref name="MatSon">{{cite web |last=Wells |first=Dominic |url=https://londonhollywood.wordpress.com/2014/09/23/meet-the-men-behind-manga-gekiga-exhibition-launches-at-london-cartoon-museum/|title=Meet the men behind manga: Gekiga exhibition launches at London Cartoon Museum |date=2014-09-23|publisher=London, Hollywood|access-date=2018-07-28}}</ref> Although influenced by Tezuka and his cinematic style, Tatsumi and his colleagues were not interested in making comics for children.

I would have an emotional reaction of some kind and want to express that in my comics."<ref name="JapTimes"/>

Irma Nunez of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' wrote that "Rather than simply use "gekiga" as a banner to legitimize adult content and realism in manga, however, they developed a whole new aesthetic."<ref name="JapTimes"/> Matsumoto's son said that these artists felt that the shorter stories Tezuka started writing after moving to Tokyo, narrowed his expression as action needed to be explained in speech bubbles.<ref name="MatSon"/> Nunez explained, "Structural integrity was one of the pioneers' primary concerns. They experimented with how best to blend images with the text; how a closeup might express the interiority of a character; how to synchronize a story's action with the pace of the reader's gaze as it covered the page."<ref name="JapTimes"/>

Rather than working for the mainstream publications, the ''gekiga'' artists worked in the rental manga industry; where the work of several artists were printed in collections, that readers borrowed from stores and then returned like video rentals.<ref name="Tatsumi">{{citation|last=Garner|first=Dwight|title=Manifesto of a Comic-Book Rebel | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-04-14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/books/15garn.html?_r=1|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref><ref name="museum">{{cite web |url=http://www.cartoonmuseum.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/50109-gekiga-alternative-manga-from-japan|title=Gekiga: Alternative Manga from Japan|publisher=[[The Cartoon Museum]]|access-date=2018-07-28}}</ref> In November 1956, Masahiko Matsumoto used the term {{nihongo|''komaga''|駒画|}} to describe his work ''Kyūketsu-jū'', instead of manga. Matsumoto's son later claimed this work was the basis for what would later be known as ''gekiga''.<ref name="MatSon"/> Yoshihiro Tatsumi's work ''Yūrei Taxi'' was the first to be called ''gekiga'' when it was published at the end of 1957.<ref name="crossroads">{{cite book|url={{Google books|GdwJAgAAQBAJ|page=53|plainurl=yes}}|title=Manga's Cultural Crossroads|last=Suzuki|first=Shige|year=2013|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=53}}</ref> Other names he considered include ''katsudōga'' and ''katsuga'', both derived from ''katsudō eiga'' or "moving pictures", an early term for films, showing the movement's cinematic influence.<ref name="mangatopia">{{cite book|url={{Google books|_2OHko5C2kYC|page=21|plainurl=yes}} |title=Mangatopia: Essays on Manga and Anime in the Modern World|last=Shamoon|first=Deborah|year=2011|publisher=[[Libraries Unlimited]]|page=21}}</ref>

In 1959, the {{nihongo|Gekiga Kōbō|劇画工房|}} formed in Tokyo with eight members, including Tatsumi, Matsumoto, and [[Takao Saito]].<ref name="museum"/> The group wrote a sort of "Gekiga Manifesto" that was sent to various publishers and newspapers declaring their mission.<ref name="Tatsumi"/><ref name="crossroads"/> The Gekiga Kōbō disbanded in 1960 over internal divisions;<ref name=Booker>Booker, M.

The avant-garde magazine ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]'', founded in 1964, was an outlet for experimental and unconventional works that were "visually or thematically too challenging for the mainstream market". With works like [[Sanpei Shirato]]'s ''[[Kamui (1964 manga)|Kamui]]'', it quickly gained a following among college students.<ref name="museum"/><ref name="Santos"/> In response to the success of ''Garo'', Tezuka founded the magazine ''[[COM (manga magazine)|COM]]'' in 1967 for more experimental works.<ref name="museum"/>

| quote  = What I aimed to do was increase the age of the readership of comics. It wasn't that I was trying to create anything literary, but I did want to create an older audience. I didn't do that single-handedly, but I did succeed to a certain level. And, again, part of that was accomplished out of necessity. There was an incommensurable difference between what I wanted to express and what you could express in children's comics.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the children who had grown up reading manga wanted something aimed at older audiences and ''gekiga'' provided that niche. [[The Cartoon Museum]] describes the ''gekiga'' audience: "Drawn in a more realistic and atmospheric style with grittier story lines, gegika attracted older teenagers, university students and eventually adult readers."<ref name="museum"/> That particular generation came to be known as the "manga generation" because it read manga as a form of rebellion, which was similar to the role that [[rock music]] played for [[hippies]] in the United States.

Some authors use the term ''gekiga'' to describe works that only have shock factor. In 1968, Tatsumi published ''Gekiga College'' because he felt ''gekiga'' was straying too far from its roots and wanted to reclaim its meaning.<ref name="Santos"/> In 2009, he said "Gekiga is a term people throw around now to describe any manga with violence or eroticism or any spectacle. It's become synonymous with spectacular. But I write manga about households and conversations, love affairs, mundane stuff that is not spectacular. I think that's the difference."<ref name="pop">{{cite web|last=Ho|first=Oliver|url=https://www.popmatters.com/109053-from-gekiga-to-good-raymond-connecting-japans--2496063480.html|title=From Gekiga to Good Raymond |date=2009-08-01|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=2018-07-28}}</ref>

The Cartoon Museum wrote that by the 1980s, ''gekiga'' became integrated into various types of manga. "For some younger people the term gekiga is now consigned to the history books, but its legacy lives on."<ref name="museum"/>

For a long time ''gekiga'' was not translated into other languages, but after 2000 more and more publishers dedicated to graphic novels began to explore the history of Japanese ''gekiga''. More recently publishers like [[Drawn & Quarterly]] began publishing several English editions of works by Tatsumi and [[Yoshiharu Tsuge]] among others, gaining more attention for the genre in the Western graphic novel market.
