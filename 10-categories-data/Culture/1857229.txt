{{Taoism condensed}}
The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|三|寶}}|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are theoretical cornerstones in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and practices such as [[Neidan]], [[Qigong]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]]. They are also known as '''Jing Qi Shen''' ({{zh|c=精氣神|p=''jīng-qì-shén''| w=''ching ch'i shen''}}; "essence, [[qi]], and spirit"). Despeux summarizes.
<blockquote>''Jing'', ''qi'', and ''shen'' are three of the main notions shared by Taoism and Chinese culture alike. They are often referred to as the Three Treasures (''sanbao'' {{lang|zh|三寶}}), an expression that immediately reveals their importance and the close connection among them. The ideas and practices associated with each term, and with the three terms as a whole, are complex and vary considerably in different contexts and historical periods. (2008:562) </blockquote>

This Chinese name ''sanbao'' originally referred to the Taoist "[[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Treasures]]" (from ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' 67, tr. Waley 1958:225, "pity", "frugality", and "refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven' ") and has subsequently also been used to refer to the Buddhist [[Three Jewels]] (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha). (This use is misleading, however, as the Three Jewels in Buddhism is a completely different philosophy.  The Buddha is the teacher, the Dharma is the teaching, and the Sangha is the community. The Three Jewels of Buddhism are the external supports for achieving realization, while the Three Treasures of Taoism are interior qualities or attitudes to be cultivated.)

In long-established Chinese traditions, the "Three Treasures" are the essential energies sustaining human life:
*''[[Jing (TCM)|Jing]]'' {{linktext|lang=zh|精}} "nutritive essence, essence; refined, perfected; extract; spirit, sperm, seed"
*''[[Qi]]'' {{linktext|lang=zh|氣}} "vitality, energy, force; air, vapor; breath; spirit, vigor; attitude"
*''[[Shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|Shen]]'' {{linktext|lang=zh|神}} "spirit; soul, mind; god, deity; supernatural being"
This ''jing-qi-shen'' ordering is more commonly used than the variants ''qi-jing-shen'' and ''shen-qi-jing''.

In ''Neidan'' "[[internal alchemy]]" practice (Despeux 2008:563), transmuting the Three Treasures is expressed through the phrases ''lianjing huaqi''  {{lang|zh|鍊精化氣}} "refining essence into breath", ''lianqi huashen''  {{lang|zh|鍊氣化神}} "refining breath into spirit", and ''lianshen huanxu''  {{lang|zh|鍊神還虛}} "refining spirit and reverting to Emptiness". Both ''Neidan'' and [[Neo-Confucianism]] (Despeux 2008:564-5) distinguish the three between ''xiantian'' {{lang|zh|先天}} "prior to heaven" and ''houtian'' {{lang|zh|後天}} "posterior to heaven", referring to ''Yuanjing'' {{lang|zh|元精}} "Original Essence", ''[[Yuanqi]]'' {{lang|zh|元氣}} "Original Breath", and ''yuanshen'' {{lang|zh|元神}} "Original Spirit".

The (2nd century BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' refers to ''qi'' and ''shen'' with ''xing''  {{linktext|lang=zh|形}} "form; shape; body".
<blockquote>The bodily form [''xing''] is the residence of life; the ''qi'' fills this life while ''shen'' controls it. If either of them loses their proper position, they will all come to harm. (1, tr. Englehart 2000:99) </blockquote>

The Taoist text ''Gaoshang yuhuang xinyin jing'' ({{lang|zh|高上玉皇心印經}}, "Mind-Seal Scripture of the Exalted Jade Sovereign", or ''Xinyin jing'' "Mind-Seal Scripture") is a valuable early source about the Three Treasures (tr. Olson 1993). <blockquote>Probably dating from the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), this anonymous text presents a simple and concise discussion of internal alchemy (''neidan'' {{lang|zh|內丹}}). In particular, it emphasizes the so-called Three Treasures (''sanbao'' {{lang|zh|三寶}}), namely, vital essence (''jing'' {{lang|zh|精}}), subtle breath (''qi'' {{lang|zh|氣}}), and spirit (''shen'' {{lang|zh|神}}). (Komjathy 2004:29) </blockquote>
[[Frederic H. Balfour]]'s (1880:380-381) brief essay about the ''Xinyin jing'' ("The Imprint of the Heart") contains the earliest known Western reference to the Three Treasures: "There are three degrees of Supreme Elixir – the Spirit, the Breath, and the Essential Vigour".

The (late 16th century) ''[[Journey to the West]]'' novel provides a more recent example when an enlightened Taoist patriarch instructs [[Sun Wukong]] "Monkey" with a poem that begins:
<blockquote>
Know well this secret formula wondrous and true:
Spare and nurse the vital forces, this and nothing else.
All power resides in the semen [jing], the breath [qi], and the spirit [shen];
Guard these with care, securely, lest there be a leak.
Lest there be a leak!
Keep within the body! (tr. Yu 1977:88)</blockquote>
