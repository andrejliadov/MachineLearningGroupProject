{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}
A '''culture of life''' describes a [[culture|way of life]] based upon the belief that human life at all stages from [[Human fertilization|conception]] through [[natural death]] is sacred.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae}}  It opposes the destruction of human life at any stage, including [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], studies and medicines involving [[embryonic stem cells]], and [[contraception]].{{sfn|p=16|Evangelium vitae}}<ref>{{CCC|pp=2276-2279|long=on}}</ref>{{sfn|Humanae vitae|pp=15-18}} It also promotes policies that "lift up the human spirit with compassion and love."<ref name=leonard/> The term originated in [[moral theology]], especially [[Catholic moral theology|that of the Catholic Church]], and was popularly championed by [[Pope John Paul II]];<ref name= Grondelski/><ref name=barry/> it has been widely used by religious leaders in [[evangelical Christianity]] as well.<ref name="GeorgeGuarino2015">{{cite book |last1=George |first1=Timothy |last2=Guarino |first2=Thomas G. |title=Evangelicals and Catholics Together at Twenty: Vital Statements on Contested Topics |date=2015 |publisher=Brazos Press |isbn=978-1-4934-0237-3 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="Goodstein2005">{{cite web |last1=Goodstein |first1=Laurie |title=Schiavo Case Highlights Catholic-Evangelical Alliance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/24/us/schiavo-case-highlights-catholicevangelical-alliance.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 August 2020 |language=English |date=24 March 2005 |quote=... is testament to growing alliance of conservative Roman Catholics and evangelicals who have found common cause in 'culture of life' agenda ...}}</ref> The philosophy of such a culture is a [[consistent life ethic]].<ref name="RozellWhitney2007">{{cite book |last1=Rozell |first1=M. |last2=Whitney |first2=G. |title=Religion and the Bush Presidency |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-60735-4 |page=206 |language=English}}</ref>

The expression "culture of life" entered popular parlance from [[Pope John Paul II]] in the 1990s.<ref name= Grondelski/><ref name=barry/>  He used the term in his 1991 encyclical ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', and then more fully expanded upon it in the 1995 [[encyclical]] ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' ("Gospel of Life"):

{{quote|In our present social context, marked by a dramatic struggle between the "culture of life" and the "culture of death", there is need to develop a deep critical sense, capable of discerning true values and authentic needs.<ref name=ev/>}}

In the encyclical, the pope noted that even those who were not Catholic "can appreciate the intrinsic value of human life."<ref name=build/>  He also issued "a pressing appeal addressed to each and every person, in the name of God: Respect, protect, love, and serve life, every human life! Only in this direction will you find justice, development, true freedom, peace and happiness!"<ref name=build/>{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=5}} 

John Paul linked this to Catholic teaching, which believes every person is created in the [[Image of God|image and likeness of God]] and is intimately loved by God.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=2}}<ref name=hobart/> The Church, then, must build a culture of life that values each person as a person, not for what they own, do, or produce.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=23}}<ref name=hobart/> It must also protect every human life, especially those that are threatened or weak.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=77}}<ref name=hobart/> The doctrine had foundations in earlier church teaching such as [[Pope Paul VI]]'s 1968 encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'',<ref name=hv/> which articulated the Church's position defending life from conception to natural death, disapproving medical procedures harming an unborn fetus, which the Church holds to be a person with an inviolable [[right to life]]. Catholic hospitals and medical institutions will not perform such procedures.{{fact|date=September 2018}} 

Following the promulgation of ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'', advocates of a culture of life founded the [[Culture of Life Foundation]] in the United States to promote the concepts behind the Pope's encyclical.<ref name=foundation/> Pope John Paul II recognized and [[blessing|blessed]] the foundation in 1997.<ref name=fox/><ref name=foundation/>

==United States politics==
[[Image:PBAsigning.jpg|thumb|250px|George W. Bush signing the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] of 2003, surrounded by members of Congress]]
[[Evangelium vitae]] has been described as the Catholic academic Christopher Kaczor as the "[[magna carta]] for the [[pro-life movement]]."<ref name=build/> [[Evangelicals]] and others have also adopted the phrase.<ref name=goodstein/>

===Abortion===
On October 3, 2000, during the [[US presidential election, 2000|U.S. presidential election]] campaign, then-Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], a Methodist, cited the term during a televised debate against then [[United States Vice President|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]].  Bush expressed concerns that [[Mifepristone]], then newly approved as an abortifacient pill, would encourage more women to terminate their pregnancies; whereas his goal was to make such terminations rarer:

{{quote|Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors or allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Sure, we can work together to create a culture of life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.<ref name=debates/>}}

Leonard Mary of the [[The Boston Globe|''Boston Globe'']] said that Bush had directly borrowed his language from John Paul II, viewing this as a deliberate strategic attempt to gain political support from "moderate" Catholics voters (while not coming out so strongly against abortion rights that it would alienate [[pro-choice]] voters).<ref name=build/><ref name=leonard/>  Some voters believed that only the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] would build a culture of life in the United States, and this helped Bush win.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=386}}

Some Catholics,{{Who|date=December 2018}} however, criticized Bush for apparent inconsistency between his support of a culture of life and his strong support for the death penalty, which Catholic doctrine permits where there is no other means for society to protect itself. As [[Governor of Texas]], Bush repeatedly authorized executions of convicted murderers. 

Kristen Day, the executive director of [[Democrats for Life of America]] says that "achieving a culture of life cannot be done by simply voting Republican."  Day says that "to be truly pro-life, we must support a broad spectrum of issues including worker's compensation, minimum wage, and education assistance for displaced workers,"{{sfn|Day|2006|p=385}} as well as addressing poverty, including a livable wage and health care.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=395}}  Day says that Republicans should broaden their definition of a culture of life beyond simple opposition to abortion, and that to achieve a true culture of life that members of both parties will be needed.{{sfn|Day|2006|p=387}}

The 2004 Republican National Convention adopted a platform with a plank titled "Promoting a Culture of Life."<ref name=kirk/><ref name=platform/>  The platform's pro-life stance included positions on abortion; access to healthcare despite disability, age, or infirmity; euthanasia; assisted suicide; and promoted research and resources to alleviate the pain of the terminally ill.<ref name=platform/>

===Other issues===
The phrase "culture of life" was also invoked during the [[Terri Schiavo]] case of March 2005 when the phrase was used in support of legislative and legal efforts to prolong the life of a woman in an alleged [[persistent vegetative state]].<ref name=hanson/><ref name=goodstein/>  It has also been used to promote providing inexpensive medical care for people in impoverished countries.<ref name=cafta/>

Following the [[Boston Marathon bombing]], the Catholic bishops of Massachusetts opposed the death penalty for terrorist bomber [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]], citing the need to build a culture of life.<ref name=conflicted/>  In their statement, they cited a 2005 document by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], ''A Culture of Life and the Penalty of Death,'' which said "no matter how heinous the crime, if society can protect itself without ending a human life, it should do so."<ref name=conflicted/>

A growing culture of life in the United States, one that took the protection of life more seriously, led to the rapid adoption of [[Safe-haven law|infant safe-haven laws]] in the early 2000s.<ref name=sanger/>  Under these laws, mothers can leave their newborn children in places such as hospitals, police stations and fire stations, without being criminally charged with child abandonment.

==Culture of death==

Pope [[John Paul II]] also used the opposing term "culture of death" in ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' (April 1995):

{{quote|In fact, while the climate of widespread moral uncertainty can in some way be explained by the multiplicity and gravity of today's social problems, and these can sometimes mitigate the subjective responsibility of individuals, it is no less true that we are confronted by an even larger reality, which can be described as a veritable structure of sin. This reality is characterized by the emergence of a culture which denies solidarity and in many cases takes the form of a veritable '<u>culture of death</u>.' This culture is actively fostered by powerful cultural, economic and political currents which encourage an idea of society excessively concerned with efficiency.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}}}

He argued that there was "a war of the powerful against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love and care is considered useless, or held to be an intolerable burden, and is therefore rejected in one way or another."{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}} Those who are ill, handicapped, or just simply threaten the well being or lifestyle of the more powerful thus become enemies to be eliminated.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}} John Paul said he saw this as applying both between individuals and between peoples and states.{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|p=12}}

He added his belief that every time an "innocent life" is taken (dating back to the time of [[Cain and Abel]]) that it was "a violation of the ‘spiritual’ kinship uniting mankind in one great family, in which all share the same fundamental good: equal personal dignity."<ref name=build/>{{sfn|Evangelium vitae|pp=7-8}}  Any threat to the human person, including wars, class conflict, civil unrest, ecological recklessness, and sexual irresponsibility, should therefore be regarded in his opinion as part of the "culture of death."<ref name=build/>

Without morals, Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] said, "it is the strong who decide the fate of the weak," and "human beings therefore become instruments of other human beings... We are already on that road: for what else is the termination of millions of lives in the womb since the [[Abortion Act 1967|Abortion Act]] was introduced, and embryo selection on the basis of gender and genes?”<ref name=pook/>

===Wider usage===

Advocates of a culture of life argue that a culture of death results in political, economic, or eugenic murder. They point to historical events like the [[USSR]]'s [[Great Purges]], the [[Nazi]] [[Holocaust]], [[China]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge]] as examples of devaluation of human life taken to an extreme conclusion. The term is used by those in the pro-life movement to refer to supporters of embryonic stem cell research, legalized abortion, and euthanasia.<ref name=Dennehy/><ref name=Blanke/><ref name=Smith/><ref name=watson/><ref name=Pasquini/><ref name=Dietrich/> Some in  the [[pro-life movement]], such as those from the [[Center for Bio-Ethical Reform]], have compared those in the [[pro-choice movement]] to the perpetrators of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Holocaust]].<ref name=college/> They say that their opponents share the same disregard for human life.<ref name=Dowbiggin/><ref name=Hartman/><ref name=Slane/>
