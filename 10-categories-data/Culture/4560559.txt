'''''The Land of Foam''''' also known as '''''At the Edge of Oikoumene''''' ({{lang-ru|На краю Ойкумены|Na krayu Oikumeny}}) and '''''Great Arc''''' ({{lang-ru|Великая Дуга|Velikaya Duga}}) is a novel written by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] writer [[Ivan Yefremov]] in 1946.

==Plot summary==
The novel is divided in two parts, separated by more than 1000 years.

The first part takes place during the rule of the pharaoh [[Djedefra]] (26th century BC), who decides to send an expedition to the South, in order to seek the famous and fabled [[Land of Punt]] and to seek the limits of the land and the start of the ''Great Arc'', the circular ocean encompassing the entire world in [[Egypt]]ian [[cosmology]].

The second part starts in Ancient Greece during its [[History of Greece#Aegean civilization: prehistoric Greece|Aegean Period]] (no precise dates are provided, but one can assume a date c. 1000–900 BC).<ref>The book mentions the abandoned capital of [[Akhetaten]], constructed by the pharaoh of same name c. 1350 BC and abandoned shortly afterwards. Those facts are place as 400 years away at the time the novel takes place.</ref> A young [[sculptor]] named Pandion sets off on a journey to Crete, but a storm finally lands him in Egypt, where he is enslaved. He manages to win his freedom and after a long and perilous journey comes back home. On the way, he carves a [[Cameo (carving)|cameo]] which portrays his friends and some details of their adventures.

In a short [[framing narrative]], modern researchers examine the cameo and contemplate its possible origins.
