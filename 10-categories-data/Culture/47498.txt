{{short description|Internet meme about a bad translation of a video game cutscene transcript}}
[[File:Aybabtu.png|thumb|The phrase as it appears in the introduction to ''[[Zero Wing]]''.]]

"'''All your base are belong to us'''" is a popular [[Internet meme]] based on a phrase found in the opening [[cutscene]] of the European release of the 1992 [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of the 1989 arcade video game ''[[Zero Wing]]'', which is subtitled and [[Engrish|poorly translated]]. 

The meme developed from this in the early 2000s, as the result of a [[GIF animation]] depicting the opening text, which was initially popularized on the [[Something Awful]] message forums.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Julian | last=Dibbell | date=2008-01-18 | title=Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World | url=http://archive.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=all | work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref>

In November 2000, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] computer [[programmer]], Something Awful forum member, and part-time [[disc jockey]] Jeffrey Ray Roberts (1977-2011) of the [[Gabber]] band [[the Laziest Men on Mars]], made a techno dance track, "Invasion of the Gabber Robots", which remixed some of the ''Zero Wing'' video game music by [[Tatsuya Uemura]] with a voice-over phrase "All your base are belong to us".<ref>{{cite news|author=Taylor, Chris |date=2001-02-25 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,100525,00.html |title=All Your Base Are Belong To Us |access-date=2007-06-29 |work=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621020832/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C100525%2C00.html |archive-date=21 June 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tribal War forums member Bad_CRC in February 2001 created a video combining Roberts' song and the various images created in a Something Awful AYB photoshop thread, which proceeded to go viral.

On February 23, 2001, [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] provided an early report on the phenomenon, covering it from the Flash animation to its spread through [[email]] and Internet forums to T-shirts bearing the phrase.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Jeffrey | last=Benner | date=2001-02-23 | title=When Gamer Humor Attacks | url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/02/42009 | work=Wired}}</ref>

On April 1, 2003, in [[Sturgis, Michigan]], seven people aged 17 to 20 placed signs all over town that read: "All your base are belong to us. You have no chance to survive make your time." They claimed to be playing an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's]] joke, but most people who saw the signs were unfamiliar with the phrase. Many residents were upset that the signs appeared while the U.S. was at [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war with Iraq]] and police chief Eugene Alli said the signs could be "a borderline terrorist threat, depending on what someone interprets it to mean".<ref>{{cite web|title=Men arrested for "All Your Base" prank|author=Doyle, Holly|url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/sturgis-468-security-thought.html|date=2003-04-04|access-date=2009-07-10|publisher=WWMT NEWSCHANNEL 3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829220138/http://www.wwmt.com/news/sturgis-468-security-thought.html |archive-date=29 August 2010}}</ref>

In February 2004, [[North Carolina State University]] students and members of [[TheWolfWeb]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] exploited a web-based service used by local schools and businesses to report weather-related closures to display the phrase within a [[news ticker]] on a live news broadcast on [[Spectrum News North Carolina|News 14 Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Poulsen, Kevin|date=2004-03-05 | work=The Register | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/05/wags_hijack_tv_channels_onscreen/ | title=Wags hijack TV channel's on-screen ticker | access-date=2006-05-15| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060525074052/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/05/wags_hijack_tv_channels_onscreen/| archive-date= 25 May 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>

On June 1, 2006, [[YouTube]] was taken down temporarily for maintenance. The phrase "ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG TO US" appeared below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while the site was down. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading YouTube to add the message "No, we haven't be{{Sic|}} hacked. Get a sense of humor."<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Sandoval |date=2006-06-02 |title=YouTube: Our humor, not our hack |url=http://news.cnet.com/YouTube-Humor,-not-hack/2100-1026_3-6079314.html |work=CNET News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506201205/http://news.cnet.com/YouTube-Humor%2C-not-hack/2100-1026_3-6079314.html |archive-date=2014-05-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>
