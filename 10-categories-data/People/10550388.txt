'''Kantheesangal''' or '''Qadishangal''' are the two of the many common [[Malayalam]] (and its [[English language|English]]) renderings of a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] term meaning 'the holy ones'.

In the Orthodox churches of Kerala, the term applies to [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth|Mar Sabor and Mar Aphroth]], while in the Roman Catholic churches of Kerala it refers to [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150803/http://catholic-forum.com/saints/saintg29.htm St. Gervase] and his twin brother [https://web.archive.org/web/20071109161002/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/saintp45.htm St. Protase].

== Kantheesangal and St. Thomas Christians ==

In c. AD 825 two Syrian Bishops, [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth|Mar Sabor]] and [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth|Mar Aphroth]] arrived in [[Kerala]]. These two saintly bishops established many churches, which were later consecrated after these two bishops - Kantheesangal. Later, during the [[Synod of Diamper]], these churches were reconsecrated either to [[Saint|all saints]] or to Sts. [[Gervasius and Protasius]], based on the Roman Catholic Portuguese presumption that these two Syrian bishops and all Syrian churches were [[Heresy|heretic]].
