The family has produced several notable rabbis, scholars, physicians, and merchants especially achieving prominence in [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]] and [[Hamburg]]. The progenitor of the family is [[Abraham Aboab|Rav Abraham Aboab]], who, in 1263 was given a tower in [[Altea]], [[Aragon]] with the surrounding dairy farms along with a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] achievement by [[James I of Aragon]]. Some have suggested that Aboab is a spelling of the [[Arabic]] "Abdelwahab", which means "the benefactor’s servant", while others have stated that it derives from the town of [[Umm al-Abohav]] in [[Tunisia]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Aboab Family|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/familyname/aboab|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot Database}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=ABOAB - JewishEncyclopedia.com|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/344-aboab|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref>

== History ==
The family progenitor Abraham Aboab had one son, [[Isaac Aboab I]] who was a [[Talmud]]ic scholar in Aragon. He later moved to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], where he headed his own [[yeshiva]], teaching [[Jewish ethics]]. He is best known for his work Menorat ha-Maor, which is a collection of [[midrashic]] sermons. His son Abraham II was a close contemporary of [[Judah ben Asher]] and Abraham II's great grandson [[Isaac Aboab of Castile|Isaac Aboab II]], was a [[Posek]] and [[Torah]] commentator in Toledo. Following the [[Alhambra Decree]] of 1492, he with thirty others of the most respected Jews of the land went to [[Lisbon]] in order to negotiate with King [[John II of Portugal]] for the reception of his banished coreligionists. He and his companions were allowed to settle under favourable conditions in [[Porto]], [[Portugal]]. However his son [[Abraham Aboab IV]] was the victim of forced conversion in 1497 and thus he and all his descendants became [[Crypto-Judaism|Cypto-Jews]]. In the early 17th-century the majority of the family immigrated to [[Western Europe]]. With [[Elijah Aboab Cardoso]], and [[Abraham Aboab (Hamburg)|Abraham Aboab V]] in Hamburg. [[Immanuel Aboab]], [[Isaac ben Mattathiah Aboab|Isaac Aboab V]], and [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] in Amsterdam, and [[Samuel Aboab]] and his son [[Jacob Aboab|Jacob Aboab VI]] in Venice.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aboab {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/aboab|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Rav Abraham Aboab|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Rav-Abraham-Aboab/6000000143626655831|access-date=2020-07-20|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US}}</ref>
