==Life and career==
Boston was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and grew up in [[McLean, Virginia]]. During his time in high school he was a photographer for the newspaper and yearbook. He graduated from the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) in 1955 where he was a member of Gamma Phi local fraternity. After it became a chapter of [[Sigma Pi]] fraternity he was inducted into the national organization.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=McHenry|first=John A.|date=Summer 1960|volume=47|number=2|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Rochester Institute Local Granted Beta Phi Charter|pages=76–78|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/1960/SP_Emerald_VOL_47_NO_2_SUMMER_1960.pdf}}</ref><ref name = Emerald>{{cite magazine|date=Summer 1989|volume=76|number=2|magazine=The Emerald of Sigma Pi|title=Alumni Features - Bernie Boston|pages=13–14|url=http://www.enivation.com/SigmaPi/archive/Emerald/Other/SP_EMERALD_VOL_76_NO_2.pdf}}</ref> After his time at RIT, Boston studied at the School of Aviation Medicine in the [[U.S. Air Force]]. He served in the Army for two years while in Germany practicing radiology “in a neurosurgical unit.”

In 1958, he left the Army and returned to Washington, working in custom photofinishing.<ref name="NPPA">"[https://nppa.org/news/1521 Bernard "Bernie" Boston, 74, Retired Los Angeles Times Photojournalist, Was An Icon]". [[National Press Photographers Association]], 22 January 2008. Accessed 30 September 2017</ref> He started his news photography career in [[Dayton, Ohio]] with the ''[[Dayton Daily News]].'' He moved back to Washington to work at ''[[The Washington Star]]'' and was director of photography when the newspaper folded in 1981. He then was hired by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to establish a photo operation in the nation's capital.

Boston covered every president from [[Harry S. Truman]] to [[Bill Clinton]]. In 1967 he was commissioned to shoot a portrait of former Black Panther [[H. Rap Brown]]. Noticing the trend of a call for [[civil rights]] in the late 1960s, Boston took more images of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], including a portrait of Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during his [[Poor People's Campaign]], and other notable events. On October 22, 1967 he photographed his most famous picture, "[[Flower Power (photograph)|Flower Power]]", which showed a [[Vietnam War]] protester inserting flowers into [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen's]] rifle barrels.<ref name="washingtonpost">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701300.html "Flowers, Guns and an Iconic Snapshot"] ''Washington Post'', March 18, 2007; Page D04</ref> The protester has been claimed to be both Joel "Super-Joel" Tornabene<ref>{{cite web | first=Paul | last=Krassner | author-link=Paul Krassner | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-krassner/tom-waits-meets-superjoel_b_84035.html | title=Tom Waits Meets Super-Joel | date=January 30, 2008 | work=The Huffington Post | accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref> and George Edgerly Harris III.<ref name="washingtonpost"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/magazine/karma-chameleon.html|title=Karma Chameleon|last=Silva|first=Hoaracio|date=August 17, 2003|work=New York Times Magazine|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>

He was a finalist for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for a 1987 photograph of [[Coretta Scott King]] unveiling a bust of her late husband, the Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], in the U.S. Capitol.<ref name="obit"/><ref name="pulitzer">[http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/1987 1987 Pulitzer Prizes]. [[Pulitzer Prize]].

Boston taught photojournalism classes at [[Northern Virginia Community College]] and [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].<ref name="NPPA"/>

An archive of many of Boston's negatives as well as some prints and contact sheets is held at RIT. Established as a tribute to his memory and an inspiration for young photographers, it includes most of his work including the original negative for "Flower Power".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Therese|title=A tribute to photojournalist and alumnus Bernie Boston|url=http://www.rit.edu/news/newsevents/2008/Feb01/story.php?file=v|publisher=RIT|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>

Boston attributed his success to his knowledge of his equipment. In an age of film, he knew chemistry as well as the capabilities of his lenses.  Boston also believed in dressing in a suit and tie. "I'm in the capital of the world and I don't believe you should walk into an office in jeans and a sweat-shirt. I think you should blend in."<ref name = Emerald/>
