{{short description|French graverobber and necrophiliac}}
'''Victor Antoine Ardisson''' (1872–1944), nicknamed the "Vampire of Muy", was a French [[Grave robbery|graverobber]] and [[necrophile]].

He was born on 5 September 1872 at [[Le Muy|Muy]] in [[Provence]] in southeastern France, and became an [[undertaker]] and [[gravedigger]] as an adult. He violated many bodies, especially those of young women, and mutilated and decapitated them in some cases. According to his confession, Ardisson regularly spoke to the corpses which he had retrieved, feeling genuine shock and hurt when they would not respond.<ref>{{cite book |first=Anil |last=Aggrawal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&q=Victor%20Ardisson&pg=PA296 |title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices |publisher= CRC Press |year=2008|isbn=9781420043099 }}</ref>

Victor Ardisson was arrested in 1901 upon multiple charges of the exhumation and violation of dead bodies.<ref>{{cite book |first=Augustus Montague |last=Summers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpaCCyGuMqwC&q=Victor%20Ardisson&pg=PA69 |title=The vampire, his kith and kin |publisher= Forgotten Books |year=1960|isbn=9781605065663 }}</ref>

Ardisson was examined by Dr. Alexis Epaulard, one of the first [[psychiatrist]]s to associate necrophilia and [[vampirism]]. Epaulard diagnosed Ardisson as a "degenerate impulsive [[Sadomasochism|sadist]] and necrophile." Dr. [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], who also studied the case, called Ardisson a "[[moron (psychology)|moron]] void of any moral sense."

Victor Ardisson was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in a [[psychiatric hospital]] at [[Pierrefeu-du-Var]].<ref>Pierre Pascal, ''Dostoïevski, L’homme et l’oeuvre''.</ref>
