[[File:USMC-01158.jpg|thumb|Weston takes a question during a pre-election press conference held in [[Fallujah]], Iraq, on December 14, 2005, during his time as a State Department employee.]]

Weston's seven years in Iraq and Afghanistan was more than any other State Department officer. During his time, he was a political adviser to combat units on the battlefield. He spent two and a half years on the ground before, during and after the [[Fallujah during the Iraq War|Battle of Fallujah]]. His supervisor, political counselor [[Robert Stephen Ford|Robert Ford]], said Weston "had the toughest, most dangerous assignment of any State Department officer worldwide.”<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite news|publisher=Newsweek|title=The Renegade Diplomat: Kael Weston's Afghanistan Turnaround|url=https://www.newsweek.com/renegade-diplomat-kael-westons-afghanistan-turnaround-63799|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref> Weston has reported he was "almost killed numerous times in both wars, including surviving a suicide car bomb attack in [[Khost, Afghanistan]], [[Taliban]] machine gun rounds hitting a mud wall a few feet away, insurgent RPGs overhead, not to mention more than a few additional loud bullets whizzing nearby.

===2020 congressional election===

Weston announced his campaign with an editorial in the [[Salt Lake Tribune]] on December 15, 2019.<ref name="DeservesBetter" /> Prior to Weston's entering the race, UtahPolicy.com had reported the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] considered Chris Stewart potentially vulnerable to a strong opponent, due to [[Donald Trump]]'s unpopularity in the 2nd district, and Stewart's record of vigorously defending him.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/21348-national-democrats-think-rep-chris-stewart-could-be-vulnerable-in-2020|title=National Democrats think Rep.

(The remainder were undecided or voting for someone else.)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/22929-poll-suggests-reps-chris-stewart-and-ben-mcadams-could-have-tough-re-election-campaigns-in-november|title=Poll suggests Reps.

==Political positions==

Weston supports the [[Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare), calling it “a public policy focused on the public good.” Weston also supports efforts to preserve, improve, and extend the law to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Salt Lake Tribune|url= https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/03/14/john-zaccheo-kael-weston/|title= John Zaccheo and Kael Weston: Much work still to be done as ACA turns 10}}</ref>

Weston has publicly expressed concern about “serious and lasting damage“ to the American “brand” by Trump's allegedly anti-immigration rhetoric, and by actions taken by his administration that “appear intended to punish entire classes of people from Latin America,” such as family separations at the southern US border with [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/05/john-zaccheo-kael-weston/|publisher=Salt Lake Tribune|title=John Zaccheo and Kael Weston: Decent Utahns should stand against Trump's attacks on immigrants}}</ref>

Weston considers the Afghanistan War to have been "a necessary war", but says the Iraq War was not.<ref name = "npr" /> Weston broke with [[President Obama]] over the decision to approve a 30,000-troop surge in Afghanistan in late 2009. Weston instead believed the president should have determined how many troops to commit to Afghanistan for a decade, and then have pledged that level of support over that timeframe.<ref name = "Newsweek" />

In May 2019, Weston co-authored an editorial opposing [[President Trump]]’s proposed pardoning of accused or convicted war criminals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/opinion/trump-war-military-pardons.html|publisher=NY Times|date=May 24, 2019|title=Opinion: What Message Is Trump Sending to Soldiers?}}</ref> Later that year, Trump pardoned [[Eddie Gallagher (Navy SEAL)|Eddie Gallagher]] and granted clemency to two other soldiers accused or convicted of war crimes.<ref>https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/472201-trump-says-he-stood-up-to-the-deep-state-by-intervening-in-war-crime-cases</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/27/eddie-gallagher-trump-navy-seal-iraq</ref>

In January 2020, after the [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|killing]] of Iranian general [[Qasem Soleimani]] by air strike, Weston published an editorial in the [[Salt Lake Tribune]] stating his opposition to the attack. Weston argued the strike made the United States less safe by provoking [[Iran]]. <ref>{{cite web|publisher=Salt Lake Tribune|url=https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/01/06/kael-weston-trumps/|title= Kael Weston: Trump's actions have left us less safe than we were last week}}</ref>

Weston has criticized the Trump administration's response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and its decision to withdraw from the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite news|title= John Zaccheo and Kael Weston: America must regain its standing in the world|publisher=Salt Lake Tribune|url= https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2020/07/24/john-zaccheo-kael-weston/}}</ref>

Weston's campaign website lists his priorities as health care, living wages, gun violence, public lands, climate policy, money in politics, veterans' issues, and human rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Priorities - Weston for Congress|url=https://www.westonforcongress.com/issues/|access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref><ref name="DeservesBetter" />
