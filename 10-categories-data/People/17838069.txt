The so-called '''Bars of Aragon, Royal sign of Aragon, Royal arms of Aragon, Four Bars, Red Bars''' or '''Coat of arms of the [[Crown of Aragon]]''', which bear four red [[Pale (heraldry)|paletts]] on gold background, depicts the familiar coat of the [[Kings of Aragon]].<ref name=leon>" Léon Jéquier.

Today, this symbol has been adopted and/or included in their arms by several former territories related to the Crown of Aragon, like the [[Coat of arms of Spain|arms of Spain]], which wears it in its third quarter whereas the kings of Spain are heirs of those of Aragon; the shield of [[Andorra]], which also shows it in its third quarter. It is also the main element of the arms of the present Spanish Autonomous Communities of [[Catalonia]], Valencian Community and the [[Balearic Islands]]; the fourth quarter of the Spanish Autonomous Community of [[Aragon]]; of the French regions of [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] (Department of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]], whose territory regroups the old province of [[Roussillon]] and [[French Cerdagne]]); and in the Italian provinces of [[Province of Reggio Calabria|Reggio de Calabria]], [[Province of Catanzaro|Catanzaro]] in Calabria and [[Province of Lecce|Lecce]] in Apulia. It figures also in numerous located municipal blazons in the territories of the Crown, either by explicit concession of the king, or because they were cities or towns of ''realengo'' (that is, directly dependent on the Crown and subject to no kind of [[manorialism]]); and others outside it, in which case the symbol is because of the presence of the king or knights of the Crown at some moment of their local history.

==History==
[[File:Arms of Aragonese Monarchs (13th-15 centuries).svg|right|thumb|150px|Version of the coat of arms of the kings, created by the king [[Peter IV of Aragon]], with the blue and white cross flag attributed by the Ceremonious to the old Aragonian kings and the pales of the Aragon Kings and Barcelonian counts.<ref name="libro.uca.edu">{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne5.htm|work=A History of Spain and Portugal|title=Chapter Five The Rise of Aragón-Catalonia|access-date=3 May 2008}}</ref>]]

Originally it was the familiar emblem of the [[Kings of Aragon]] and [[House of Barcelona|Counts of Barcelona]].<ref name=leon/> In 1137, when [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[County of Barcelona]] merged by [[dynastic union]]<ref name="bison_31">{{cite book|title=The medieval Crown of Aragon. A short story|chapter=II. The age of the Early Count-Kings (1137–1213) (The Principate of Ramon Berenguer IV 1137–1162)|year=1986|editor=Clarendon Press – Oxford|page=31}}</ref> by the marriage of [[Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona]] and [[Petronila of Aragon]], these titles were finally borne by only one person when their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] ascended to the throne in 1162. Slowly the various entities and territories over which the [[House of Aragon]]-[[House of Barcelona|Barcelona]] ruled and came to rule came to be called the [[Crown of Aragon]].

"The new ruler of the united dynasty (Raymond Berenger IV of Barcelona) called himself count of Barcelona and "prince" of Aragón."<ref name="libro.uca.edu"/>

The son of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronila, Alfonso II, inherited both the titles of King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona, in a style that would be maintained by all its successors to the crown. Thus, this union was made while respecting the existing institutions and parliaments of both territories.

It constitutes the third quarter section of the [[Coat of Arms of Spain|coat of arms of the Kingdom of Spain]].

==Theories of origin==

===Theories of Catalan origin===
The oldest ''evidence'' where the arms can be seen is from 1150, in a seal of Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0083412 see picture]</ref> The seal evidence is disputed by some Aragonese authors who claim that the first documented evidence dates from the time of Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona) reign<ref name="gea">[http://www.enciclopedia-aragonesa.com/voz.asp?voz_id=20407&voz_id_origen=1080 "Palos de Aragón"] Entry on Gran Enciclopedia Aragonesa</ref>

As a pre-heraldic symbol, the ''red bars'' on a yellow background are found on the Romanesque tombs of Barcelona's Count [[Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'estopes]], who died in 1082, and his great-grandmother Ermessenda, who died in 1058, wife of Count Ramon Borrell I,<ref>[http://www.pedresdegirona.com/capelles_cat_20.htm original Romanesque tomb of Ermessenda]</ref> both of whose tombs were at the portico of the old Romanesque Cathedral of Girona; it is not sure that the 15 bars of gold appearing in a painting are contemporary to the tombs.<ref>This theory was rejected by the member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués. ''Cfr.'', ''Símbolos de España'' (2000). Madrid: Centro de Estudios Políticos y Constitucionales,  pp. 95–138. {{ISBN|978-84-259-1110-1}}: In 1982 it was given great importance to the discovery of red and golden vertical stripes on the exterior of the sarcophagus of Ramon Berenguer II Cap d'Estopes († 1082) and which is attributed to Ermesenda de Carcasona when opening the tombs of the cathedral of Girona worked by mandate of Peter IV in the fourteenth century. It was attempted to present the finding as the definitive proof of the origin of the bars in the counts of Barcelona previous to Ramon Berenguer IV.

What would have been conclusive [is] that those pigments were not used on the XIV [...] It could only be concluded that such paintures are not posterior to 1365, when the sarcofagus was covered with the new tomb [...]

Moreover, the paintures are in a good state of conservation and without retouches[,] how could they have resisted three centuries in its old emplacement on the entry of the temple since the century XI until the XIV? It's very probable that the sarcofagus were decorated by outside, on the said manner, in times of Peter IV; there are news of having procured this king in 1384 heraldic ornamentations of old tombs of his ancestors (RUBIÓ Y LLUCH, Antonio, Documents per l'historia de la cultura catalana mig-eval, II, Barcelona, 1921, p. 296.). But the objection of most weight proceeds from other considerations [...]

It would have to be accepted that were used then emblematic ornamentations on tombs. [...] It doesn't exist, of course, any such case, be it known by material proof or by reference. [...] Pedro IV accepted prolongating the use of his arms to the ascenstors by varony [meaning by male line], that's why were his bars figurated on the new tombs of Gerona. [...] the first authentic testimonial of the arms that use the Kings of Aragon is found on the seals of Ramon Berenguer IV, whose oldest mark is from year 1150. Since in them he titles [himself] already Prince of Aragon, the matrixs result posterior to 1137. On those seals we find already the pallets or bars in the [blocado, I don't know the translation of this word] shield of the equestrian representations of the Count and maybe on the ensign of his lance [...]

The struggle for finding the antecedents is directed to attributing it to the anterior counts of Barcelona, aliens to the Kingdom of Aragon. [...] [Ramon Berenguer IV] was a full right member of the Royal House of Aragon, as the traditional juridic formula of "marriage at home". In {{Citation|author=Faustino Menéndez Pidal de Navascués|title=Símbolos de España|publisher=Madrid: Centro de Estudios Políticos y Constitucionales, pp. 95–138.|year=2000}}</ref> It is a proof that relates the arms to the Counts of Barcelona lineage and the pre-heraldic forms indicate pre-heraldic times, before the second third of the 12th century.<ref>Marti de Riquer. "Llegendes històriques catalanes. Quaderns Crema. 2000.pag.16. Barcelona. {{ISBN|84-7727-296-4}}</ref>

===Theories of Aragonese origin===
The exact origin of the ''four bars'' symbol is obscure, and for long it has been explained by legends, now proven false. The first undisputed evidences are from the [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II (king of Aragon and count of Barcelona)]] reign.<ref name="gea" />

Even though a purely Aragonese origin for the ''four bars'' symbol has been proposed, the main point held by Aragonese authors (Fatás, Ubieto, Montaner), partially supported by some Catalan historians like Ferran de Segarra,<ref>Ferran de Sagarra, ''Sigillografia catalana'', 1932, apud F. Menéndez Pidal de Navascués (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cCLL5mbUA-wC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false ''El escudo de España'']. Madrid: Real Academia Matritense de Heráldica y Genealogía; Hidalguía, p. 107. {{ISBN|978-84-88833-02-0}}</ref> is that the key evidence for the Catalan origin, the Marseilles seals, is dubious. The lines in the monochrome Marseilles seals are interpreted as mere scratchings by some, and as representation of a shield reinforcement by others.<ref name="gea" /> This theory was rejected by Aragonese member of the International Heraldry Academy Faustino Menéndez-Pidal.<ref name="palos" />

A second point put forward by Aragonese authors is that [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona]] was the ''de facto'' ruler of Aragon, even if only his son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] would become ''[[de jure]]'' king of Aragon. Therefore, any symbol associated with Ramon Berenguer IV can also be attributed to the then budding [[Crown of Aragon]].<ref name="gea"/>
