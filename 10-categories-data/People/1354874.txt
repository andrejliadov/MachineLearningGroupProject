English film director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] made [[cameo appearance]]s in 40 of his 54 surviving major films (his second film, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'', is [[Lost film|lost]]). For the films in which he appeared, he would be seen for a brief moment in a non-speaking part as an extra, such as boarding a bus, crossing in front of a building, standing in an apartment across the courtyard, or even appearing in a newspaper photograph (as seen in the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'', which otherwise provided no other opportunity for him to appear).

This playful gesture became one of Hitchcock's signatures; and fans would make a sport of trying to spot his cameos. As a recurring theme, he would carry a musical instrument{{nbs}}– especially memorable was the [[double bass]] case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]''. In his earliest appearances, he filled in as an obscure extra in crowds or walking through scenes in long camera shots. His later appearances became more prominent, such as when he turns to see Jane Wyman's disguise as she passes him in ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'', and in stark silhouette in his final film ''[[Family Plot]]''.

His appearances became so popular that he began to make them earlier in his films so as not to distract the audience from the plot. Hitchcock confirms this in extended interviews with [[François Truffaut]],<ref>Truffaut, François (1968) ''Hitchcock'', Secker and Warburg</ref> and indeed the majority of his appearances occur within the first half-hour of his films, with over half in the first 15 minutes. 

Hitchcock's longest cameo appearances are in his British films ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' and ''[[Young and Innocent]]''.<ref>Walker, Michael (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v2dnVhpwVssC&pg=PA88&dq=hitchcock+longest+cameo+blackmail&hl=en&ei=rhw_TL_7HMGJ4Qbp3vn0Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=hitchcock%20longest%20cameo%20blackmail&f=false Hitchcock's motifs] Amsterdam University Press</ref> He appears in all 30 features from ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (his first American film) onward; before his move to Hollywood, he only occasionally performed cameos.

== Other cameo appearances ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
*Hitchcock appeared only once in any installment of his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television show (aside from his personal introductions and closings): in the 1958 episode of the third season ("Dip in the Pool") at 5 minutes 15 seconds Hitchcock appears on the cover of a magazine one of the characters is reading.
* Hitchcock's image shows up in [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'', as an homage to Hitchcock's cameo appearances.
* Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] incorporates a Hitchcock cameo into ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' (1983), even though Hitchcock was by then dead. When Mary Samuels and Norman Bates pay an early nighttime visit to Mother's bedroom, Hitchcock's familiar silhouette can be seen in shadow on the far right wall just after they enter the room.
* In [[Gus Van Sant]]'s 1998 shot-for-shot remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'', Van Sant can be seen standing next to a Hitchcock look-alike at the same point in the film as in the original.
