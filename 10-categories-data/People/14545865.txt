==Biography==

Born Andre Johnson in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], Andre J. was raised by a single mother in a [[housing project]] called Academy Spires<ref name=nytimes>Trebay, Guy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/fashion/25andre.html "A Cover Girl Who's Simply Himself."] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (November 25, 2007).</ref>

For several years in the early 2000s, they lived in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=nymag>Larocca, Amy. [http://nymag.com/fashion/lookbook/28861/ "Look Book: Cheerful Muse Andre J."] ''[[New York Magazine]]'' (March 4, 2007).</ref>  During those years, they worked at a boutique on [[Melrose Avenue]] and made three brief appearances on [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] segments "devoted to human curiosities".<ref name=nytimes/> They typically wore a fur hat, a hole-covered beige fishnet shirt, and jeans so low that they revealed their pubic hair, though they changed before leaving for fear of being mistaken for a transgender prostitute on their way home to the $60-a-night [[Sunset Strip]] hotel in which they lived.<ref name=nytimes/>

Andre J. later moved to [[New York City]] "for the liberation, the freedom, the action" and worked variously as a perfume salesperson at [[Lord & Taylor]], as a publicist for [[Patricia Field]]'s boutique, and as a party host for the clubs Lotus and Hiro.<ref name=nytimes/>  While on the street one day in summer 2007, they were spotted by [[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]] [[Joe McKenna (stylist)|Joe McKenna]], who was then on the phone with fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]].<ref name=nytimes/>  With McKenna's encouragement, Weber decided to shoot Andre J. for French ''Vogue'', and [[Carine Roitfeld]], the magazine's editor, deemed Andre J.'s photos the freshest of all Weber's images.<ref name=nytimes/>  Roitfeld put a photo of the bearded Andre J., dressed in a womenâ€™s blue neoprene [[Burberry]] trench coat, ankle boots, and a cocktail ring, on the cover of her magazine.<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=vogue>[[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], photographer. "Love Me or Leave Me." French ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' (November 2007).</ref>  "There is not a special message in the cover, I just loved it," she said later.<ref name=nytimes/> Andre at one point had a day time job at a boutique in Melroe and is known for their intricate style that people see as creative and unique.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/fashion/25andre.html|title=A Cover Girl Who's Simply Himself|last=Trebay|first=Guy|date=2007-11-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>

==Personal style==
Though Andre J. often wears feminine clothing, they do not consider themself a [[crossdresser]].<ref name=nytimes/> Rather, they see themself as unconfined by gender and social conventions.<ref name=nytimes/> "Most people are conditioned to think of a black man looking a certain way," they told ''[[The New York Times]]''. "They only think of the ethnic man in XXX jeans and [[Timberlands]], and here Andre J. comes along with a pair of hot shorts and a caftan or maybe flip-flops or cowboy boots or a high, high heel."<ref name=nytimes/>  Most recently, Andre J.'s style inspirations have included [[Cher]] and model [[Donyale Luna]].<ref name=nytimes/> They describe their aesthetic as a "60s, not [[mod (subculture)|mod]], but mod-ish, and [[hippie]] look" that is also influenced by the style of 1970s [[blaxploitation]] films.<ref name=nytimes/>

Called a "cheerful [[muse]]" by ''[[New York Magazine]]'',<ref name=nymag/> Andre J. says their positive outlook on life has influenced their style: "I want people to look at me and feel inspired, to feel hope, to smile. I want to surge positive energy in your body, confirm that you too can be yourself."<ref name=nytimes/>  They said they have been affirmed by strangers telling them that they were glad they are alive, and believe that they were put on the earth "to be a [[bodhisattva]], to just glow, emanate love, respect, peace, pizzazz".<ref name=nymag/>
