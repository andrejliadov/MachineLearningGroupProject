The [[papal coats of arms|personal papal coat of arms]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who was later created a Cardinal) soon after the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal election in 2005]].

==Shield==
The shape of the [[shield (heraldry)|shield]] varies from artist to artist. In the official rendering of the coat of arms of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] the shape chosen is that of a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]].

===Blazon===
The [[blazon]] (the written description, in terminology peculiar to heraldry, of the contents of the coat of arms) given on the Vatican [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html website] is as follows:
{{block indent|''Gules, chape ployé Or, with the scallop shell Or; the dexter chape with a moor's head Proper, crowned and collared Gules, the sinister chape a bear trippant (*passant) Proper, carrying a pack Gules belted Sable.''}}
This means, in non-technical English:
{{block indent|A red shield mantled in gold and with a gold scallop shell; the right (for the bearer of the shield, the left for the viewer) part of the mantle has the head of a moor in her natural colour (brown) wearing a red crown and red collar; the left part of the mantle has a walking bear in its natural colour (brown) carrying a red pack tied with black bands.}}

Note 1. A mantle outside the shield does not normally contain ''charges'' (an heraldic term for objects). Within the shield, as here, it is a religious symbol, and indicates ideals inspired in monastic spirituality.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is also a reference to the [[Order of Saint Benedict]].

===Charges===
[[File:Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Joseph Ratzinger, as cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church]]
The charges of the arms &mdash; the [[Maure|Moor's head]], [[Corbinian]]'s bear, and [[scallop]] &mdash; appeared on Ratzinger's previous coat of arms, used when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. However, they relate not only to his origins, but also to his trust in God, as well his calling to spread this faith to others.

====Scallop shell====
The symbolism of the [[scallop]] shell is multiple. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] is said to have been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. A boy was using a shell to pour sea water into a little hole. When Augustine asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am emptying the sea into this hole."  Thus did [[Augustine]] understand that man would never penetrate to the depths of the mystery of God. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on ''The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church'', and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.

The scallop shell is also an allusion to the [[Sacrament]] of Holy [[Baptism]]. In the Roman Catholic Church, a sea shell is often used to pour water over the head of the child being baptized. Thus, a sea shell is used to evoke the imagery of this rite which is fundamental to the Christian life.

The shell also stands for [[pilgrimage]]. When topped with a [[Shell of Saint James|scallop shell]] a [[pilgrim's staff]], or "[[Jacob's staff]]", is the sign of a pilgrim. In Church art it is a symbol of the apostle [[Saint James the Great]], and his sanctuary at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain, perhaps the principal place of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages. This symbol also alludes to "the pilgrim people of God", a title for the Church which Joseph Ratzinger championed at the [[Second Vatican Council]] as ''[[peritus]]'' (theological adviser) to Cardinals [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne and [[Julius Döpfner]] of Munich-Freising (his episcopal predecessor). When he became Archbishop he took the shell in his coat of arms. It is also found in the insignia of the Schottenkloster in Regensburg, where the major seminary of that diocese is located, a place where Benedict taught as a professor of theology.

Finally, the [[pilgrimage]] [[symbol]]ism of the shell may also refer both to the reconfigured role of the pope as not only ruler, but also pilgrim among the peoples and nations of the world. [[Pope Paul VI]]&mdash;who created Joseph Ratzinger as a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1977&mdash;was often called the "Pilgrim Pope" for his ground-breaking travels to the [[Holy Land]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Colombia]], the [[Philippines]], and elsewhere. This precedent was greatly elaborated upon by [[Pope John Paul II]] with his historic trips, numbering over a hundred. As a result, Benedict may be paying homage to these men and the new role for the papacy.

====Moor of Freising====
[[File:Hochstift Freising coat of arms.svg|right|150px|Moor's head of Freising, from the coat of arms of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Freising]].]]
The [[maure|Moor's head]] is a heraldic charge associated with [[Wörth, Upper Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The origin of the Moor's head in Freising is not entirely known. It typically faces to the heraldic right, the viewer's left (''[[dexter and sinister|dexter]]'' in heraldic terms) and is depicted in natural brown colour ''caput Aethiopum'' (literally "Ethiopian head") with red lips, crown and collar. This is the ancient emblem of the Diocese of Freising, founded in the 8th century, which became a [[metropolitan archdiocese]] with the name of {{lang|de|italics=no|München und Freising}} in 1818, subsequent to the [[Concordat]] between [[Pius VII]] and [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria]] (5 June 1817).

The Moor's head is fairly common in European heraldry. It still appears today in the arms of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], as well as in the [[blazons]] of various noble families. Italian heraldry, however, usually depicts the Moor wearing a white band around his head instead of a crown, indicating a slave who has been freed; whereas in [[German heraldry]] the Moor is shown wearing a crown. The Moor's head is common in the [[Bavaria]]n tradition and is known as the ''caput Ethiopicum'' or the ''Moor of Freising''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/elezione/documents/stemma-benedict-xvi.html |title=Coat of Arms of His Holiness Benedict XVI |publisher=[[Vatican Publishing House]] |accessdate=2020-09-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200226173537/http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/elezione/documents/stemma-benedict-xvi.html |archivedate=2020-02-26 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Corbinian's bear====
A legend states that while traveling to Rome, Saint [[Corbinian]]'s pack [[horse]] was killed by a [[bear]]. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned        to Bavaria. The implication is that "[[Christianity]] tamed and domesticated the ferocity of [[paganism]] and thus laid the foundations for a great civilization in the Duchy of [[Bavaria]]."<ref>{{cite web | title= The bear and the scallop-shell &mdash; a unique papal coat of arms | work=Catholic World News| url= http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=36801   | date =27 April 2005 | accessdate=5 January 2007}}</ref>  At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolizes the weight of office that Benedict carried.

==External ornaments==

Traditionally, a pope's coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. No other objects nor a motto was added. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind on heaven and earth ({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}}). Pope Benedict's arms maintain the keys, but replace the tiara with a mitre and add a pallium. However, the tiara and keys remain the symbol of the papacy, and appear on the coat of arms of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
In Pope Benedict's arms, the tiara is replaced with a silver [[mitre]] with three gold stripes.<ref name= "cns2005">{{cite news | last=Glatz | first=Carol  |  title=Pope drops papal crown from coat of arms, adds miter, pallium | date=2005-05-18 | publisher=Catholic News Service | url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502625.htm| accessdate=2012-03-23}}</ref> These stripes recall the three crowns  of the tiara, which came to represent the three powers of the Bishop of Rome: Orders, Jurisdiction and Magisterium. The stripes preserve that meaning and are joined at the centre to show their unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Pallium===
The [[pallium]] with red crosses is also a new addition.<ref name="cns2005"/> It represents a bishop's role of being pastor of the flock entrusted to him by Christ. The form of the pallium included in the coat of arms recalls that used by metropolitan archbishops (but with black crosses) rather than the much larger pallium worn by Pope Benedict at his inauguration.

==After papal abdication==
{{Main|Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI}}
After Benedict resigned as pope in 2013 and assumed the role of [[pope emeritus]], Cardinal [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]], who designed the coat of arms in 2005, said that Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms now that he was no longer the pontiff. Montezemolo drew up a proposal for a new coat of arms (which was not officially adopted), which Montezemolo believed could be used now by the former pontiff. Montezemolo's proposal moved the big keys of Saint Peter from the back of the coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller.<ref>{{cite web|author=Estefania Aguirre|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/benedict-xvi-needs-new-coat-of-arms-designer-says/ |title=Benedict XVI needs new coat of arms, designer says|date=May 4, 2013|agency=[[Catholic News Agency]]}}</ref>
