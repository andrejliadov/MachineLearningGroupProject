The portrayal of [[Warrior|women warriors]] in [[literature]] and [[popular culture]] is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a [[counter stereotype]], opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine.<ref name="Stringer">{{cite book|last1=Stringer|first1=Rebecca|editor1-last=Radner|editor1-first=Hilary|editor2-last=Stringer|editor2-first=Rebecca|title=Feminism at the Movies|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|chapter=From Victim to Vigilante: Gender, Violence, and Revenge in ''The Brave One'' (2007) and ''Hard Candy'' (2005)}}</ref>{{rp|269}} This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and [[gender roles]] in society.

==Folklore and mythology==
[[File:Medieval women as warriors.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval women helping to defend the city from attack.]]
{{See also|List of women warriors in folklore}}
In Hindu mythology, [[Chitrāngadā]], wife of [[Arjuna]], was the commander of her father's armies.

The [[Amazons]] were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. "Amazon" has become an [[eponym]] for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.

In British mythology, [[Queen Cordelia]] fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is the historical Queen [[Boudica]], who led a rebellion against the [[Roman Empire]].

In his ''On the Bravery of Women'' the Greco-Roman historian [[Plutarch]] describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of [[Telesilla]] in the fifth century BCE.<ref name="uchicago">{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Bravery_of_Women*/A.html|title=Plutarch • On the Bravery of Women — Sections I‑XV|publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2014-11-18}}</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|author=Plant, I.M.|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806136219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC|page=33|accessdate=2014-11-18}}</ref>

==Religion==
[[Hind bint ‘Utbah]] was an Arab woman in the late 6th and early 7th centuries who converted to Islam. She took part in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636, fighting the Romans and encouraging the male soldiers to join her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://raseef22.com/en/politics/2017/03/07/arab-women-war-battles-assassinations-army-leaders/|title=Arab Women at War: Battles, Assassinations, and Army Leaders |author=Azmy, Ahmed|publisher=Raseef22|date=7 March 2017|accessdate=10 March 2019 }}</ref>

[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was a prominent woman Muslim warrior in the 7th century, leading battles in what are today Syria, Jordan and Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamophobiatoday.com/2014/03/12/15-important-muslim-women-in-history/|title=15 Important Muslim Women in History|work=Islamophobia Today|accessdate=10 March 2019 }}</ref>

[[Ghazala]] the [[Khawarij|Kharijite]] was also a commander in battle, making famous generals like [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]] flee. Her courage was extolled in poems. 

[[Joan of Arc]] was a warrior in the 15th century and considered a heroine in France for her role in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. She was later canonised as a [[Roman Catholic saint]].

==Folk and fairy tales==
There is a Chinese legend, recorded by [[Gan Bao]], about the deeds of a girl named Li Ji, who slays a serpent who devoured many maidens of her village (''Li Ji Slays the Giant Serpent'' or ''Li Chi Slays the Serpent'').<ref>Gan Bao.

The narrative of the woman warrior sometimes involves the motif of crossdressing or disguising herself as a man or a male soldier. These stories belong to the cycle of ''La Doncella Guerrera'', or The Warrior Maiden.<ref>Delpech, François. "Essai d'identification d'un type de conte. Première partie. Le sauvage et la fille travestie". In: ''Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez'', tome 20, 1984. p. 298 (footnote fr. 29).

Sometimes, the disguised maiden enters the service of a king and discovers the queen's infidelity. The queen is punished and the king marries the warrior maiden.<ref>Delpech, François. "Essai d'identification d'un type de conte. Deuxième partie: Antoine, la princesse muette et l'amour médecin". In: ''Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez'', tome 21, 1985. pp. 255-280.

''Portuguese folk-tales''. London: E. Stock. 1882. pp. 53-59.</ref> These stories are classified in the [[Aarne-Thompson-Uther]] folktale index as ATU 513, "The Extraordinary Companions" and subtypes, and ATU 514, "The Shift of Sex".<ref>Thompson, Stith.

==Literature, film, and television==
{{See also|List of female action heroes and villains}}
Literary women warriors include "[[Gordafarid]]" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem [[The Shāhnāmeh]], [[Delhemma]] in [[Arabic epic literature]], [[Mulan]], [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Belphoebe]] and [[Britomartis|Britomart]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Bradamante]] and [[Marfisa]] in ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', [[Clorinda (Jerusalem Delivered)|Clorinda]] and (reluctantly) Erminia in ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]'', and [[Grendel's mother]].

The woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.<ref name="Heinecken">{{cite book|title=The Warrior Women of Television: A Feminist Cultural Analysis of the Female Body in Popular Media|date=2003|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|last1=Dawn|first1=Heinecken}}</ref>{{rp|136}}<ref name="Tasker">{{cite book|author-link1=Yvonne Tasker|last1=Tasker|first1=Yvonne|title=Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|25}}

==In feminism==
Women warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood.<ref name="Stringer" />{{rp|269}}  Professor Sherrie Inness in ''Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture''<ref>''[http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/945.html Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture]''</ref> and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in ''Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors'',<ref>''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2003-catalog/athenas-daughters.html Athena’s Daughters: Television’s New Women Warriors]''</ref> for example, focus on figures such as [[Xena]], from the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' or [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and [[Girl Power|girl power]].<ref>[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=238391094059727 Book review]</ref> 

===Violence===
Although there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like ''[[Kill Bill]]'' still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression.<ref name=Lavin>{{cite book|last1=Lavin|first1=Maud|title=Push Comes to Shove: New Images of Aggressive Women|url=https://archive.org/details/pushcomestoshove0000lavi|url-access=registration|date=2010|publisher=MIT|location=London}}</ref>{{rp|108,237}} Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women.<ref name=Verstraten>{{cite news|last1=Verstraten|first1=Katelyn|title=For Indigenous Women, Radical Art as a Last Resort|url=https://thetyee.ca/ArtsAndCulture/2013/06/22/Radical-Art/|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=The Tyee|date=22 June 2013}}</ref> Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]''.<ref name=Stringer />{{rp|269}}
