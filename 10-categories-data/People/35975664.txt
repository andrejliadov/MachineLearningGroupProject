'''''Gandhi's Three Monkeys''''' is a series of sculptures created by Indian artist [[Subodh Gupta]] that portrays three heads in different types of military headgear. The sculptures recall a visual metaphor from India's famous champion of peace, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], of the "[[Three wise monkeys]]", representing the principle "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20120528/content.asp?section=nation1_5|title=QMA unveils Gandhi’s ‘Three Monkeys’ at Katara|newspaper=[[Qatar Tribune]]|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=21 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606062409/http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20120528/content.asp?section=nation1_5|archive-date=6 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Design==
The three heads are composed of stainless steel cooking instruments, used pails, traditional Tiffin lunch boxes, and glass bowls.<ref name="vogue">[http://cloud.hauserwirth.com/documents/xL3nAXcNb3NfqP0qEg3I7nXwPujfWPDuhw7a435jlhE7j96USO/vogue-india_0209_gab1-12Ux8Y.pdf Man of Steel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225120452/http://cloud.hauserwirth.com/documents/xL3nAXcNb3NfqP0qEg3I7nXwPujfWPDuhw7a435jlhE7j96USO/vogue-india_0209_gab1-12Ux8Y.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }} in Vogue India, February 2009</ref> Different elements define each head—each respectively covered by a gas mask, a helmet and pair of glasses, and a hood.<ref name="peninsula">{{cite news|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/195800-gandhis-three-monkeys-at-katara.html|title=Gandhi’s Three Monkeys get a different rendition|date=28 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]]|accessdate=21 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702124732/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/qatar/195800-gandhis-three-monkeys-at-katara.html|archive-date=2 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
This series of sculptures continues Gupta's inspections of dualities in his artwork, including themes of war and peace, public and private, global and local.<ref name="peninsula" /> The phrase "See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil" first emerged in Japan in the 17th century and was later adopted worldwide as a message of peace and tolerance due to Mahatma Gandhi's visual metaphor of the three monkeys, with one of them covering his eyes, the second his mouth, and the third his ears.<ref name="vogue" />

Gupta's sculptures recall Gandhi's vision of these three monkeys as a way to peacefully fight against contemporary colonialism, oppression and injustice.<ref name="subodhgupta" />

==Location==
Since they were created in 2008, the sculptures have toured the world within various exhibitions, such as the "STILL, STEAL, STEEL" show at Jack Shainman gallery (March–April 2008).<ref name="subodhgupta">[http://www.jackshainman.com/exhibition54.html?image=164 SUBODH GUPTA / STILL, STEAL, STEEL]</ref>

Recently, the sculptures were installed permanently in [[Katara Cultural Village]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.katara.net/blog/gandhi-three-monkeys-by-subodh-gupta/ |title=Gandhi's Three Monkeys by Subodh Gupta |access-date=2012-05-29 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903144533/http://www.katara.net/blog/gandhi-three-monkeys-by-subodh-gupta/ |archive-date=2012-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
