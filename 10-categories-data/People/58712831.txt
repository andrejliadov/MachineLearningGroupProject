The '''coat of arms of the Prince of Wales''' is the official [[Heraldry|heraldic]] insignia of the [[Prince of Wales]], a title traditionally granted to the [[heir apparent]] to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|reigning monarch]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], formerly the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and before that the [[Kingdom of England]].

The [[coat of arms]], in its current form, was devised for [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in 1958. It contains the badges and elements taken from all four of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent countries of the United Kingdom]] as well as from the many [[List of titles and honours of Charles, Prince of Wales|titles the prince holds]] as [[heir apparent]].

The history of the coat of arms is closely linked with those of the [[Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms of England]] and the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, as the noted antiquarian and heraldist [[Charles Boutell]] wrote in 1863, "The Arms of the Prince of Wales have a distinct individuality of their own, with which nothing ought to be directly associated."<ref name="Boutell 256">Boutell p. 256</ref>

==Elements==
=== Coronet ===
[[File:Ströhl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 31.png|thumb|130px|left|The British heir-apparent's coronet as depicted by [[Hugo Gerard Ströhl]]]]
The [[Coronet|coronets of the Prince and the Peers]] of the realm were regulated by King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by Royal Warrant, signed on 9 February 1661. Part of the warrant proclaimed: "Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, That the Son and Heir Apparent of the Crown for the time being, shall use and bear his Coronet composed of Crosses and [[Fleur-de-lis|Flower-de-Lized]] with one Arch; and in the midst a [[Monde|Ball and Cross]], as hath our Royal Diadem".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#The_Warrant_of_1661 |title=Warrant of Feb 9, 1661|access-date=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}</ref>

In other words, the heraldic coronet used in the Prince of Wales's coat of arms is similar to the [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] ([[St. Edward's crown]]) used in the Royal arms, except that instead of two intersecting arches it has only one. Boutell wrote that: "It should be noticed, however, that this coronet belongs to the prince as eldest son of the Sovereign and heir-apparent to the Throne, and not as Prince of Wales". The coronet is also used by the Prince of Wales's consort, in her coat of arms.<ref name="Boutell 363">Boutell p. 363</ref>

The heir's coronet was confirmed in another Royal Warrant signed on 19 November 1917 by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. The warrant proclaimed: "by the son and heir apparent of the sovereign and his successors a coronet composed of crosses and fleurs-de-lis with one arch and in the midst a ball and cross as in the royal crown."<ref name="1917 warrant">{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#Warrant_of_Nov_19_1917 |title=Warrant of 19 Nov 1917|access-date=2018-08-10 |work=www.heraldica.org}}</ref>

Currently there are three physical examples of coronets used at one time or other as part of the [[Honours of the Principality of Wales]]: the [[Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Frederick]], the [[Coronet of George, Prince of Wales|Coronet of George]] and the [[Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales|Coronet of Charles]]. However, these physical manifestations have not affected the graphical representation of the coronet in heraldic art.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/honours-principality-wales |title=Honours of the Principality of Wales |website=www.royal.uk |access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref>

=== Label ===
Beginning with the reign of King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]] (or blue) was used by his son, the future King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], to differentiate his arms from those of his father. Without such a label their arms would be identical. Within [[heraldry]] this system of differentiating arms is called [[cadency]]. The label is placed on the [[Chief (heraldry)|chief]] (or top) of the [[shield]] of arms, with the ends extending across from the dexter to the sinister sides of the shield. It was Prince [[Edward the Black Prince]], heir of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], who first used a label of three points [[Argent]], also white or silver. This has been the label of the heir apparent ever since, without regard to the system of [[Cadency labels of the British royal family|cadency used by other members]] of the royal family.<ref name="Official Web"/><ref>Boutell p. 187</ref>

=== Crest ===
[[File:Prince of Wales 1914.png|thumb|200px|right|Coat of arms of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] as illustrated in [[Burke's Peerage]] 1914 edition.]]
The Prince of Wales's [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] follows closely that of the Sovereign, but always with the appropriate label of [[Cadency|difference]] displayed. This crest depicts a "Lion [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], passant guardant, wearing a coronet of the Heir, and differenced on the shoulders with a label of three points Argent." The lion always stands on a larger coronet of the Heir, which then sits on a golden [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] or the Royal Helm. From the sides flow the gold and [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] [[mantling]] of the royal family.<ref name="Official Web"/>

=== Supporters ===
Similarly to the crest, the prince's [[supporter]]s follow those of the Sovereign. On either side of the shield of arms and standing on gold scrollwork are the royal supporters: the [[Lion and the Unicorn]]. Both beasts have the prince's label charged around their necks, again as an appropriate mark of difference. The [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|dexter side]], an [[National symbols of England|ancient symbol of England]], is crowned with the coronet of the Heir. The beast has been a [[Royal Supporters of England|supporter of the English royal arms]] since the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The white [[Unicorn#Heraldry|unicorn]] of [[Scotland]] on the [[Dexter and sinister|sinister side]] was incorporated into the royal arms from the [[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|Scottish royal arms]] after the Union of the crowns in 1603.<ref name="Official Web"/>

=== Order ===
Prince Charles was appointed a [[List of current members of the Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] in 1958. Since the founding of the Order in 1348, almost every Prince of Wales has been appointed to the Order.<ref>Boutell p. 265</ref> The [[Order of the Garter]] is represented in the coat of arms by its namesake the blue buckled [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], which bears in gold letters the motto ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'', [[French language|French]] for "Shame upon him who thinks evil of it".<ref name="Official Web"/>

=== Motto ===
Under the coat of arms is a scroll bearing the [[motto]] ''[[Ich dien]]'', German for "I serve". The motto of uncertain origin first appeared on the arms of [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward of Woodstock]], or the Black Prince. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales by his father King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] on 12 May 1343. Legend holds that the Black Prince took the motto as well as the ostrich feathers from King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind of Bohemia]], who was killed fighting alongside the prince and his father at the [[Battle of Crécy]] in 1346. The motto is also a near [[homophone]] for ''Eich Dyn'', "Your Man" in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref name="Official Web"/><ref>Scott-Giles p. 75</ref>

The Prince of Wales as part of his full achievement of arms has many [[Heraldic badge]]s, which represent the history and sovereignty of his many titles.

====Prince of Wales' feathers====
{{Main|Prince of Wales's feathers}}
 
The Prince of Wales's feathers badge comprises "a plume of three [[ostrich]] feathers Argent enfiled by a royal coronet of alternate crosses and fleur-de-lys Or" with the motto "Ich Dien" on a dark blue ribbon. The badge is probably the most recognisable element of the Prince of Wales's heraldic achievement as a personal insignia of the prince and also of the [[Principality of Wales]] itself.<ref name="Official Web"/><ref name="Feathers">{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry|title=Titles and Heraldry: Prince of Wales's Feathers |access-date=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}</ref> In a personal capacity the badge is granted as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant of Appointment]] to companies that regularly supply goods and services to the Prince. Currently there are 170 companies which are entitled to display this badge with the words "By Appointment to HRH The Prince of Wales" underneath. The badge can be depicted on all premises, delivery vehicles, stationery and advertisements as well as on the individual products themselves.<ref name="Warrants">{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/titles-and-heraldry |title=Titles and Heraldry: Royal Warrants |access-date=2018-08-10 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}</ref> Other organisations associated with Wales or the Prince incorporate the badge into their own insignia including many Welsh regiments of the [[British Army]] (such as the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]]) and the [[Welsh Rugby Union]].<ref>Scott-Giles p. 18</ref>

Feathers used as either a crest or a badge have been an [[Royal badges of England|ancient heraldic badge]] of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. However, it was not until its incorporation into the heraldic achievements of the Black Prince that the feathers have become an omnipresent feature of the coats of arms of the Prince of Wales.<ref>Scott-Giles pp. 89&ndash;93</ref>

====Red Dragon of Wales====
{{Main|Royal Badge of Wales}}
On 10 December 1901 a warrant signed by King [[Edward VII]] approved the addition of a badge of the [[Welsh Dragon|Red Dragon]] to the coat of arms of the Prince of Wales. The proclamation specified "on the sinister side a representation of the [[Royal badge of Wales|Badge of Wales]], namely, on a mount vert a Dragon, passant [[gules]], differenced (as in the Crest) with a label of three points argent." This was to complement the feathers badge, which was to be depicted on the dexter side of the prince's crest.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=27385 |date=10 December 1901 |page=8714 }}</ref>

The Red Dragon, or ''Y Ddraig Goch'', has been a symbol associated with Wales since the time of [[Cadwaladr]], [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|King of Gwynedd]] in the 7th century. It was not until the beginning of the [[House of Tudor]] that the Red Dragon became a royal badge of the kings of England. Henry Tudor (later King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]) displayed the Dragon of Cadwaladr on his [[Royal standards of England|battle standard]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Robin%20Ashburner.pdf |title=Flags in Wales |last=Ashburner |first=Robin |date=2001 |website=flaginstitute.org |access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> The red dragon became an official royal badge of the sovereign (representing Wales) according to a warrant issued in 1801. The warrant at the same time also confirmed the [[Tudor rose]] as a royal badge for England, the [[thistle]] for Scotland and the [[Celtic harp|golden harp]] for Ireland.<ref>Pinces & Pinces p. 216</ref>

====Arms of the Duchy of Cornwall====
{{Main|Duke of Cornwall}}
The arms of the Duke of Cornwall are: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]], fifteen [[bezant]]s, five, four, three, two and one." These arms were derived from those of [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], [[King of the Romans]], son and heir of King [[John, King of England|John]], who was also [[Count of Poitiers]] (or [[Poitou]]), represented by arms made up of [[pea]]s ({{lang|fr|pois}}) or [[gold coin]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fox-Davis |first=Arthur Charles|author-link=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |title=The Book Of Public Arms.

Upon the accession of the prince's mother as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] on 6 February 1952, Prince Charles was automatically made the [[Duke of Cornwall]]. As such he is able to display the arms of the duchy on his coat of arms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|author-link=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's guide to the Royal Family (Burke's genealogical series)|url=https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond |url-access=registration|year=1973 |publisher=Burke's Peerage; 1st edition |location=London |isbn=0220662223|pages=[https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/137 137]}}</ref> This title has been granted to every heir apparent since 17 March 1337, in accordance with a charter issued by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] for his eldest son and heir [[Edward the Black Prince]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke's Peerage|author-link=Burke's Peerage |title=Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of peerage, baronetage and knightage |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ |year=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Pf8cAAAAYAAJ/page/n214 16]}}</ref> A royal warrant of 21 June 1968 augmented this arms with two supporters "on either side, a [[Cornish chough]] proper supporting an ostrich feather Argent, penned Or", and a motto: "''Houmont''" (or ''Houmout''), meaning courage.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=Geoffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Civic_Corporate_Heraldry.html?id=XR6hQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y |title=Civic & Corporate Heraldry: A Dictionary of Impersonal Arms of England, Wales, & N.

The Hanoverian inescutcheon was replaced by the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]], which was an heraldic inheritance from the queen's husband Prince [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (a Duke of Saxony).<ref name="Aveling 287">Aveling p. 287</ref><ref>Pinches & Pinches p. 259</ref> The inescutcheon only appeared in the arms of Albert's male-line descendants, and not in the Royal arms itself. According to the antiquarian Charles Boutell, the inescutcheon was placed as an "escutcheon of pretence", that "does not appear to be in accordance with either the spirit or the practical usage of true historical Heraldry".<ref name="Boutell 256"/> These arms were granted twice, first to 'Bertie' (later King Edward VII) and to the future George V. In his 1909 book ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] writes: "It is much to be regretted that the arms of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales (the future George V) do not include the arms of his sovereignty of the Duchy of Cornwall, nor any allusion to his dignities of Prince of Wales or [[Earl of Chester]]."<ref name="FD 486">Fox-Davies (1909) p. 486</ref><ref>Pinches & Pinches p. 265</ref>

||In 1910 Prince Edward was invested and presented to the Welsh people as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle, the first time in six hundred years. Welsh local authorities had asked that the red dragon might be introduced into the Royal arms and the coinage, but neither of these wishes were granted. However, a year later in 1911, King George V issued an [[order in council]] that replaced the inescutcheon of Saxony, in the Arms of the Prince of Wales, with an inescutcheon with the arms "representing the Principality of Wales". Blazoned as: ''"Quarterly Or and Gules four lions passant guardant counterchanged, ensigned by the Coronet of His degree."''<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=28473 |date=7 March 1911 |page=1939 }}</ref><ref>Pinches & Pinches p. 273</ref> In 1958 Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, son of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], was granted the same arms when he was made Prince of Wales.<ref>Pinches & Pinches p. 280</ref>

==Family==
===Consorts===
The family of the Prince of Wales is entitled to use certain heraldic features. The consort of the Prince of Wales (titled the [[Princess of Wales]]) is granted a unique coat of arms upon marriage, based on the [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] of the prince's arms (on the dexter side) and her father's arms (on the sinister side). The consort is also entitled to use the prince's supporters (with the appropriate label) and the use of the prince's coronet over the arms.<ref name="Boutell 363"/> The current consort, [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], the [[Duchess of Cornwall]], was granted a coat of arms on 17 July 2005 upon her marriage to Charles, Prince of Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/biographies/hrh-duchess-cornwall |title=HRH The Duchess of Cornwall: Titles and Heraldry |access-date=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the Prince of Wales}}</ref>

===Children===
The children of the heir apparent were given their own distinct coronet, unlike any other grandchildren of the sovereign. This was confirmed in the 1917 Royal Warrant, which proclaimed: ''"to all the sons and daughters of the son and heir apparent of us and of our successors a coronet composed of two [[Cross pattée|crosses pattée]] (or crosses formy), four fleurs-de-lis and two strawberry leaves."''<ref name= "1917 warrant"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/71-coat-of-arms-prince-william |title=The Coat of Arms of HRH Prince William of Wales |access-date=2018-10-09 |work=Official website of the College of Arms}}</ref> The wives of the sons of the Prince of Wales use the same coronet as their husbands, for example, the arms borne by [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], which were granted to her in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/the-duchess-of-cambridge/titles-and-heraldry/coat-of-arms-0 |title=Coat of Arms of Duchess of Cambridge |publisher=dukeandduchessofcambridge.org |date=14 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106071755/http://www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org/the-duchess-of-cambridge/titles-and-heraldry/coat-of-arms-0 |archive-date=6 November 2012 |access-date=2018-08-10 }}</ref>
