==Comedy style==
Abdul Rashid switches from surreal to satirical in his dichotomy of being a middle-class educated man yet simultaneously a street-smart urban youth while avoiding clichés when dealing with topics such as being a black Muslim in South London. He switches accent and languages, speaking French, [[Patois]], [[Urdu]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and blends them into his material.<ref name="comedycv"/><ref name="flavourmag">{{cite news |url=http://www.flavourmag.co.uk/ones-to-watch/|title=Ones to watch|work=Flavour Magazine|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref>
