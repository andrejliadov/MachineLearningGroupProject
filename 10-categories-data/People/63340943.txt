Prior to the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], nearly all Lord Chancellors were peers of the realm (if not already, then ennobled swiftly after taking office) and the principal presiding officer of the upper house of Parliament - now taken by the [[Lord Speaker]]. Shields of arms of former Chancellors are painted on the coving of the chamber (beneath the railings of the public viewing galleries) interspersed with the shields of arms of the monarchs whom they served. <ref>{{cite book|title=Curiosities of London: Exhibiting the Most Rare and Remarkable Objects of Interest in the Metropolis |author=John Timbs |publisher=D.
