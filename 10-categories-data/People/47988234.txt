'''Women in music''' describes the role of women as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critic]]s/[[music journalist]]s and in other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements (e.g., [[women's music]], which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]].

In the 2010s, while women constitute a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critic]]s and rock instrumentalists. Notable women artists in pop, such as [[Bjork]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have commented about [[sexism]] and [[gender discrimination]] in the [[music industry]].<ref name="newyorker.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics|title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics|first=Anwen|last=Crawford|date=26 May 2015|access-date=7 April 2018|website=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref name="people.com">{{cite web|first = Karen |last = Mizoguchi|title = Lady Gaga Calls Music Industry a 'F—king Boys Club' |work = People|date = 12 December 2015|url =  http://www.people.com/article/lady-gaga-music-industry-boys-club-billboard}}</ref>  Additionally, a recent study led by Dr. Smith announced that "...over the last six years, the representation of women in the music industry has been even lower".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/arts/music/music-industry-gender-study-women-artists-producers.html|title=Gender Diversity in the Music Industry?

Women constitute a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s.

A songwriter is an individual who writes the [[lyrics]], [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s for songs, typically for a [[popular music]] genre such as pop, rock or [[country music]]. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.

===19th century-early 20th century===
"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the "lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage."<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> Women "struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th century [[Tin Pan Alley]]. Prior to 1900 and even after, it was expected that "women would perform music, not make music."<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote the book ''Women in Music'', in which he argued that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to the "biological predisposition" of women.<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> As part of women's role in music education, women wrote hymns and children's music. The "secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women." In the mid 19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including [[Faustina Hasse Hodges]], Susan Parkhurst, [[Augusta Browne]] and [[Marion Dix Sullivan]]. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but "many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials" to hide the fact that they were women.<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/>

[[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] was the "preeminent woman composer of the late 1800s and well into the middle of the twentieth century... [making her] the first million selling woman" songwriter.<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> Maude Nugent (1877–1958) wrote "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" in 1896. She also penned "Down at Rosie Reilly's Flat", "My Irish Daisy" and "Mary From Tipperary".<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> Charlotte Blake (1885–1979) was a staff writer for at the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, Michigan.

She was "one of America's more well known and popular composers of the Tin Pan Alley era." Her songs include "Can't Yo' Heah Me Calling", "Faded Rose", "The Angelus", "Thinking of Thee" and "Resignation".<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> About 95% of the songwriters in British [[music hall]] during the early 1900s were men; however, about 30% of the singers were women.<ref name="ReferenceA">John Mullen.

===Jazz in the 20th century===
[[File:Lil Armstrong Billboard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898–1971) was a notable jazz songwriter.]]
While [[jazz]] songwriting has long been a male-dominated field, there have been a few notable [[Women in Jazz|women jazz songwriters]]. In the 1930s, [[Ann Ronell]] (1905–1993) wrote several hit songs. She is known for her 1932 hit song "[[Willow Weep for Me]]" and the 1933 Disney song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?".<ref name="blog.oup.com"/> [[Irene Higginbotham]] (1918–1988) wrote almost 50 songs, her best-known being "Good Morning Heartache".<ref name="blog.oup.com">{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/03/jazz-women-songwriters-gioia/|title=Five women songwriters who helped shape the sound of jazz |website= OUPblog|date=12 March 2013|first = Ted|last = Gioia}}</ref> [[Dorothy Fields]] (1905–1974) wrote the lyrics for over 400 songs, some of which were played by [[Duke Ellington]]. She co-wrote "[[The Way You Look Tonight]]" with [[Jerome Kern]], which won the 1936 Oscar for Best Song. She co-wrote several jazz standards with [[Jimmy McHugh]], such as "[[Exactly Like You (song)|Exactly Like You]]", "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]" and "[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love]]".<ref name="blog.oup.com"/> [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898–1971) played piano in [[King Oliver]]'s Creole Jazz Band. Her most famous song, "Struttin' with Some Barbecue", has been recorded 500 times. Her other notable songs are "Doin' the Suzie Q", "Just for a Thrill" and "Bad Boy".<ref name="blog.oup.com"/> While [[Billie Holiday]] (1915–1959) is best known as a singer, she co-wrote "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]" and "[[Don't Explain (song)|Don't Explain]]" with [[Arthur Herzog, Jr.]] and she penned the blues song "[[Fine and Mellow (song)|Fine and Mellow]]".<ref name="blog.oup.com"/>

Jazz music was a propelling force to help women with liberation in the early 20th century. Jazz music also helped pave the way for more jobs for women. This increase of a very male-dominated career until the 1920s allowed more women to be in a performing arts career. In return of this increase, ''Showboat'', the first jazz Broadway musical, was produced. ''Showboat'' discusses the hardships of family in Mississippi and the reunification of family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnh.com/show/89/Show-Boat|title=Show Boat|website=rnh.com|access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> Jazz music influenced in helping women gain more jobs, open environment for post-war equality, and open sexuality in the early twentieth century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/tbacig/studproj/is3099/jazzcult/20sjazz/jazzlib.html|title=jazzlib|website=d.umn.edu|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> Many of the women in jazz music at the time helped influence the genre and many jazz women musicians were people of color. These factors helped grow the jazz music genre that is it today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Many women influenced jazz music by producing, composing and performing jazz music. A woman who was influential in jazz music was Bessie Smith, also known as the Empress of the Blues. She lived from 1894 to 1937. She is a rock and roll hall of fame inductee, and 1989 Smith was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/bessie-smith.|title=Inductee Explorer|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> Another woman who made history in the jazz industry is Dolly Jones.

Women like Sweet Emma Barrett, who performed in the Original Tuxedo Orchestra toured domestically and internationally. One of Barrett's hit songs is "A Good Man is Hard to Find". More women such as Billie Pierce, Lovie Austin,  Jeanette Kimball, Mary Lou Williams, Alice Coltrane, and Hazel Scott, all had an impact in the jazz genre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectrevolver.org/features/articles/women-jazz-10-ladies-changed-music-forever/|title=Women in Jazz: 10 Ladies Who Changed Music Forever|last=Alexandra Daoud|date=26 September 2017|website=Project Revolver|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> These women made their mark especially by being women in a very male-dominated genre.

Many of these women who are well known in the jazz world are not seen to receive as much recognition as they deserve because of their male competitors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Not only were women influential as jazz singers, but there are so many jazz musicians that also do not get their credit. One woman was Ingrid Monson, who brought to the attention that when women first started to play the piano, they also gained more social acceptance in the music industry. Typically women would be seen to play in an all-women's jazz group, but when they would step into the "professional jazz world" they would be an instant hit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 January 2003|title=The NPR curious listener's guide to jazz|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=40|issue=5|pages=40–2702–40–2702|doi=10.5860/choice.40-2702|issn=0009-4978}}</ref> One woman, by the name of Valaida Snow was also known as the "queen of the trumpet".<ref name=":0">Saur, Kirsten (20 April 2016).

These women had a lot of success, but for some it was short lived. These women rose to fame when men were drafted off into World War II. However, once these men came home from being deployed, the jazz musicians who were women were then faced with difficult hardships. Problems such as sexual harassment and harsh criticism from their other band members and fellow jazz musicians were seen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===New wave of female singer-songwriters===
By the late 1960s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, writing more personal songs in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. The artists spearheading this movement were featured in [[Newsweek]], July 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go": "What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Janis Ian]] and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalized songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery." While innovating, these women also faced many struggles such as discrimination. In a male dominated publishing world, female songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]] want to be seen outside categories of race and gender, and into the category of pure artistry.<ref name="auto3">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt130j6dp|title=Girls Rock!: Fifty Years of Women Making Music|last1=Carson|first1=Mina|last2=Lewis|first2=Tisa|last3=Shaw|first3=Susan M.|last4=Baumgardner|first4=Jennifer|last5=Richards|first5=Amy|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=9780813123103|edition=1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/girlsrockfiftyye0000cars}}</ref> In her 1994 interview with [[Alice Echols|Alice Echol]], [[Joni Mitchell]] rejected feminism but voiced her animosity towards discrimination, sex-based exclusion, and gratuitous sexualization.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard  'classical' repertoire?"<ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993">Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.</ref> Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.<ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/>

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve".<ref name="rvanews.com">{{cite web|first=Abbey|last = Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=Spacebomb: Truth lies somewhere in between |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=1 September 2011 }}</ref> During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.<ref name="rvanews.com"/> Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts".<ref name="rvanews.com"/>

{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|description=From ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) was a German [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], composer, writer, philosopher, and [[visionary]].<ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001">Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.</ref> One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and an early [[morality play]].  Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary | title=Dictionary by Merriam-Webster: America's most-trusted online dictionary}}</ref><ref>[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html|title=1998 New York Times art-at-large Matt Mirapaul Hildegurls feature|website=kitbraz.com}}</ref> Sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.</ref> Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], using soaring melodies that pushed the boundaries of the more traditional [[Gregorian chant]].

===Renaissance era===
[[Maddalena Casulana]] (1544–1590) was an Italian composer, [[lute]]nist and singer.<ref>Alternative names: Madalena Casulana di Mezarii, Madalena Casula.</ref> Her first work dates from 1566: four madrigals in a collection, ''Il Desiderio'', which she produced in [[Florence]]. Two years later she published in [[Venice]] her first book of madrigals for four voices, ''Il primo libro di madrigali'', which is the first printed, published work by a woman in Western music history.<ref>{{cite Grove |first=Thomas W. |last=Bridges |year=2001 |title=Casulana [Mezari], Maddalena |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.05155}}</ref> She was close to [[Isabella de' Medici]] and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals. In the dedication to her first book of madrigals, she shows her feelings about being a female composer at a time when this was rare: "[I] want to show the world, as much as I can in this profession of music, the vain error of men that they alone possess the gifts of intellect and artistry, and that such gifts are never given to women." 
Her style is [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] and [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and her melodic lines are singable and attentive to the text. Other composers of the time, such as [[Philippe de Monte]], thought highly of her.

[[Caterina Assandra]] (1590–1618) was an Italian composer and [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. She became famous as an organist and published various works.<ref>''Women Composers: Music Through the Ages.''</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165459/http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Assandra composed a number of [[motet]]s and organ pieces. She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.

===Baroque era===
[[File:Orazio Gentileschi - Il suonatore di liuto (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Lute Player'' by [[Orazio Gentileschi]], presumed to be a portrait of Francesca Caccini]]
[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the "best singer in all of France". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute "comedy-ballet". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.

[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be "the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.

[[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]]. She was born into a family of musicians and master instrument-makers. A child prodigy, she performed on the [[harpsichord]] before King [[Louis XIV]]. She became a musician in the Royal Court and taught, composed, and gave concerts at home and throughout Paris, to great acclaim.<ref name="Grove">{{cite Grove |first=Catherine |last=Cessac |author-link=Catherine Cessac |year=2001 |title=Jacquet de La Guerre, Elisabeth |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.14084}}</ref> She was one of the few well-known female composers of her time, and unlike many of her contemporaries, she composed in a wide variety of forms.<ref>Mary Cyr.

Vol. 149, No. 1905 (Winter, 2008), pp. 79–87.</ref>  Her talent and achievements were acknowledged by [[Titon du Tillet]], who accorded her a place on his ''Mount Parnassus'' when she was only 26 years old, next to Lalande and Marais and directly below Lully. Her works include a ballet, an opera (''[[Céphale et Procris (Jacquet de la Guerre)|Céphale et Procris]]''), [[trio sonata]]s, harpsichord pieces, ''Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin'' and vocal works such as her ''[[Cantates]] françoises sur des sujets tirez de l'Ecriture''.

[[Harriett Abrams]] (1758–1821) was an English composer and [[soprano]]. As a singer, she was praised for her performances of [[George Frideric Handel]]. She studied singing, [[music theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] with composer [[Thomas Arne]] before making her opera début in 1775 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780 to 1790. Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became popular. She published two sets of Italian and English [[canzonet]]s, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental [[ballad]]s. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]].<ref name="Grove1">{{cite Grove |first=Olive |last=Baldwin |first2=Thelma |last2=Wilson |origyear=2001 |date=24 February 2010 |title=Abrams, Harriett |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.00059}}</ref>

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi]] (1720–1795) was an Italian composer.  Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished [[harpsichordist]] and singer. The majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles. She also wrote arias, concertos and sonatas for keyboard, small ensemble and voice.

[[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia|Princess Anna Amalia]] (1723–1787) was a Prussian composer and score curator. She learned to play the harpsichord, flute, and violin as a young woman.

As a composer she achieved a modest amount of fame and is most known for her smaller chamber works, which included trios, marches, cantatas, songs and fugues. In 1758, she studied musical theory and composition with [[Johann Kirnberger|Johann Philipp Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. She composed chamber music such as flute sonatas. More, she set the text of Ramler's [[Passion cantata]] ''Der Tod Jesu'' ("The Death of Jesus") to music. She was also a collector of music, preserving over 600 volumes of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Karl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], among others. Her works of [[curator|curation]] are a significant contribution to [[Western culture]].

===Romantic era===
[[File:Fanny Hensel 1842.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Mendelssohn, 1842, by [[Moritz Daniel Oppenheim]]]]

[[Maria Szymanowska]] (1789–1831) was a well-known Polish composer and pianist. She wrote in many of the same genres as fellow Pole [[Frederic Chopin]] (1810–1849). Szymanowska maintained connections with several famous nineteenth-century people, including [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Poland's greatest poet.

[[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) was one of the best-known women composers of the 1800s. She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that "[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82</ref> Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:
<blockquote>'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113
</ref>  </blockquote>

[[Clara Schumann]] (1819–1896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Frédéric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently "praised her extravagantly" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.<ref name="Nancya250">Reich (1986), 250.</ref> She was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' ("Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.<ref name="Nancya250" />

She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. <!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:

{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out'.}}{{cn|date=February 2018}}-->

[[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] (born 1939) received her Doctorate in Composition from [[Juilliard]] and was the first woman to ever achieve this. The same year, she won a gold medal at the International Composition Competition in Italy. In 1983 Zwilich made history again, becoming the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in music for her ''Symphony No. 1.'' Since this success, she has received many commissions. Her piece ''Millennium'' has been performed by twenty-seven orchestras since its premiere in 2000.

====Individuals and bandleaders====
[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. "[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.<ref>Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers.

"Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''.

"Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104</ref> "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians."<ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/> One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role."<ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/> In the 1960s pop music scene, "[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done."<ref name="rebeatmag.com"/>

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".<ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man">{{cite journal |last=Auslander |first=Philip |date=28 January 2004 |title=I Wanna Be Your Man: Suzi Quatro's musical androgyny |journal=Popular Music |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |doi=10.1017/S0261143004000030 |url=http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524032035/http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/quatro.pdf |archive-date= 24 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{rp|2–3}} In relation to the gender composition of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal bands]], it has been said that "[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male"<ref name="Brake 1990 87–91">{{cite book |last=Brake |first=Mike |editor1-last=Frith |editor1-first=Simon |editor2-last=Goodwin |editor2-first=Andrew |title=On Record: Rock, Pop and the Written Word |publisher=Routledge |date=1990 |pages=87–91 |chapter=Heavy Metal Culture, Masculinity and Iconography }}</ref> "[a]t least until the mid-1980s"<ref>{{cite book |last=Walser |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=Running with the Devil:Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |page=76 }}</ref> apart from "exceptions such as [[Girlschool]]."<ref name="Brake 1990 87–91"/> However, "now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Chuck |date=1 July 2011 |title=Women of Metal |journal=Spin|publisher=SpinMedia Group}}</ref> "carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kim |date=17 January 2013 |title=Queens of noise: heavy metal encourages heavy-hitting women |journal=The Telegraph}}</ref>
When [[Suzi Quatro]] emerged in 1973, "no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader".<ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man" />{{rp|2}} According to Auslander, she was "kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female ''musician''&nbsp;... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about&nbsp;... could play as well if not better than the boys".<ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man" />{{rp|3}}

====All-female bands and girl groups====
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.<ref>For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].</ref> While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |access-date=4 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups – A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date=n.d.|access-date=4 June 2014}}</ref> All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.<ref>For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007</ref>

These all-female bands were difficult to maintain, as many earlier groups struggled with replacing female musicians once they departed, and some were forced to open the band to men to avoid quitting.<ref name="jstor.org">HENRY, M. (2013). ALL-FEMALE BANDS. In Pretty Good for a Girl: Women in Bluegrass (pp. 304–315). University of Illinois Press. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt3fh3cr.50</ref>

====1930s–1960s====
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular.[[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://szczecin.wyborcza.pl/szczecin/1,34939,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html|title=Filipinki.

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie & the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), Ariel (1968–1970), and the New Coon Creek Girls (1930s).<ref name="jstor.org"/>

====1970s–1980s====
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.</ref> [[Joan Jett]]'s "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]" at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] "[[We Got the Beat]]" at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money. 
In 1989, one of the most famous female bands, [[the Dixie Chicks]], began playing on street corners in Dallas, Texas. This band consists of a trio of [[Natalie Maines]] as lead singer, Natalie Maguire on the fiddle and mandolin, and [[Emily Robison]], master of banjo, the Dobro, guitar, and the accordion. The Dixie Chicks sold more CDs than all other country music groups combined. They won five [[Grammys]], in 2000, the Country Music Association's Album of the Year, and the Vocal Group of the Year award in 2002. Another famous female band includes the WildWood Girls. Originally the WildWood Pickers beginning in 1979 from the Chicago area, the all female band began after the band became a family affair and later, they changed their name to WildWood Girls in 1982, resulting in twice as many bookings. They embarked on overseas tours for the USO and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], they worked as a band at [[Dollywood]] for about 5 years, and they played many times at Bill Monroe's Bean Blossom Festival in [[Indiana]] for 10 years. They released six recordings, despite the issues they ran into regarding the fact that they were an all girls band. Yet, another famous band is the Happy Hollow String brand (1974–1979). They were an all female bluegrass band with Sandy Crisco on banjo. Crisco reported that it was difficult to find the ladies restroom during bookings, as due to the lack of female performers, many male instrumentalists did not know where it was.<ref name="jstor.org"/>

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical.

The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Go's]], switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom. Women in the heavy metal genre tend to have to limit themselves due to the genre being very male orientated.<ref>Hill, R.L.

While there is a perception that the groups in the 1980s and 1990s [[alternative rock]] genre of [[grunge]] were "overwhelmingly male" (e.g., [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), "[w]omen were totally represented" in grunge bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], STP, [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Courtney Love]]'s group [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the latter an "all-female Minneapolis band", and grunge was "inextricably linked with [[Riot Grrrl]]", an underground feminist [[punk rock|punk]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain|title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain |last=True |first=Everett |date= 24 August 2011|work=The Guardian |access-date=29 January 2017 }}</ref> Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and drummers [[Patty Schemel]] (Hole and Courtney Love projects) and [[Lori Barbero]] of Babes in Toyland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://90srock.about.com/od/top-picks/tp/The-Greatest-Drummers-of-the-90s.htm|title=The 10 Greatest Drummers of the '90s|website=90srockmusic.com|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref>

====1990s–2000s====
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]<ref>Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977</ref><ref>Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998</ref> and [[Tina Weymouth]]<ref>"Tina Weymouth & David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984</ref> on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.<ref>Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991. "Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint."</ref> In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]]. [[Destiny's Child]] was a female American group composed of [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]], and Michelle Williams. Destiny's Child began as [[Girl's Tyme]], in 1990 and years later, it was signed to [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] as Destiny's Child in 1997. Destiny's Child's best-selling second album was ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' (1999), which included  "Bills, Bills, Bills" and "Say My Name".<ref>"Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing)". MTV. 13 June 2005. Retrieved 4 June 2014.</ref> Additionally, the [[Spice Girls]] was a British all girl pop group that formed in 1994. The band is composed of [[Melanie Brown]], [[Melanie Chisholm]], [[Emma Bunton]], [[Geri Halliwell]], and [[Victoria Beckham]]. They signed with [[Virgin Records]] and their single "Wannabe" came out in 1996 and was deemed as number one in 37 different countries.<ref>"Simon Fuller: Guiding pop culture". BBC News. 18 June 2003. Retrieved 18 September 2011.</ref>

====2000s–2010s====
In the 2000s, all female and female fronted bands started using their influence to promote feminism and females in the music industry. Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/|title=HAIM Says a Male Group Got Paid 10 Times More by a Festival|date=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back|title=Live music acts are mostly male-only. What's holding women back?|first=Naomi|last=Larsson|date=12 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> In recent years, the lack of female representation in music has been a major controversial point in the industry. Female musicians and bands are constantly overlooked in favor of male artists, however many people in the music industry have been making an effort to change this.

==== 2010s–2018 ====
From 2010 to 2018, many girl bands have emerged and became more popular. One of the most famous girl bands is [[Little Mix]] (2011), a British band that originated on ''[[The X Factor]]'' and is composed of [[Jesy Nelson]], [[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]], [[Jade Thirlwall]], and [[Perrie Edwards]]. Little Mix is the first all female group since the [[Pussycat Dolls]] to reach the US top five with their album ''[[DNA (Little Mix album)|DNA]]'' (2012). They also broke the record held by the [[Spice Girls]] by earning the highest debut US chart position for a British girl group's first release.<ref>"Simon Cowell Congratulates Little Mix After DNA Beats Spice Girls' Record Stateside". ''HuffPost''. 5 June 2013.</ref> Additionally, [[Fifth Harmony]] is an American female group that is based in Miami and composed of [[Ally Brooke]], [[Normani Kordei]], [[Dinah Jane]], [[Lauren Jauregui]], and [[Camila Cabello]] until her departure in 2016. This group was also on the ''X Factor'' in 2012. Their three studio albums charted on the top ten of the US [[Billboard 200]].<ref>

===Jazz===
[[File:Mary Lou Williams (Gottlieb 09231) - Crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mary Lou Williams]] (1910–1981) was a pianist, composer and arranger who played [[jazz]], classical and [[Gospel music|gospel]] music. She wrote hundreds of compositions and arrangements and recorded more than one hundred records.]]
Historically, the majority of well-known [[Women in jazz|women performers in jazz]] have been singers, such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. ''Culture Trip'' notes that women in jazz have been "too often confined to the role of chanteuse."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rasch|first1=Mirac|title=The Top 10 Female Jazz Musicians You Should Know|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-top-10-female-jazz-musicians-you-should-know/|access-date=3 April 2016|publisher=Culture Trip|date=13 November 2015}}</ref> However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders:
* [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (b. 1929): bandleader, pianist, arranger, composer
* [[Regina Carter]]: [[jazz violin]]
* [[Melba Liston]]: trombonist and arranger
* [[Vi Redd]] (b. 1928): alto saxophonist 
* [[Melissa Aldana]]: tenor saxophonist 
* [[Emily Remler]]: jazz guitar
* [[Mimi Fox]]: jazz guitar
*[[Sweet Emma Barrett]]
*[[Terri Lyne Carrington]] (drums)
*[[Carla Bley]] (piano)
*[[Mary Lou Williams]] (piano)
*[[Billie Pierce]] (piano)
*[[Jeanette Kimball]] (piano)
*[[Lovie Austin]] (piano and bandleader)
*[[Joelle Khoury]] (piano and composer)
*[[Shirley Horn]]
*[[Eva Cassidy]]
*[[Ruth Brown]]

There have also been [[all-female band|all-female jazz bands]] such as [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]] and all female orchestras such as the [[Hour of Charm Orchestra]]. Often, during [[World War II]], these all women's groups would entertain the troops while the male musicians served. However, after the war, these girls groups were thrown aside, as male musicians returned and the public favored the "normalcy" it brought, and the over sexualization of females in music returned.<ref name="auto5">Arnwine, B. (2018). The Beautiful Struggle: A Look at Women Who Have Helped Shape the DC Jazz Scene. In Jackson M. & Ruble B. (Eds.), DC Jazz: Stories of Jazz Music in Washington, DC (pp. 117–128). Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvvnh25.14</ref>

Some of these musicians helped shape jazz music and [[American culture]]. When June Norton was young, she wanted to pursue classical music, in hopes that one day she could join the opera. However, this did not seem possible, so she began to pursue [[popular music]]. Norton became the first black woman in the region of Washington DC to appear singing in TV commercials marketed towards southern states. This led to her accomplishments of many awards including the 1962 Achievement Award from the [[National Association of Colored Women]], the TV Personality of the Year award, the 1962 Emphasis Award from the National Association of Market Development, and the 1962 Singer of the Year Award from the [[YMCA]]. She later stepped away from the spotlight and began a career as a counselor and married Thomas C. Cuff. She spent the rest of her working years helping underprivileged youth and female prisoners.<ref name="auto5"/>

Another female pianist, composer, and vocalist made significant contribution to jazz and the American culture. [[Shirley Horn]] (1934–2005) recorded more than 25 albums and worked as a side musician for [[Stuff Smith]], [[Toots Thielemans]], [[Charlie Haden]], and [[Oscar Peterson]]. She practiced at the [[Howard University]] Junior School of Music, and later received offers from [[Juilliard]] University and [[Xavier University]], but opted to remain in Washington DC, marry, and have a child. She continued to tour and play gigs constantly. Her first recording was part of Stuff Smith's 1959 release, [[Cat on a Hot Fiddle]]. Her debut recording, [[Embers and Ashes]] attracted a large amount of attention and helped her to realize she wanted to be a concert pianist after all. A few months after this, [[Miles Davis]] contacted Horn and told [[Village Vanguard]] in New York City that he wanted Horn to open for him, and that he refused to play if this was not a possibility. This is when Horn's fame and reputation began to rise. She continued to work with [[Mercury Records]] and [[Verve Records]]. She received many awards including a [[Grammy Award]] in 1999 for Best Jazz vocal album for I Remember Miles, five Washington Area Music Awards, an honorary music degree from the [[Berklee College of Music]], and a 2004 NEA Jazz Master Fellowship and Award from the National Endowment for the Arts.<ref name="auto5"/>

===Classical music===
Instrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.

Many album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, "often using risqué images".<ref>Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294</ref> According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/> Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/>

====Orchestra====
[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]
Historically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a "women's instrument". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the "lighter instruments", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.<ref name="osborne-conant.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias in International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=n.d.|access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref> Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.<ref name="osborne-conant.org"/>

In the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that "ethnic and gender uniformity" gave their orchestra a better sound.<ref name="osborne-conant.org"/> Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has "gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity" in the orchestra.<ref name="osborne-conant.org"/> One male VPO member stated that men "carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women."<ref name="osborne-conant.org"/> One male VPO performer stated that "pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question. You find that in all men's groups."

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] in 2008,<ref name="The world's greatest orchestras">{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=Gramophone |date=n.d.|access-date=29 April 2013}}</ref> the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].<ref>[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007</ref>) As late as February 1996, first flautist [[Dieter Flury]] told [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".<ref name=WDR5>Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]</ref> In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] was a problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=25 February 1996 |access-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Sarah Chang before performing.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Classical violinist [[Sarah Chang]] before performing a 2005 solo concert]]

In 1997, the orchestra was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and International Association of Women in Music. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."<ref name=JP>Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1997</ref> As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-appoints-first-ever-female-concertmaster-opera-austria |title = Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|publisher = [[France 24]]|date = 8 May 2008}}</ref> In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and 36% in the [[New York Philharmonic]]. VPO president [[Clemens Hellsberg]] said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s. She said it chooses "the best we get," implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions.<ref name=Legends>James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998</ref> The [[Czech Philharmonic]] excludes women and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] "has a history of gender discrimination."<ref name="osborne-conant.org"/>

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists. Brass, percussion, and [[Double bass|string-bass]] orchestra sections are still predominantly male."<ref name="motherjones.com">{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |work=Mother Jones |date=n.d.|access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref>

====Soloists====
In classical music, soloists may perform unaccompanied solos on their instrument, as occurs with pianists who play works for solo piano or stringed instruments who play Baroque suites for one instrument (e.g., [[Bach suites for solo cello]]). In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014–2015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/> When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.
An internationally famed soloist is Argentina's [[Martha Argerich]] who is considered to be one of the greatest pianists of the recorded era.

===Popular music===
[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]

Singers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Three well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna]], [[Beyoncé]] and [[Britney Spears]]. Madonna is a key figure in popular music; critics have retrospectively credited her presence, success and contributions with paving the way for every female artist after her debut, and changing forever the music scene for women in the music history, as well as for today's pop stars.<ref name="Noisey">{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/69eyz6/madonna-bedtime-stories-20th-anniversary-sex-sexuality-feminism|title=Why Madonna's Unapologetic 'Bedtime Stories' Is Her Most Important Album|date=October 24, 2014|access-date=August 2, 2020|last=von Aue|first=Mary|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] Magazine}}</ref>

Singer-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how "women's labor and expertise—inside and outside of the music industry—go unnoticed." She has stated that "[I]t's invisible, what women do," and "[I]t's not rewarded as much."<ref name="newyorker.com"/> Bjork states "that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument."<ref name="newyorker.com"/> In 2015, "while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the "difficulties of being a female recording artist." She said it "is really hard sometimes for women in music. It's like a f[uck]ing boys club that we just can't get in to." She stated that she "tried for so long... to be taken seriously as a musician for my intelligence more than my body", yet she felt that others in the industry did not believe that women could have a "musical background... [or] understand what you're doing because you're a female."<ref name="people.com"/> A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.<ref name="auto1">Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M.

[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|180 px |[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite [[funk]]'s popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility"<ref>Cheryl Keyes, "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis" 35.</ref> (35). Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].

Below are some of the top-earning female singers in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. Another way of selecting the most notable singers for this section would be by [[Music criticism|critical acclaim]], but this is a more subjective criteria than earnings. Almost all of these singers are also songwriters, and some are also music producers:

*[[Adele]]
*[[Beyoncé]]
*[[Lady Gaga]]
*[[Madonna]]
*[[Katy Perry]]
*[[Rihanna]]
*[[Britney Spears]]

[[Classic female blues]] was an early form of [[blues music]] popular in the 1920s. An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.

[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]] (1886–1939), known as the "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and comedy around 1902.<ref>Stewart-Baxter, Derrick.

Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.<ref>Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159</ref> [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.

The most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the "Empress of the Blues". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]]."<ref>Harrison, Daphne Duval.

===Country music ===
Gender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: "Bro-Country", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular "Bro-Country" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time, going backwards compared to some categories like [[Rapping|rap]] and pop. Dr. Eric Rasmussen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, "talking more about women's appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters."

"Bro-Country" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues, and often find no way to directly deal with them. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important. Women like [[Kacey Musgraves]], no matter what they do or change, will almost always fall under some form of scrutiny from her male competitors.

A large number of women singers in the country music genre have been influential to the industry through their success. Despite the popularity of male country artists and the discrimination that is displayed throughout their music, many female artists have worked their way past, leading them to achieve multiple accomplishments.

Dolly Parton, a female country singer that has been in the industry for over 55 years, developed a successful career for herself. Parton consistently created new projects to release to her fans and was described as "unstoppable" by a pop culture magazine titled ''Rolling Stone''. These projects include over 45 musical albums, multiple film features, a Dollywood theme park, and the creation of a production company.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://login.library.collin.edu/login|title=Collin College Library|website=login.library.collin.edu|access-date=22 March 2019}}</ref>

Carrie Underwood, the iconic ''American Idol'' winner, also created a lasting impact in the country music genre. With over 251,000 units sold, Underwood's album ''Cry Pretty'' was her fourth album to reach number one on the ''Billboard 200'' list.<ref name=":3"/> ''Blown Away, Play On'' and ''Carnival Ride'' were the other three albums that also reached the top of the charts. These achievements led her to become the first women singer to have four country albums as number one in the all-genre ''Billboard 200''.<ref name=":3"/> Underwood had multiple other number ones throughout her career, surpassing many other popular artists, as she left a strong impact on the female country music industry.

A women's rights activist and animal lover, Miranda Lambert, is another woman known to have a dominating career within the music industry. Her songs titled "Over You" and "Heart Like Mine" took over the ''Billboard'' charts and country music radio stations in 2010 and 2011.<ref name=":3"/> As a solo female artist, she writes her music through honesty and reality.<ref name=":3"/> The messages sent through her music are intended to help other women not to feel alone as they go through difficult life situations. Lambert uses the fame she has earned from the music industry and works with charities like the Humane Society as a way to give back.<ref name=":3"/>

===Jazz===
[[File:Ella Fitzgerald in September 1947.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ella Fitzgerald]] performing with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Milt Jackson]] and [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] in September 1947, New York]]
While woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the [[Cool jazz]] era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]]. [[Esperanza Spalding]] has been trying to speak out louder and push towards more conversation about the current discrimination in jazz. In 2017, [[Esperanza Spalding]] spent 77 hours straight creating an entire album titled Exposure to help change herself. It quickly became "a display of dauntless prowess and grand ambition<sup>[1]</sup>" and showed, to thousands of people<sup>[1]</sup>, a woman working confidently within the male dominated space of a recording studio.

===Classical music===

[[File:Kathleen battle.PNG|thumb|right|180px|[[Kathleen Battle]]]]
Classical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the "color" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the "color" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.

Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.

==== Sexism and discrimination of female musicians ====
Whether it is hip-hop, country, or [[popular music]], female musicians and performers from all genres experience discrimination and sexist treatment.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Sarah|year=2014|title=Sexism Across Musical Genres: A Comparison|journal=Paper 2484|volume=Honors Theses}}</ref> The treatment of women in the music industry is best highlighted by the phrase denoted by Megan Jordan, heavily agreed upon in current scholarly discourse: 10X THE TALENT = 1/3 OF THE CREDIT.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Meggan|year=2006|title=10x The Talent = 1/3 Of The Credit: How Female Musicians Are Treated Differently In Music|journal=Stars-University of Central Florida|volume=Electronic Theses and Dissertations. 946.}}</ref> The three prominent forms of subtle discrimination experienced by female singers are being mistaken for non-musicians, lack of artistic control compared to their male counterparts, and having their [[sexuality]], age, and [[femininity]] constantly scrutinized.<ref name=":5" /> In many cases, female musicians are dismissed into inferior roles, such as a "gimmick," "good for a girl," and "invisible accessory."<ref name=":5" /> Males lead most of the music projects and female musicians' artistic freedom is constrained by male bandleaders or managers.<ref name=":5" /> Another prevalent form of discrimination towards female vocalists and musicians in the music industry is [[sexual misconduct]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Coopersmith|first=Tristan.

Another form of [[sexism]] in the music industry emanates from the lyrics prevalent in the music .<ref name=":4" /> There are five major themes in lyrics from all genres that facilitate female discrimination, noted here by Dr. Sarah Neff: "portrayal of women in traditional gender roles, portrayal of women as inferior to men, portrayal of women as objects, portrayal of women as [[stereotype]]s, and portrayal of violence against women."<ref name=":4" /> Utilizing a series of sexist markers, studies have found that countless lyrics entails sexist themes, including "depicting women in traditional [[gender role]]s, describing relationships with women in unrealistic ways, and attributing a woman's worth strictly on the basis of her physical appearance."<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/research/news_and_pubs/caravel/archive/2013/2013-caravel-sexism-in-unexpected-places.php|title=Sexism in Unexpected Places: An Analysis of Country Music Lyrics – Office of the Vice President for Research {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=sc.edu|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref> Sexism in music is well-documented for genres such as rap and [[Hip hop|hip-hop]], but with newer research, this holds true for country music, rock, and other genres as well.<ref name=":7" />

Women play an important role in [[world music]], a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world, including [[ethnic music]] and [[traditional music]] from Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and other regions, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle (e.g., mixtures of Western pop and ethnic music). The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.<ref>{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|book-title=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}</ref>

Brazilian actress, singer and dancer [[Carmen Miranda]] became known in the West as [[Exotism|exotic]] supplement in Hollywood films in the 1930s, akin to dancer [[Josephine Baker]] before, and the voice of [[exotica]] [[Yma Sumac]] after her. In the 1960s [[Elis Regina]] was the most prominent female singer in the [[Bossa Nova]] of Brazilian music that influenced popular music around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states. Sosa singing "[[Gracias a la vida]]", Makeba's "[[Pata Pata]]", and Farantouri's collaboration with composer [[Mikis Theodorakis]] were musical icons of the struggle for human rights. The "Queen of Salsa" [[Celia Cruz]] immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1966.

With the rising interest in the then so-called world music in the 1980s old recordings of long established artists were re-discovered for a global audience and distributed worldwide; well known in their home country –sometimes stars with legendary status– like Arabic singers [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Asmahan]], and [[Fairuz]], the Algerian [[Raï]] singer [[Cheikha Rimitti]], [[Asha Bhosle]], most prolific playback singer for [[Bollywood]] film soundtracks, Romani [[Esma Redžepova]], Mexican [[ranchera]] singer [[Chavela Vargas]], and the [[Mahotella Queens]] from South Africa; or they were recorded for the first time (by Caucasian males) like [[Cesária Évora]] from Cape Verde, [[Stella Chiweshe]] from Zimbabwe and Afro-Peruvian [[Susana Baca]].

There are many notable women world music performers, including: [[Ann Savoy]], [[Bi Kidude]], [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Chava Alberstein]], [[Cleoma Breaux Falcon]], [[Dolly Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Frehel]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Genoa Keawe]], [[Googoosh]], [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Lola Beltrán]], [[Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[Lucilla Galeazzi]] (The Mammas), [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Maria Tanase]], [[Mariam Doumbia]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Rosa Passos]], [[Roza Eskenazi]], [[Safiye Ayla]], [[Salamat Sadikova]], [[Selda Bagcan]], [[Shirley Collins]], [[Valya Balkanska]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia|Warda]], and [[Zap Mama]].

==Eastern music==

===Arabic music===
[[File:ComedianpartyBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A group of musicians, including women performers, from a Baghdad musical theatre group in the 1920s]]
[[Arabic music]], which has [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] origins,<ref>''The Golden Age of the Moor''. By [[Ivan van Sertima]]. 1992. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56000-581-5}}. p.17</ref>
is an amalgam of the music of the [[Arab people]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the varied peoples that make up the Arab world. In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means "a player upon an instrument". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a "learned female". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.

In the 9th century, using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and "learned female" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.

===Chinese music===

In [[Chinese music]], music was a major activity for women during Ancient times, especially for learned women. Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.<ref>《胡笳十八拍》</ref>

Women musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.

The [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.

Nowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several girl groups have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show. These groups have achieved significant success, with the debut [[Extended play|EP]] of Rocket Girls selling over 1.6&nbsp;million copies.<ref name="Tencent">{{cite web|url=https://y.qq.com/n/yqq/album/001zLxbr23aBw9.html|title=撞|work=[[QQ Music]]|publisher=[[Tencent]]|language=zh|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref> Despite this though, solo Chinese female artists continue to be much more popular overall in the country, as they have traditionally been.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&page=1&sex=-100&|title= 歌手列表|access-date= 26 August 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= zh}}</ref> Some of the most recently popular solo Chinese female singers include 胡66, [[Ada Zhuang]], [[Kelly Yu]], 陳粒 ([[:zh:陳粒|zh]]), [[Feng Timo]], [[Bibi Zhou]], 双笙, [[Tia Ray]], 金玟岐 ([[:zh:金玟岐|zh]]) and [[Jane Zhang]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&page=1&sex=1&|title= 歌手列表|access-date= 26 August 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= zh}}</ref>

===Indian music===

[[Indian classical music]] is the [[art music]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the [[Hindu]] hymns. This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]]. One woman instrumentalist is [[Annapurna Devi]].

In [[Indian folk music]], [[lavani]] is a music genre popular in [[Maharashtra]] that is traditionally performed by women.
[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਭੰਗੜਾ) is a form of dance-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The present musical style is derived from non-traditional musical accompaniment to the riffs of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] called by the same name. The female dance of [[Punjab region]] is known as [[Giddha]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਗਿੱਧਾ).

In the [[music of Bollywood]] (the centre of India's film industry) and other regional film industries in India, women playback singers have had a significant role, with the sisters [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]], who have mainly worked in Hindi films, often referred to as two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India.

[[File:Parisa.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fātemeh Vā'ezi ({{lang-fa|فاطمه واعظی}}) (born 1950), commonly known by her stage name Parīsā ({{lang-fa| پریسا}}), is a [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical]] vocalist and musician.]]

Since the [[Iranian revolution]], Iranian female solo vocalists have been permitted to perform for female audiences. Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905–1959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923–2004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].

The classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name "Parisa") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.<ref>Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans. Maryam Habibian, Zanan, No. 36 (1997), p. 23.</ref> Iranian folk-music performers include [[Sima Bina]], [[Darya Dadvar]], [[Monika Jalili]], [[Ziba Shirazi]], [[Zohreh Jooya]], and [[Shusha Guppy|Shushā Guppy]]. Iranian pop performers include [[Googoosh]], [[Hayedeh]], [[Mahasti]], [[Leila Forouhar]], [[Pooran (singer)|Pooran]], and [[Laleh Pourkarim]].

There is literary evidence from biblical books such as ''[[The Book of Judges]]'' that women (including [[Miriam]], [[Deborah]] and [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]]), participated in musical traditions that included singing [[lamentation]]s and playing instruments. However, women are not mentioned in references to [[liturgy]]. Women were eventually banned from liturgical worship (''[[Tzniut#Female singing voice|kolisha]]'').

==Music scholars and educators==

===Musicologists and music historians===
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian and [[feminist]] who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.<ref name=NYTObit>Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Retrieved 19 November 2008.</ref>]]

The vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".<ref name=HG>[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Retrieved 10 December 2014</ref>

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

===Ethnomusicologists===
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&nbsp;– 1957) was an American [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of Native American music and culture.]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-Western music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Women have also made significant contributions in Ethnomusicology, especially in the intersection of gender studies and Ethnomusicology.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last=Koskoff|first=Ellen|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987}}</ref> Ellen Koskoff, Professor Emerita at the Eastman School of Music, has done extensive work on gender in Ethnomusicology.<ref name="Koskoff, Ellen 2019, pp. 1">Koskoff, Ellen. “My Music.” Ethnomusicology, vol. 63, no. 1, 2019, pp. 1–18.

Accessed 1 Dec. 2020.</ref> Koskoff has also served as President of the Society for Ethnomusicology and hosted a radio show called "What in the World is Music?"<ref name="Koskoff, Ellen 2019, pp. 1"/>

In, “An Introduction to Women, Music, and Culture” (1987), Koskoff argues that music performed by women is “devalued” and in some cases, is even considered, “non-music,” despite having “musical form”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last=Koskoff|first=Ellen|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987}}|page=15}}</ref> Koskoff explains that the distinction that men occupy public spheres and women occupy private, domestic ones has, “creat[ed] not necessarily two separate and self-contained music cultures, but rather two differentiated yet complementary halves of culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last=Koskoff|first=Ellen|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987}}|page=1}}</ref> She reasons that because “In most societies, a woman’s identity is believed to be embedded in her sexuality,” “one of the most common associations between women and music... links women’s primary sexual identity and role with music performance”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last=Koskoff|first=Ellen|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987}}|page=6}}</ref> Based on this association, Koskoff argues that “Four categories of music performance thus emerge in connection with inter-gender relations: (1) performance that confirms and maintains the established social/sexual arrangement; (2) performance that ''appears'' to maintain the established norms in order to protect other, more relevant values; (3) performance that protests, yet maintains, the order (often through symbolic behavior); and (4) performance that challenges and threatens established order”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective|last=Koskoff|first=Ellen|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1987}}|page=10}}</ref>

{{Main|Women in music education}}
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."<ref name="parlorsongs.com"/> "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations."<ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015">Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators in the United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)</ref> When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."<ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/>

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in normal schools and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female presidents of this organization.<ref name="slideshare.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=5 July 2012 |access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref> Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .<ref name="slideshare.net"/> More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.<ref name="slideshare.net"/> According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."<ref name="slideshare.net"/>

While there is a lack of women in professional orchestra, more recent studies show that the conducting profession itself lacks gender and racial diversity. There is a clear distinction between the low number of white women in the field compared to that of white men, but there is an even lower number of other racial and ethnic identities. The proportion of non-white musicians represented in the orchestra workforce – and of African American and Hispanic / Latino musicians in particular –remains extremely low.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite book|title=American Symphony Orchestra League|volume = 1|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Music Online|doi = 10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.00790}}</ref> The field of orchestra continues to remain predominantly white. Positions such as conductors, executives, and staff are dominated by white individuals, in particular, white males. In high level executive positions, it remains rare to see women or people of color. However, the gender gap narrowed in the early 1990s, with women musicians making up between 46% and 49% of the total musician pool in the two decades since.<ref name="auto6"/> The years 1980 to 2014 saw a four-fold increase in the proportion of diverse musicians on stage, driven largely by an increase in musicians from Asian / Pacific Islander backgrounds.<ref name="auto6"/> Over the years, more attention was brought to gender and racial disparity in the field. This awareness has caused positive impacts in the orchestrating field. Data about conductors from 2006 to 2016 reveals there is a gradual but steady trend towards greater racial and ethnic diversity, with the percentage of African American, Latino / Hispanic, Asian /Pacific Islander, American Indian / Alaskan Native, and other non-white conductorsincreasing from 15.7% in 2006 to 21% in 2016.<ref name="auto6"/> Although there has been reconstruction of the whiteness and gender domination of males in the field, there is still work to be done.

Many women within the orchestrating profession experience forms of discrimination whether it be gender, racial, or both. Women, initially, were not encouraged to play professionally because it was deemed inappropriate by society. Women were further considered neither strong enough nor skilled enough to play instruments other than the piano, or to survive grueling rehearsal schedules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jagow|first=Shelley M.|year=1998|title=Women Orchestral Conductors in America: The Struggle for Acceptance—An Historical View from the Nineteenth Century to the Present|journal=College Music Symposium|volume=38|pages=126–145|issn=0069-5696|jstor=40374324}}</ref> [[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first African-American woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005. She is the founder and music director of the Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, the first multi-ethnic professional orchestra in [[Philadelphia]]. A graduate of [[Wellesley College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], she is a conductor, composer and pianist. From 2001 to 2004, she was the assistant conductor of The [[Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoDAAAAMBAJ&q=%22jeri+lynne+johnson%22&pg=PA54|title=Sisters in the Spotlight|date=March 2003|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|access-date=18 May 2010|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}</ref> She has led orchestras around the world including the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra|Colorado Symphony]], [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Symphony]] (UK), and the Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany). Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."<ref name="theguardian.com" /> The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in music school; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.<ref name="motherjones.com" />

The turn for women's rights in music began the feminist movement in America in 1848. The movement fueled  all women to fight for equal rights in a plethora of fields such as voting, education, employment, and marriage. While the women's rights movement meant the start of including women into the orchestrating field, there would still be barriers that these women needed to overcome. Women of color, in particular, were faced with many stereotypes that challenged the worthiness of their work. In fact, black women's work in the field faced more scrutiny than their white counterparts. A classic example of this is seen in a study conducted for the Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, by Elliot Charles, in 1996. Elliot Examined:

Whether race and gender influenced judgments of musical performances. Four trumpeters and four flutists were videotaped performing the same music excerpt. For each instrument, one white male, one white female, one black male, and one black female, served as models. To control the audio portion of the study, the researcher used two prerecorded performances, one for the trumpets and one for the flutes. This created the same audio for all trumpets and flute performances. College music majors rated each performance on a Likert-type scale. Results revealed black performers of each genders and instruments were rated significantly lower than white performers. The lowest ratings were given to black male and female trumpet players.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=VanWeelden|first=Kimberly|year=2004|title=Racially Stereotyped Music and Conductor Race: Perceptions of Performance|journal=Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education|issue=160|pages=38–48|issn=0010-9894|jstor=40319217}}</ref>

This example demonstrates that gender discrimination was prevalent during this time, but racial discrimination must be accounted for as well.

===Sexism, Racism, and Gender Discrimination===
Women conductors faced sexism, racism, and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. "To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B. Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&Itemid=124|title=Women Orchestral Conductors in America: The Struggle for Acceptance—An Historical View from the Nineteenth Century to the Present – College Music Symposium|date=21 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921190155/http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&Itemid=124|archive-date=21 September 2015}}</ref> A number of other all-women orchestras were founded in the early decades of the 20th century, and women conductors led these groups. It is both interesting and ironic that something that is considered "universal"  has historically excluded women (with the exception of certain stereotypically defined roles) and more specifically women on color.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronnie Wooten|year=2017|title=Women of Color in the Conducting Profession: Where Are They?|journal=Black History Bulletin|volume=80|issue=1|pages=15–24|doi=10.5323/blachistbull.80.1.0015|jstor=10.5323/blachistbull.80.1.0015}}</ref> This comments on the fact that the underrepresentation of women in conducting is seen as a sexism issue, but also an issue of racism as well.

Women conductors continue to face sexism and gender discrimination in the early decades of the 21st century. In the 2010s, several notable male conductors and musicians made sexist statements about women conductors. In 2013, "[[Vasily Petrenko]], the principal conductor of the [[Oslo Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]], provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them."<ref name="theguardian1">{{cite web|author1=Charlotte Higgins |author2=chief arts writer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/male-conductors-better-orchestras-vasily-petrenko |title=Male conductors are better for orchestras, says Vasily Petrenko |work=The Guardian |date=n.d.|access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref> He also stated that "when women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business".<ref name="theguardian1"/> [[Bruno Mantovani]], the director of the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gave an interview in which he made sexist statements about women conductors.

The essence of a woman is weakness."<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/> Finnish conductor [[Jorma Panula]] made sexist statements about women conductors in 2014; he stated that "women [conductors are not]... getting any better – only worse", which he called a "purely biological question."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/ |title=Musical Toronto |publisher=Musical Toronto |date=n.d.|access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref>

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant". Crawford notes that the "most famous rock-music critics—[[Robert Christgau]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]]—are all male".<ref name="newyorker.com"/>

"The National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia... completed a large study of arts journalism in America [in 2005]. They found that 'the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female.'" However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times'').

==Other musical professions==

===Record producing and sound engineering===
A 2013 ''Sound on Sound'' article stated that there are "few women in record production and [[sound engineering]]."<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> "Only three women have ever been nominated for best producer at the Brits or the [[Grammys]]" and none won either award.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19284058 |title=Why are female record producers so rare? – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=29 August 2012 |access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref> "Women who want to enter the [producing] field face a boys' club, or a [[guild]] mentality".<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Despite this, women haven been taking on the challenge since the 1940s. [[Mary Shipman Howard]] was an engineer in New York City in the 1940s. [[Lillian McMurry]] was a record producer and founder of Trumpet Records in the 1950s. One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923–2004). She founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 and began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. [[Ethel Gabriel]] had a 40-year career with RCA and was the first major label record producer.

===DJs and turntablists ===

[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event]]
Women in music are often seen mainly in singing roles in [[popular music]] and there are relatively few women DJs or [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]], [[house music]], [[nu metal]] and other genres where DJs and turntablists participate. Indeed, all of these genres are very male-dominated. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs, such as audio engineering and production.  In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women battle; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."<ref name="Katz">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=89|issue=4|pages=580–599|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007}}</ref> In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces."<ref name="Farrugia">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia |first=Rebekah |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664}}</ref> While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male technophilia."<ref name="Katz" /> Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field ... is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oldenziel|first=Ruth A. |year=1997 |title=Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=60–96 |doi=10.2307/3106784 |jstor=3106784 |url=https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/boys-and-their-toys--the-fisher-body-craftsmans-guild-19301968-and-the-making-of-a-male-technical-domain(2200e441-1a9d-4813-b544-fbe86c0ad1a3).html }}</ref>

===Riot Grrrl===
[[File:Carrie Brownstein.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Carrie Brownstein]] from the punk-indie band [[Sleater-Kinney]], performing at Vegoose in 2005]]
[[Riot grrrl]] is an [[underground music|underground]] [[feminist]] [[hardcore punk]] movement that originally started in the early 1990s, in Washington, D.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1080646/its-riot-grrrl-day-in-boston-here-are-songs-to-rock-out-to-at-work|title=Boston wins 'Most Feminist City' with Riot Grrrl Day – we made a playlist to celebrate|date=9 April 2015|website=Sheknows.com|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]], noticeably in [[Olympia, Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement |url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library}}</ref> It is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]], which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.<ref>{{cite Grove |last=Leonard |first=Marion |date=31 January 2014 |title=Riot grrrl |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.A2257186}}</ref>

Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, [[domestic abuse]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], racism, [[patriarchy]], and female [[empowerment]]. Bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Cake Like]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and also [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13 |archive-date=23 February 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |access-date=30 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&q=Dickless%20riot&pg=PA42|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|page=42 |title=Girl Power: The 1990s Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=15 February 2010}}</ref> In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and genre, riot grrrl is a [[subculture]] involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

The use of the word "girl" was meant to indicate a time when girls are least influenced by societal pressures and therefore have the strongest self-esteem – childhood. The anger behind the movement was noted by the alternate spelling of the word as "grrrl", which sounds like a growl.<ref name="Schilt" />

They partook in a new type of punk feminism that promoted the idea of do-it-yourself, exchanging [[manifesto]]s and trading mixed tapes of favorite bands to get the word out.<ref name="Nguyen 173–196">{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=1 July 2012|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival|journal=Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|volume=22|issue=2–3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|s2cid=144676874|issn=0740-770X}}</ref> They were tired of women being erased from history or having their experiences misinterpreted and ignored by others. In, response to patriarchal violence, adultism, and [[heterocentrism]],<ref name="Kearney">{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=1995|title=Riot Grrrl: It's Not Just Music, It's Not Just Punk|journal=The Spectator|volume=16}}</ref> Riot grrrl engaged in negative emotional expressions and rhetoric similar to that of feminism and the punk aesthetic. The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love – "girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves".

The accompanying slogan "every girl is a riot grrrl" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of "fanzines").<ref name="Schilt" /> [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.<ref name="Kearney" /> The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to "it's all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they'll send them to each other", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.

In the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing "SLUT" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.<ref name="Nguyen 173–196"/> While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, "the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access."<ref name="Kearney" /> Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.

===Festivals===
Women's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for lesbians. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&d=DIL19740326.2.55&srpos=6&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 – Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> It celebrated its 40th year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2–5 July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival – July 5–8, 2018 Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that "promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities. While most attendees are women, men can attend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org/wia/membership-and-donation/|title=Membership and Contributions – National Womens Music Festival|website=Wiaonline.org|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States.<ref>Morris 1999:28</ref>

An example of a festival that focuses on music is the Women in Music Festival held by the [[University of Rochester]]'s [[Eastman School of Music]]. The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|access-date=7 April 2018}}</ref> From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania León]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.

Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.

While women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of lesbian and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.<ref>Morris 1999</ref>

====Lilith Fair====
[[File:Sarah McLachlan 29 July 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Lilith Fair]] co-founder [[Sarah McLachlan]]]]
[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. It was founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |publisher=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref>
McLachlan organized the festival after she became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.<ref name="cnn072898">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | first=Donna | last=Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=28 July 1998 | access-date=4 July 2008}}</ref> Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan's home town, on 14 September 1996 – went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife. In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16&nbsp;million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.<ref name="cnn072898"/> Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.<ref name="cnn072898"/>
The festival received several pejorative nicknames, including "Breast-fest", "Girlapalooza", and "Clam Jam".<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071698/fea_lilith.shtml]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_popular,5.html |title=ARTS : Music: Popular |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=n.d.|access-date=29 May 2014}}</ref>
