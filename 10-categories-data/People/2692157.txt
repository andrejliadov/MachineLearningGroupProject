'''Kaldi''' or '''Khalid''' was a legendary Ethiopian [[goatherd]] who discovered the [[coffee]] plant around 850 AD, according to popular legend, after which it entered the Islamic world then the rest of the world.

==Story==
Kaldi, noticing that when his goats were nibbling on the bright red berries of a certain bush, they became more energetic (jumping goats), chewed on the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to an [[Dervish|Islamic monk]] in a nearby Sufi [[Khanqah|monastery (zawiyah)]], but the Sufi monk disapproved of their use and threw them into a fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed. The roasted beans were quickly raked from the embers, ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee.<ref>A similar version after Nairon, without the name of "Kaldi" and sited in Yemen, is recounted in Miguelonne Toussaint-Samat, Anthea Bell, tr. ''A History of Food'' 2nd. ed. 2008, "Coffee in Legend" pp 532-34.</ref>

===Analysis===
The story is probably apocryphal, as it was first related by Antoine Faustus Nairon, a [[Maronites|Maronite]] who became a Roman professor of Oriental languages and author of one of the first printed treatises devoted to coffee, ''De Saluberrima potione Cahue seu Cafe nuncupata Discurscus'' (Rome, 1671).<ref>Noted by H. F. Nicolai, ''Der Kaffee und seine Ersatzmittel: Volkshygienische Studie'', (Brunswick, 1901) ch. 1 "Geschichtliches über den Kaffee" p. 4 note 1.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_XqtX_0BdDbwC|title=De saluberrima potione cahue, seu cafe nuncupata discursus Fausti Naironi Banesii Maronitae, linguae Chaldaicae, seu Syriacae in almo vrbis archigymnasio lectoris ad eminentiss. ...
