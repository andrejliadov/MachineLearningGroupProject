The '''Little Rock Nine''' was a group of nine African American students enrolled in [[Little Rock Central High School]] in 1957. Their enrollment was followed by the '''Little Rock Crisis''', in which the students were initially prevented from entering the [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] school by [[Orval Faubus]], the [[Governor of Arkansas]]. They then attended after the intervention of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] issued its historic ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]], 347 U.S. 483, on May 17, 1954. Tied to the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the decision declared all laws establishing segregated schools to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], and it called for the [[desegregation]] of all schools throughout the nation.<ref name="BrownVBoardOfEducation">{{cite court|authorlink=Earl Warren|last=Warren|first=Earl, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court|publisher=Cornell|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZO.html|litigants=Brown v. Topeka Board of Education|date=1954|court=U.S.}}.</ref> After the decision, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) attempted to register black students in previously all-white schools in cities throughout the [[Southern United States|South]]. In [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], the [[Little Rock School District|school board]] agreed to comply with the high court's ruling. [[Virgil Blossom]], the Superintendent of Schools, submitted a plan of gradual integration to the school board on May 24, 1955, which the board unanimously approved. The plan would be implemented during the fall of the 1957 school year, which would begin in September 1957.

By 1957, the NAACP had registered nine black students to attend the previously all-white Little Rock Central High, selected on the criteria of excellent grades and attendance.<ref name="LittleRockCentralHigh">{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Rains|url=http://www.centralhigh57.org/1957-58.htm|title=Little Rock Central High 40th Anniversary|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217140900/http://www.centralhigh57.org/1957-58.htm|archive-date=December 17, 2006|df=mdy-all}}.</ref> Called the "Little Rock Nine", they were [[Ernest Green]] (b. 1941), [[Elizabeth Eckford]] (b. 1941), [[Jefferson Thomas]] (1942–2010), [[Terrence Roberts]] (b. 1941), [[Carlotta Walls LaNier]] (b. 1942), [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]] (b. 1941), [[Gloria Ray Karlmark]] (b. 1942), [[Thelma Mothershed-Wair|Thelma Mothershed]] (b. 1940), and [[Melba Pattillo Beals]] (b. 1941). Ernest Green was the first African American to graduate from Central High School.

When integration began in September 4, 1957, the [[Arkansas National Guard]] was [[Arkansas National Guard and the integration of Central High School|called in to "preserve the peace"]].  Originally at orders of the governor, they were meant to prevent the black students from entering due to claims that there was "imminent danger of tumult, riot and breach of peace" at the integration.  However, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] issued Executive order [[s:Executive Order 10730|10730]], which federalized the [[Arkansas National Guard]] and ordered  them to support the integration on September 23 of that year, after which they protected the African American students.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Documents - Executive Order 10730: Desegregation of Central High School (1957) |url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=89 |website=www.ourdocuments.gov}}</ref>

==The Blossom Plan==
One of the plans created during attempts to desegregate the schools of Little Rock was by school superintendent [[Virgil Blossom]]. The initial approach proposed substantial integration beginning quickly and extending to all grades within a matter of many years.<ref>Tony A. Freyer, "Politics and Law in the Little Rock Crisis, 1954–1957," ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 60/2, (Summer 2007): 148</ref> This original proposal was scrapped and replaced with one that more closely met a set of minimum standards worked out in attorney Richard B. McCulloch's brief.<ref name="Freyer 149">Tony A. Freyer, "Politics and Law in the Little Rock Crisis, 1954–1957," The Arkansas Historical Quarterly, 60/2, (Summer 2007): 149</ref> This finalized plan would start in September 1957 and would integrate one high school: Little Rock Central. The second phase of the plan would take place in 1960 and would open up a few junior high schools to a few black children. The final stage would involve limited desegregation of the city's grade schools at an unspecified time, possibly as late as 1963.<ref name="Freyer 149" />

This plan was met with varied reactions from the [[NAACP]] branch of Little Rock. Militant members like the [[Daisy Bates (activist)|Bateses]] opposed the plan on the grounds that it was "vague, indefinite, slow-moving and indicative of an intent to stall further on public integration."<ref name="Kirk">John A. Kirk, "The Little Rock Crisis and Postwar Black Activism in Arkansas," ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 60/2, (Summer 2007): 239</ref> Despite this view, the majority accepted the plan; most felt that Blossom and the school board should have the chance to prove themselves, that the plan was reasonable, and that the white community would accept it.

This view was short lived, however. Changes were made to the plan, the most detrimental being a new transfer system that would allow students to move out of the attendance zone to which they were assigned.<ref name="Kirk" /> The altered Blossom Plan had [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] school districts to guarantee a black majority at Horace Mann High and a white majority at Hall High.<ref name="Kirk" /> This meant that, even though black students lived closer to Central, they would be placed in Horace Mann thus confirming the intention of the school board to limit the impact of desegregation.<ref name="Kirk" /> The altered plan gave white students the choice of not attending Horace Mann, but did not give black students the option of attending Hall. This new Blossom Plan did not sit well with the NAACP and after failed negotiations with the school board, the NAACP filed a lawsuit on February 8, 1956.

This lawsuit, along with a number of other factors contributed to the Little Rock School Crisis of 1957.

==National Guard blockade==
{{Main|Arkansas National Guard and the integration of Central High School}}
Several segregationist councils threatened to hold protests at Central High and physically block the black students from entering the school. Governor [[Orval Faubus]] deployed the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to support the segregationists on September 4, 1957. The sight of a line of soldiers blocking out the students made national headlines and polarized the nation. Regarding the accompanying crowd, one of the nine students, [[Elizabeth Eckford]], recalled:

{{quote|They moved closer and closer. ... Somebody started yelling. ... I tried to see a friendly face somewhere in the crowd—someone who maybe could help. I looked into the face of an old woman and it seemed a kind face, but when I looked at her again, she spat on me.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/27019977/little-rock-nine-paved-way|title=Little Rock Nine paved the way|access-date=March 4, 2009|last=Boyd|first=Herb|date=September 27, 2007|volume=98|issue=40|newspaper=[[New York Amsterdam News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132249/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/27019977/little-rock-nine-paved-way|archive-date=April 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}

On September 9, the Little Rock School District issued a statement condemning the governor's deployment of soldiers to the school, and called for a citywide prayer service on September 12. Even President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] attempted to de-escalate the situation by summoning Faubus for a meeting, warning him not to defy the Supreme Court's ruling.<ref name="Newport">{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893684,00.html|title=Retreat from Newport|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 23, 1957|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811215326/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893684,00.html|archive-date=August 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}.</ref>

==Armed escort==
[[Woodrow Wilson Mann]], the mayor of Little Rock, asked President Eisenhower to send federal troops to enforce integration and protect the nine students. On September 24, the President ordered the [[101st Airborne Division]] of the [[United States Army]]—without its black soldiers, who rejoined the division a month later—to Little Rock and [[United States National Guard#Constitutional basis|federalized]] the entire 10,000-member Arkansas National Guard, taking it out of Faubus's control.<ref name="smith2012">{{cite book | title=Eisenhower in War and Peace | publisher=Random House | author=Smith, Jean Edward | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-679-64429-3 | pages=723}}</ref>

==A tense year==
By the end of September 1957, the nine were admitted to Little Rock Central High under the protection of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (and later the [[Arkansas National Guard]]), but they were still subjected to a year of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[verbal abuse]] by many of the white students. [[Melba Pattillo Beals|Melba Pattillo]] had acid thrown into her eyes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/iml04/soc/ush/civil/beals/index.html|title=Melba Pattillo Beals|access-date=February 2, 2008|work=Teachers' Domain|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421200149/http://www.teachersdomain.org/resources/iml04/soc/ush/civil/beals/index.html|archive-date=April 21, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and also recalled in her book, ''Warriors Don't Cry'', an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], was verbally confronted and abused. She said

<blockquote>I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Minnijean|author-link=Minnijean Brown-Trickey|last2=Moskin|first2=J. Robert|title=One Girl's Little Rock Story|magazine=[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]|date=June 24, 1958}}</ref></blockquote>

Minnijean Brown was also taunted by members of a group of white male students in December 1957 in the school cafeteria during lunch. She dropped her lunch, a bowl of chili, onto the boys and was suspended for six days. Two months later, after more confrontation, Brown was suspended for the rest of the school year. She transferred to the [[New Lincoln School]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="LittleRockCentralHigh"/> As depicted in the 1981 made-for-TV docudrama ''[[Crisis at Central High]]'', and as mentioned by Melba Pattillo Beals in ''Warriors Don't Cry'', white students were punished only when their offense was "both egregious and witnessed by an adult".<ref name=CaCH>{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Janelle |title=Easing a Country's Conscience: Little Rock's Central High School in Film |journal=Southern Quarterly |publisher=[[University of Southern Mississippi]] |date=2008 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=78–90 |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1598172951/easing-a-country-s-conscience-little-rock-s-central |id={{ProQuest|222252522}} |access-date=June 10, 2020}}</ref> The drama was based on a book by [[Elizabeth Huckaby]], a vice-principal during the crisis.

=="The Lost Year"==
[[File:Little-Rock-TIME-1957.jpg|thumb|Young U.S. Army paratrooper in battle gear outside Central High School, on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (October 7, 1957)]]
In the summer of 1958, as the school year was drawing to a close, Faubus decided to petition the decision by the Federal District Court in order to postpone the desegregation of public high schools in Little Rock.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962, p. 151.</ref> In the ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'' case, the Little Rock School District, under the leadership of [[Orval Faubus]], fought for a two and a half year delay on de-segregation, which would have meant that black students would only be permitted into public high schools in January 1961.<ref>Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 428.</ref> Faubus argued that if the schools remained integrated there would be an increase in violence. However, in August 1958, the Federal Courts ruled against the delay of de-segregation, which incited Faubus to call together an Extraordinary Session of the State Legislature on August 26 in order to enact his segregation bills.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962, p. 152.</ref>

Claiming that Little Rock had to assert their rights and freedom against the federal decision, in September 1958, Faubus signed acts that enabled him and the Little Rock School District to close all public schools.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962, p. 154.</ref> Thus, with this bill signed, on Monday September 15, Faubus ordered the closure of all four public high schools, preventing both black and white students from attending school.<ref name="GordySondra">Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 429.</ref> Despite Faubus's decree, the city's population had the chance of refuting the bill since the school-closing law necessitated a [[referendum]]. The referendum, which would either condone or condemn Faubus's law, was to take place within thirty days.<ref name="GordySondra" /> A week before the referendum, which was scheduled to take place on September 27, Faubus addressed the citizens of Little Rock in an attempt to secure their votes. Faubus urged the population to vote against integration since he was planning on leasing the public school buildings to private schools, and, in doing so, would educate the white and black students separately.<ref>Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 431.</ref> Faubus was successful in his appeal and won the referendum. This year came to be known as the "Lost Year."

Faubus's victory led to a series of consequences that affected Little Rock society. Faubus's intention to open private schools was denied{{clarify|date=August 2014}} the same day the referendum took place, which caused some citizens of Little Rock to turn on the black community. The black community became a target for hate crimes since people blamed them for the closing of the schools.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962, p. 155.</ref> [[Daisy Bates (activist)|Daisy Bates]], head of the NAACP chapter in Little Rock, was a primary victim to these crimes, in addition to the black students enrolled at Little Rock Central High School and their families.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962. p. 159.</ref>

The city's teachers were also placed in a difficult position. They were forced to swear loyalty to Faubus's bills.<ref name= "GordySondra" /> Even though Faubus's idea of private schools never played out, the teachers were still expected to attend school every day and prepare for the possibility of their students' return.<ref>Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 436.</ref> The teachers were completely under Faubus's control and the many months that the school stayed empty only served as a cause for uncertainty in their professional futures.<ref>Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 441.</ref>

In May 1959, after the firing of forty-four teachers and administrative staff from the four high schools, three segregationist board members were replaced with three moderate ones. The new board members reinstated the forty-four staff members to their positions.<ref name="GordySondra_a">Gordy, Sondra. "Empty Hearts: Little Rock Secondary Teachers, 1958–1959". ''The Arkansas Historical Quarterly'', 1997, p. 442.</ref> The new board of directors then began an attempt to reopen the schools, much to Faubus's dismay. In order to avoid any further complications, the public high schools were scheduled to open earlier than usual, on August 12, 1959.<ref name="GordySondra_a" />

Although the Lost Year had come to a close, the black students who returned to the high schools were not welcomed by the other students. Rather, the black students had a difficult time getting past mobs to enter the school, and, once inside, they were often subject to physical and emotional abuse.<ref>Bates, Daisy. ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir''. New York: David McKay, 1962, p. 165.</ref> The students were back at school and everything would eventually resume normal function, but the Lost Year would be a pretext for new hatred toward the black students in the public high school.

==Motivations==
Faubus's opposition to desegregation was likely both politically and racially motivated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Rock Nine|url=http://originalpeople.org/little-rock-nine/|website=Originalpeople|access-date=May 6, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126015035/http://originalpeople.org/little-rock-nine/|archive-date=January 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Although Faubus had indicated that he would consider bringing Arkansas into compliance with the high court's decision in 1956, desegregation was opposed by his own [[Dixiecrats|southern Democratic Party]], which dominated all Southern politics at the time. Faubus risked losing political support in the upcoming 1958 Democratic gubernatorial primary if he showed support for integration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Showdown over Segregation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031600131.html|website=The Washington Post|access-date=May 6, 2015|first=Juan|last=Williams|date=March 18, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126015035/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/16/AR2007031600131.html|archive-date=January 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Most histories of the crisis conclude that Faubus, facing pressure as he campaigned for a third term, decided to appease racist elements in the state by calling out the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering Central High. Former associate justice of the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] [[James D. Johnson]] claimed to have hoaxed Governor Faubus into calling out the National Guard, supposedly to prevent a white mob from stopping the integration of [[Little Rock Central High School]]: "There wasn't any caravan. But we made Orval believe it. We said. 'They're lining up. They're coming in droves.' ... The only weapon we had was to leave the impression that the sky was going to fall." He later claimed that Faubus asked him to raise a mob to justify his actions.<ref name=notgone>{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2010/02/18/justice_4/ |title=Racist "Justice" is dead, but not gone |work=Salon |date=February 18, 2010 |access-date=October 5, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006172206/http://www.salon.com/2010/02/18/justice_4/ |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[Harry Ashmore]], the editor of the ''Arkansas Gazette'', won a 1958 Pulitzer Prize for his editorials on the crisis. Ashmore portrayed the fight over Central High as a crisis manufactured by Faubus; in his interpretation, Faubus used the Arkansas National Guard to keep black children out of Central High School because he was frustrated by the success his political opponents were having in using segregationist rhetoric to stir white voters.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pulitzer Prize Winners 1958|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1958|publisher=the Pulitzer Board|access-date=September 7, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925063344/http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1958|archive-date=September 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Congressman [[Brooks Hays]], who tried to mediate between the federal government and Faubus, was later defeated by a last minute write-in candidate, [[Dale Alford]], a member of the Little Rock School Board who had the backing of Faubus's allies.<ref>{{cite book|title=Profiles in Hue|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1456851200|pages=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OANpT_Bl1c8C&q=A+few+years+later,+despite+the+incident+with+the+%22Little+Rock+Nine%22,+Faubus+ran+as+a+moderate+segregationist+against+Dale+Alford,+who+was+challenging+Faubus+for+the+Democratic+nomination+for+governor+in+1962.&pg=PA366|access-date=May 6, 2015|date=January 17, 2011}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} A few years later, despite the incident with the "Little Rock Nine", Faubus ran as a moderate segregationist against Dale Alford, who was challenging Faubus for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1962.
