'''Đerzelez Alija''' or '''Gjergj Elez Alia''' is a popular legendary hero in epic poetry and literature in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Gora (region)|Gora]] and in northern [[Albania]]. According to one opinion, Muslims from [[Bosnian Krajina]] modeled the poetic image of Alija Đerzelez after the image of Christian [[Prince Marko]], based on the historic person [[Ali Bey Mihaloğlu]]. Songs about Đerzelez Alija were transmitted by bilingual singers from [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] milieu to northern [[Albanians|Albanian]] milieu, where he is known as ''Gjergj Elez Alia''.<ref>Citation needed</ref>

{{cquote|Gjergj Elez Alia had nine wounds on his body and lay suffering for nine years in his house and everybody had forgotten him. Only his sister took care of him night and day for nine years. Then news came that another enemy, [[Balozi i Zi]] (black knight) had come from the sea and was killing people and destroying villages every day.<br>One day Gjergj felt some drops of water on his face and thought that his house had become so old that the rain was coming in. His sister told him that it was not the rain, but her tears on his face. She told him that Balozi had requested her and sooner or later would come to get her. Gjergj then told her to take his horse and make it ready for war, as he was going to fight against the horrible Baloz. He met Baloz the next day and had the fight; Gjergj was victorious. He returned home to his sister and as they hugged with joy, both their hearts stopped beating and they died instantly together. They were then buried in the same grave and the place was never forgotten. Everyone that passed by stopped to remember his great actions.}}
