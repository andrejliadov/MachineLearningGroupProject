{{Life in the Arab League}}
[[File:Population Density in the Arab World.png|thumb|right|250px|Population density of the Arab League member states (includes pre-schism Arab League member state [[Syria]])]]
The [[Arab League]] (League of Arab States) is a [[social]], [[culture|cultural]] and [[economy|economic]] grouping of 22 [[Arab states]] in the [[Arab world|Arabic speaking world]]. As of {{UN_Population|Year}}, the combined population of all the Arab states was around 407-420&nbsp;million people.

The most populous Arab League member state is [[Egypt]], the North African nation with a population of {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Egypt}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million residents. [[Comoros]], the Indian Ocean nation is the least populated, with around {{UN_Population|Comoros}} inhabitants. The largest city is [[Cairo]].

==Population growth==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
The population of the Arab League as estimated by the UN in 2017 was 414,727,833.<ref name=UN>{{cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DVD/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/EXCEL_FILES/1_Population/WPP2017_POP_F01_1_TOTAL_POPULATION_BOTH_SEXES.xlsx |title=Total Population - Both Sexes|work=World Population Prospects, the 2017 Revision|publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division, Population Estimates and Projections Section|date=June 2017|access-date=22 June 2017}}</ref> No exact figures of the League's annual population growth, fertility rate, or mortality rate are known to exist.

Most of the Arab League's population is concentrated in and around major urban areas.

[[Muhammad]]'s [[Islam]]ic [[Ummah]] and [[Christianity]] were all reportedly founded in or near areas that are now Arab League countries. Consequently, the majority of the Arab League's citizens are either [[Muslims]] or [[Christians]]. The countries of the Arab League host several holy cities and other religiously significant locations, including [[Alexandria]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Arbil]], and [[Baghdad]]. [[Sunni]] Muslims constitute the majority of the Arab League's residents. However, large numbers of [[Shi'a]] Muslims make up the majority in areas of Lebanon, Iraq, and [[Bahrain]].

[[Arab Christians|Christianity]] is the second largest religion in the League, with over 20&nbsp;million Christians living in countries such as [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Jordan]]. There are smaller [[Arab Jews|Jewish]] populations living mainly in the western part of the Arab league. Places such as Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria, Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt and Iraq all have Jewish populations. However, most Arab Jews emigrated from the Arab states to [[Israel]] after its founding in 1948.<ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html |title=Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=20 August 2015}}</ref> Other minor religions such as [[Druze]] religion, the [[Baháʼí Faith]], [[Mandeanism]], [[Yazdanism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Shabakism|Shabak]] religion and [[Yarsan]] are practiced on a much smaller scale.

[[File:Arab League Languages.PNG|right|300px|thumb|Major languages of the Arab League ''(the map is not precise)'']]
[[File:Arabic Dialects.svg|thumb|right|An overview of the different Arabic dialects]]
[[Arabic]] is the Arab League's official language, but additional languages are often used in the daily lives of some of the League's citizens. Currently, three major languages other than Arabic are used widely: [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] in northern Iraq and parts of Syria, [[Berber languages|Berber]] in [[North Africa]], and [[Somali language|Somali]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].

There are several minority languages that are still spoken today, such as [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Nubian languages|Nubian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Aramaic]], [[Mandic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].
Arabic is a non-native language to 20% of the Arab League's population, with the Somali, Berber and Kurdish languages considered the most widely used after Arabic.

On the other hand, Arabic is divided into over 27 dialects. Almost every Arab state has at least one local dialect of its own. they can be divided into 5 major branches, the Peninsula Arabic, which is the Arabic used in the Arabian peninsula, with around 9 main dialects, Arabic of the Nile Valley, which includes the Masri, Saedi, Sudanese and Chadic Arabic, the Arabic of the Fertile Crescent, which includes the Bedawi, Levant Arabic, Iraqi Arabic and North Mesopotamian Arabic, the Magharbi Arabic, which includes the Dialects used in Mauritania, Morocco, Libya, Algeria and Tunisia, also another category of Arabic is the other isolated dialects of Arabic, like the Judeo-Arabic, Mediterranean Arabic, Nubi Arabic, and the juba Arabic, which have greatly been affected by these communities' own pronunciation, culture and native tongue.

==Arab League populations==
According to the League of Arab States, the Arab League is an organization of independent [[Arab States]] in [[North Africa|North]] and [[Northeast Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]].<ref name="Alpotal">{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Arab League|url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/hello-world/#more-1|publisher=Arab League|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref> Member nations are in turn bound by the [[Charter of the Arab League]].<ref name="Alcal">{{cite web|title=Charter of Arab League|url=http://www.arableagueonline.org/hello-world/#more-1|publisher=Arab League|access-date=21 April 2015}}</ref>

Many Arab countries in the Persian Gulf have sizable (10–30%) non-Arab populations. Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman have a [[Persian language|Persian]] speaking minority. The same countries also have Hindi-Urdu speakers and Filipinos as sizable minority. Balochi speakers are a good size minority in Oman. Additionally, countries like Bahrain, UAE, Oman and Kuwait have significant non-Arab and non-Muslim minorities (10–20%) like Hindus and Christians from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Philippines.

Many non-Arab countries bordering the Arab states have large Arab populations, such as in [[Chad]], [[Israel]], [[Mali]], [[Niger]], [[Senegal]] and [[Turkey]].

The table below shows the distribution of populations in the [[Arab world]] and Israel, as well as the official language(s) within the various Arab states.

===Armenians===
[[File:Armenian woman and her children from Geghi, 1899.jpg|thumb|right|Armenian refugees after the [[Hamidian massacres]]. A lot of them settled in [[Armenians in Syria|Syria]], [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Armenians in Egypt|Egypt]]]]
The [[Arab world]] has between 400,000 and 500,000 [[Armenians]] inhabiting its geographical area. [[Armenians]] are largely concentrated in countries such as [[Lebanon]] 150,000 - 250,000 and [[Syria]] 100,000 to 150,000 as well as [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and to a lesser degree [[Egypt]] and [[Iraq]], but Armenians can also be found in countries like [[Qatar]] and the [[UAE]]. These Armenians are economic migrants from [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].

Prior to World War I, there were some 2,000–3,000 Armenians in Palestine, mostly in Jerusalem. From 1915 and onward, thousands of [[Armenian Genocide]] survivors from [[Cilicia]] ([[Adana Vilayet]]) found refuge, and settled in Palestine, increasing its Armenian population.<ref name=dermat>{{cite journal|last=Der Matossian|first=Bedross|title=The Armenians of Palestine 1918–48|journal=[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]|date=2011|volume=41|issue=1 |jstor=10.1525/jps.2011.XLI.1.24 |doi=10.1525/jps.2011.XLI.1.24 |pp=25, 29–30}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shemassian|first=Vahram|title=Armenian Genocide Survivors in the Holy Land at the End of World War I|journal=Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies|volume=21|year=2012|pages=247–77}}</ref> In 1925, around 15,000 Armenians are believed to have lived in all of Palestine, with the majority in Jerusalem.<ref name=dermat/> During [[Mandatory Palestine]] period, the number of Armenians is estimated to have reached up to 20,000.<ref name=dermat/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bremer|first=Joerg|editor-last=v.

Most [[Armenians]] are Christians mainly following the Orthodox [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The church has one of its two headquarters in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]], called [[Holy See of Cilicia|The Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] (the other being in Armenia called [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]]). There are also Armenian Catholics. The world headquarters of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] is also located in Beirut, Lebanon (and historically in [[Bzoummar]], Lebanon). There are also a minority Armenian Evangelical Protestants. The Middle East headquarters of the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]] is in Beirut called [[Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East]].

===Assyrians===
[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] (also known as Chaldo-Assyrians) can be found in [[Iraq]], north eastern [[Syria]], and to a lesser degree north western [[Iran]] and south eastern [[Turkey]]. They are an ancient [[Semitic people]] who retain [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as a spoken language. They are exclusively [[Christians|Christian]] and are descendants of the ancient pre Arab  [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]/[[Mesopotamians]]. Almost all Christians in Iraq are ethnic Assyrians, where they number approximately 400,000. 500,000 are in Syria but are harder to identify, because they are often included in with the general [[Christians|Christian]] population and speak Arabic, however the Christians of the [[Tur Abdin]] and [[Al Hasakah]] regions in the north east are predominantly Assyrian.

===Berbers===
{{See also|Amazigh}}[[File:Aït Benhaddou1 (js).jpg|thumb|right| The town of [[Aït Benhaddou]] is a typical desert Amazigh town; the [[Berber people|Berbers]] (Amazigh) are the largest non-Arab ethnicity in the Arab League.]]
[[Berbers]] are an ethnic group indigenous to North Africa. They are distributed in an area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Siwa Oasis in Egypt, and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Niger River. Historically, they spoke Berber languages, which together form the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family. Since the Muslim conquest of North Africa in the seventh century, a large number of Berbers inhabiting the Maghreb have acquired different degrees of knowledge of varieties of Maghrebi Arabic.

===Circassians===
[[Circassians]] are a people who originate in the [[North Caucasus]]. They are predominantly Muslim, and can be found in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon in relatively small numbers.

===Coptic Christians===
[[Egypt]]ian [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] are a religious group who do not usually identify themselves as Arabic and they follow the Coptic Orthodox Church. They place heavy emphasis on the Egyptian aspect of their identity and their [[Christianity|Christian heritage]]. Their numbers are heavily disputed but are estimated to compromise roughly 5.35 % of the Egyptian population. They are mainly followers of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], there are however a minority among them who are members of the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], and an even smaller group who belong to the [[Coptic Evangelical Church]]. The [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic language]], which is a late script that was developed in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and descending from the late form of the [[Egyptian language]] of [[ancient Egypt]], continues to be used as the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

===Jews===
{{Further|Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jews}}
The [[Jewish tribes of Arabia]] were Arabian tribes professing the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] that inhabited the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before and during the advent of [[Islam]].  It is not always clear whether they were originally [[Israelite]] in ancestry, genealogically Arab tribes that converted to Judaism, or a mixture of both. In Islamic tradition the Jewish tribes of the [[Hejaz]] were seen as the offspring of the ancient [[Israelites]].<ref name="Gil">{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|title=The origin of the Jews of Yathrib|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vTTCwG0nKIC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=The+Origin+of+the+Jews+of+Yathrib|isbn=9789004138827}}</ref>{{rp|4–5}} According to Muslim sources, they spoke a language other than Arabic, which [[Al-Tabari]] claims was Persian. This implies they were connected to the major Jewish center in Babylon.<ref name="Gil"/>{{rp|5}} Certain Jewish traditions records the existence of nomadic tribes such as the [[Rechabite]]s that converted to Judaism in antiquity. The tribes collapsed with the rise of Islam, with many either converting or fleeing the Arab peninsula. Some of those tribes are thought to have merged into [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], while others, like the residents of [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]] consider themselves Islamized descendants of [[Khaybar]], a Jewish tribe of Arabia.

[[Jew]]s from Arab countries&nbsp;– included in the [[Mizrahi Jewish]] communities– are not categorized as, and do not consider themselves to be, Arabs, as Jews are a separate nation from Arabs, with different history and culture.<ref name="Jews-are-ethnoreligious-group">

</ref> However, sometimes the term [[Arab Jews]] is used to describe Jews from Arab countries, though the term is highly controversial. Sociologist Sammy Smooha stated "This ("Arab Jews") term does not hold water. It is absolutely not a parallel to 'Arab Christian'".<ref>Lee, Vered. (2008-05-18) [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/conference-asks-iraqi-israeli-arab-jew-or-mizrahi-jew-1.246035 Conference asks: Iraqi Israeli, Arab Jew or Mizrahi Jew? - Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper]. Haaretz.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> Those who dispute the [[historicity]] of the term make the claim that Middle Eastern Jews are similar to [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Berbers]], and other Middle Eastern groups who live in Arab societies as distinct minority groups with distinct identity and therefore are not categorized as Arabs.

===Kurds===
In the northern regions of [[Iraq]] (15-20%) and [[Syria]] (10%) live a group called the [[Kurd]]s, an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ethnic group who speak [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], a language closely related to [[Persian language|Persian]] and using [[Persian alphabet]] (In Turkey, Kurds use [[Latin alphabet]]). The majority of Kurds are [[Sunni Muslim]], others are [[Alevi]] Muslim, with [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Yarsan]] minorities. The nationalist aspiration for self-rule or for a state of [[Kurdistan]] has created conflict between Kurdish minorities and their governments in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]

===Mandaeans===
[[Mandaeans]], sometimes also called [[Sabians]], are a people found mainly in southern Iraq. Their numbers total no more than 70,000. They follow [[Mandaeism]], a [[gnostic]] religion.

===Mhallami===
[[Mhallami]] are a tiny minority of the Assyrian/Syriac people who have converted to Islam but retained their Syriac culture.

===Nubians===
{{See also|Nubians}}
Nubians, found in Northern [[Sudan]] and Southern [[Egypt]], are a different [[ethnicity]] from their northern and southern neighbors in Egypt and Sudan, numbering 1.7&nbsp;million in Sudan and Egypt. The [[Nubian people]] in Sudan inhabit the region between [[Wadi Halfa]] in the north and Aldaba in the south. The main Nubian groups from north to south are the Halfaweyen, Sikut (Sickkout), [[Mahas]], and Danagla. They speak different dialects of the [[Nubian language]].

[[Ancient Nubians]] were famous for their vast wealth, their trade between [[Central Africa]] and the lower [[Nile valley]] civilizations, including Egypt, their skill and precision with the bow, their 23-letter alphabet, the use of deadly poison on the heads of their arrows, their great military, their advanced civilization, and their century-long rule over the united upper and lower Egyptian kingdoms.

===Roma===
[[Romani people|Roma]] are to be found in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa; their numbers are unknown. They speak their own language and may loosely follow the predominant religion of the country they live in.<ref name="Bury Me Standing">{{cite book|title=Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey|author=Fonseca, I.|date=1996|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679737438|url=https://archive.org/details/burymestandinggy00fonse|url-access=registration|access-date=20 August 2015}}</ref>

===Shabaks===
[[Shabak people|Shabaks]] are mainly found in Iraq, they are either Muslim or follow native religions. They are also related to Kurds, but like the Yazidi, emphasise their separate identity.

===Turks===
{{see also|Turks in the Arab world}}
The Arab world is home to sizeable populations of Turks throughout [[North Africa]], the [[Levant]], and the [[Arabian Peninsula]].

There is a notable Turkish minority in [[Egypt]]; prior to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|Egyptian revolution]] in 1919, the ruling and upper classes were mainly Turkish,  or of Turkish descent (see [[Turks in Egypt]]), which was part of the heritage from the Ottoman rule of Egypt.<ref>{{citation|last=Abdelrazek|first=Amal Talaat|year=2007|title=Contemporary Arab American women writers: hyphenated identities and border crossings|publisher=[[Cambria Press]]|isbn=978-1-934043-71-4|page=37|quote=This interiorized rejection of things local and Arabic in part derives from the fact that the ruling and upper classes in the years before the revolution were mainly Turkish, or of Turkish descent, part of the heritage from the Ottoman rule in Egypt. If one was not really Western, but belonged to the elite, one was Turkish. Only the masses, the country folk, were quite simply Egyptian in the first place, and possibly Arabs secondarily. }}</ref>

In the [[Levant]] the Turks are scattered throughout the region. In Iraq and Syria the Turkish minorities are commonly referred to as "Turkmen", "Turkman" and "Turcoman"; these terms have historically been used to designate Turkish speakers in Arab areas, or Sunni Muslims in Shitte areas.<ref name=Peyrouse2015>{{citation |last=Peyrouse|first=Sebastien|year=2015|title=Turkmenistan: Strategies of Power, Dilemmas of Development|page=62|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0230115521}}</ref> The majority of [[Iraqi Turkmen]] and [[Syrian Turkmen]] are the descendants of Ottoman Turkish settlers.<ref name="Taylor 2004 loc=31">{{citation |last=Taylor|first=Scott|year=2004|title=Among the Others: Encounters with the Forgotten Turkmen of Iraq|publisher=[[Esprit de Corps (magazine)|Esprit de Corps]]|isbn=1-895896-26-6|page=31|quote=The largest number of Turkmen immigrants followed the army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent when he conquered all of Iraq in 1535.

[[North Africa]]ns are the inhabitants of the [[North Africa]] ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]). Maghrebis mostly speak [[Maghrebi Arabic]], which is descended from [[Classical Arabic]] and has a marked [[Berber languages|Berber]] [[Stratum (linguistics)|substratum]], while Egyptians speak [[Egyptian Arabic]] which is mainly based on Coptic grammar rather than Classical Arabic.

In 647 AD (the year 27 of the Hegira), the first [[Muslim]] expedition to [[Africa]] took place. By 700 AD, the area had been conquered and converted to the [[Islamic faith]]. We know little of the early Islamic town, but by the tenth century the area outside of the fortress was once more filled with houses: on the site of the Roman baths over twelve of these were excavated, with large courtyards surrounded by long, thin, rooms.<ref>E.
