== Life ==
Lorenzini was born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, the seventh of eight children.<ref name=":0" /> She worked as a typist at the Unión Telefónica Company, and enjoyed participating in sports such as rowing, javelin, athletics and hockey. In 1933 she started learning to fly at the Aeroclub de [[Morón, Buenos Aires|Morón]]. The lessons were expensive, and she had to use all her savings, and sell her bicycle and encyclopedia, to pay. In March 1935 she earnt her pilot's license. The same year, she broke the South American record for altitude, flying to 5,700 metres.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.inac.edu.ar/ciataonline/index.php?sec=&pag=noticia&tipo=Institucional&id=21|title=CIATA - Centro de Instrucción de Aeronavegantes y Técnicos Aeronáuticos|date=4 October 2009|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004065125/http://www.inac.edu.ar/ciataonline/index.php?sec=&pag=noticia&tipo=Institucional&id=21|archivedate=4 October 2009}}</ref> She also entered and won several flying races, and became interested in high aerobatics, enrolling in a course on the subject.<ref name=":0" /> She became famous for her skill in performing inverted loops, an advanced maneouvre which only one other aviator, her instructor Santiago Germanó, was able to perform.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/radar/9-698-2003-04-20.html|title=Página/12 :: radar|website=www.pagina12.com.ar|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref>

From 1938 to 1940, Lorenzini was involved in an air exploration mission to fly all of Argentina's 14 provinces and make aerial maps for transport and mail flights. She flew to every town and city in the country, annotating maps as she travelled.<ref name=":1" /> As a result, she became nationally famous; in 1939 the magazine ''Vosotras'' named Lorenzini one of Argentina's eight women of the year, and in 1940 she featured on the cover of ''[[El Gráfico|El Grafico]]'' magazine.<ref name=":1" />

On 23 November 1941 Lorenzini lost control of her aircraft, a [[Focke-Wulf]], while conducting her famous inverted loop, and crashed. She was killed immediately. The accident happened in Morón during an aerobatics exhibition for a visiting group of Uruguayan aviators.<ref name=":0" /> It was later reported that Lorenzini had been flying an aircraft she was unfamiliar with and that she had been extremely angry on the day of the exhibition due to an ongoing issue with the organisers of the event.<ref name=":1" />

In 2001, the Argentine post office issued a postage stamp bearing Lorenzini's image and name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stampcommunity.org/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=35146&whichpage=9|title=Famous women on stamps and covers - Stamp Community Forum - Page 9|website=Stamp Community Family Stamp Collecting Forum|access-date=2016-12-28}}</ref>
