==The rights of an ''arguido''==

If a person becomes an ''arguido'', they automatically gain certain rights that a witness or suspect would not have.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6657977.stm|title=Q&A: Suspects and Portuguese law|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-09-08| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070910224226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6657977.stm| archive-date= 10 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> An ''arguido'' has the right to be accompanied by a lawyer when questioned.<ref name=times /> The investigating police may ask the ''arguido'' more direct accusatory questions (the answers to which would not be admissible in court if possibly self-incriminatory and asked of a non-''arguido'') but the ''arguido'' must be presented with whatever evidence is held against them,<ref name=bbc /> and unlike a witness has the [[right to silence|right to remain silent]],<ref name=metro>{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=65170&in_page_id=34|title=Why is Kate McCann now a 'suspect'?|publisher=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]|date=2007-09-07|accessdate = 2007-09-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929082943/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=65170&in_page_id=34| archive-date= 29 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> not to answer any question that may incriminate the person, and does not face legal action for lying.<ref name="dn.sapo.pt">{{cite web|url=https://dn.sapo.pt/2007/09/10/opiniao/arguidos_e_regresso.html |title=Arguidos E Regresso |publisher=Dn.sapo.pt |accessdate=2010-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201195418/http://dn.sapo.pt/2007/09/10/opiniao/arguidos_e_regresso.html |archive-date=2008-12-01 }}</ref>

[[Witness]]es in criminal investigations are legally bound to co-operate with the police and do not have the right to silence and face legal actions if they lie.<ref name=bbc /><ref name="dn.sapo.pt"/>  Because of the legal advantages, some individuals apply for ''arguido'' status to be given to themselves, e.g. when it would appear that the police suspect them but are trying to use their witness status to extract as much information as possible.<ref name=bbc />

A person who has ''arguido'' status has not been formally accused of a crime, arrested or charged,<ref name=skynews>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,70131-1265804,00.html|title='Formal Suspect' - The Portuguese Law|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=2007-05-15|accessdate = 2007-09-08}}</ref>
and not all ''arguidos'' are subsequently charged.<ref name=guardian />
The police may ask a court to restrict an ''arguido'''s movement and oblige them to not leave the country.<ref name=guardian/>
''Arguidos'' cannot change their place of residence, without permission from a court.<ref name=skynews />
There is no time limit on the status.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/08/nmaddy308.xml|title=Portuguese law: naming an 'arguida'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=2007-09-08|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | location=London}}</ref>

==Comparison with common-law administrations==
The status is very similar to that of being "questioned under caution" under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|Police and Criminal Evidence Act]] in the United Kingdom or being questioned after being read one's "[[Miranda Rights]]" in the USA, specifically the right to legal representation, the liberty to refuse to answer questions, and the admissibility in court of statements taken whilst in those statuses.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/10/uk.pressandpublishing | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Media have rushed to judge Portuguese police | first=Marcel | last=Berlins | date=2007-09-10}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Arguido'' derives from the Latin ''arguire'' or ''arguere''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/definir_resultados.aspx |title=Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa On-line Priberam |publisher=Priberam.pt |access-date=25 April 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424022125/http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/definir_resultados.aspx| archive-date= 24 April 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookit.pl?latin=arguire |title=Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid |publisher=Archives.nd.edu |access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref> The English words ''argue'' and ''argument'' have the same etymology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=argument&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=25 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=argument |title=Argument &#124; Definition of Argument by Merriam-Webster |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>
