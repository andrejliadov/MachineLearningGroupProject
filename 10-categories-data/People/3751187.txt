'''Calle 13''' is a Puerto Rican band formed by stepbrothers René Pérez Joglar (born February 23, 1978 in [[Hato Rey, Puerto Rico|Hato Rey]]) who calls himself [[Residente]] (lead singer, songwriter) and Eduardo José Cabra Martínez (born September 10, 1978 in [[Santurce, Puerto Rico|Santurce]]), who calls himself [[Visitante]] ([[multi-instrumentalist]], vocalist, beat [[record producer|producer]]) and their half-sister [[ILE (singer)|Ileana Cabra Joglar]] aka PG-13 or recently ILE<ref>{{cite web|title=ILE's official website|url=http://www.ilevitable.com}}</ref> (backing vocals).

Stepbrothers Pérez and Cabra first were discovered by Elias De Leon. They were subsequently given a record deal with [[White Lion Records]] after leaving a demo with A&R Director Carlos “Karly” Rosario. After the controversial song "Querido F.B.I." was released, the group gained notoriety in Puerto Rico. In 2005, Calle 13 released its [[Calle 13 (album)|eponymously titled debut album]], which became very popular due to the singles "Se Vale Tó-Tó" and "[[Atrévete-te-te|¡Atrévete-te-te!]]". In 2007, the group released its second album, ''[[Residente o Visitante]]'', which was also very successful and experimented with a wide variety of genres. The album helped the group gain success throughout Latin America and win three Latin Grammys. The group released its third album, ''[[Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo]]'', in 2008, which won Album of the Year at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2009|2009 Latin Grammy Awards]]. Calle 13 released ''[[Entren Los Que Quieran]]'' in November 2010 and its latest album, ''[[Multi Viral]]'', on March 1, 2014.

Calle 13 is noted for its eclectic musical style, often using unconventional instrumentation in its music, which distances the group from the [[reggaeton]] genre. The band is also known for its satirical lyrics as well as social commentary about Latin American issues and culture. The stepbrothers are strong supporters of the [[Puerto Rican independence movement]], a stance that has generated controversy.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/arts/music/11calle.html|title=Continuing Days of Independence for Calle 13|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=2010-04-18|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2009-04-07}}</ref> For their work, the group has won twenty-one [[Latin Grammy Award]]s, holding the record for the most Latin Grammy wins. They have also won three [[Grammy Awards]].

== History==
===2004-05: Early years===
Residente and Visitante met when they were both two years old, when Residente's mother married Visitante's father.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/calle-13-p747326/biography|title=Calle 13 Biography|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|access-date=2011-02-02|work=Allmusic}}</ref> The family developed strong ties to the Puerto Rican arts community; Residente's mother, Flor Joglar de Gracia, was an actress in Teatro del Sesenta, a local acting troupe, while Visitante's father (who later became Residente's stepfather) is currently a lawyer, but at one time was a musician.<ref name="New York Times"/> The duo asserts that they lived a relatively comfortable lifestyle growing up, as Residente places himself in a group of Puerto Ricans who are "too poor to be rich and too rich to be poor."<ref name="Sin Mapa">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/02/entertainment/ca-calle2|title=Calle 13, in search of the real Latin America|last=Morales|first=Ed|date=2009-08-02|access-date=2011-02-07|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Although their parents later divorced, the stepbrothers remained close.<ref name="Allmusic"/> When they were children, Visitante would visit his brother at the Calle 13 (13th Street) of the El Conquistador subsection of [[Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico]] every week. Since the subsection is a gated community, visitors were routinely asked "¿Residente o visitante?" ("Resident or visitor?") by a security guard when approaching the community's main gate.<ref name="New York Times"/> Therefore, Visitante would identify himself as a visitor, while Residente would have to insist that he was a resident to clear the gate.<ref name="Allmusic"/> The pair named themselves Calle 13 after the street their family's house was on.<ref name="CALLE">[http://www.latinrapper.com/calle_13_interview.html Latin Hip Hop Interview - "Calle 13 Cross Spanish Rap's Musical Borders"]</ref> Before living there, they lived at Calle 11.<ref name=emequis>{{cite web|last1=Acuña|first1=Carlos|title=Me Llaman el Incongruente|url=http://www.m-x.com.mx/2014-04-20/calle-13-me-llaman-el-incongruente/|website=Emeequis|access-date=20 October 2014|language=es|date=20 April 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018231703/http://www.m-x.com.mx/2014-04-20/calle-13-me-llaman-el-incongruente/|archive-date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

Residente originally studied to be an accountant, and Visitante finished a computer science degree. An art course prompted Residente to pursue a career as a [[multimedia]] designer, and Visitante became a full-time musician and producer. Residente states that his degree in design has influenced his musical style: "What I used to do with my visual art is the same thing I do now with my lyrics. My songs are descriptive, very visual."<ref name="New York Times"/> Besides this, Residente was a fan of what was then called "underground rap" in Puerto Rico, and started to earn a reputation as a lyricist (Residente says, with some embarrassment, that his moniker at the time was ''"El Déspota"'', or "The Despot"). Meanwhile, Visitante participated in Bayanga, a [[rock music|rock]] and Brazilian [[batucada]] group.<ref name="NIGHT">[http://www.latina.com/latina/entertainment/entertainment.jsp?genre=music&article=nightoutcalle13 Latina.com Interview - "A Night Out with Calle 13" by Nuria Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928195600/http://www.latina.com/latina/entertainment/entertainment.jsp?genre=music&article=nightoutcalle13 |date=2007-09-28 }}</ref> After Residente finished studying in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] at the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] and earned a master of fine arts in animation, illustration, sequential art and film, he returned to Puerto Rico.<ref name="New York Times"/> Soon after, both of them started working on their music. They claim they initially did it as a joke, but they still managed to get some of their songs heard throughout Puerto Rico.<ref name="NIGHT"/> They began recording music together in 2004, with the idea of hosting their work on a website, beginning with two demos ("La Tripleta" and "La Aguacatona").<ref name="Allmusic"/> Within a year, the duo began looking for a record label to distribute their music commercially. They decided to pursue a deal at [[White Lion Records]], because [[Tego Calderón]] was on the label, whom the two admired.<ref name="Allmusic"/>

===2005-06: "Querido F.B.I." and ''Calle 13''===
While their first album was being mixed, [[Filiberto Ojeda Ríos]], leader of the Puerto Rican revolutionary group known as [[Boricua Popular Army|Los Macheteros]], was killed in the course of arrest by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|F.B.I.]]

Angered by the F.B.I.'s action, Residente wrote a song protesting against what had happened to Ojeda and asked his record label to allow the group to release it on the Internet through [[viral marketing]] through [[Indymedia]] Puerto Rico, an alternative news website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/arts/crisper-and-more-mature-calle-13-returns-with-politically-charged-album-entren-los-que-quieran-1.2422669 |title=Crisper and more mature, Calle 13 returns with politically−charged album, ‘Entren Los Que Quieran’ |last=MacEwen |first=Melissa |date=2010-12-06 |work=The Tufts Daily |access-date=2010-12-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304222140/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/arts/crisper-and-more-mature-calle-13-returns-with-politically-charged-album-entren-los-que-quieran-1.2422669 |archive-date=2012-03-04 }}</ref>

Public controversy about the song's lyrics ensured immediate attention from mainstream media in Puerto Rico and gave the band instant rise to local fame. The song, according to critics, "redefined what a reggaeton vocalist's relationship to Puerto Rico should be."<ref>Frances Negrón-Muntaner and Raquel Z. Rivera, "Reggaeton Nation" (17 December 2007)</ref>

[[File:Calle13R.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Visitante during Calle 13's first concert in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].]]

Soon after this, the duo rose to fame in 2005 with two back-to-back hits on Puerto Rican radio stations: "Se Vale Tó-Tó" and "[[Atrevete-te-te!]]" Both songs were later included on their [[Calle 13 (album)|eponymously titled debut album]], which was released on November 29, 2005.

After this rise to fame, the duo was sought by other reggaetón artists, and they collaborated with artists such as [[Voltio]] in the song ''"Ojalai"'' (also known as ''"Chulin Culin Chunfly"'', whose name is a minor variation of a song written by Mexican comedy writer [[Roberto Gómez Bolaños]], of whose comedic characters Residente is a fan -by citing the name, Gómez Bolaños is legally a co-author of the song<ref>[https://archive.is/20130118163838/http://repertoire.bmi.com/title.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&keyID=7851875&ShowNbr=0&ShowSeqNbr=0&querytype=WorkID BMI database record] for "Chulin Culin Fun Flai", accessed on 25 June 2012.</ref>), and with the [[Three 6 Mafia]] in the remix, singing or co-writing songs. At the end of 2005, they finally released their album, which received great critical praise.

In 2006 the duo kept on working as they broke into a wider-music scene with at least two more smash hits that were played throughout Puerto Rico and U.S. Urban music radio and television stations, including the songs "Japón" ("Japan"), and "Suave" ("Soft/Slow"). The group had their first massive-venue concert on May 6, 2006 at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. They also toured Central and South America, playing "Atrévete-te-te" before an ''escola de [[samba]]'' in Venezuelan television, and also visiting, among others, [[Guatemala]], [[Chile]], [[Honduras]] and [[Colombia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In light of the criticism directed towards the band, Calle 13 has become a cultural reference to be reckoned with in Puerto Rico. An example of this is the constant references made to the band and to Residente by satirical writer [[Fiquito Yunqué]] in the weekly pro-independence newspaper ''[[Claridad]]''. Yunqué's columns sometimes feature Calle 13 lyrics as their titles, and Yunqué even introduced the band onstage at one of their live performances in Puerto Rico (mentioned in the section "Major success in the Americas" below).

Acceptance of Calle 13's music even influenced the former [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[Aníbal Acevedo Vilá]] who, in December 2005, admitted to listening to Calle 13 because his son had copied some of their songs to his [[iPod]]. Acevedo claimed that "songs such as Calle 13's were eye openers" to him. As a result, since the country had a chronic problem of people being unknowingly injured or killed by stray bullets fired to the air on [[New Year's Eve]], Acevedo felt compelled to invite the duo to [[La Fortaleza]] and to have them record a song against shootings bullets in the air as a way of celebrating the holiday.<ref name="GOV">{{Cite web |url=http://www.zonai.com/noticia_mainm.asp?ZONAI:81318&pos=m&title=ESPECTACULOS&catid=6# |title=Zonai.com Article about Calle 13 and the Governor of Puerto Rico "Residente Calle 13 en campaña contra las balas" |access-date=2007-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055814/http://www.zonai.com/noticia_mainm.asp?ZONAI%3A81318&pos=m&title=ESPECTACULOS&catid=6# |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The single, "Ley De Gravedad" (Law of Gravity) was released as part of a public-service campaign for that matter. Some political adversaries of Acevedo dismissed this as a trick to ingratiate himself with Puerto Rican youth and pro-independence advocates, and was criticized by the local press due to the fact that an artist who seemingly promoted violence with their "Querido FBI" song was now supposed to be a [[role model]] for anti-violence. However, the campaign was thought to be effective in reducing the injured, from twelve (and one death) the previous year, to three the year the campaign was run, though many members of the artistic community contributed to this effort in separate campaigns.<ref name="BALAS">{{cite web|url=https://www.prpop.org/noticias/ene06/reggaeton_ene04.shtml|title=Creatividad y talento en función cierre de ‘Teatro en Movimiento’|work=Fundación Nacional para la Cultura Popular - San Juan, Puerto Rico|access-date=20 November 2015}}</ref>

As the duo has risen to fame, other international artists of various genres have sought them. In 2006 and 2007, they recorded songs with Canadian [[Nelly Furtado]] and Spanish [[Alejandro Sanz]]. In their recent album, they feature contributions with such diverse groups like [[Orishas (band)|Orishas]] (a [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group whose members had emigrated from [[Cuba]]), Mexican [[Café Tacuba]], [[Argentina|Argentine]] Vicentico (from [[Los Fabulosos Cadillacs]]), and [[La Mala Rodríguez]] (from Spain), among others. On May 19, 2006, the band celebrated their first international concert, held in [[Panama City]] to a crowd of 5,000. During the summer of 2006 Calle 13 was featured on [[MTV]]'s ''My Block: Puerto Rico''. From September 15-October 31 ''Calle'' 13 was ''Artist Speaking Tr3s'' on [[MTV Tr3s]].

On November 2, 2006 the band won three [[Latin Grammys]] (''Best New Artist''; ''Best Urban Album''; and ''Best Short Version Video'', for the song ''Atrévete-te-te''.) They later filmed a video along with [[Voltio]] for "Chulín Culín Chunfly", where Residente, dressed as a [[priest]] and later as [[Bruce Lee]], is given a severe beating by a gang.

On April 24, 2007, their second album ''[[Residente o Visitante]]'' was released. Tracks in the album were partially recorded in [[Puerto Rico]] and while on tour in [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. While recording the album, Residente and Visitante took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Latin America's indigenous]] and African-descended minorities. The duo was strongly influenced by the experience; Visitante discovered and purchased several new musical instruments on the trip including a [[Jawbone (instrument)|quijada]], a [[charango]] and a [[bombo legüero]], all of which were used on the duo's song "Lllegale a Mi Guarida".<ref name="Sin Mapa"/>

Residente considered this album to be darker than the first, but also more introspective and biographical. The album garnered controversy for its sexual and religious overtones.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/10/04/us-calle-idUSTRE49309420081004|title=Calle 13 still defying labels on third album|agency=Reuters|last=Cobo|first=Leila|date=2008-10-03|access-date=2011-01-31|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> As part of the album, Calle 13 filmed the video for their first single off the album, "[[Tango del Pecado]]", on February 25, 2007.

In May 2007, the duo performed at [[Vive Latino#2007|Vive Latino]], and the public answered them by throwing beer bottles filled with urine. In 2010, when taking part of the same festival, they were less bitterly welcomed.<ref name=emequis/> In July 2007, Calle 13 teamed up with [[Julio Voltio]] to speak out against police brutality in Puerto Rico.<ref name="RL">{{cite web|url=http://www.reggaetonline.net/voltio-residente-calle-13-08222007_news|title=Julio Voltio and Residente (Calle 13) Denounce Police brutality with Two New Songs|work=reggaetonline.net|access-date=20 November 2015}}</ref> After recording a song titled "Tributo a la Policía", Calle 13 distributed the single free on the streets in front of the Police Headquarters of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].

On November 8, 2007, Calle 13, along with Orishas, performed the song "Pa'l Norte" at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2007|8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]], held at the [[Mandalay Bay Events Center]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Their live performance featured the percussion/dance group [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]]. A troupe of dancers dressed in traditional Latin American garb and wearing [[bandanna]]s in their faces (as if they were [[bandits]]) were also featured. Two members of the traditional Colombian folk cumbia band [[Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto]], as well as members from an indigenous tribe local to the Gaiteros' hometown in northern Colombia, followed Residente to the stage at the beginning of the song. The subtext of the presentation was that Latin Americans were "invading the North" (the United States) and were there to stay.

Calle 13 earned two Latin Grammys later that night: "Best Urban Music Album" for ''Residente o Visitante'' and "Best Urban Song" for "Pal Norte".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2007/11/08/2007-11-08_winners_of_the_2007_latin_grammy_awards.html|title=Winners of the 2007 Latin Grammy Awards|work=New York Daily News|date=2007-11-09|access-date=2011-02-10}}</ref> They were nominated for two other categories,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2007/11/09/2847/|title=Winning five Latin Grammy Awards at Vegas ceremony even better than scoring at the tables|work=Hollywood today|date=November 9, 2007|access-date=January 12, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221170448/http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2007/11/09/2847/|archive-date=February 21, 2013}}</ref> the others being [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Short Form Music Video]] and [[Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].

A later tour of the Americas had Calle 13 perform to sell-out crowds in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. The band also performed in the United States, including an appearance at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]] on April 27, 2008.

The band received all three possible audience acceptance awards when they performed at the 2008 [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]] in, [[Viña del Mar]], Chile, taming the usually demanding crowd (traditionally nicknamed ''"El Monstruo"'', or "The Monster" -because of its fickleness- by Chilean media). They also performed to a sold-out crowd at [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. They finished their tour at the 34th Annual [[Claridad]] Support Festival in San Juan on April 24, 2008. [[Denise Quiñones]] joined the band onstage for their abbreviated song set.

On August 11, 2009, the duo was invited to [[Ecuador]] by [[Rafael Correa]]'s government, serving as guests in the local celebrations that commemorate the coup that began the [[Ecuadorian War of Independence]].

===2010-2012: ''Entren Los Que Quieran''===
Calle 13 released their latest album, ''[[Entren Los Que Quieran]]'', on November 22, 2010.<ref name="Latina">{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/music/exclusive-calle-13-said-no-reggaeton-new-album|title=Calle 13 "Said No to Reggaeton" on New Album|last=Bastidas|first=Grace|date=2010-11-04|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group|access-date=2010-11-07}}</ref> The singles "Calma Pueblo" and "Vamo' a Portarnos Mal" have been released to the [[iTunes Store]]. Visitante explained that the title of the album means that "Everyone's invited to enter. If you don’t want to, well don’t."<ref name="Latina"/> He also stated that the album continues to experiment with different styles of music, with collaborations with [[Omar Rodríguez-López]] from [[The Mars Volta]] on "Calma Pueblo", giving the song a "[[Beastie Boys]] vibe." He stated that there would also be influences from [[Bollywood]] and South American rhythms.<ref name="Latina"/> The promotional tour for ''Entren Los Que Quieran'' featured over a hundred presentations in 2011, spanning most of Latin America and parts of Europe. Among the most notable being serving as the sole representation of Puerto Rico at the inauguration of the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] and their performance at the 2011 Viña del Mar Festival, where Calle 13 decided to go against the event's rules, refusing further awards beyond a "Silver Torch" in order to avoid further interruption, despite being the most clamored artist in that night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.aollatino.com/blog/musica/2011/02/24/calle-13-mejor-tercera-noche-vina-del-mar/ |title=Calle 13, lo mejor de la tercera noche de Viña del Mar |publisher=Aol Latino |language=es |date=2011-02-24 |access-date=2012-01-01}}</ref> On November 19, 2011, the group offered a concert in El Salvador where the entrance gate was fully paid in rice and beans, the collected food was subsequently donated to flood victims in that country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entretenimiento.starmedia.com/musica/concierto-benefico-calle-13-todo-exito.html |title=Concierto benéfico de calle 13 todo un éxito |author=Fabricio Alonso |publisher=starMedia Latino América |language=es |date=2011-11-21 |access-date=2012-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603015135/http://entretenimiento.starmedia.com/musica/concierto-benefico-calle-13-todo-exito.html# |archive-date=2012-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pérez also remixed an exclusive version of "El Hormiguero" for four-time world boxing champion [[Miguel Cotto]], who used it in his entrance prior to a successful title defense on December 3, 2011.

Upon release, the music video for "Calma Pueblo" generated controversy for its violence and full-frontal nudity, which the band claims is a metaphor for self-liberation.<ref name="Anger">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2010/11/17/2010-11-17_residente_tames_his_anger.html|title=Calle 13's Residente tames his anger in new CD, 'Everybody Is Welcome'|last=Morales|first=Ed|work=NY Daily News|date=2010-10-17|access-date=2011-01-31}}</ref>
The album received more nominations for the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2011|12th Latin Grammy Awards]] than any other production that year. It went on to win nine categories in total "Album of the Year", "Best Urban Music Album" and "Producer of the Year" in general; "Best Urban Song" for "Baile de los Pobres"; "Best Tropical Song" for "Vamo' a Potarnos Mal"; "Best Short Form Music Video" for "Calma Pueblo"; "Song of the Year" and "Record of the Year" for "Latinoamérica".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2011/11/11/dupla-porto-riquenha-calle-13-domina-grammy-latino-2011.jhtm|title=Com nove prêmios, dupla porto-riquenha Calle 13 domina Grammy Latino 2011|work=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|date=October 11, 2011|access-date=January 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103030232/http://musica.uol.com.br/ultnot/2011/11/11/dupla-porto-riquenha-calle-13-domina-grammy-latino-2011.jhtm|archive-date=January 3, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following this ceremony, Calle 13 emerged as the artist or group with most awards won in the event with 19, besting Juanes' 17. This accomplishment also shattered several records, including "Most Honored Album", "Most Latin Grammies won in one night" and increased their leadership in the "Most Latin Grammies won by a group" category to 13 more than their closest competitors.

In the press conference that followed, the group was interviewed by journalist Elvis Castillo of VENFM regarding his support to some elements of the Latin American left-wing. The journalist, a member of the conservative Venezuelan opposition, cited the work of local cartoonist Edo, a sketch of one of Pérez's characteristic black shirts scribbled with the phrase ''A Calle 13: No es lo mismo ver la Revolución como Visitante que como Residente'' (lit. "To Calle 13: It is not the same to see the [[Bolivarian Revolution|Revolution]] as a Visitor as it is as a Resident") to question a supposed sympathy for [[Chavismo]]. Pérez disregarded that notion, stating that "[Calle 13] does not support any president, because when we support any president we stop belonging to the people." On June 22, 2011, Calle 13 performed at The Pachamama Peace Festival and supported the project together with 8 Latin American embassies as the Godparent of the Pachamama Project.

On December 22, 2011, the group received the Medalla Ramón Emeterio Betances from the Ateneo Puertorriqueño, the oldest cultural institution in Puerto Rico, as part of their Puerto Rican Flag Day celebrations. In the event, Pérez was heralded as the "[[Roberto Clemente]] of modern music" by host [[Luis Gutierrez]], only to respond that he was "merely another member of [the Puerto Rican people] who decided to express [his] message". However, he admitted that being recognized in his motherland held more weight than any other award received during his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noticel.com/mobile/detalle/115257/residente-esto-es-mas-poderoso-que-los-grammys.html |title=Residente: "Esto es más poderoso que los Grammys" |author=Melissa Solórzano García |publisher=Noticel.com |language=es |date=2011-12-22 |access-date=2011-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530182629/http://www.noticel.com/mobile/detalle/115257/residente-esto-es-mas-poderoso-que-los-grammys.html# |archive-date=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2014, the duo once again performed at Vive Latino. When they were playing "El Aguante", one spectator jumped onto the stage and tried to take Residente's microphone. Five security guards grabbed the invader and Residente tried to punch him.<ref name=emequis/> The duo later issued a statement (with a fan-made video of the incident) in which they say Residente's punch never actually hit the aggressor.<ref name=lifeboxset>{{cite web|title=Residente se reúne con el fan que lo "atacó" en el Vive Latino|url=http://www.lifeboxset.com/2014/residente-calle-13-fan-vive-latino/|website=LifeBoxSet|access-date=20 October 2014|language=es|date=3 April 2014}}</ref> They also included a video in which Residente is shown with the attacker sharing a drink and celebrating the fifth album.<ref name=lifeboxset/>

Following the end of their ''Multi_Viral'' world tour, Residente and Visitante went separate ways to focus on personal projects - the former would see the release of his first solo effort, ''[[Residente (album)|Residente]]'', in March 2017.

Although most people have labeled Calle 13's music as [[reggaeton]], they have tried to distance themselves from the style.<ref name="Sin Mapa"/> Indeed, Residente once admitted the group played reggaeton in their first album as way of gaining some initial popularity more easily, while assuring that the group has nothing against the genre.<ref name=emequis/> Visitante, being a professional musician, tries to fuse diverse styles in the group's songs. Early cuts featured elements from [[jazz]], [[bossa nova]] and [[salsa music|salsa]], while recent songs feature [[cumbia]], [[tango music|tango]], [[electronica]] and others. In their recent tours around Latin America they have added different musical elements according to the place the band is playing in, yet many of their songs carry the traditional reggaeton "Dem Bow" beat such as in their hit "[[Tango del Pecado]]" and the remix to "Suave".

Singer Residente is reluctant to label their music in a specific genre, instead calling it plain [[urban music|urban]] style. In an interview with Rueben Blades, Rene mentioned that he is wary of making generic [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and traditional reggaeton. He added that even though he welcomes the "urbanity" of Hip Hop, he does not consider it to be an authentic Latin American musical expression. On the other hand, he believes that reggaeton has become generic and watered down with pop aesthetics.<ref name="Interview with Rueben Blades">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_P8ALGq7p8|title=Interview with Ruben Blades|date=2008-03-08|last=Blades|first=Rueben|access-date=2011-12-19|work=Rueben Blades Official Youtube}}</ref> Calle 13 has maintained a healthy distance from the orthodoxy of [[reggaeton]] and both he and his brother justify it by saying that only three songs out of fifteen songs in their eponymous debut album, as well as four out of fifteen songs in their album ''[[Residente o Visitante]]'', feature reggaetón beats.<ref name="CALLE"/> Residente said of the group's musical style "I love to mix things up, like on our song 'La Jirafa’. We have drumming from Brazil combined with the theme music from the film ''[[Amélie]]''. It's a pretty song, a love song for a woman, but it's about Puerto Rico too. I think this why people like our music, because - sexually speaking or politically speaking – it's just very genuine."<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/5978736/Calle-13-interview.html|title=Calle 13 interview|date=2009-08-06|last=Horan|first=Tom|access-date=2011-02-05|work=The Telegraph}}</ref>

[[File:Calle13residente.jpg|thumb|left|Residente performing in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz, Mexico]] on August 29, 2009.]]
Residente's lyrical style is inspired partly by the lyrical approach used by artists such as [[Vico C]] and [[Tego Calderón]], trying to minimize what they refer to as "clichés" of the genre -such as open confrontations with other rappers, known in Spanish as ''tiradera'' (pronounced {{IPA-es|tiɾaˈeɾa|}} in Puerto Rican dialect). He attempts to stray away from the "wannabe gangster aesthetic" typical of reggaeton music.<ref name="Sin Mapa"/> Residente's trademark is a lyrical style full of [[sarcasm]], [[satire]], [[parody]] and [[shock value]], which some critics and fans have likened to [[Eminem]]'s.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] writes that Residente's lyrical style and delivery "eschews reggaeton's clichés, showcasing a healthy sense of humor and an almost clownish approach to sarcasm...A world apart from the kingly bravado of most reggaeton vocalists, not to mention the obligatory glimmers of [[misogyny]] and [[violence]] that accompany such streetwise swaggering."<ref name="Allmusic"/> Residente also utilizes Puerto Rican [[slang]] considerably (which in turn incorporates a sizeable dose of [[Spanglish]]), as well as [[allegory]]. Early in his career, Residente expressed a desire to write lyrics only in Spanish, however he has recently stated that he will begin to write more lyrics in English in order to help communicate with English-speaking listeners.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Residente's distinctive lyrics treat a wide and eclectic variety of subjects. He mentions (and sometimes derides) celebrities and known icons such as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], and [[2Pac]], in "Tengo Hambre" (''I'm Hungry''); [[50 Cent]] in "La Crema" (''The Cream''); [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] ("I mean, [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]]", Residente says) in "Sin Exagerar" (''Without Exaggeration''); Puerto Rican singer [[Nydia Caro]] (rather affectionately) in "La Era de la Copiaera", wrestler [[Abdullah the Butcher]] in "Tributo a la Policía" (''A Tribute to Police''), golfer [[Tiger Woods]] in "Baile de los Pobres" ("Dance of the Poor") he also made a diss track to [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] in the song "Pi-Di-Di-Di (La Especialidad de la Casa)" (''House Specialty'') and most controversially, his [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] aimed at the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in "Querido F.B.I." (''Dear F.B.I.''). The song "A Limpiar El Sucio" (''Cleaning Up The Dirty One'') is rumored to be a veiled (some say direct) attack on Puerto Rican entertainment journalist [[Milly Cangiano]].

Visitante, on the other hand, is strongly influenced by [[electronica]], [[world music]], and particularly Latin American folk and popular music. Recently, Visitante has claimed to be influenced by music from Central Europe such as [[Fanfare Ciocărlia|Fanfare Ciocarlia]] (particularly its collaboration with [[Romani people|Romani]] band Kaloome, also known as ''"The Gypsy Kings and Queens"'') and [[Emir Kusturica]]'s group, ''"The No Smoking Orchestra"''. He also stated that his musician father introduced the [[Beatles]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] to him at a young age, which has greatly influenced his music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7wARKQQGxw |title=adidas Originals - Calle 13 |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2011-01-03}}</ref> In live presentations, Visitante can be seen playing a variety of instruments: an [[electric guitar]], [[synthesizers]], an [[accordion]], a [[melodica]], a Puerto Rican [[cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]] and a [[theremin]].
