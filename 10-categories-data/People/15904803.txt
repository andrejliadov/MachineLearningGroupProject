He was created by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] and [[Mark Texeira]], and first appeared in ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' Vol. 3, #3.

== Publication history ==

Creator [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] has noted that the character was inspired by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Hannibal Lecter]], and [[Die Hard|Hans Gruber]]. Christopher Priest has stated that he is "The [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] to Black Panther's [[Batman]]".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://digitalpriest.com/legacy/comics/adventures/frames/panther_intro.htm|last = Priest|first = Christopher|title = Chapter Eleven: ''Black Panther'' Series Commentary|publisher = Digital Priest|date = June 2001|website = digitalpriest.com|access-date = 8 July 2015}}</ref>

== Fictional character biography ==
In similar ways to the Joker, Achebe's origin and past is vague, but is assumed and believed by the United States government that he was a Ghudazan farmer nicknamed "Bob" who tended to leftist rebels from the neighboring country of Ujanka when the men were driven across the Ghudazan/Ujankan border and onto Achebe's property. The soldiers repaid Achebe's kindness by leaving him for dead after they seduced his wife, razed his farm, and stabbed him thirty-two times. According to [[urban legend]]s, Achebe survived by selling his soul to [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and went on to kill everyone who had ever interacted with his wife, destroying the homes of his victims and stabbing each one thirty-two times.<ref name ="BP3">{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Rich S and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Original Sin|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #3|date = January 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

After attending [[Yale Law School]], Achebe returned to Ghudazan where he helped instigate an [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic war]].<ref name ="BP3"/> When [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] established a [[refugee camp]] on the outskirts of [[Wakanda]] for those seeking asylum from the conflict, Achebe infiltrated it and exacerbated unease between the refugees and the Wakandans. Achebe then lured Black Panther out of Wakanda by corrupting one of his charities situated in America and by having the organization's "[[poster child]]" killed.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Client|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #1|date = November 1998|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Avalon Color|letterer = Rich S and Comicraft's Siobhan Hanna|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Invasion|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #2|date = December 1998|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

While Black Panther is preoccupied in the United States, Achebe leads an uprising in the African refugee camp and appoints himself head of the [[provisional government]] that overtakes Wakanda.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Mark Texeira|inker = Mark Texeira|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Richard S and Comicraft Letters|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = The Price|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #4|date = February 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Achebe subjects Wakanda to his deranged decrees, which worsen after his connection to Mephisto is severed by the cunning of Black Panther. Achebe's forces weaken without Mephisto's backing, though he retains his position as [[prime minister]] by promising to share power with Black Panther's stepmother, Ramonda, so long as Black Panther remains in America.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Christopher Priest|penciller = Vince Evans|inker = Vince Evans|colorist = Brian Haberlin|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti|story = Lord of the Damned|title = Black Panther|volume = 3|issue = #5|date = March 1999|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Achebe later tries to assassinate Black Panther by having his allies in the United States place a bomb on a bystander and a remotely controllable [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] on Black Panther's ex-fianc√©e, Monica.

==Powers and abilities==

Along with being empowered by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], Achebe is a very psychological and manipulative villain. A rebel anarchist, brilliant schemer, top tier political strategist, and planner. These attributes are slightly weakened by his mental instability and obsessive detestation of Black Panther.<ref name = "EoftS"/> He is also a highly skilled acrobat with exceptional agility.
