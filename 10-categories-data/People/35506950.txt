In season 4, while trying to identify murder victim Mariana Wallace, Rusty meets her brother Gustavo "Gus" Wallace who becomes romantically interested in him. After initially resisting Gus' advances due to distance and his fears of Gus no longer liking him if they date, Rusty enters into a relationship with Gus. Despite this, Rusty is shown to be uncomfortable with being gay, shying away from holding Gus' hand in public which causes them some problems. In "Off the Wagon", Rusty tells Gus he loves him for the first time and intends to spend his life with Gus, something that Gus reciprocates.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>

|[[Paul Narita]] || [[Christopher Sean]] || ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' || The first love of long-time gay character Sonny Kiriakis (one half of Days's gay "super-couple" Will and Sonny, the first married gay couple on a US daytime soap) and a successful professional baseball player, Paul came to Salem in November, 2014. He was immediately loved by fans and became part of a frontburner storyline that included his coming out, discovering that he is the son of [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)]] (an iconic long-term character) and a love triangle between him, Sonny and Will Horton, which also involved the newly introduced fourth gay character on the show, Derrick. Unfortunately, since head writers [[Christopher Whitesell]] and [[Gary Tomlin]] were replaced by Josh Griffith and Dena Higley, with their material starting to air in mid-August, Paul has appeared only a handful of times, and the frontburner storyline involving him, Sonny, Will and Derrick was axed by the new regime, which involved the killing of the gay legacy character Will, which led to a huge backlash from fans right before the show's 50th anniversary.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>
