'''Areius''' or '''Areius Didymus''' or '''Arius''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄρειος}}) was an [[Alexandria]]n philosopher of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] or [[Stoicism|Stoic]] schools who lived in the 1st century BCE. He was the "personal philosopher" of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] for a time.

Augustus esteemed him so highly that after the conquest of Alexandria, he declared that he spared the city chiefly for the sake of Areius.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Ant.'' 80, Apophth. p. 207</ref><ref>[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' 51.16</ref><ref>[[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], ''Epistulae'' 51</ref><ref>[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' xiv. p.670</ref> Modern scholars disagree over whether this was the actual reason Augustus spared the city, as at the same time Augustus claimed he was also doing it to honor the memory of [[Alexander the Great]], and some scholars also suggest that he did it to curry favor with that city's elite.<ref name="ae">{{cite book | last =Capponi | first =Livia | title =Augustan Egypt: The Creation of a Roman Province | publisher =[[Routledge]] | series =Studies in Classics | date =2005 | pages =87, 179 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=JhYfDAAAQBAJ | isbn = 9781135873691 | accessdate=2018-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last =Gurval | first =Robert Alan | title =Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War | publisher =[[University of Michigan Press]] | date =1998 | pages =70-71 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qVd4vuhkVqcC | isbn = 9780472084890 | accessdate=2018-01-15}}</ref>

Areius as well as his two sons, Dionysius and Nicanor, are said to have instructed Augustus himself in philosophy, and Areius for a time resided directly within Augustus's household.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', ''Augustus'' 89</ref><ref name="rs">{{cite book | last =Arnold | first =Edward Vernon | title =Roman Stoicism: Being Lectures on the History of the Stoic Philosophy with Special Reference to Its Development Within the Roman Empire | publisher =The University Press | date =1911 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/romanstoicismbei00arno/page/110 110]-111 | url =https://archive.org/details/romanstoicismbei00arno | accessdate=2018-01-15}}</ref> He is frequently mentioned by the philosopher [[Themistius]], who says that Augustus valued Areius not less than [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], who is commonly thought of as Augustus's confidant and right-hand man (though it must be mentioned that Themistius was writing four hundred years after the fact).<ref>[[Themistius]], ''Orations'' v. p. 63d. viii. p. 108b. x. p. 130b. xiii. p. 173c. ed. Petav. 1684</ref>

Others sources state that he was offered the post of ''[[Praefectus]]'' or governor of Egypt, but that Areius turned Augustus down in order to take a post in the province of [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], though modern scholars have some doubt about this anecdote (primarily because there are no other examples of anyone being "offered" a post by Augustus and having turned him down). It has been suggested that this story was state propaganda to justify Augustus's removal of Areius from the province of Egypt and installation of [[Cornelius Gallus]] as Praefectus.<ref name="ae"/>

Areius was succeeded as "personal philosopher" of Augustus by the philosopher [[Theon (1st century BC)|Theon]].<ref name="rs"/> From [[Quintilian]]  it appears that Areius also taught or wrote on rhetoric.<ref>[[Quintilian]], ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]'' 2.15.36, 3.1.16</ref><ref>[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], ''[[De Consolatione ad Marciam]]'' 4</ref><ref>[[Claudius Aelianus]], ''Varia Historia'' 12.25</ref><ref>[[Suda]], Ἄρειος, Θέων</ref>
