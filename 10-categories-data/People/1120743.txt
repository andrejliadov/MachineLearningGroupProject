'''''Bachelorette''''' (/ˌbætʃələˈrɛt/)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/bachelorette|title=bachelorette noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes &#124; Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}</ref> is a term used in [[American English]] for a [[Single person|single]], unmarried woman.  The term is derived from the word ''[[bachelor]]'', and is often used by journalists, editors of popular magazines, and some individuals. "Bachelorette" was famously the term used to refer to female contestants on the old ''[[The Dating Game]]'' TV show and, more recently, ''[[The Bachelorette]]''.

In older English, the female counterpart term to "bachelor" was "[[spinster]]".  However, this has acquired negative connotations and, when used now, tends to imply that the unmarried woman is too old to find a husband and have children.<ref>"A woman still unmarried; ''esp.'' one beyond the usual age of marriage, an old maid" — definition 2b, entry "Spinster", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'' 1st edition.</ref>  A bachelorette may have previously been in a relationship.

In [[Canada]], the term ''bachelorette'' also refers to a small bachelor apartment (an apartment with only one large room serving as a bedroom and living room plus a separate bathroom—i.e. a [[studio apartment]]).

==Derivation==
The more proper [[neologism]] would be ''bacheloress'', since the ''[[Wiktionary:-ess|-ess]]'' suffix is the standard English suffix denoting a female subject, while ''[[Wiktionary:-ette|-ette]]'' is a French-origin diminutive suffix, mainly used to denote something is smaller in size.  However, in American English the ''-ess'' suffix is only marginally [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] productive, and the ''-ette'' suffix can indicate a feminine version of a noun without a change in size (though many such words in ''-ette'' were intended to be jocular when they were first coined). The ''-ess'' suffix is also slowly falling into disuse in the English language due to attempts to neutralize professional terms; it is therefore less commonly applied to new terms nowadays.

==Reasons for use==

An archaic English term for a woman who has never married is a [[spinster]], while a woman who is [[divorce]]d is a divorcée, and a woman whose spouse has died is a [[widow]]. "Spinster" often implied that the woman was older than the age when most women traditionally marry and that she would probably never marry; a more derogatory term was "[[old maid]]".

Typically, a young person (male or female) who has never been married is said to be "single" or "never married".

The term "bachelorette" may indicate a woman who is unmarried by choice, the counterpart to the term "[[bachelor]]".
