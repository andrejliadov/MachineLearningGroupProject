Ermes was born in [[Colloredo di Monte Albano]], [[Friaul]]. He was educated at [[Medici]]'s court in [[Florence]] as page of Greatduke [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]], and entered the service of Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] during the [[Thirty Years War]] as a Cuirassiers' Officier, at the orders of his uncle, Field Marschall Rudolf von Colloredo Mels und Wallsee, Governor of [[Prague]], of the [[Republic of Venice]] as a Cavalry Colonel and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold I]]. In the latter part of his life Ermes returned to his homeland to focus on writing poetry, most of which centers on the theme of love.

Ermes wrote over 200 [[sonnet]]s, in both [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. He used the ''koinè'' from [[San Daniele]], which would become the most notable literary language and the basis of today's standard Friulian.
