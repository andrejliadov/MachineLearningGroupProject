==Early life==
Don Stewart was born in the [[San Francisco Bay]] area of California.<ref name="Burke 2014">{{cite web | last=Burke | first=Owen James | title=Rest in Peace, Captain Don Stewart: Early Pioneer of Diving and Reef Conservation Dies at 88 | website=The Scuttlefish | date=2014-06-04 | url=http://thescuttlefish.com/2014/06/rest-and-peace-captain-don-stewart-early-pioneer-of-diving-and-reef-conservation-dies-at-88/ | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> His mother died when he was a young boy, and was raised by his father. He was diagnosed as [[dyslexic]], dropped out of high school and at age 17, joined the [[United States Navy]] shortly after the Japanese had bombed [[Pearl Harbor]].<ref name="Legends 2008">{{cite web | title=Captain Don: Underwater Environmentalist, Resort Owner, and Writer | website=Legends of Scuba Diving | date=2008-05-05 | url=http://www.internationallegendsofdiving.com/FeaturedLegends/captain_don_bio.htm | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> He signed up for medical training while in the Navy, and by age 19, was serving as [[Chief Medical Officer]] of the [[USS Persistent (MSO-491)]].<ref name="Burke 2014" /> He was later diagnosed with [[lymphatic cancer]] and was discharged from the Navy.<ref name="Burke 2014" /><ref name="Travels">{{cite web | title=Don Stewart, The Man Who Made Bonaire Famous | last= O'Keefe |first=Tim | date=2010-11-26 | url=https://www.travelswithtimokeefe.com/2010/11/the-man-who-made-bonaire-famous/ | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref>

==Arrival on Bonaire==
Stewart was penniless when he first arrived on Bonaire in May 1962 but quite eager to make things happen.<ref name="Stinapa">{{cite web | title=Captain Don | website=Stinapa Bonaire National Parks Foundation | url=https://stinapabonaire.org/bonaire-national/captain-don/ | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> A friend once quipped in an interview that, "no matter what Don tells you, the truth is he stayed in Bonaire because that's where his ship sank".<ref name="Gazette"/>

Stewart was instrumental in opening Zeebad, Bonaire's first hotel and dive operation.<ref name="Gazette">"Joel Simon", Bonaire's bountiful reefs", ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' (November 23, 1996), p. I-1, 3.</ref> It was built on property that was once a German detention camp, and over time, the hotel grew to become Divi Flamingo Beach Resort & Casino.<ref name="UFDC-Reporter" /> In the late 1960s, [[Irwin Hasen]], who was a cartoonist with the [[Chicago Tribune Syndicate]] at the time, had created the cartoon character "[[Dondi]]" which was published daily in more than a hundred newspapers. During a trip to Bonaire, Hasen met Captain Don, and created a segment in the Dondi comic-strip that illustrated Captain Don teaching Dondi how to scuba dive, and preserve the coral reefs.{{r|ScubaNash|p=36}}<ref name="Fine 2015">{{cite web | last=Fine | first=John Christopher | title=Dondi Creator Irwin Hasen’s Final Interview | website=Observer | date=2015-03-17 | url=https://observer.com/2015/03/dondi-creator-irwin-hasens-final-interview/ | access-date=2020-12-10}}</ref><ref name="Legends of Scuba Diving">{{cite web | title=Captain Don: Underwater Environmentalist, Resort Owner, and Writer (Page 3) | website=Legends of Scuba Diving | url=http://www.internationallegendsofdiving.com/FeaturedLegends/captain_don_bio-page-3.htm | access-date=2020-12-10}}</ref>

==Significance to Bonaire==
After Stewart arrived on Bonaire, he realized the importance of protecting its fragile ecosystem, both above and below the ocean. He introduced permanent mooring systems to protect the island's fringing reefs, and spearheaded a campaign that banned spearfishing and tropical fish collecting on Bonaire. He named most of the dive sites on the island, and in 1976, founded a resort hotel of his own, and named it Captain Don's Habitat. He was inducted into the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in 2005.<ref name="CIDOT">{{cite web | author=CIDOT | title=The International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in the Cayman Islands | website=Your Holiday, Your Cayman &#124; Best Tropical Getaway in the Caribbean | url=https://www.visitcaymanislands.com/en-us/isdhf/isdhf-bios/capt-don-stewart | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref><ref name="translate.google.com">{{cite web | title=Google Translate | website=translate.google.com | url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=nl&u=https://www.beautiful-bonaire.nl/natuur/bonaire-national-marine-park-captain-don-steward.php&prev=search&pto=aue | access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref> One of his memorable quotes when greeting scuba divers to the island was simply, "Take only pictures and memories, leave only bubbles.”<ref name="UFDC-Reporter" /> He was quite serious about not touching the corals or harming the fish, which led to the founding of Bonaire Marine Park.<ref name="Stinapa" />
