In [[law]], an '''alien''' is a [[person]] who is not a [[citizenship|citizen]] or [[nationality|national]] of a given [[country]],<ref name="Black's" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://law.academic.ru/171/alien |title=alien |publisher=law.academic.ru |work=[[Merriam-Webster|Webster’s Dictionary of Law]] |year=1996 |access-date=August 17, 2018}}</ref> although definitions and terminology differ to some degree depending upon the [[continent]] or region of the world. The term "alien" is synonymous with "[[foreign national]]".<ref name="foreign national">{{uscsub|52|30121|b}} (explaining that "the term 'foreign national' means—.... (2) an individual who is not a citizen of the United States or a national of the United States (as defined in section 1101(a)(22) of title 8) and who is not [[lawful permanent residents (United States)|lawfully admitted for permanent residence]], as defined by section 1101(a)(20) of title 8.").</ref>

==Lexicology==
The term "alien" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''alienus'', meaning [[stranger]], foreign, [[Etymology|etym.]] "belonging (somewhere) else".{{fact|date=May 2018}} Similar terms to "alien" in this context include ''foreigner'' and ''lander''.<ref>Van Houtum, Henk.

Different countries around the world use varying terms for aliens. The following are several types of aliens:
* a '''legal alien''' is a [[foreign national]] who is permitted by law to be in the host country. This is a very broad category which includes [[permanent residents]], [[temporary resident]]s, and [[travel visa|visa]] holders or foreign visitors.
** a '''resident alien''' is a person who has permission by the government to reside and work in the country.<ref name=immigrant>{{uscsub|8|1101|a|20}} ("The term '[[lawful permanent residents (United States)|lawfully admitted for permanent residence]]' means the status of having been lawfully [[wikt:accord#English|accorded]] the [[wikt:privilege#English|privilege]] of residing [[wikt:permanently#English|permanently]] in the United States '''''as an immigrant''''' ....") (emphasis added).</ref>
** a '''nonresident alien''' is a foreign national who is visiting a country as a tourist (e.g., for pleasure, for studies, on business, to receive medical treatment, to attend a conference or a meeting, as entertainers or sportspeople, and so forth).{{fact|date=May 2018}}
* an '''illegal alien''' is any foreign national inside a country where he or she has no legal right to be.<ref name="illegal alien"/> It covers a foreign national who has entered the country through illegal [[wikt:migration#English|migration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/immigration-terms-and-definitions-involving-aliens|title=Immigration Terms and Definitions Involving Aliens |publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) |access-date=July 3, 2016 |location=United States}}</ref> In some countries it also covers an alien who entered the country lawfully but subsequently fallen out of that legal status.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/08/07/dhs-foreigners-overstayed-visas-2017/924316002/ |title=Homeland Security: More than 600,000 foreigners overstayed U.S. visas in 2017 |publisher=USA Today |access-date=2018-10-16|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/dhs-700k-plus-overstayed-us-visas-last-year/4517849.html |title=DHS: 700K-plus Overstayed US Visas Last Year  |publisher=Voice of America (VOA) |access-date=2018-10-16|date=August 7, 2018}}</ref>

==Common law jurisdictions==
{{See also|History of British nationality law#Early English and British nationality law}}
An "alien" in [[English law]] denoted any person born outside of the monarch's dominions and who did not owe allegiance to the monarch. Aliens were not allowed to own [[real property|land]] and were subject to different taxes to [[British subject|subjects]].<ref>William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' (1753), Book 1, Chapter 10</ref> This idea was passed on in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] to other common law jurisdictions.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], citizenship is defined in the [[Australian nationality law]]. Non-citizens in Australia are permanent residents, temporary residents, or illegal residents (technically called "unlawful non-citizens").<ref>[http://www.cccs.law.unimelb.edu.au/download.cfm?DownloadFile=98E80E9C Key Issue 5. Citizenship Fact Sheet 5.2 Citizenship in Australia] Retrieved 2012-03-05.</ref> Most non-citizens (including those who lack citizenship documents) traveling to Australia must obtain a [[visa policy of Australia|visa]] prior to travel. The only exceptions to the rule are holders of [[New Zealand]] passports and citizenship, who may apply for a visa on arrival according to the [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/mig/report/olympics/Chap2.pdf | title=Australia's Visitor and Temporary Entry Provisions | publisher=Joint Standing Committee on Migration, Parliament of Australia | date=27 September 1999 | access-date=20 July 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629154251/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/mig/report/olympics/Chap2.pdf | archive-date=June 29, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2020, in ''[[Love v Commonwealth]]'', the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled that [[Aboriginal Australians]] (as defined in ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)]]'') cannot be considered aliens under the [[Constitution of Australia]], regardless of whether they were born in Australia or hold Australian citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/high-court-rules-aboriginal-australians-cannot-be-aliens-under-the-constitution |title=High Court rules Aboriginal Australians cannot be 'aliens' under the constitution |work=SBS News |date=11 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=karp>{{cite web | last=Karp | first=Paul | title=High court rules Aboriginal Australians are not 'aliens' under the constitution and cannot be deported | website=the Guardian | date=11 February 2020 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/11/high-court-rules-aboriginal-australians-are-not-aliens-under-the-constitution-and-cannot-be-deported | access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=byrne>{{cite web | last=Byrne | first=Elizabeth | last2=Robertson | first2=Josh | title=Man released from detention as High Court rules Aboriginal people cannot be deported | website=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=11 February 2020 | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-11/high-court-rules-aboriginal-people-cant-be-deported/11953012 | access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref>

===Canada===
In Canada, the term "alien" is not used in federal statues. Instead, the term "[[foreign national]]" serves as its equivalent and is found in legal documents. The [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]] defines "foreign national" as "a person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident, and includes a stateless person."<ref>[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/page-1.html#h-2 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (S.C. 2001, c. 27)]</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|British Nationality Act}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[British Nationality Act 1981|British Nationality Act of 1981]] defines an alien as a person who is not a [[British citizen]], a citizen of Ireland, a [[Commonwealth citizen]], or a [[British protected person]].<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/section/51 section 51], British Nationality Act 1981</ref> The [[Aliens Act 1905|Aliens Act of 1905]], the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914|British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of 1914]] and the [[Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919|Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act of 1919]] were all products of the turbulence in the early part of the 20th century.

The usage of the term "alien" dates back to 1798, when it was used in the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=16 |title=Alien and Sedition Acts |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> Although the INA provides no overarching explicit definition of the term "illegal alien", it is mentioned in a number of provisions under title 8.<ref name="illegal alien">See, e.g., {{uscsub|8|1252c|a|1}}; {{uscsub|8|1330|b|3|A|iii}}; {{uscsub|8|1356|r|3|ii}}; {{uscsub|8|1365|b}} ("An illegal alien ... is any alien ... who is in the United States unlawfully...."); {{uscsub|8|1366}}.</ref> Several provisions even mention the term "unauthorized alien".<ref>{{uscsub|8|1324a|h|3}}</ref> According to PolitiFact, the term "illegal alien" occurs in federal law, but does so scarcely.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2018/may/09/steve-mccraw/illegal-alien-legal-term-federal-law/|title=Is 'illegal alien' a term in federal law?|website=@politifact|language=en|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> PolitiFact opines that, "where the term does appear, it’s undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies."<ref name=":0" /> 

Because the U.S. law says that a [[corporate personhood|corporation is a person]], the term alien is not limited to natural humans because what are colloquially called foreign corporations are technically called alien corporations. Because corporations are creations of local state law, a foreign corporation is an out-of-state corporation.

There are a multitude of unique and highly complex U.S. domestic tax laws and regulations affecting the U.S. tax residency of foreign nationals, both nonresident aliens and resident aliens, in addition to income tax and social security tax treaties and Totalization Agreements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.protaxconsulting.com/foreign-nationals-nonresident-resident-aliens/ |title=Foreign Nationals: Non-Resident Aliens and Resident Aliens |publisher=Protax Consulting Services}}</ref>

In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, etc.), many non-natives (foreigners) have lived in the region since birth or since independence. However, these Arab states of the Persian Gulf do not easily grant citizenship to the non-natives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/10/10/uk-emirates-citizenship-feature-idUKBRE99904J20131010|title=Call to naturalise some expats stirs anxiety in the UAE|first=Mahmoud|last=Habboush}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/482086|title=Say no to expats calling for Saudi citizenship|date=November 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfbusiness.com/2014/01/gcc-citizenship-debate-a-place-to-call-home/#.VKfqDxA4Lw8|title=GCC Citizenship Debate: A Place To Call Home - Gulf Business|date=January 5, 2014}}</ref>
