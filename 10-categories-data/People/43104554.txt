As she made these dresses, her cousin, Tom Marotta, who was at that time Vice President of [[Saks Fifth Avenue]]'s couture department, was intrigued by her designs and had Joan introduce her dresses to the store. This Children's Boutique owned by Linda Berman<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-06-23 | url=https://www.manta.com/c/mmflttv/the-children-s-boutique-inc | title=The Children's Boutique Inc | website=manta.com}}</ref> started to buy her self-sewn dresses, which started off her career. For the first couple of years of sewing dresses, she only worked on them herself, but as her children's dresses got introduced into her boutiques she began to hire seamstress. As she began to become more known, her dresses were now in Cerutti's<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/magazine/children-s-fashion-sizzling-summertime-wear.html|title=Children's Fashion; Sizzling Summertime Wear|last=Skinner|first=Andrea|date=1989-03-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-06-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> on Madison Avenue, New York. After this well-known store bought her clothing, more and more companies wanted her dresses, which led to her name getting out there. She was one of the few stylist for high style clothing for children. Calabrese also made women's handbags, but was more inspired to do children's clothing and continued on with couture for kids.
