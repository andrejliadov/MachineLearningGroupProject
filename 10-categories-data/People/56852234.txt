Women have been active in the [[cannabis industry]], [[cannabis legalization]] and [[cannabis rights]], and related issues.

According to some sources, the cannabis industry is a particularly woman-friendly environment and has a higher percentage of women than many other industries for several reasons. Cited reasons include its founding by "liberally minded rebels" less bound by [[gender conformity]]; and its being relatively new and "unhampered by established business networks" closed to women,<ref name=Shekhtman2017/> and the lack of [[glass ceiling]]s in some parts of the industry, especially "support" activities such as finance and investment,<ref name=Kavilanz2016/> marketing, delivery,<ref name=toast/> and agronomy research.<ref name=Jan2016/>
Women comprised over 60% of executives in [[cannabis product testing]] laboratories in 2015, the highest rate of women executives in the cannabis industry.<ref>{{citation|newspaper=MJ Business Daily|title=Chart of the Week: Women Hold 36% of Executive-Level Positions in the Cannabis Industry|author=Becky Olson |date=October 12, 2015|url=https://mjbizdaily.com/chart-of-the-week-women-holding-more-seats-in-the-executive-suite-at-cannabis-companies/}}</ref>
