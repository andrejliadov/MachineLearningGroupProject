'''Native Esperanto speakers''' ([[Esperanto]]: ''denaskuloj'' or ''denaskaj esperantistoj'') are people who have acquired [[Esperanto]] as one of their [[native language]]s.  As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.<ref>Corsetti, Renato (1996).

Language Problems and Language Planning 20: 3, 263-73</ref><ref name="Bergen" /> Estimates from associations indicate that there were around 1,000 Esperanto-speaking families, involving perhaps 2,000 children in 2004.<ref name="Corsetti"/> According to a 2019 synthesis {{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} of all the estimates made, they would be between several hundred and 2000, and would compose between <1% and 4.5% of the Esperanto community.  In all known cases, speakers are natively [[Multilingualism|bilingual]], or multilingual, raised in both Esperanto and either the local national language or the native language of their parents. In all but a handful of cases, it was the father who used Esperanto with the child. In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.<ref name=Bergen>Benjamin Bergen (2001), "[http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/papers/NEJCL.pdf Nativization processes in L1 Esperanto]", ''Journal of Child Language'' 28:575–595 {{doi|10.1017/S0305000901004779}}</ref><ref name="lindstedt">{{Cite journal

Raising children in Esperanto occurred early in the history of the language, notably with the five children of [[Montagu C. Butler|Montagu Butler]] (1884–1970).  Because of this, some families have passed Esperanto on to their children for several generations.<ref>For example, the Klünder family [http://blogs.transparent.com/esperanto/3rd-gen-native-esperanto-speaker-nils/ (interview with a second<!--not third! see the comment by his father-->-generation native Esperanto-speaker], ''Esperanto Language Blog'', 2013 Jun 13)</ref> Also notable are young Holocaust victim [[Petr Ginz]],<ref>Ginz, Petr.

Esperanto is not the primary language of any geographic region, outside of temporary gatherings (such as conventions like the [[World Congress of Esperanto]]) and isolated offices (such as the [[World Esperanto Association]]'s central office in [[Rotterdam]]). Consequently, native speakers have limited opportunity to meet one another except where meetings are specially arranged.  For this reason, many parents consider it important to bring their children regularly to Esperanto conventions such as the annual "Renkontiĝo de Esperanto-familioj" (or "Esperantistaj familioj"; REF, since 1979). Similarly, the annual {{Interlanguage link|Children's Congress of Esperanto|eo|Internacia Infana Kongreseto|nl|Internacia Infana Kongreseto}} happens alongside the largest Esperanto convention, the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] (''Universala Kongreso'').

==Grammatical characteristics==
{{see also|Esperanto grammar}}
The Esperanto of native-speaking children differs from the standard Esperanto spoken by their parents.  In some cases this is due to interference from their other native language (the [[adstrate]]), but in others it appears to be an effect of [[language acquisition|acquisition]].

Bergen (2001) found the following patterns in a study of eight native-speaking children, aged 6 to 14, who were bilingual in Hebrew (two siblings), Slovak (two siblings), French, Swiss German, Russian, and Croatian.<ref name="Bergen" />

*Phonological reduction (usually to [[schwa]]) of vowels in common grammatical suffixes and one-syllable grammatical words. This occurred about 5% of the time.  The reduced grammatical suffixes were mostly the ''-o'' of nouns and ''-as'' of present-tense verbs, but occasionally also the ''-a'' of adjectives.  Reduced grammatical words included personal pronouns (which all end in ''i''), the article ''la'' 'the', and prepositions such as ''al'' 'to' and ''je'' (a generic preposition). The article ''la'' was sometimes omitted with the Slavic speakers, as might be expected as a contact effect. 
*Proper nouns were generally unassimilated, either to Esperanto grammatical suffixes or to stress patterns.  Proper nouns are common exceptions to grammatical rules in many languages, and this pattern is common among L2-speakers of Esperanto as well.  However, stress was also observed to vary in native words, for example ''nómiĝas'' 'is/am called' and ''ámikoj'' 'friends' (stress expected on the ''i'' in both cases).
*Children were not observed to use compound tenses (''esti'' + a participle) or aspectual affixes (''ek-, -iĝi, -adi, re-, el-'') on verbal roots.  Except for simple passives, the parents were not observed to use compound tenses either.  However, they did use aspectual affixes (at least in the formal context of Bergen's interviews), but nonetheless the children did not use such affixes even when their other language was Slavic, where aspectual affixes are important.  The closest thing to such forms that the children were observed to use were ''fini'' + verb 'stop doing something', ''komenci'' + verb 'start doing something', ''ankoraŭ'' 'still', and ''kaj poste'' 'and then'; but even then, usage was not as common as equivalents in the adstrate language.  ''-Iĝi'' was, however, used on adjectival roots:
::''Malheliĝas kaj ili ankoraŭ estas ĉe la plaĝo.'' – It's becoming dark and they are still on the beach.
*The word order was mostly [[subject-verb-object|SVO]]. [[object-subject-verb|OSV]] order was also attested, but half of all instances were with the Swiss German-speaking child, and Swiss German allows preposing the object.
*Related to the fixed word order, there is evidence that the [[accusative case]] has become redundant.  Usage closely reflects the role of case in the adstrate language, being used only where consistent with the other language, but not always ever there.  Usage ranged from ≈100% with the Slovak-speaking children, to 0% with the French-speaking child,<ref>Bergen did not count the set expression ''saluton!'' 'hello!', which was used by all the children but involves no active grammar.</ref> despite the fact that the French mother consistently used the accusative case in her own speech.  Slovak has an accusative case on nouns, French does not.  Other children used the accusative in only some of the contexts required by standard Esperanto, largely reflecting usage in their other language.  There were other patterns to emerge as well. The Croatian child, for example, used the accusative only on personal pronouns immediately following a verb (underlined):
::''En la sepa, unu infano <u>prenis</u> lia'''n''' ŝtrumpo.'' (Standard: ''lia'''n''' ŝtrumpo'''n''') – At seven o'clock, a child <u>took</u> hi'''s''' sock.
:but
::''Poste li iris kaj poste li <u>prenis</u> en unu mano lia simio.'' (Standard: ''lia'''n''' simio'''n''') – Then he went and then he <u>took</u> in one hand his monkey.

Among children that do use the accusative, its usage may be regularized from adult usage, at least at young ages. For example, when a screw dropped out of a lock, a young (≤ 5-year-old) child said it ''malvenis la pordo'''n'''.'' Besides the novel use of ''mal-'' with ''veni'' 'to come' to mean 'come away from', the accusative is not used in adult speech for motion away, but only motion towards.  However, in this case the child generalized the usage of the accusative for direct objects.<ref name=Corsetti/>

Lindstedt, on the other hand, referencing Bergen's study, contends that "it is difficult to find convincing examples of changes introduced by the process of nativisation. All examples proposed seem rather to be due to (1) transfers from the children’s other native languages, (2) differences between the spoken and written register of Esperanto and, in some cases, (3) incomplete acquisition." Some of the features, such as phonological reduction, can be found in the speech of some fluent non-native speakers, while some other, such as the attrition of the accusative, are completely absent from the speech of some native-speaking children.<ref name="lindstedt"/>

==Word derivation==
{{see also|Esperanto vocabulary}}
Native-speaking children, especially at a young age, may coin words that do not exist in the speech of their parents, often for concepts for which Esperanto has a word they do not yet know, by exploiting the morphology of the language.  This is analogous to what adult speakers do for concepts where Esperanto lacks a word, and indicates that some of the grammatical alterations that adult learners may find difficult come easily to native-speaking children.  For example,<ref name=Corsetti>Corsetti, Pinto, & Tolomeo (2004) "[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/lplp/2004/00000028/00000003/art00003 Regularizing the regular]: The phenomenon of overregularization in Esperanto-speaking children", ''Language Problems & Language Planning,'' 28:3, pp. 261–282</ref>

*Antonyms in ''mal-''
:The prefix ''mal-'' is extremely productive, and children extend it beyond the usage they hear:
::''malmiksi'' 'to separate' (''miksi'' to mix)
::''malpluvi'' 'to stop raining' (''pluvi'' to rain)
::''malscias'' 'is ignorant of' (''scias'' knows)
::''malnuna'' 'past' (''nuna'' present)
::''malfari'' 'to break (un-make)' (''fari'' to make)
::''maltie'' 'here' (''tie'' there)
::''malstartas'' 'turn off (an engine)' (''startas'' 'starts', standard Esperanto ''ŝaltas'' 'switches on')
::''malĝustigis'' 'broke' (''ĝustigis'' repaired, made right)
::''malsandviĉiĝis'' 'became (a shape) which isn't a sandwich anymore' (''sandviĉ-iĝis'' 'became a sandwich', of a brother playing with cushions)
::''malstelita'' 'not surrounded by stars' (of the moon; from ''stelita'' 'starred')
::''malmateno'' 'evening' (''mateno'' morning)
::''malio'' 'nothing' (''io'' 'something'; standard Esperanto ''nenio'' 'nothing')
::''malinterne'' 'externally' (''interne'' internally)
::''malgraveda'' 'no longer pregnant' (''graveda'' pregnant)

*Containers in ''-ujo''
::''elektrujo'' 'a battery' (''elektro'' electricity)

*Tendencies in ''-ema''
::''ventrema'' 'fat' (tending to belly-ness, from ''ventro'' 'belly')

*Places in ''-ejo''
::''triciklejo'' 'a place for tricycles'

*Feminine in ''-ino''
::''penisino'' 'vagina' (''peniso'' penis)

*Instrument in ''-ilo''

::''buŝas'' 'kisses on the mouth' (''buŝo'' mouth)
::''langeti'' 'to give a little lick' (diminutive, from ''lango'' tongue)
::''dentumado'' 'activity with teeth' (''dento'' tooth, ''-umi'' doing something undefined with, ''-ado'' noun of action)
::''kuvi'' 'to have a bath' (''kuvo'' 'tub'; standard Esperanto ''bani sin'' 'to bathe oneself')
::''mukis'' '(my nose) was running' (''muko'' 'snot', by analogy with ''sangis'' 'bled', from ''sango'' 'blood')
::''literiĝas'' 'the letters are changing' ([[middle voice]], from ''litero'' 'letter (of the alphabet)')
::''ne seĝu sur la divano'' 'don't sit on the couch' (''seĝo'' 'chair'; standard Esperanto ''sidu'' 'sit')
::''muzi'' 'to museum' (from ''muzeo'' 'museum', misunderstood as ''muz-ejo'' 'a place for museuming')

*Verbs from adjectives
::''belos'' 'will be beautiful' (''bela'' 'beautiful'; found in poetry, but not usual in adult speech)
::''samante kiel mi'' 'being the same as me (you ...)' (''sama'' same)

*Adjectives from verbs
::''rida'' '(often) laughing' (''ridi'' 'to laugh'; standard Esperanto ''ridema'')

*Adjectives from nouns
::''ventuma'' 'making a breeze' (from ''ventum-ilo'' 'a fan')

*Compounds with prepositions
::''perblove'' 'by blowing' (''per'' 'via', ''blovi'' 'to blow')
::''mi superruliĝos vin'' 'I will roll over you' (an intransitive verb ending in ''-iĝos'' won't normally take an object in the accusative case, but here it is necessary because the preposition ''super'' 'over' has been moved to the verb ''rul'' 'roll'.  Without the suffix ''-iĝos'', however, the meaning would be a transitive 'I will roll you over'.)

*Adverbs from verbs
::''Ege halte, ege paŭze, ege salte'' 'very stoppingly, very pausingly, very jumpily'

*Adverbs from nouns and prepositions
::''Ene estas akve'' 'inside is wet' (''akvo'' 'water'; standard Esperanto is ''malseke'', an adverb being required because no specific thing is wet.)

*Nouns from adjectives
::''ludeblo'' 'the possibility of playing' (''ludi'' to play, ''-ebla'' -able)
