==Early life and education==
Aziz was born in [[Karachi]] in 1959 and grew up in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan.<ref name="TNS">{{cite news|url=https://thenewspaces.com/2016/03/07/making-the-impossible-possible-ashar-aziz/|title=Making the Impossible Possible: Ashar Aziz|work=The New Spaces|date=7 March 2016|accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://propakistani.pk/2016/09/22/pakistani-americans-cybersecurity-company-worth-2-43-billion-today/|title=This Pakistani-American’s Cybersecurity Company is Worth $2.43 Billion Today|first=Rehan|last=Ahmed|work=ProPakistani.pk|quote=Meet Ashar Aziz, a 57-year-old entrepreneur who entered Forbes’ Billionaire list two years back.

He graduated from MIT with a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering in 1981, followed by a Master of Science in computer science from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was also granted a [[Regents' and Chancellor's Scholarship|Regents' Fellowship]].<ref name="MIT"/><ref name="TNS"/>

==Career==
Aziz worked as an engineer at [[Sun Microsystems]] for twelve years, specialising in networking, [[network security]] and [[Systems design|system design]].<ref name="MIT"/><ref name="TNS"/> He also served as [[chief technology officer]] of the N1 program at Sun.<ref name="SE"/> In 1999, he founded his first startup company Terraspring Inc., which focused on [[Data center security|data center]] automization and [[virtualization]]. The business was bought by Sun Microsystems in 2002, following the [[stock market crash]] of 2001.<ref name="MIT"/><ref name="TNS"/>

At around the same time, Aziz began studying the risks stemming from highly stealthy and self-propagating [[malware]] systems, and the threats they posed to future cybersecurity infrastructures – a problem he first discovered in the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] archives. In 2004, he founded FireEye, having become convinced that he could provide the solutions to these emerging cybersecurity challenges.<ref name="MIT"/> He initially worked out of his home for 80 to 100 hours a week, with only $4,000 in his personal savings.<ref name="TNS"/> Initially, most of his technical team comprised engineers and technology professionals he knew from his previous startup.<ref name="TNS"/> Based in [[Milpitas, California]], the company today provides both software and [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based anti-malware products.<ref name="Forbes"/> According to the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, "the core of the FireEye platform is a virtual execution engine, complemented by dynamic threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber attacks in real time and across the different stages of an attack life cycle."<ref name="MIT"/> Describing FireEye in 2012, Aziz stated that the company's objective was to strengthen the "security and key infrastructure that is pervasive across financial, government and [[credit card]] infrastructure to protect from three very important threats: crime, espionage, and warfare."<ref name="MIT"/> Aziz served as FireEye's chief executive officer from 2004 to 2012, as well as remaining its [[chief strategy officer]], chief technology officer and board vice chairman.<ref name="MIT"/><ref name="Forbes"/><ref name="SE"/>
