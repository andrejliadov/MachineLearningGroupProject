'''[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]'''<ref>'''known as Charles I in Spain and Austria, Charles II in Burgundy and Sicily, Charles III in Flanders, Charles IV in Naples'''</ref> was the heir of four of Europe's leading royal houses.  He first inherited the 
[[Burgundian Netherlands]], which came from his paternal grandmother, [[Mary of Burgundy]]. Charles was then the first sole [[List of Spanish monarchs|monarch of Spain]], inheriting the kingdoms first united by his maternal grandparents, [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (the [[Catholic Monarchs]]). Finally, on the death of his paternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], he inherited the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands in [[Austria]].  His [[coat of arms]], representing much of the land he inherited, is [[blazon]]ed as follows:

{{cquote|''[[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV grand-quarterly i and iv great-grand-quarterly 1 and 4 [[gules]] a three towered castle [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] [[Mortar (masonry)|masoned]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and ajouré [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] (for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]), 2 and 3 [[argent]] a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] [[Lion (heraldry)#Positions|rampant]] [[purpure]] crowned Or [[List of heraldic charges#Attitude of animals|langued]] and armed gules (for [[Kingdom of León|Leon]]), ii [[Division of the field|per pale]], dexter [[Division of the field|per fess]], in chief Or four [[Pale (heraldry)|pallets]] gules (for [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a [[cross]], [[saltire]], and [[Ordinary (heraldry)#Subordinaries|orle]] of chains linked together Or and a centre point [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister party per pale argent a [[cross potent]] and four crosslets Or  impaling [[Variation of the field|barry]] of eight gules and argent (for [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]), iii per pale, dexter per fess, in chief Or four pallets gules (for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]), in base gules a cross, saltire, and orle of chains linked together Or and a centre point vert (for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]), sinister [[Division of the field|per saltire]], 1 and 4 Or four pallets gules, 2 and 3 argent an [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle displayed]] sable (for [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]); II and III grand-quarterly, i gules a [[fess]] argent (for [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]]), ii azure [[Variation of the field#Semé|semy-de-lis]] Or a [[bordure]] [[Compone|compony]] argent and gules (for [[House of Valois-Burgundy|new Burgundy]]), iii [[Variation of the field|bendy]] of six Or and azure a bordure gules (for [[House of Burgundy|old Burgundy]]), iv sable a lion rampant Or langued and armed gules (for [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]]), overall at the fess point of the quarter an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon]] Or a lion rampant sable armed and langued gules (for [[Counts of Flanders|Flanders]]) [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] argent an eagle displayed gules, armed, beaked, and langued Or (for [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]]); enté en point argent a [[pomegranate]] proper seeded gules, supported, sculpted and slipped vert (for [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]]).''

The motto, [[Plus ultra (motto)|PLVS VLTRA]] or [[Plus Oultre|PLVS OVLTRE]], wraps around the columns.''

The first and fourth quarters represents holdings derived from the Spanish crowns:  that is, the quartered arms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] themselves quartered with the quartered arms of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sicily]]. After 1520 the Aragon/Sicily quartering also incorporated the arms of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Kingdom_of_Naples#Aragonese_and_Spanish_Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], and [[Navarre]].

The second and third quarters represents holdings derived from Charles's Austrian and Burgundian inheritance: these quarters shows further quartering of [[Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy]], [[House of Valois-Burgundy]], and the [[Duchy of Brabant]], with the escutcheon in the middle showing [[Flanders]] on the left and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] on the right.

The [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] [[pomegranate]] is represented at the bottom between the two.

==The Burgundian Inheritance and the Order of the Golden Fleece==
In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] had been conquered and annexed by France. In the same year, [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary "the Rich"]], the [[Charles the Bold|last Burgundian duke]]'s only child, had married Charles' grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance: although the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of [[Duke of Burgundy]] and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the [[Low Countries]] and the [[County of Burgundy|Free County of Burgundy]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  They often used the term [[Burgundy (disambiguation)|Burgundy]] to refer to it until the late 18th century, when the [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were lost to the [[France|French Republic]].  Although Charles V had inherited the grand mastership of numerous orders, the only order which he habitually wore and awarded was that of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]].
