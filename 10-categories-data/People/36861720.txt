'''Abdallah al-Battal''' ({{lang-ar|عبدالله البطال||Abdallah the Hero}}; died in 740) was a Muslim Arab commander in the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]] of the early 8th century, participating in several of the campaigns launched by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Historical facts about his life are sparse, but an extensive pseudo-historical and legendary tradition grew around him after his death, and he became a famous figure in both Arabic and later Turkish [[epic literature]] as {{transl|ar|[[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Battal Ghazi]]}}.

== Biography ==
Nothing is known of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later accounts claim that he hailed from [[Antioch]] or [[Damascus]], and that he was a {{transl|ar|[[mawla]]}} of the [[Umayyad]] family. He is also given various {{transl|ar|[[kunya (Arabic)|kunya]]}}, Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn, by which he is usually known.<ref name="EI2">Canard (1960), pp. 1002–1003</ref><ref name="EI3">Athamina (2011)</ref> The use of the {{transl|ar|[[nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]}} of {{transl|ar|al-Antaqi}} ("of Antioch") rather than a [[Arab tribes|tribal affiliation]] suggests that he may not have been of Arab origin; in this context, his name "[[Abdallah]]" further suggests that he was a convert to Islam, as this name (meaning "servant of Allah") was often given to new converts in early Islamic times.<ref name="EI3"/> [[Khalid Yahya Blankinship]] suggested that he might be the same person as a certain "Amr" recorded by the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] in the [[Siege of Nicaea (727)|Nicaea campaign]] of 727, and hence that "Amr" could be his actual personal name or a [[patronymic]] (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively "Abdallah" could simply be an honorific.<ref>Blankinship (1994), p. 314 (Note 20)</ref>

Arab accounts from the 10th century place al-Battal alongside [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] during the latter's [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|unsuccessful siege]] of [[Constantinople]] in 717–718, but as the Arab accounts of the siege are semi-legendary, it is impossible to know if this report contains any truth.<ref name="EI2"/> In reliable historical sources (the chroniclers [[al-Ya'qubi]] and [[al-Tabari]]), al-Battal first appears in 727, in one of the annual raids against Byzantine [[Asia Minor]]. This campaign was commanded by [[Mu'awiya ibn Hisham]], the son of the reigning Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]] ({{reign|723|743}}). Al-Battal led the vanguard, with which he penetrated as far as the city of [[Gangra]] in [[Paphlagonia]], which he captured and razed, before the army went on to unsuccessfully lay siege to [[Nicaea]].<ref name="EI2"/><ref>Blankinship (1994), p. 120</ref> Blankinship considers that al-Battal's capture of Gangra ranks as one of the greatest successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period, along with the capture of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]] by Maslama in 726.<ref>Blankinship (1994), pp. 120–121</ref>

Al-Battal himself commanded another raid in [[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 114 (731–732), of which little is known. It most probably was a failure, and is remembered only for the death in battle of another Arab hero, Abd al-Wahhab ibn Bukht.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="B162">Blankinship (1994), p. 162</ref> In the next year, AH 115 (732–733), al-Battal campaigned again alongside Mu'awiya ibn Hisham, raiding as far as [[Akroinon]] in [[Phrygia]]. A Byzantine army under a certain Constantine tried to confront the Muslims, but al-Battal defeated Constantine and took him prisoner.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="B162"/><ref name="PmbZ">Lilie, et al. (1999), pp. 5–6</ref> Al-Battal's next and last appearance is in 740, when a major campaign involving several tens of thousands of men was launched by the Umayyads against Byzantium. Along with Malik ibn Shu'ayb, deputy governor of [[Malatya]], al-Battal commanded a 20,000-strong cavalry force while [[Sulayman ibn Hisham]] led the main force behind them. Al-Battal and Malik's force reached as far as Akroinon, but there they were [[Battle of Akroinon|confronted and defeated]] by the Byzantines under Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] ({{reign|717|741}}) in person. Both Arab generals and two thirds of their army perished.<ref name="EI2"/><ref name="PmbZ"/><ref>Blankinship (1994), pp. 169–170</ref>

== Legend ==
{{see |Battal Gazi}}
Although his military career was "not particularly distinguished" according to Marius Canard, Abdallah al-Battal quickly became the subject of popular tales and his fame grew, so that by the 10th century he was well established as one of the heroic figures of the [[Arab–Byzantine Wars]]: [[al-Mas'udi]] (''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'', VIII, 74–75) ranks him among the "illustrious Muslims" whose portraits were displayed in Byzantine churches as a mark of respect.<ref name="EI2"/> In the 10th–12th centuries his alleged role in the siege of Constantinople was embellished by the Persian historian [[Bal'ami]] and the [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] mystic [[Ibn Arabi]].<ref name="EI2"/> A number of fictional anecdotes became part of the accepted historical corpus around al-Battal from the time of [[Ibn 'Asakir]] (1106–1175) on: the use of his name to frighten children by the Byzantines; his entry into [[Amorion]] pretending to be a messenger and discovery of the Byzantine plans; his stay at a convent, whose [[abbess]] shielded him from Byzantine soldiers and whom he took with him and married; and finally his death in battle and burial, attended by Emperor Leo himself.<ref name="EI2"/> On the other hand, beginning with Ibn 'Asakir's contemporary al-Samaw'al ibn Yahya al-Maghribi, a succession of Muslim chroniclers were critical of the various fabrications introduced into the accounts of al-Battal's life. [[Ibn Kathir]] in particular regarded it as "poor and confused material suitable only for the unsophisticated".<ref name="EI3"/>

Al-Battal's exploits became the subject of two [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], the Arabic-language "Tale of Delhemma and al-Battal" ({{transl|ar|[[Delhemma|Sīrat Ḏāt al-Himma wa-l-Baṭṭāl]]}}) and the Turkish epic tradition of {{transl|ar|[[Battal Gazi|Sayyid Baṭṭāl Ghāzī]]}}.<ref name="EI2"/> Although both were composed in the 12th century and draw upon a common Arabic tradition, they show significant differences, with the Turkish tale including many uniquely Turkic and Persian influences, including supernatural elements from folk tradition or motifs from the ''[[Shahname]]'' and the ''Romance of [[Abu Muslim]]''.<ref name="Melikoff">Melikoff (1960), pp. 1003–1004</ref> Both romances place al-Battal in the mid-9th century and associate him with the epic cycle of Malatya and its emir, [[Umar al-Aqta]] (died 863), with the result that he became particularly associated with the city of Malatya and its region.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 9–14</ref> In the ''Delhemma'', his own role in the Umayyad wars with Byzantium is taken over by the [[Banu Kilab|Kilabite]] hero al-Sahsah. In these tales al-Battal is presented as an Islamic analogue to [[Odysseus]], to the extent that his name became a byword for cunning.<ref>Canard (1961), pp.  158–173, esp. 167–169</ref>

The Turks adopted al-Battal following the [[Danishmendid]] conquest of Malatya in 1102, and he became prominent as a Turkish national hero, as a symbol of the revived frontier spirit of the {{transl|ar|[[jihad]]}} of early Muslim times, and of the Turkish conquest of Asia Minor. His stories (''Battalname'') were reworked throughout the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and he became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 9–16, 23–25</ref> Thus, according to the 14th-century geographer Abu'l-Fida, based on the 13th-century work of Ibn Sa'id, the river Dalaman çayı, which formed the boundary between the lands of the [[Seljuk Turks]] and the [[Empire of Nicaea]], was known as the "River of Battal".<ref>Wittek (1934), pp. 1–3, 7–8</ref> A cult developed around him as a saintly figure ("{{transl|ar|[[sayyid]]}}"), especially among the [[Alevi]] and [[Bektashi]] sects, and his supposed tomb at [[Seyitgazi]] became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century, drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia.<ref name="Melikoff"/><ref>Dedes (1996), pp. 16–22</ref>
