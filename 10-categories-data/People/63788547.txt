==Biography==
Jenkins was born in [[England]]. She has a twin sister Toni (Antoinette McCallum).

Per week she trained 2 times at the ice, 2 times racing, 5 times at the gym and running three times. With the help of Spicer, Jenkins won within two years her first of her Victorian-Australian championship doubles. When she was 18 years old, she won the Ladies' Quarter Mile title in 1954 in [[Sydney]]. She couldn't perform will in the half-mile event due to several falls caused by blunt skates. Her step-father told the press that someone had taken her skates before the event and returned them with ground down edges.<ref>[https://icelegendsaustralia.com/legends-2/images/jenkins_1954.jpg Skating champion 'Nobbling' of skates claim], Sunday Times, Perth Australia, Oct 3rd 1954.]</ref><ref name=icelegendsaustralia />
