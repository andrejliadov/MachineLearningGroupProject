'''''Age of Unreason''''' is the seventeenth studio album by American [[punk rock]] band [[Bad Religion]], released on May 3, 2019.<ref name="blabbermouth" /> It is the band's first studio album to feature guitarist [[Mike Dimkich]] and drummer [[Jamie Miller (US musician)|Jamie Miller]], replacing [[Greg Hetson]] and [[Brooks Wackerman]] respectively, and the first one to be produced by [[Carlos de la Garza (music producer)|Carlos de la Garza]], thus ending their collaboration with [[Joe Barresi]], who had produced, mixed or engineered every Bad Religion album since 2004's ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]''; Barresi did, however, mix "The Kids Are Alt-Right", which was already released as a one-off single in 2018.

The release of ''Age of Unreason'' also marks the longest gap between studio albums in Bad Religion's entire career, with their previous album, ''[[True North (Bad Religion album)|True North]]'', having been released in January 2013. Singles released from the album were "My Sanity", "Chaos from Within" and "Do the Paranoid Style".

==Background==
Bad Religion's intention for their seventeenth studio album was revealed by guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] about ten months after the release of ''True North'', who said, "We'll play some shows next year, not heavily. I think 2014 will be when we start writing the next album, too."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=2111|title=Brett in the media. Plus a first sign of a next album?|work=thebrpage.net|date=November 27, 2013|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> By early 2015, Gurewitz and vocalist [[Greg Graffin]] had begun writing songs for the album, and plans were made to enter the studio that fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=2111|title=Bad Religion returning to studio!|work=thebrpage.net|date=March 21, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> However, it appeared plans had changed, as Graffin stated in a September 2015 interview with ''Glide Magazine'' that he had been working on his first solo album since 2006's ''[[Cold as the Clay]]'', and Bad Religion did not have plans to release another album until at least late 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/news/?newsID=2151|title=New solo album Greg Graffin?|work=thebrpage.net|date=September 26, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Graffin later stated that plans were made to begin writing the seventeenth Bad Religion album after the release of this third solo album ''[[Millport (album)|Millport]]'', which was eventually released on March 10, 2017. He was quoted as saying, "During the fall semester I'm pretty busy. But next year there's going to be a new solo album. I put out a new solo album about every six years, so next year I'm due for one. And then I'm going to develop a new book, but I can't talk about it yet. And finally, Bad Religion has a new album to write. So we've got a lot of work to do."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Cityfiles/Fall-2015/Greg-Graffin-Wants-to-Provoke-People-to-Think/ |title=Greg Graffin Wants to Provoke People to Think |work=[[San Diego Magazine]] |date=November 9, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> Asked in a March 2017 interview about the follow-up to ''True North'', Graffin said, "It's one of the great challenges as artist is to maintain the tradition of his or her prior work. That's hard to do. It normally takes (Bad Religion) two years to put out an album. Why has it taken us four years to release an album after ''True North''? Well, ''True North'' was such a great album – and we owe it to our fans to take it seriously as a great album – that to do another one is going to take a lot more work."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://punx.uk/ds-interview-greg-graffin-on-his-latest-solo-effort-and-new-bad-religion/ |title=DS Interview: Greg Graffin on his latest solo effort and new Bad Religion |publisher=punx.uk |accessdate=February 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330091804/http://punx.uk/ds-interview-greg-graffin-on-his-latest-solo-effort-and-new-bad-religion/ |archive-date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On February 14, 2018, Graffin posted a picture of himself with Gurewitz in the studio on Twitter, and tweeted, "New songs in the pipeline"; the post indicated that Bad Religion was in the studio working on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/DoctorGraffin/status/963952352179847170|title=Greg Graffin on Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}{{Primary source inline|date=March 2019}}</ref> Speculation resurfaced in April of that year when Gurewitz and Baker posted pictures from the studio on their respective Instagram accounts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh9tRM8HRX-/|title=Brett Gurewitz on Instagram: "Today's office"|website=Instagram|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh7Y79PnaSr/|title=Brian Baker on Instagram: "FINALLY"|website=Instagram|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> On June 20, 2018, the band released their first single in five years "The Kids Are Alt-Right".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bad-religion-takes-down-alt-right-movement-with-new-single-the-kids-are-alt-right/|title=BAD RELIGION Takes Down Alt-Right Movement With New Single, 'The Kids Are Alt-Right'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

Despite earlier reports that Bad Religion had been in the studio by mid-2018, and the fact that they had released one new song, Gurewitz told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in July 2018 that, "We're writing for a new album, recording this fall or late summer. No release date announced yet, but we should have an album's worth of 'Fuck [[Donald Trump|Trump]]' songs pretty soon. It's exactly what we need."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/super-powers-and-punk-rock-brett-gurewitz-crosses-mediums-to-spread-important-messages-9625890|title=Super Powers and Punk Rock: Brett Gurewitz Crosses Mediums to Spread Important Messages|last=Callwood|first=Brett|date=July 11, 2018|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref> On February 26, 2019, Bad Religion announced ''Age of Unreason'' as the title of the new album, its release date, and premiered the lead single "Chaos from Within".<ref name="blabbermouth" /> The third track, "Do the Paranoid Style", was released on March 26, 2019.<ref name="stereogum" />

The CD version of the album features the two previously released non-album singles "The Kids Are Alt-Right" (as the band's first ever hidden track after "What Tomorrow Brings")  and "The Profane Rights of Man" as bonus tracks.

''Wall of Sound'' gave the album a 9/10 stating: "Since their formation in 1980 the band have been challenging their listeners with music that appeal to their fans humanity, reason and conscience. ''Age of Unreason'' continues these themes, focusing on the current political climate."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/04/28/bad-religion-age-of-unreason-album-review/|title=Bad Religion – Age Of Unreason (Album Review)|date=April 27, 2019|website=Wall of Sound|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>
