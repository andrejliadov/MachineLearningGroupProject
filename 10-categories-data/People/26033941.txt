Assange visited Sweden in August 2010. During his visit, he became the subject of sexual assault allegations from two women.<ref name="sex lies">{{cite news |title=Sex, Lies and Julian Assange|date=23 July 2012|url=https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/sex-lies-and-julian-assange/4156420|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=6 May 2019}}</ref> He was questioned, the case was initially closed, and he was told he could leave the country. In November 2010, however, the case was reopened by a special prosecutor who said that she wanted to question Assange over two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of "lesser-degree rape" ({{lang-sv|mindre grov våldtäkt}}). Assange denied the allegations and said he was happy to face questions in Britain.<ref name="davies2010">{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Davies |title=10 days in Sweden: the full allegations against Julian Assange |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=17 December 2010 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden |access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="humanrights">{{cite news|last=Addley|first=Esther|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/17/julian-assange-human-rights-violated-ecuador|title=Julian Assange has had his human rights violated, says Ecuador foreign minister|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=17 August 2014|access-date=18 August 2014}}</ref>

On 20 November 2010, the Swedish police issued an international arrest warrant. On 8 December 2010, Assange gave himself up to British police and attended his first [[extradition]] hearing where he was remanded in custody. On 16 December 2010, at the second hearing, he was granted bail by the High Court and released after his supporters paid £240,000 in cash and sureties. A further hearing on 24 February 2011 ruled that Assange should be extradited to Sweden. This decision was upheld by the High Court on 2 November and by the Supreme Court on 30 May the next year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11949341|title=Timeline: Julian Assange saga|date=23 May 2019|accessdate=22 July 2019|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

After previously stating that she could not question a suspect by video link or in the Swedish embassy, prosecutor [[Marianne Ny]] wrote to the English [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) in 2013. Her letter advised that she intended to lift the detention order and withdraw the European arrest warrant as the actions were not proportionate to the costs and seriousness of the crime. In response, the CPS tried to dissuade Ny from doing so.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bowcott |first1=Owen |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=Sweden tried to drop Assange extradition in 2013, CPS emails show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/11/sweden-tried-to-drop-assange-extradition-in-2013-cps-emails-show |accessdate=16 May 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=11 February 2018}}</ref>

On 19 May 2017, the Swedish authorities suspended their investigation, saying they could not expect the Ecuadorian Embassy to communicate reliably with Assange with respect to the case. Chief prosecutor Marianne Ny officially revoked his arrest warrant, but said the investigation could still be resumed if Assange visited Sweden before August 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39973864|title=Julian Assange: Sweden drops rape investigation|work=BBC News|date=19 May 2017|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|last2=Travis|first2=Alan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/19/swedish-prosecutors-drop-julian-assange-investigation|title=Swedish prosecutors drop Julian Assange rape investigation|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2017|access-date=19 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/5/19/human_rights_lawyer_sweden_dropping_investigation|title=Human Rights Lawyer: Sweden Dropping Investigation of WikiLeaks' Assange is "Long Overdue Decision"|last=Avila|first=Renata|date=19 May 2017|website=[[Democracy Now!]]|access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref>

Officers of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] were stationed outside from June 2012 to October 2015 to arrest Assange for breaching the bail conditions and to compel him to attend court to face the Swedish extradition appeal hearing, should he leave the embassy. The police guard was withdrawn on grounds of cost in October 2015, but the police said they would still deploy "several overt and covert tactics to arrest him". The cost of the policing for the period was reported to have been £12.6&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34508500 |title=Julian Assange: Police end guard at Wikileaks founder's embassy refuge |work=BBC News |date=12 October 2015 }}</ref>

Wikileaks insiders stated that Assange decided to seek asylum because he felt abandoned by the Australian government. The Australian attorney-general, [[Nicola Roxon]], had written to Assange's lawyer, [[Jennifer Robinson (lawyer)|Jennifer Robinson]], saying that Australia would not seek to involve itself in any international exchanges about Assange's future. She suggested that if Assange was imprisoned in the US, he could apply for an international prisoner transfer to Australia.

In 2013, Assange and others in WikiLeaks helped whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]] flee from US law enforcement. After the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, stranding him in Russia, they considered transporting him to Latin America on the presidential jet of a sympathetic Latin American leader. In order to throw the US off the scent, they spoke about the jet of the Bolivian president [[Evo Morales]], instead of the jet they were considering.{{failed verification|date=September 2020}} As a result, [[Evo Morales grounding incident|Morales' jet was forced to land]]{{by whom|date=September 2020}} in Austria in July 2013. Assange said the grounding "reveals the true nature of the relationship between Western Europe and the United States" as "a phone call from U.S. intelligence was enough to close the airspace to a booked presidential flight, which has immunity".

Documents provided by Edward Snowden showed that in 2012 and 2013 the NZ government worked to establish a secret mass surveillance programme which it called "Operation Speargun". On 15 September 2014, Assange appeared via remote video link on [[Kim Dotcom]]'s ''Moment of Truth'' town hall meeting held in [[Auckland]] which discussed the programme. Assange said the Snowden documents showed that he had been a target of the programme and that "Operation Speargun" represented "an extreme, bizarre, Orwellian future that is being constructed secretly in New Zealand".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/sep/15/kim-dotcom-accused-nz-government-of-mass-spying-live|title=Kim Dotcom accuses New Zealand government of mass spying&nbsp;– live updates|author=Michael Safi & Hannah Jane Parkinson|date=15 September 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Murder of Seth Rich===

[[File:Transmisioncorrea.jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Correa]], who was openly sympathetic to Assange, served as President of [[Ecuador]] from 2007 to 2017]] 
In March 2017, Wikileaks began releasing the largest leak of CIA documents in history, codenamed [[Vault 7]].

On 16 August 2017, [[Republican Party (United States)|US Republican]] congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] visited Assange and offered him a pardon if Assange provided information about who gave him the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak]]s. At his extradition hearings in 2020, Assange's lawyers told the court that President Trump had made the offer.

In August 2017, in the midst of the [[2017–19 Qatar diplomatic crisis|Qatar diplomatic crisis]], Dubai-based ''[[Al Arabiya]]'' accused Assange of acting to support Qatar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wikileaks founder Assange slams Al Arabiya report against Qatar as 'absurd fabrication' |url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/22/08/2017/Wikileaks-founder-Assange-slams-Al-Arabiya-report-against-Qatar-as-%E2%80%98absurd-fabrication%E2%80%99 |work=[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]] |date=22 August 2017}}</ref> In September 2017, Assange released "Spy Files Russia," revealing "how a [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]-based technology company called [[Peter-Service]] helped [[Government of Russia|Russian state entities]] gather detailed data on Russian cellphone users, part of a national system of online surveillance called System for Operative Investigative Activities ([[SORM]])."

In February 2018, after Sweden had suspended its investigation, Assange brought two legal actions, arguing that Britain should drop its arrest warrant for him as it was "no longer right or proportionate to pursue him" and the arrest warrant for breaching bail had lost its "purpose and its function". In both cases, Senior District Judge [[Emma Arbuthnot]], ruled that the arrest warrant should remain in place.<ref name="ft070218">{{cite news |last1=Croft |first1=Jane |title=UK judge upholds arrest warrant for Assange |url=https://www.ft.com/content/87db8906-0b4f-11e8-839d-41ca06376bf2 |accessdate=12 October 2020 |work=www.ft.com |date=7 February 2018|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name="ft140218">{{cite news |last1=Croft |first1=Jane |title=Julian Assange loses bid to discharge UK arrest warrant |url=https://www.ft.com/content/9a702124-10d3-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277 |accessdate=12 October 2020 |date=14 February 2018|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

On 28 March 2018, Ecuador cut Assange's Internet connection in response to his social media posts denouncing the arrest of [[Catalan independence movement|Catalonian separatist]] leader [[Carles Puigdemont]] which it put at risk Ecuador's relations with European nations.<ref>{{cite news |date=28 March 2018 |title=Ecuador cuts WikiLeaks founder Assange's internet at embassy|url=https://apnews.com/aab0a5a4592746b397cd925d96b4329d |work=[[Associated Press]] |first=Gonzalo |last=Solano |access-date=28 March 2018 }}</ref> In May 2018, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' reported that over five years Ecuador had spent at least $5&nbsp;million (£3.7m) to protect Assange, employing a security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and the British police. Ecuador reportedly also devised plans to help Assange escape should British police forcibly enter the embassy to seize him. ''The Guardian'' reported that, by 2014, Assange had compromised the embassy's communications system. Wikileaks described the allegation as "an anonymous libel aligned with the current UK-US government onslaught against Mr Assange".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/revealed-ecuador-spent-millions-julian-assange-spy-operation-embassy-london|title=Revealed: Ecuador spent millions on spy operation for Julian Assange|last1=Collyns|first1=Dan|last2=Kirchgaessner|first2=Stephanie|last3=Harding|first3=Luke|date=15 May 2018|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=15 May 2018}}</ref>

On 21 December 2018, the UN's [[Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]] urged the UK to let Assange leave the embassy freely. In a statement, the organisation said that the "Swedish investigations have been closed for over 18 months now, and the only ground remaining for Mr Assange's continued deprivation of liberty is a bail violation in the UK, which is, objectively, a minor offense that cannot post-facto justify the more than six years' confinement that he has been subjected to".<ref>{{cite web |title=UN experts urge the UK to honour rights obligations and let Mr Julian Assange leave Ecuador embassy in London freely |url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24042&LangID=E |website=United Nations Human Rights.

Assange submitted a complaint to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and accused the Ecuadorian embassy of monitoring his daily activities and restricting his visitors. The complaint requested the Ecuadorian government to "ease the conditions that it had imposed on his residence" at the embassy. Furthermore, the complaint urged the commission to forbid the embassy from extraditing him to the US. In March 2019, the commission rejected his complaint.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-wikileaks-assange/human-rights-agency-rejects-assange-complaint-against-ecuador-idUSKCN1QW02T |title = Human rights agency rejects Assange complaint against Ecuador|work = Reuters|date = 15 March 2019}}</ref>

==Surveillance of Assange in the embassy==
On 10 April 2019, WikiLeaks said it had uncovered an extensive surveillance operation against Assange from within the embassy. WikiLeaks said that "material including video, audio, copies of private legal documents and a medical report" had surfaced in Spain and that unnamed individuals in Madrid had made an extortion attempt.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/10/julian-assange-wikileaks-says-spies-at-work-in-ecuadorean-embassy|title=Spanish police 'recover Julian Assange surveillance footage'|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=10 April 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 April 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-assange/julian-assange-being-spied-on-in-ecuadorean-embassy-wikileaks-says-idUSKCN1RM17L|title=WikiLeaks Says Julian Assange Is Being Spied On in Ecuadorean Embassy|author=Andrew MacAskill|work=Reuters|date=10 April 2019}}</ref>

On 26 September 2019, the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' reported that the Spanish defence and security company Undercover Global S.L. (UC Global) had spied on Assange for the CIA during his time in the embassy. UC Global had been contracted to protect the embassy during this time. According to the report UC Global's owner David Morales had provided the CIA with audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and colleagues. Morales also arranged for the US to have direct access to the stream from video cameras installed in the embassy at the beginning of December 2017. The evidence was part of a secret investigation by Spain's High Court, the [[Audiencia Nacional]], into Morales and his relationship with US intelligence. The investigation was precipitated by a complaint by Assange that accused UC Global of violating his privacy and client-attorney privileges as well as committing misappropriation, bribery and money laundering.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Irujo |first1=Jose Maria |title=Spanish security company spied on Julian Assange in London for the United States |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/09/25/inenglish/1569384196_652151.html |accessdate=30 September 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=26 September 2019}}</ref>

Morales was arrested in September on charges involving violations of privacy and client-attorney privileges, as well as misappropriation, bribery, money laundering and criminal possession of weapons. He was released on bail. On 25 September, Spanish Judge José de la Mata sent British authorities a [[European Investigation Order]] (EIO) asking for permission to question Assange by videoconference as a witness in the case against Morales. The United Kingdom Central Authority (UKCA), which is in charge of processing and responding to EIOs in the UK, provisionally denied De la Mata's request to question Assange, raised a number of objections to the request, and asked for more details. De la Mata responded to UKCA's objections on 14 October by stating that Assange was the victim who had filed the complaint and that unlawful disclosure of secrets and bribery are also crimes in the UK. He said that the crimes were partially committed on Spanish territory because the microphones used to spy on Assange were bought in Spain, and the information obtained was sent and uploaded to servers at UC Global S. L.'s headquarters in Spain.<ref name="ep231019">{{cite news |last1=Irujo |first1=Jose Maria |title=UK blocks Spanish judge from questioning Julian Assange over spying allegations |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/10/23/inenglish/1571817241_796975.html |accessdate=24 October 2019 |publisher=El Pais |date=23 October 2019}}</ref>

Spanish judicial bodies were upset at having their EIO request denied by UKCA and believed the British justice system is concerned by the effect the Spanish case may have on the process to extradite Assange to the US.<ref name="ep231019" />

In a November 2019 article, Stefania Maurizi said she had access to some of the videos, audios and photos showing a medical examination of Assange, a meeting between Ecuadorian ambassador Carlos Abad Ortiz and his staff, a meeting between Assange, Glenn Greenwald and David Miranda and lunch between Assange and British rapper [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Microphones had been placed in the women's toilets to capture meetings between Assange and his lawyers. Phones belonging to some of the embassy's visitors were compromised. Spanish lawyer Aitor Martinez, who is part of Assange's legal team, said videos were taken of meetings between Assange and his legal defence team.  Maurizi concluded that, based on statements from former employees of UC Global, internal UC Global emails and the type of information collected, it was clear that the surveillance was conducted on behalf of the US government and the information gathered would be used by the US to assist in its case for extraditing Assange.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Maurizi |first1=Stefania |title=A massive scandal: how Assange, his doctors, lawyers and visitors were all spied on for the U.S. |url=https://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2019/11/18/news/a_massive_scandal_how_assange_his_doctors_lawyers_and_visitors_were_all_spied_on_for_the_u_s_-241314527/ |accessdate=23 November 2019 |work=la Repubblica |date=18 November 2019}}</ref>

In 2011, Assange criticised a ''[[Private Eye]]'' article for portraying WikiLeaks contributor [[Israel Shamir]] as antisemitic. According to editor [[Ian Hislop]], Assange called the article "an obvious attempt to deprive [WikiLeaks] of Jewish support and donations" and went on to point out that several journalists involved were Jewish. On 1 March 2011, Assange released a statement in which he said, 
{{quote|Hislop has distorted, invented or misremembered almost every significant claim and phrase. In particular, 'Jewish conspiracy' is completely false, in spirit and word.

In a statement accompanying release of "Yemen Files", Assange said about the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen#United States|U.S. involvement in the Yemen war]]: "The war in Yemen has produced 3.15&nbsp;million internally displaced persons. Although the United States government has provided most of the bombs and is deeply involved in the conduct of the war itself reportage on the war in English is conspicuously rare."<ref name="yemenconflict"/>
