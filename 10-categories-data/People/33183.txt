The plural ''women'' is sometimes used for female humans regardless of age, as in phrases such as "[[women's rights]]."

Typically, a woman has two [[X chromosome]]s and is capable of [[pregnancy]] and giving [[childbirth|birth]] from [[puberty]] until [[menopause]]. Female anatomy, as distinguished from male anatomy, includes the [[fallopian tube]]s, [[ovaries]], [[uterus]], [[vulva]], [[breasts]], [[Skene's gland]]s, and [[Bartholin's gland]]s. The adult female [[pelvis]] is wider than the male's, the [[hip]]s are generally broader, and women have significantly less facial and other body hair. On average, women are shorter and less muscular than men.

Throughout [[History of the world|human history]], traditional [[gender role]]s have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women. With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional [[homemaker]], and the ability to pursue higher education. [[Violence against women]], whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men. Some women are denied [[reproductive rights]]. The movements and ideologies of [[feminism]] have a shared goal of achieving [[gender equality]].

[[Trans women]] have a male [[sex assignment]] at birth that does not align with their [[gender identity]],<ref name="MorrowMessinger">''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0-231-50186-2}}), p. 8: "Gender identity refers to an individual's personal sense of identity as [man] or [woman], or some combination thereof."</ref> while [[intersex]] women were born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology.

== Etymology ==
The spelling of "woman" in English has progressed over the past millennium from ''wīfmann''<ref>"wīfmann": Bosworth & Toller, ''Anglo-Saxon Dictionary'' (Oxford, 1898–1921) p. 1219. The spelling "wifman" also occurs: C.T. Onions, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1011</ref> to ''wīmmann'' to ''wumman'', and finally, the modern spelling ''woman''.<ref>''Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition'', entry for "woman".</ref>  In [[Old English]], ''wīfmann'' meant "woman" (literally "woman-person"), whereas ''wer'' meant "man". ''Mann'' had a gender-neutral meaning of "human", corresponding to Modern English "person" or "someone"; however, subsequent to the [[Norman Conquest]], ''man'' began to be used more in reference to "male human", and by the late 13th century had begun to eclipse usage of the older term ''wer''.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=man man] – definition Dictionary.reference.com</ref> The medial labial consonants f and m in ''wīfmann'' coalesced into the modern form "woman", while the initial element ''wīf'', which had also meant "woman", underwent semantic narrowing to the sense of a married woman ("wife").

It is a [[Folk etymology|popular misconception]] that the term "woman" is [[Etymology|etymologically]] connected to "womb".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stanton|first1=Elizabeth Cady|title=The Woman's Bible: A Classic Feminist Perspective|date=2002|pages=21–22|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=Mineola, New York|isbn=978-0486424910|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiTpfBGwNR0C|chapter=The Book of Genesis, Chapter II|quote=Next comes the naming of the mother of the race.

'''Womanhood''' is the period in a human female's life after she has passed through childhood, puberty, and adolescence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/7824699/Girls-now-reaching-puberty-before-10-a-year-sooner-than-20-years-ago.html|title=Girls now reaching puberty before 10 – a year sooner than 20 years ago|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2010-06-13|access-date=2019-06-02|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Different countries have different laws, but age 18 is frequently considered the [[age of majority]] (the age at which a person is legally considered an adult).

The word ''woman'' can be used generally, to mean any female human, or specifically, to mean an adult female human as contrasted with ''girl''. The word ''girl'' originally meant "young person of either sex" in English;<ref>Used in Middle English from c. 1300, meaning 'a child of either sex, a young person'.  Its derivation is uncertain, perhaps from an Old English word which has not survived: another theory is that it developed from Old English 'gyrela', meaning 'dress, apparel': or was a diminutive form of a borrowing from another West Germanic Language. (Middle Low German has Gör, Göre, meaning 'girl or small child'.)  "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013</ref> it was only around the beginning of the 16th century that it came to mean specifically a ''female'' child.<ref>By late 14th century a distinction was arising between female children, often called  'gay girls'&nbsp;– and male, or 'knave girls' -: a1375   William of Palerne  (1867) l. 816  ' Whan þe gaye gerles were in-to þe gardin come, Faire floures þei founde.' ('When the gay girls came into the garden, Fair flowers they found.') By the 16th century, the unsupported word had begun to mean specifically a female:  1546   J. Heywood Dialogue Prouerbes Eng. Tongue i. x. sig. D,   'The boy thy husbande, and thou the gyrle his wyfe.'  The usage meaning 'child of either sex' survived much longer in [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]]. "girl, n.". OED Online. September 2013. Oxford University Press. 13 September 2013</ref> The term ''girl'' is sometimes  used colloquially to refer to a young or unmarried woman; however, during the early 1970s, feminists challenged such use because the use of the word to refer to a fully grown woman may cause offence. In particular, previously common terms such as ''office girl'' are no longer widely used. Conversely, in certain cultures which link family [[honor]] with female [[virginity]], the word ''girl'' (or its equivalent in other languages) is still used to refer to a never-married woman; in this sense it is used in a fashion roughly analogous to the more-or-less obsolete English ''maid'' or ''maiden''.

There are various words used to refer to the quality of being a woman. The term "womanhood" merely means the state of being a woman, having passed the [[menarche]]; "femininity" is used to refer to a set of typical female qualities associated with a certain attitude to [[gender role]]s; "womanliness" is like "femininity", but is usually associated with a different view of gender roles.  "Distaff" is an archaic adjective derived from women's conventional role as a spinner, now used only as a deliberate [[archaism]].

Menarche, the onset of [[menstruation]], occurs on average at age 12–13. Many cultures have [[rites of passage]] to symbolize a girl's [[coming of age]], such as confirmation in some branches of [[Christianity]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/confirmation_1.shtml|title=BBC&nbsp;— Religions&nbsp;— Christianity: Confirmation|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref> [[bat mitzvah]] in [[Judaism]], or a custom of a special celebration for a certain [[birthday]] (generally between 12 and 21), like the [[quinceañera]] of Latin America.

[[Trans women]] have a male [[sex assignment]] at birth that does not align with their [[gender identity]],<ref name="MorrowMessinger"/> while [[intersex]] women were born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology.

Although fewer females than males are born (the ratio is around 1:1.05), newborn girls are more likely to reach their first birthday than are boys and women typically have a longer life expectancy of six to eight years, although in some areas gender-based discrimination against women has lowered female life expectancy to lower or equal to that of males. Out of the total human population in 2015, there were 101.8 men for every 100 women. The life expectancy differences are partly due to inherent biological advantages, but they also reflect behavioral differences between men and women.  The gap is narrowing to some extent in some developed countries, possibly due to increased smoking among women and declining rates of cardiovascular disease among men.  The World Health Organization writes that it is "important to note that the extra years of life for women are not always lived in good health."<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-is-life-expectancy-lo |title=Why is life expectancy longer for women than it is for men? |magazine= Scientific American |date=2004-08-30 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url= http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/dyb2015.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division&nbsp;— Demographic and Social Statistics |website= unstats.un.org|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Female Life Expectancy |url=https://www.who.int/gho/women_and_health/mortality/situation_trends_life_expectancy/en/ |website=World Health Organization |accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>

Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls consists of the differences in their [[Human genitals|genitalia]]. [[Puberty]] is the process of physical changes by which a child's [[Human body|body]] matures into an adult body capable of [[sexual reproduction]] to enable [[fertilisation|fertilization]]. It usually takes place between the ages 10 – 16. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s - either the ovaries or the testes. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sexual organs. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when the child has developed an adult body.  The major landmark of girls' puberty is [[menarche]], the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12–13.<ref name="Tanner">(Tanner, 1990).</ref><ref name="U.S. menarche">{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title =Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}</ref><ref name="Canadian menarche">{{cite journal|title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children & Youth |year= 2010 |pmid=21110899 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmc=3001737 |volume=10 |vauthors=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |journal=BMC Public Health |page=736}}</ref><ref name="UK menarche">{{cite journal |url =http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |title= Obstetrics and Gynaecology |first=Diana |last=Hamilton-Fairley |edition= Second |publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}</ref>

Most girls go through menarche and are then able to become [[pregnant]] and [[childbirth|bear children]]. This generally requires internal fertilization of her eggs with the sperm of a man through [[sexual intercourse]], though [[artificial insemination]] or the surgical implantation of an existing embryo is also possible (see [[reproductive technology]]).

The main causes of maternal mortality include [[pre-eclampsia]] and [[eclampsia]], [[unsafe abortion]], pregnancy complications from [[malaria]] and [[HIV/AIDS]], and severe bleeding and infections following childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/ |title=WHO &#124; Maternal mortality |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> Most European countries, Australia, Japan, and Singapore are very safe in regard to childbirth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

In 1990 the US ranked 12th of the 14 developed countries that were analyzed and since that time the death rates of every country have steadily improved while the US rate has spiked dramatically. While the others that were analyzed in 1990 show a 2017 death rate of fewer than 10 deaths per every 100,000 live births, the U.S. rate rose to 26.4. Furthermore, for every one of the 700 to 900  women who die in the U.S. each year during pregnancy or childbirth, 70 experience significant complications, totaling more than one percent of all births.<ref>{{cite web |title= Healthy Women, Healthy Babies: How health reform can improve the health of women and babies in America |url= http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH%202011HealthyBabiesBrief.pdf | vauthors = Levi J, Kohn D, Johnson K |publisher= [[Trust for America's Health]] |location= Washington, D.C. |date= June 2011 |access-date= 2013-08-29 <!-- American Pregnancy Association website --> |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120624230140/http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH%202011HealthyBabiesBrief.pdf |archive-date= 2012-06-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bogdanska |first1=Kasia |title=Severe Complications for Women During Childbirth Are Skyrocketing — and Could Often Be Prevented |url=https://www.propublica.org/article/severe-complications-for-women-during-childbirth-are-skyrocketing-and-could-often-be-prevented |website=ProPublica |accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>

== Reproductive rights and freedom ==
[[File:Sterilization states.jpg|thumb|A poster from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference displays the U.S. states that had implemented sterilization legislation]]

[[Reproductive rights]] are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]]. The [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics]] has stated that:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figo.org/projects/reproductive_and_sexual_health |title=Resolution on Reproductive and Sexual Health &#124; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics |publisher=Figo.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

:(...) the human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences.

The World Health Organization reports that based on data from 2010–2014,   56 million induced abortions occurred worldwide each year (25% of all pregnancies). Of those, about 25 million were considered as [[Unsafe abortions|unsafe]].  The WHO reports that in developed regions about 30 women die for every 100 000 unsafe abortions and that number rises to 220 deaths per 100 000 unsafe abortions in developing regions and 520 deaths per 100 000 unsafe abortions in sub-Saharan Africa.  The WHO ascribes these unnecessary deaths to 
*restrictive laws
*poor availability of services
*high cost
*stigma
*conscientious objection of health-care providers 
*unnecessary requirements, such as mandatory waiting periods, mandatory counselling, provision of misleading information, third-party authorization, and medically unnecessary tests that delay care.<ref>{{cite web |title=Preventing unsafe abortion |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preventing-unsafe-abortion |website=World Health Organization |accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>

== Culture and gender roles ==
{{Main|Gender role}}
[[Image:Weaving profile.jpg|thumb|A woman weaving. Textile work is traditionally and historically a female occupation in many cultures.]]

In recent history, gender roles have changed greatly. At some earlier points in history, children's occupational aspirations starting at a young age differed according to gender.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Sharpe| first1=S. |title=Just like a Girl |date=1976 |publisher=Penguin| location=London|isbn=9780140219531}}</ref> Traditionally, [[middle class]] women were involved in domestic tasks emphasizing child care. For poorer women, especially [[working class]] women, although this often remained an ideal,{{Specify |date=February 2007}} economic necessity compelled them to seek employment outside the home. Many of the occupations that were available to them were lower in pay than those available to men.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

As changes in the labor market for women came about, availability of employment changed from only "dirty", long hour factory jobs to "cleaner", more respectable office jobs where more education was demanded. Women's participation in the U.S. labor force rose from 6% in 1900 to 23% in 1923. These shifts in the labor force led to changes in the attitudes of women at work, allowing for the revolution which resulted in women becoming career and education oriented.{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|During [[World War II]], some women performed roles which would otherwise have been considered male jobs by the culture of the time]]

In the 1970s, many female academics, including scientists, avoided having children. Throughout the 1980s, institutions tried to equalize conditions for men and women in the workplace. Even so, the inequalities at home hampered women's opportunities: professional women were still generally considered responsible for domestic labor and child care, which limited the time and energy they could devote to their careers. Until the early 20th century, U.S. women's colleges required their women faculty members to remain single, on the grounds that a woman could not carry on two full-time professions at once. According to Schiebinger, "Being a scientist and a wife and a mother is a burden in society that expects women more often than men to put family ahead of career." (p.&nbsp;93).<ref>{{cite book| last=Schiebinger |first=Londa| title=Has Feminism Changed Science? : Science and Private Life| year=1999| publisher= Harvard University Press| location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |pages=92–103}}</ref>

Movements advocate [[equality of opportunity]] for both sexes and [[civil rights|equal rights]] irrespective of gender. Through a combination of [[economics|economic]] changes and the efforts of the [[feminist movement]], in recent decades women in many societies have gained access to careers beyond the traditional [[homemaker]]. Despite these advances, modern women in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as with the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and motherhood, and others. [[Sexism]] can be a main concern and barrier for women almost anywhere, though its forms, perception, and gravity vary between societies and social classes.  There has been an increase in the endorsement of egalitarian gender roles in the home by both women and men.<ref>Gere, J., & Helwig, C.C. (2012). Young adults' attitudes and reasoning about gender roles in the family context.

Although a greater number of women are seeking higher education, their salaries are often less than those of men. CBS News said in 2005 that in the United States women who are ages 30 to 44 and hold a university degree make 62 percent of what similarly qualified men do, a lower rate than in all but three of the 19 countries for which numbers are available. Some Western nations with greater inequity in pay are Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/09/13/national/main838207_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=U.S. Education Slips In Rankings | date=13 September 2005}}</ref>

=== Violence against women ===
{{main|Violence against women}}
[[File:Campaign road sign against female genital mutilation (cropped).jpg|thumb|A campaign against [[female genital mutilation]]&nbsp;– a road sign near [[Kapchorwa]], [[Uganda]]]]

The [[United Nations|UN]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] defines "violence against women" as:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104. Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

{{quote|any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.}}

and identifies three forms of such violence: that which occurs ''in the family'', that which occurs ''within the general community'', and that which is perpetrated or condoned ''by the State''. It also states that "''violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women''".<ref>{{cite web| author= United Nations General Assembly |url= http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women&nbsp;— UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements |publisher=UN Documents |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

Violence against women remains a widespread problem, fueled, especially outside the West, by patriarchal social values, lack of adequate laws, and lack of enforcement of existing laws. Social norms that exist in many parts of the world hinder progress towards protecting women from violence. For example, according to surveys by [[UNICEF]],  the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is as high as 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], and 80% in the [[Central African Republic]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |title= Statistics by Area&nbsp;— Attitudes towards wife-beating&nbsp;— Statistical table |publisher=Childinfo.org |accessdate=2014-04-19 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php |archive-date=2014-07-04 |url-status=dead}}</ref> A 2010 survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that [[stoning]] as a punishment for [[adultery]] was supported by 82% of respondents in [[Egypt]] and [[Pakistan]], 70% in [[Jordan]], 56% [[Nigeria]], and 42% in [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ |title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah &#124; Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project |publisher=Pewglobal.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

Specific forms of violence that affect women include [[female genital mutilation]], [[sex trafficking]], [[forced prostitution]], [[forced marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], [[honor killings]], [[acid throwing]], and [[dowry death|dowry related violence]]. Governments can be complicit in violence against women, for instance through practices such as [[stoning]] (as punishment for adultery).

There have also been many forms of violence against women which have been prevalent historically, notably the  [[Witch-hunt|burning of witches]], the sacrifice of [[widows]] (such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]]) and [[foot binding]]. The prosecution of women accused of [[witchcraft]] has a long tradition; for example, during the early modern period (between the 15th and 18th centuries), [[witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]] were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in witchcraft is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.<ref>http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=djcil#H2N1</ref><ref>http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21363894 | work=BBC News | title=Woman burned alive for 'sorcery' in Papua New Guinea | date=7 February 2013}}</ref> In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft. In [[Saudi Arabia]], witchcraft remains a crime [[punishable by death]], and in 2011 the country beheaded a woman for 'witchcraft and sorcery'.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/saudi-arabia-beheading-sorcery-shocking-2011-12-12 |title=Saudi Arabia: Beheading for 'sorcery' shocking &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/meast/saudi-arabia-beheading/ | work=CNN.com | title=Saudi woman beheaded for 'witchcraft and sorcery'| date=14 December 2011}}</ref>

It is also the case that certain forms of violence against women have been recognized as criminal offenses only during recent decades, and are not universally prohibited, in that many countries continue to allow them. This is especially the case with [[marital rape]].<ref>In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women'' found that (p. 113): "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 States. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offence in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf]</ref><ref>In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736)'', stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "''hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract''"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.]</ref> In the Western World, there has been a trend towards ensuring [[gender equality]] within [[marriage]] and prosecuting [[domestic violence]], but in many parts of the world women still lose significant legal rights when entering a marriage.<ref>For example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf] In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".{{cite web| url= http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100954/http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf |archive-date=2012-10-21 }} In the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household; the wife owes her obedience to her husband; a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live; and wives must have their husbands' authorization to bring a case in court or to initiate other legal proceedings.[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/drc/Congo0602-09.htm]</ref>

Sexual violence against women greatly increases during times of [[war]] and [[armed conflict]], during [[military occupation]], or [[ethnic conflict]]s; most often in the form of [[war rape]] and [[sexual slavery]]. Contemporary examples of sexual violence during war include [[rape during the Armenian Genocide]], [[rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War]], [[rape in the Bosnian War]], [[rape during the Rwandan genocide]], and [[War rape#Democratic Republic of the Congo|rape during Second Congo War]]. In Colombia, the [[Colombian conflict (1964–present)|armed conflict]] has also resulted in increased sexual violence against women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/colombian-authorities-fail-stop-or-punish-sexual-violence-against-women-2012-10-04 |title=Colombian authorities fail to stop or punish sexual violence against women &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> The most recent case was the [[sexual jihad]] done by [[ISIL]] where 5000–7000 Yazidi and Christian girls and children were sold into [[sexual slavery]] during the [[Sexual violence in the Iraqi insurgency|genocide and rape of Yazidi and Christian women]], some of which jumped to their death from [[Mount Sinjar]], as described in a witness statement.<ref name=rudaw-26082014>{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Havidar|title=The Yezidi Exodus, Girls Raped by ISIS Jump to their Death on Mount Shingal|date=14 August 2014|url=http://rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/140820142|publisher=[[Rudaw Media Network]]|accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>

Women in different parts of the world dress in different ways, with their choices of clothing being influenced by local culture, religious tenets, traditions, social norms, and fashion trends, amongst other factors. Different societies have different ideas about [[modesty]]. However, in many jurisdictions, women's choices in regard to dress are not always free, with laws limiting what they may or may not wear. This is especially the case in regard to [[Islam and clothing|Islamic dress]]. While certain jurisdictions legally mandate such clothing (the wearing of the headscarf), other countries forbid or restrict the wearing of certain [[hijab]] attire (such as [[burqa]]/covering the face) in public places (one such country is [[France]] – see [[French ban on face covering]]). These laws are highly controversial.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Women's right to choose their dress, free of coercion |url=https://doc.es.amnesty.org/cgi-bin/ai/BRSCGI/WOMENS%20RIGHT%20TO%20CHOOSE%20THEIR%20DRESS%20FREE%20OF%20COERCION?CMD=VEROBJ&MLKOB=29309215959 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |date=4 March 2011}}</ref>

The [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) – the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime&nbsp;— differs significantly between different regions of the world. In 2016, the highest estimated TFR was in [[Niger]] (6.62 children born per woman) and the lowest in [[Singapore]] (0.82 children/woman).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html|title=The World Factbook&nbsp;— Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> While most Sub-Saharan African countries have a high TFR, which creates problems due to lack of resources and contributes to [[overpopulation]], most Western countries currently experience a [[sub replacement fertility rate]] which may lead to  [[population ageing]] and [[population decline]].

In many parts of the world, there has been a change in family structure over the past few decades. For instance, in the West, there has been a trend of moving away from living arrangements that include the [[extended family]] to those which only consist of the [[nuclear family]]. There has also been a trend to move from marital fertility to non-marital fertility. Children born outside marriage may be born to [[cohabitation|cohabiting couples]] or to [[single parent|single women]]. While births outside marriage are common and fully accepted in some parts of the world, in other places they are highly stigmatized, with unmarried mothers facing ostracism, including violence from family members, and in extreme cases even [[honor killings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=91cf943a-3fa6-4fce-afec-4ab2c2a356fd|date=2013-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501013343/http://www.mrt-rrt.gov.au/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=91cf943a-3fa6-4fce-afec-4ab2c2a356fd|access-date=2019-06-28|archive-date=2013-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3523123.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey condemns 'honour killings' | date=1 March 2004}}</ref> In addition, [[sex outside marriage]] remains illegal in many countries (such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |title=Human Rights Voices&nbsp;– Pakistan, August 21, 2008 |publisher=Eyeontheun.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121175822/http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |archive-date=January 21, 2013 }}</ref> Afghanistan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |title=Home |publisher=AIDSPortal |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081026065259/http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |archive-date=2008-10-26 }}</ref><ref name="travel.state.gov">{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |title=Iran |publisher=Travel.state.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801084310/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |archive-date=2013-08-01 }}</ref> Iran,<ref name="travel.state.gov"/> Kuwait,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=United Nations Human Rights Website&nbsp;– Treaty Bodies Database&nbsp;– Document&nbsp;– Summary Record&nbsp;– Kuwait |publisher=Unhchr.ch}}</ref> Maldives,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/Maldives.html |title=Culture of Maldives&nbsp;– history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social |publisher=Everyculture.com}}</ref> Morocco,<ref>{{cite news|last=Fakim |first=Nora |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19049000 |title=BBC News&nbsp;– Morocco: Should pre-marital sex be legal? |work=BBC |date=9 August 2012}}</ref> Oman,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215043802/http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archive-date=15 December 2007 |title=Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children&nbsp;– Oman |publisher=Interpol}}</ref> Mauritania,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154358.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Mauritania |publisher=State.gov |date=8 April 2011}}</ref> United Arab Emirates,<ref>{{cite web|author=Dubai FAQs |url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/education-dubai.php |title=Education in Dubai |publisher=Dubaifaqs.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Judd |first=Terri |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/briton-faces-jail-for-sex-on-dubai-beach-863918.html |title=Briton faces jail for sex on Dubai beach&nbsp;– Middle East&nbsp;– World |work=The Independent |date=10 July 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Sudan,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/28/idUSL28849488._CH_.2400 |title=Sudan must rewrite rape laws to protect victims |agency=Reuters |date=28 June 2007}}</ref> and Yemen<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47387b712f.html/ |title=Refworld &#124; Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa&nbsp;– Yemen |publisher=UNHCR}}</ref>).

The social role of the [[mother]] differs between cultures. In many parts of the world, women with dependent children are expected to stay at home and dedicate all their energy to child raising, while in other places mothers most often return to paid work (see [[Working parent|working mother]] and [[Housewife|stay-at-home mother]]).

== Religion ==
{{Further|Women in Christianity|Women in Judaism|Women in Islam|Women in Mormonism|Women in Hinduism|Women in Sikhism|Women in Buddhism}}
Particular religious doctrines have specific stipulations relating to [[gender roles]], social and private interaction between the sexes, appropriate dressing attire for women, and various other issues affecting women and their position in society. In many countries, these religious teachings influence the [[criminal law]], or the [[family law]] of those jurisdictions (see [[Sharia law]], for example). The relation between religion, law and gender equality has been discussed by international organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp/html/http%3Cspan%20class=%27pullme%27%3EIt%20has%20become%20increasingly%20clear%20that%20disasters%20are%20setting%20back%20efforts%20in%20development%20%E2%80%93%20they%20can%20cripple%20the%20economy,%20destroy%20infrastructure,%20and%20plunge%20more%20people%20into%20poverty%3C/span%3E://www.unisdr.org/www.sealthedeal2009.org/petition/html/story.asp?NewsID=46370&Cr=religion&Cr1=#.Ustsg_tpCKE |title=United Nations News Centre&nbsp;— Harmful practices against women and girls can never be justified by religion&nbsp;– UN expert |publisher=Un.org |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{Main|Female education}}
[[Single-sex education]] has traditionally been dominant and is still highly relevant. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender, is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries. In some Western countries, women have surpassed men at many levels of education. For example, in the United States in 2005/2006, women earned 62% of associate degrees, 58% of bachelor's degrees, 60% of master's degrees, and 50% of doctorates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_178.asp |title=Historical summary of faculty, students, degrees, and finances in degree-granting institutions: Selected years, 1869-70 through 2005-06 |publisher=Nces.ed.gov |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=Eisenhart, A.

The educational [[Sex ratio|gender gap]] in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries has been reduced over the last 30 years. Younger women today are far more likely to have completed a tertiary qualification: in 19 of the 30 OECD countries, more than twice as many women aged 25 to 34 have completed tertiary education than have women aged 55 to 64. In 21 of 27 OECD countries with comparable data, the number of women graduating from university-level programmes is equal to or exceeds that of men. 15-year-old girls tend to show much higher expectations for their careers than boys of the same age.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/31/0,2340,en_2649_201185_33710751_1_1_1_1,00.html Education Levels Rising in OECD Countries but Low Attainment Still Hampers Some, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], Publication Date: 14 September 2004]. Retrieved December 2006.</ref>
While women account for more than half of university graduates in several OECD countries, they receive only 30% of tertiary degrees granted in science and engineering fields, and women account for only 25% to 35% of researchers in most OECD countries.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/13/0,2340,en_2649_33703_37682893_1_1_1_1,00.html Women in Scientific Careers: Unleashing the Potential, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], {{ISBN|92-64-02537-5}}, 2006].

Research shows that while women are studying at prestigious universities at the same rate as men they are not being given the same chance to join the faculty. Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman has observed that the more prestigious an institute is, the more difficult and time-consuming it will be for women to obtain a faculty position there. In 1989, Harvard University tenured its first woman in chemistry, Cynthia Friend, and in 1992 its first woman in physics, Melissa Franklin. She also observed that women were more likely to hold their first [[professional]] positions as instructors and lecturers while men are more likely to work first in tenure positions. According to Smith and Tang, as of 1989, 65 percent of men and only 40 percent of women held tenured positions and only 29 percent of all scientists and engineers employed as assistant professors in four-year colleges and universities were women.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Brainard, Susanne G.; Carlin, Linda |title=A six-year Longitudinal Study of Undergraduate Women in Engineering and Science:The Gender and Science Reader|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=24–37}}</ref>

In 1992, women earned 9 percent of the PhDs awarded in [[engineering]], but only one percent of those women became professors. In 1995, 11 percent of professors in science and engineering were women. In relation, only 311 deans of engineering schools were women, which is less than 1 percent of the total. Even in [[psychology]], a degree in which women earn the majority of PhDs, they hold a significant amount of fewer tenured positions, roughly 19 percent in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has feminism changed science ?: Meters of Equity|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press}}</ref>

=== Literacy ===
{{main|Literacy}}
World literacy is lower for females than for males. The CIA World Factbook presents an estimate from 2010 which shows that 80% of women are literate, compared to 88.6% of men (aged 15 and over). Literacy rates are lowest in South and West Asia, and in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>

[[Women's suffrage in the United States]] was achieved gradually, first at state and local levels, starting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and in 1920 women in the US received universal suffrage, with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Some Western countries were slow to allow women to vote, notably Switzerland, where women gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1971, and in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women were granted the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=Experts In Women'S Anti-Discrimination Committee Raise Questions Concerning Reports Of Switzerland On Compliance With Convention |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> and [[Liechtenstein]], in 1984, through [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|a women's suffrage referendum]].

Women have, throughout history, made contributions to science, [[literature]] and [[art]]. One area where women have been permitted most access historically was that of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]] (prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was undertaken by women; from the mid 18th century onwards, medical monitoring of pregnant women started to require rigorous formal education, to which women did not generally have access, and thus the practice was largely transferred to men).<ref name="Gelis">Gelis, Jacues.

London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1051–1052.</ref>

Writing was generally also considered acceptable for upper-class women, although achieving success as a female writer in a male-dominated world could be very difficult; as a result of several women writers adopted a male pen name (e.g. [[George Sand]], [[George Eliot]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Women have been [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. There are music movements,{{clarify|date=December 2018}} events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

[[File:Ella Fitzgerald 1968.jpg|thumb|right|175px|American singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]] in 1968]]

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.<ref>Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103</ref> Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "... to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."<ref name="parlorsongs.com">{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref>

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "... too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "... to look sexy onstage and in photos."<ref name="music.cbc.ca">{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap |title=CBC Music |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |archive-date=2016-03-01 }}</ref> Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks, ... the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."<ref name="music.cbc.ca"/>

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the classical music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref> In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref>
