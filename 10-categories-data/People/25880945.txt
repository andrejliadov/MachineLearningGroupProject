The '''Bluff Cove air attacks''' occurred 8 June 1982, during the [[Falklands War]]. [[Round Table class landing ship logistics ship|British troop transport ships]] were bombed by the [[Argentine Air Force]] (FAA) whilst unloading, with significant damage and casualties.

==Background==
By 1 June, British forces on the [[Falkland Islands]] were bolstered by the arrival of 5,000 new troops of the [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]]. Major General [[Jeremy Moore]] now had sufficient force to start planning a full-scale assault on [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Port Stanley]].

Advance parties of the [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] moved forward and occupied [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]] and [[Bluff Cove]], when it was discovered to be clear of Argentine forces. Units of the [[Welsh Guards]] and [[Scots Guards]] were to be sent in to support them. After the sinking of the transport [[MV Atlantic Conveyor|''Atlantic Conveyor'']] there was only one British heavy-lift helicopter available, an RAF [[CH-47 Chinook]], ''[[Bravo November]]''.<ref>McCann, Carol and Pigeau, Ross (2000). ''The human in command: exploring the modern military experience''. Springer, p. 59. {{ISBN|0-306-46366-0}}</ref> Therefore, supplies and reinforcements would have to be transported by ships of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]],<ref name=bol>Bolia, p. 68</ref> which were manned by civilian sailors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Puddefoot|first=Geoff|title= Ready For Anything: The Royal Fleet Auxiliary 1905-1950 pp. 69-70|year=2010|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|isbn=978-1-848-32074-1}}</ref>

==Air strikes==
While unloading on 8 June, the British ships were attacked by two waves of [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s from the [[Argentine Air Force]]'s 5th Air Brigade, each of them loaded with three 500&nbsp;lb [[Mark 81 bomb|retarding tail bombs]] of [[Spain|Spanish]] design.<ref>Moro, Rubén Oscar (1985).

The aircraft was eventually written off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/barmavn/aac/656-sqn|title=656 Sqn - British Army & Royal Marine Aviation|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Falklands: The Air War|last=Burden|first=Rodney A.|publisher=British Aviation Research Group|year=1986|isbn=0906339057|pages=406}}</ref>

Six Argentine [[IAI Dagger]] fighters simultaneously took off from the airbase at [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego|Río Grande]] for a complementary mission, led by a [[Learjet]] which provided navigation information. One of the Daggers subsequently returned to base due to refueling issues. The attacking aircraft were preceded by four [[Mirage III]] fighters which took off from Río Grande airbase to carry out a decoy mission over the north of the islands in order to draw away the British [[Sea Harrier]]s and allow the Skyhawks and Daggers to carry out their attacks unmolested, while the Argentine destroyer [[ARA Santísima Trinidad (1974)|ARA ''Santísima Trinidad'']] broadcast interference signals to jam the frequencies used by the Royal Navy's air controllers directing Sea Harrier operations.<ref>West, p. 37</ref><ref>https://smallwarsjournal.com/documents/bolia1.pdf</ref> The nuclear submarine [[HMS Valiant (S102)|HMS ''Valiant'']], on picket duty off Río Grande, was able to track the six Dagger fighters that took off from the airbase there, but the report from the submarine failed to reach the British forces at Bluff Cove.<ref name=nig>West, p. 39</ref>

===First strike===
At approximately 14:00 local time the ships [[RFA Sir Tristram|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] and [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA Sir ''Galahad'']] were badly damaged<ref>{{citation |title=Task Force Falklands: Goose Green |url=http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/falklands/page5.shtml |work=[[National Army Museum]] |access-date=20 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719102137/http://www.national-army-museum.ac.uk/exhibitions/falklands/page5.shtml# |archive-date=19 July 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> by five A-4Bs of ''Grupo 5''. Three A-4s targeted ''Sir Galahad'', which was hit by three bombs released from the Skyhawk flown by First Lieutenant Carlos Cachón. The second Skyhawk was unable to drop its bombs, and the third overshot the British ship.<ref name=nig/>

The remaining two aircraft attacked ''Sir Tristram'', which was struck by two bombs released by package leader Lieutenant Daniel Gálvez; the bombs of the last A-4 fell short.<ref name=nig/> The explosions and subsequent fires killed 48 men aboard ''Sir Galahad'', of whom 32 were soldiers from the [[Welsh Guards]], 11 were other army personnel, and five were crewmen of the ''Sir Galahad'', among them two [[Hong Kong]] Chinese sailors. The attack on ''Sir Tristram'' killed two crewmen, both of them Hong Kong Chinese sailors.<ref>[http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1980-89.htm Casualty Lists of the Royal Navy, 1980–89]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=Invalid date|title=The war within|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/596179/war-within|access-date=2020-07-16|website=South China Morning Post|language=en}}</ref>

===Second strike===

At 16:50 a second wave, composed by four A-4Bs of ''Grupo 5'' hit and sank the [[Landing Craft Utility]] (LCU) Foxtrot-4 from [[HMS Fearless (L10)|HMS ''Fearless'']] in [[Choiseul Sound]].<ref>Schofield, Frank (1999).

Six [[Royal Marines]] on board were killed. However, this time the Sea Harrier [[combat air patrol]] was already on scene and responded; three Skyhawks were shot down and their pilots, First Lieutenant Danilo Bolzan, Lieutenant Juan Arrarás, and Ensign Alfredo Vazquez were killed.<ref name=moro/>

Bolzan and Vazquez were shot down by Flight Lieutenant [[David Morgan (pilot)|David Morgan]] while Arrarás was shot down by Morgan's wingman, Lieutenant David Smith.<ref>Chant, Christopher (2001).

===Attack on HMS ''Plymouth''===

In a separate incident, the frigate [[HMS Plymouth (F126)|HMS ''Plymouth'']] endured the sudden attack of the Daggers from Rio Grande, which struck her with four 1,000-pound bombs. The warship sustained severe damage, and five crewmen were injured. Although all the bombs were duds, the attack caused the explosion of at least one depth charge on her flight deck.<ref>Chun, Clayton K S. (2001). ''Aerospace power in the twenty-first century: a basic primer''. Diane publishing, p. 235. {{ISBN|1-58566-091-4}}</ref>

==Aftermath==

A total of 56 British servicemen were killed, and 150 wounded.<ref name="about.com"/> The incident marked the greatest loss of life among British forces in a single incident since [[World War II]], and accounted for one-fifth of British fatalities in the entire Falklands War.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fitzroy and the Welsh Guards|url=https://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/modern-world-history-1918-to-1980/the-falklands-war-1982/fitzroy-and-the-welsh-guards/|access-date=2020-07-16|website=History Learning Site|language=en-GB}}</ref> ''Sir Galahad'' was damaged beyond repair and scuttled, but her sister ship survived to be re-built post-war. American author Robert Bolia blames the disaster on the use of large LST ships instead of LCUs and other small vessels.<ref name=bol/> 

[[BBC]] television cameras recorded images of Royal Navy helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.<ref>{{citation |title=Falklands War Compilation, (Clip 6) |year=1982|url=http://www.itnsource.com/compilations/crimeandconflict/war/?lr=S07020702#clipImage6 |work=[[ITN Source]]}}</ref> These images were seen around the world. However, General [[Mario Menendez]], commander of Argentine forces on the islands, was told that hundreds of men had been killed. He expected a drop in British morale, and their advance to slacken.<ref>Anderson, Duncan (2002). ''The Falklands War 1982''. Volume 15 of Essential histories. Osprey Publishing, p. 61. {{ISBN|1-84176-422-1}}</ref> In fact, the attacks delayed the scheduled British advance on Port Stanley by just two days, and Argentine forces on the Falkland Islands surrendered six days after the incident.<ref>https://home.bt.com/news/on-this-day/june-8-1982-56-die-at-bluff-cove-as-argentine-jets-bomb-sir-galahad-and-sir-tristram-11363985293359</ref> 

According to Brigadier [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]];
{{quote|[5 Brigade] actually hadn't seen the Argentine Air Force work, 'cause for the five days they'd been there, the bad weather had kept the Argentine Air Force away; so they hadn't seen how deadly those guys could be. I can tell you, if I'd have been on board that ship I would have swam ashore rather than stay there<ref>Channel 5, The Great Falklands Gamble: Revealed, available at http://vimeo.com/65418997 at [http://vimeo.com/65418997#t=34m20s 34:20]</ref>}}

Among the wounded was [[Simon Weston]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Jolly | first = Rick | title = The Red and Green Life Machine | publisher = Century | location = London | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-7126-0158-0 |page= 124}}</ref> who later featured in a BBC documentary showing his treatment for the appalling injuries he received. Weston endured 75 operations in 22 years, after 25% of his skin suffered [[third degree burn]]s. In a subsequent documentary, filmed in Argentina, he met the pilot who bombed his ship, Carlos Cachón, then retired with the rank of Captain. After a later visit of Cachón and his family to Weston's home in [[Liverpool]], they have become great friends.<ref>[https://archive.is/gMVT "I'm honoured. I'm just a little fat bloke"], by Rachel Tinniswood, Liverpool Echo, 7 September 2001</ref>

Carlos Cachón was born near [[Balcarce, Buenos Aires Province|Balcarce]] and raised in [[Mar del Plata]], where he currently lives. He is the chief of the security staff in the local offices of the [[Banco de la Nación Argentina|Argentina National Bank]]. Cachón was awarded the honorific title of "Illustrious Citizen" by the [[City council|City Council]] of Mar del Plata on 25 February 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title=El Concejo distinguirá a Carlos Cachón – mdphoy.com|url=https://www.mdphoy.com/el-concejo-distinguira-a-carlos-cachon-15810/|access-date=2020-06-03|language=es}}</ref>

After the war, a memorial for the British soldiers killed in the attack was erected at Fitzroy,<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Belcher |title=After the Battle |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/ATB/index.htm |year=2000 |work=britains-smallwars.com |access-date=20 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105035655/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/ATB/index.htm# |archive-date=5 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{citation |first=Hendrik |last=Meersschaert |title=The South Atlantic Medal to Mark Gibby |url=http://hendrik.atspace.com/hall/Hal-Gibby.htm |access-date=20 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622081801/http://hendrik.atspace.com/hall/Hal-Gibby.htm# |archive-date=22 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> along with a separate memorial to the ships' crew who lost their lives.
