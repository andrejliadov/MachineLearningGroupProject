The '''relic of the tooth of Buddha''' ([[Pali]] ''danta dhātuya'') is venerated in [[Sri Lanka]] as a [[cetiya]] relic of [[Gautama Buddha]], on whose teachings [[Buddhism]] was founded.

==History==
===The relic in India===
According to Sri Lankan legends, when the Buddha died in 543 BC, his body was cremated in a [[sandalwood]] pyre at [[Kushinagar]] and his left canine tooth was retrieved from the funeral pyre by his disciple, [[Khema]]. Khema then gave it to King Brahmadatte for veneration.<ref name="about">{{cite web|title=The Buddha's Tooth|url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhistholidays/a/The-Buddhas-Tooth.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|access-date=May 12, 2013}}</ref> It became a royal possession in Brahmadatte's country and was kept in the city of Dantapuri (modern [[Puri]], [[Odisha]]).

A belief grew that whoever possessed the tooth relic had a divine right to rule that land.<ref name="time">{{cite news|title=Top 10 Religious Relics|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1983194_1983193_1983197,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=May 12, 2013|date=April 19, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Dathavamsa|Dāṭhāvaṃsa]]'' recounts the tale of a war fought over the relic 800 years later between Guhasiva of [[Kalinga (Indian literature)|the republic of Kalinga]] and a king named Pandu.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dhammakitti|title=The Daṭhávansa; or, The history of the tooth-relic of Gotama Buddha &#91;by Dhammakitti&#93;.

Legend states the [[Abhayagiri vihāra]] was first appointed custodianship of the relic when it was brought to the island after the conflict in Kalinga. As time went on, the land was threatened with foreign invasions; at one time, the king of [[Bago, Burma]] offered the Portuguese £50,000 as a ransom of the tooth;<ref name="about"/> and the seat of the kingdom was moved from [[Anuradhapura]] to [[Polonnaruwa]], then to [[Dambadeniya]] and other cities. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the relic.  Finally, it was brought to [[Kandy]] where it is at present, in the [[Temple of the Tooth]].<ref name="time"/> The scholar Charles Boxer, however, asserts that the tooth was "publicly pounded to smithereens with a mortar and pestle by the Archbishop of Goa"<ref>Charles R. Boxer, <i>The Portuguese Seaborne Mission 1415-1825</i>, London, 1969, p. 74</ref> as one of the results of the Church's attempt to eradicate native religions [no date given but inferred 1550s or so].

The relic came to be regarded as a symbolic representation of the living Buddha and it is on this basis that there grew up a series of offerings, rituals, and ceremonies. These are conducted under the supervision of the two [[Mahanayaka]]s of Malwatte, Asgiriya chapters, and [[Diyawadana Nilame]] of the Maligawa.  These have a hierarchy of officials and temple functionaries to perform the services and rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
