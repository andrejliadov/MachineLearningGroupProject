A '''bus driver''', '''bus operator''', '''autobus driver''' or '''omnibus driver''' is a person who drives [[bus]]es for a living.

== Description ==
In many jurisdictions, bus drivers must have a special license above and beyond a regular [[driver's licence]]. Bus drivers typically drive their vehicles between [[bus station]]s or stops. Bus drivers often drop off and pick up passengers on a predetermined route schedule. In [[British English]] a different term, [[Coach (bus)|coach]] driver (or coach captain), is used for drivers on privately booked long-distance routes, tours and school trips.

There are various types of bus drivers, including transit drivers, school bus drivers and tour bus drivers. Bus drivers may work for a city, public ([[Federated state|state]] and national/[[Federal republic|federal]]) governments, school boards, and private enterprises, such as charter companies which run tour buses. Coach captains in Australia are frequently [[freelance]] [[sub-contractor]]s who work for various bus and coach companies. Bus drivers also need to possess social skills for interacting with their passengers, which is a daily occurrence.

== By country ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], bus and coach drivers need a [[Driving licence in Australia|''Drivers Licence'']] (issued in an Australian state or territory) for the class of vehicle they drive.

Additionally, they are required to possess a driver authorisation to drive a bus (also issued by the state or territory). This has different names in different states, for example, Driver Authorisation in Queensland, Driver Accreditation in Victoria, General Driver Authorisation in New South Wales, Public Passenger Vehicle Ancillary Certificate in Tasmania and so on.  This authorisation entails a regular review of driving history, criminal history, and medical assessment for fitness to drive.

In 2012, Australia had a fleet of 90,599 buses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/9309.0?OpenDocument|title=9309.0 - Motor Vehicle Census, Australia|date= 31 January 2017|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}</ref> and collectively travelled about 2.0 billion km.  The average age of the national fleet is 11.0 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Transport%20equipment~190|title=1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2012 - 24.26 REGISTERED MOTOR VEHICLES—31 January 2011 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}</ref>

In 2011, there were 40,900 bus and coach drivers employed in the industry.  They work an average of 41.7 hours/week and the average age is 54 years.  The main employing industries are ''Transport, Postal and Warehousing'' 87.4%, and the remainder include ''Health Care and Social Assistance'' 4%, ''Education and Training'' 3.1%, and ''Accommodation and Food Services'' 2.7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joboutlook.gov.au/pages/occupation.aspx?search=&tab=stats&cluster=&code=7312|title=Job Outlook - Make Your Career a Reality}}</ref>

=== New Zealand ===
Bus and coach drivers require either a class 2 or class 4 [[Driving licence in New Zealand|heavy vehicle licence]] corresponding to the weight and number of axles of their vehicle. As of October 1, 2017, drivers are not required to hold a P (passenger) endorsement to take fare-paying passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/p-endorsement-passenger-services-licence/|date=11 September 2017|title=How to get a passenger service licence}}</ref> The change in legislation was seen by passenger service companies as the government acquiescing to Uber drivers ignoring [[NZ Transport Agency|NZ Transport Agency's]] requirements despite ramping up infringement notices on non-compliant drivers in the last few months of P endorsement requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/93501775/Crackdown-on-Uber-drivers-sees-hundreds-of-bans-and-infringement-notices-issued|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=11 June 2017|title=Crackdown on Uber drivers sees hundreds of bans and infringement notices issued}}</ref>

Drivers of school buses for special needs children must comply with SESTA requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://education.govt.nz/school/running-a-school/school-transport/sesta/|title=School Transport - SESTA|date=11 September 2017|publisher=Ministry of Education}}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
In the [[United Kingdom]] drivers must have passed the Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcvlicencetraining.co.uk|title=Home - PCV Licence Training – PCV Licence Training|website=PCV Licence Training}}</ref> practical driving and theory test. PCV drivers also have to possess a Certificate of Professional Competence card which requires extra training to be taken.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/driver-cpc-training|title=Driver CPC training for qualified drivers|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Service bus drivers in the UK are not subject to the working hours restrictions devised by the European Union if their journeys do not exceed 30 miles radius, but are governed by less stringent UK Drivers' Hours Regulations. For example, a service bus driver may drive for 5.5 hours without a break in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rules-on-drivers-hours-and-tachographs-passenger-vehicles|title=Drivers’ hours and tachographs rules: buses and coaches (PSV375) - Guidance - GOV.UK}}</ref>

People with certain medical conditions are excluded from becoming bus drivers. Some of these conditions include [[Migraine]] (if it affects vision), [[Alcoholism]] and [[Epilepsy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvtani.gov.uk/uploads/practicaltest/LGVPCV/MedicalRules.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903003120/http://www.dvtani.gov.uk/uploads/practicaltest/LGVPCV/MedicalRules.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-03 }}</ref>

Traditionally, before the introduction of one-man buses on many city routes, the bus driver had no contact with the passengers, the tickets being sold by a [[conductor (transportation)|bus conductor]]. Now, drivers have the additional responsibility of selling tickets, keeping to the timetable and providing customer service.

Because of the additional workload many buses are fitted with [[closed-circuit television]] in an attempt to protect drivers from an increasing number of attacks which has resulted in a recruitment crisis in some British cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3147870.stm|title=BBC NEWS - England - Attacks spark bus driver crisis|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

=== United States ===

{{As of|2016}}, there are approximately 687,200 U.S. employed bus drivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/bus-drivers.htm|title=Bus Drivers : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics}}</ref>  One of the most common jobs in the [[United States]] for a bus driver is to work for a [[State school|public school]], transporting students aboard a [[school bus]] to and from the school building. As of 2004, 71% of bus drivers in the U.S. were employed by schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jobandsalaryabroad.com/en/usa/english-schoolbusdriver-usa.html|title=School Bus Drivers in the USA - Salary, Requirements, Benefits: : JobAndSalaryAbroad.com}}</ref> In other countries, school transport is often provided by the same companies that run other bus services in the area, so school bus driver is not a separate position.

In the United States, finding a position as a bus driver usually requires that the individual possess a [[commercial driver's license]] (CDL) and specialized training for the vehicle. Various other educational and vocational training may be required, but this varies from place to place.
