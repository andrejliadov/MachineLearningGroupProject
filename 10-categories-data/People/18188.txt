''' Lyman Frank Baum''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɔː|m}};<ref>{{cite Dictionary.com|Baum}}</ref> May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919) was an American author best known for his children's books, particularly ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its sequels. He wrote 14 novels in the ''Oz'' series, plus 41 other novels (not including four lost, unpublished novels), 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and screen; the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 adaptation]] of the first ''Oz'' book became a landmark of 20th-century cinema.

Born and raised in [[Upstate New York]], Baum moved west after an unsuccessful stint as a theater producer and playwright.  He and his wife opened a store in [[South Dakota]] and he edited and published a newspaper.  They then moved to [[Chicago]], where he worked as a newspaper reporter and published children's literature, coming out with the first ''Oz'' book in 1900.  While continuing his writing, among his final projects he sought to establish a movie studio focused on children's films in [[Los Angeles]], California.   

His works anticipated such later commonplaces as television, [[augmented reality]], laptop computers (''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]''), wireless telephones (''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (''[[Mary Louise in the Country]]''), and the ubiquity of clothes advertising (''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work]]'').

==Childhood and early life==
Baum was born in [[Chittenango, New York]], in 1856 into a devout [[Methodist]] family. He had [[German American|German]], [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] and [[England|English]] ancestry. He was the seventh of nine children of Cynthia Ann (née Stanton) and Benjamin Ward Baum, only five of whom survived into adulthood.<ref>Rogers, p. 1.</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Oz: The Wizard of Oz, The Emerald City of Oz, Glinda of Oz|author1=Baum, L.F.|author2=Zipes, J.|author3=Denslow, W.W.|date=1998|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=9781440674358|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVlPdbOSB6AC|access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref> "Lyman" was the name of his father's brother, but he always disliked it and preferred his middle name "Frank".<ref>Hearn, Introduction, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. xv n. 3.</ref>
[[File:Cadet L. Frank Baum 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Young Baum in the [[Peekskill Military Academy]]]]
His father succeeded in many businesses, including barrel-making, [[oil drilling]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and real estate. Baum grew up on his parents' expansive estate called Rose Lawn, which he fondly recalled as a sort of paradise.<ref>Rogers, pp. 2–3.</ref> Rose Lawn was located in [[Mattydale, New York]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freethought-trail.org/trail-map/location:l-frank-baum-childhood-home/|title=L. Frank Baum Childhood Home - Freethought Trail - New York|website=freethought-trail.org}}</ref> Frank was a sickly, dreamy child, tutored at home with his siblings. From the age of 12, he spent two miserable years at [[Peekskill Military Academy]] but, after being severely disciplined for daydreaming, he had a possibly [[Psychogenic pain|psychogenic]] [[heart attack]] and was allowed to return home.<ref>Rogers, pp. 3–4.</ref>

Baum started writing early in life, possibly prompted by his father buying him a cheap [[printing press]]. He had always been close to his younger brother Henry (Harry) Clay Baum, who helped in the production of ''The Rose Lawn Home Journal''. The brothers published several issues of the journal, including advertisements from local businesses, which they gave to family and friends for free.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Evan|title=Finding Oz: How L. Frank Baum Discovered the Great American Story|date=2009|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547055107|page=16}}</ref> By the age of 17, Baum established a second amateur journal called ''The Stamp Collector'', printed an 11-page pamphlet called ''Baum's Complete Stamp Dealers' Directory'', and started a [[stamp dealer]]ship with  friends.<ref>Rogers, pp. 4–5.</ref>

At 20, Baum took on the national craze of breeding fancy poultry. He specialized in raising the [[Hamburg (chicken)|Hamburg chicken]]. In March 1880, he established a monthly trade journal, ''The Poultry Record'', and in 1886, when Baum was 30 years old, his first book was published: ''The Book of the Hamburgs: A Brief Treatise upon the Mating, Rearing, and Management of the Different Varieties of Hamburgs''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/cu31924003117854|title=The Book of the Hamburgs; a brief treatise upon the mating, rearing and management of the varieties of Hamburgs|first=L. Frank (Lyman Frank)|last=Baum|date=June 24, 1886|publisher=Hartford, H. H. Stoddard|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

Baum had a flair for being the spotlight of fun in the household, including during times of financial difficulties. His selling of fireworks made the [[Fourth of July]] memorable. His skyrockets, Roman candles, and [[fireworks]] filled the sky, while many people around the neighborhood would gather in front of the house to watch the displays. [[Christmas]] was even more festive. Baum dressed as [[Santa Claus]] for the family. His father would place the Christmas tree behind a curtain in the front parlor so that Baum could talk to everyone while he decorated the tree without people managing to see him. He maintained this tradition all his life.<ref>Rogers, pp. 49.</ref>

==Career==
===Theater===
Baum embarked on his lifetime infatuation—and wavering financial success—with the theater.<ref>Rogers, pp. 8–9, 16–17 and ff.</ref> A local theatrical company duped him into replenishing their stock of costumes on the promise of leading roles coming his way. Disillusioned, Baum left the theater—temporarily—and went to work as a clerk in his brother-in-law's dry goods company in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. This experience may have influenced his story "The Suicide of Kiaros", first published in the literary journal ''The White Elephant''. A fellow clerk one day was found locked in a store room dead, probably from suicide.

Baum could never stay away long from the stage. He performed in plays under the stage names of Louis F. Baum and George Brooks.<ref>Rogers, p. 6.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Abrams|first=Dennis|title=L. Frank Baum|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-604-13501-5|page=122}}</ref> In 1880, his father built him a theater in [[Richburg, New York]], and Baum set about writing plays and gathering a company to act in them. ''[[The Maid of Arran]]'' proved a modest success, a [[melodrama]] with songs based on [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]]'s novel ''A Princess of Thule''. Baum wrote the play and composed songs for it (making it a prototypical [[musical play|musical]], as its songs relate to the narrative), and acted in the leading role. His aunt Katharine Gray played his character's aunt. She was the founder of Syracuse Oratory School, and Baum advertised his services in her catalog to teach theater, including stage business, play writing, directing, translating (French, German, and Italian), revision, and [[operettas]]<!---following clause deleted as it makes no sense: though he was not employed to do so--->.

On November 9, 1882, Baum married [[Maud Gage Baum|Maud Gage]], a daughter of [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a famous [[women's suffrage]] and [[first wave feminism|feminist]] activist. While Baum was touring with ''The Maid of Arran'', the theater in Richburg caught fire during a production of Baum's ironically titled parlor drama ''Matches'', destroying the theater as well as the only known copies of many of Baum's scripts, including ''Matches'', as well as costumes.

===The South Dakota years===
In July 1888, Baum and his wife moved to [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen, Dakota Territory]] where he opened a store called "Baum's Bazaar". His habit of giving out wares on credit led to the eventual bankrupting of the store,<ref>Rogers, pp. 23–5.</ref> so Baum turned to editing the local newspaper ''The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' where he wrote the column ''Our Landlady''.<ref>Rogers, pp. 25–7 and ff.</ref> Following the death of [[Sitting Bull]] at the hands of Indian agency police, Baum urged the wholesale extermination of all America's native peoples in a column that he wrote on December 20, 1890 (full text below).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=JJ|title=L. Frank Baum Advocated Extermination Of Native Americans|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/10/27/130862391/l-frank-baum-advocated-extermination-of-native-americans|access-date=20 May 2017|publisher=NPR|date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> On January 3, 1891, he returned to the subject in an editorial response to the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]:<ref>Stannard, David E, ''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World'', Oxford Press, 1992, page 126 {{ISBN|0-19-508557-4}}</ref>

<blockquote>The Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extirmination {{sic}} of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth.<ref>[https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/second/en213/term1/l_frank_baum.pdf Hastings, A.

Baum's description of [[Kansas]] in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is based on his experiences in drought-ridden [[South Dakota]]. During much of this time, [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] was living in the Baum household. While Baum was in South Dakota, he sang in a quartet which included [[James H. Kyle|James Kyle]], who became one of the first [[populism|Populist]] ([[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]]) Senators in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date = December 2012}}<ref>Koupal</ref>

===Writing===
[[File:Baum poster 1b.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Promotional Poster for Baum's "Popular Books For Children", {{circa|1901}}]]
Baum's newspaper failed in 1891, and he, Maud, and their four sons moved to the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] section of [[Chicago]], where Baum took a job reporting for the ''Evening Post''. Beginning in 1897, he founded and edited a magazine called ''The Show Window'',<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.vmsd.com/content/throwbackthursday|title=#ThrowbackThursday|work=Visual Merchandising and Store Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref> later known as the ''Merchants Record and Show Window'', which focused on store window displays, retail strategies and visual merchandising. The major department stores of the time created elaborate Christmastime fantasies, using clockwork mechanisms that made people and animals appear to move. The former ''Show Window'' magazine is still currently in operation, now known as ''VMSD'' magazine<ref name=":0" /> (visual merchandising + store design), based in Cincinnati.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vmsd.com|title={{!}} Visual Merchandising and Store Design|work=Visual Merchandising and Store Design|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref> In 1900, Baum published a book about window displays in which he stressed the importance of mannequins in drawing customers.<ref name=Smithsonian>Emily and Per Ola d'Aulaire, "Mannequins: our fantasy figures of high fashion," ''Smithsonian'', Vol. 22, no. 1, April 1991</ref> He also had to work as a [[Vendor (supply chain)|traveling salesman]].<ref>Rogers, pp. 45–59.</ref>
[[File:W._W._Denslow_1900.png|right|thumb|upright|alt=Black and white photo of man seated, drawing at a desk|Denslow in 1900]]
In 1897, he wrote and published ''[[Mother Goose in Prose]]'', a collection of [[Mother Goose]] rhymes written as prose stories and illustrated by [[Maxfield Parrish]]. ''Mother Goose'' was a moderate success and allowed Baum to quit his  sales job (which had had a negative impact on his health). In 1899, Baum partnered with illustrator [[William Wallace Denslow|W. W. Denslow]] to publish ''[[Father Goose, His Book]]'', a collection of nonsense poetry. The book was a success, becoming the best-selling children's book of the year.<ref>Rogers, pp. 54–69 and ff.</ref>

====''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''====
{{main|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}
In 1900, Baum and Denslow (with whom he shared the copyright) published ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''  to much critical acclaim and financial success.<ref>Rogers, pp. 73–94.</ref> The book was the best-selling children's book for two years after its initial publication. Baum went on to write thirteen more novels based on the places and people of the [[Land of Oz]].

====''The Wizard of Oz: Fred R. Hamlin's Musical Extravaganza''====
[[File:Tin-Man-poster-Hamlin.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|1903 poster of Dave Montgomery as the Tin Man in Hamlin's musical stage version.]]
Two years after ''Wizard''{{'s}} publication, Baum and Denslow teamed up with composer [[Paul Tietjens]] and director Julian Mitchell to produce a [[The Wizard of Oz (1902 stage play)|musical stage version]] of the book under Fred R. Hamlin.<ref>Rogers, pp. 105–10.</ref> Baum and Tietjens had worked on a musical of ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' in 1901 and based closely upon the book, but it was rejected. This stage version opened in Chicago in 1902 (the first to use the shortened title "The Wizard of Oz"), then ran on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use. The stage version starred Anna Laughlin as [[Dorothy Gale]], alongside David C. Montgomery and [[Fred Stone]] as the [[Tin Woodman]] and [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]] respectively, which shot the pair to instant fame.

The stage version differed quite a bit from the book, and was aimed primarily at adults. Toto was replaced with Imogene the Cow, and Tryxie Tryfle (a waitress) and [[Pastoria]] (a streetcar operator) were added as fellow cyclone victims. The Wicked Witch of the West was eliminated entirely in the script, and the plot became about how the four friends were allied with the usurping Wizard and were hunted as traitors to Pastoria II, the rightful King of Oz. It is unclear how much control or influence Baum had on the script; it appears that many of the changes were written by Baum against his wishes due to contractual requirements with Hamlin. Jokes in the script, mostly written by Glen MacDonough, called for explicit references to President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Senator [[Mark Hanna]], Rev. Andrew Danquer, and oil tycoon [[John D. Rockefeller]]. Although use of the script was rather free-form, the line about Hanna was ordered dropped as soon as Hamlin got word of his death in 1904.

Beginning with the success of the stage version, most subsequent versions of the story, including newer editions of the novel, have been titled "The Wizard of Oz", rather than using the full, original title. In more recent years, restoring the full title has become increasingly common, particularly to distinguish the novel from the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film]].

Baum wrote a new Oz book, ''[[The Marvelous Land of Oz]]'', with a view to making it into a stage production, which was titled ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', but Montgomery and Stone balked at appearing when the original was still running. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were then omitted from this adaptation, which was seen as a self-rip-off by critics and proved to be a major flop before it could reach Broadway. He also worked for years on a musical version of ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'', which eventually became ''[[The Tik-Tok Man of Oz]]''. This did fairly well in Los Angeles, but not well enough to convince producer [[Oliver Morosco]] to mount a production in New York. He also began a stage version of ''[[The Patchwork Girl of Oz]]'', but this was ultimately realized as a [[The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1914 film)|film]]''.

==Later life and work==
With the success of ''Wizard'' on page and stage, Baum and Denslow hoped for further success and published ''[[Dot and Tot of Merryland]]'' in 1901.<ref>Rogers, pp. 95–6.</ref> The book was one of Baum's weakest, and its failure further strained his faltering relationship with Denslow. It was their last collaboration. Baum worked primarily with [[John R. Neill]] on his fantasy work beginning in 1904, but Baum met Neill few times (all before he moved to California) and often found Neill's art not humorous enough for his liking. He was particularly offended when Neill published ''The Oz Toy Book: Cut-outs for the Kiddies'' without authorization.

Baum reportedly designed the chandeliers in the Crown Room of the [[Hotel del Coronado]]; however, that attribution has yet to be corroborated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Life of 'Oz' creator coming to big screen|publisher=San Diego Tribune|author=Bell, Diane|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/entertainment/sdut-frank-baum-coronado-movie-oz-wizard-golden-warner-2014sep22-story.html|date=September 22, 2014|access-date=March 30, 2019}}</ref> Several times during the development of the Oz series, Baum declared that he had written his last Oz book and devoted himself to other works of fantasy fiction based in other magical lands, including ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'' and ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]''. However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with ''[[The Master Key (novel)|The Master Key]]'' appearing on ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'''s survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.

In 1905, Baum declared plans for an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying Pedloe Island off the coast of California to turn it into an Oz park. However, there is no evidence that he purchased such an island, and no one has ever been able to find any island whose name even resembles Pedloe in that area.<ref name="thewizardofoz">{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?rlz=1T4ADRA_enUS335US336&gs_upl=0l0l3l496619lllllllllll0&hl=en&nfpr=1&q=cache:yc5lLfQhVK8J:http://thewizardofoz.info/wiki/Miscellaneous_questions+Pedloe+Island,+California&ct=clnk |title="Miscellaneous Questions" about L.

Cosman, in The Journal of San Diego History, Fall 1998, volume 44, Number 4 |publisher=sandiegohistory.org|access-date=May 27, 2015}}</ref>  Nevertheless, Baum stated to the press that he had discovered a Pedloe Island off the coast of California and that he had purchased it to be "the Marvelous Land of Oz," intending it to be "a fairy paradise for children."  Eleven year old Dorothy Talbot of San Francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on March 1, 1906, when the Palace of Oz was expected to be completed. Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and [[Woggle-Bug|H.M. Woggle-Bug, T.E.]]<ref>"First Princess of Oz and Owner of Island." June 18, 1905, unidentified Chicago newspaper clipping in the L. Frank Baum file at the New York Public Library of the Performing Arts</ref>  Baum abandoned his Oz park project after the failure of ''[[The Woggle-Bug (musical)|The Woggle-Bug]]'', which was playing at the Garrick Theatre in 1905.
[[File:L. Frank Baum and characters in The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays 1908.png|thumb|right|200px|Baum surrounded by the characters in ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'']]

Because of his lifelong love of theatre, he financed elaborate musicals, often to his financial detriment. One of Baum's worst financial endeavors was his ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'' (1908), which combined a slideshow, film, and live actors with a lecture by Baum as if he were giving a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] to Oz.<ref>Rogers, pp. 162–3; Hearn, ''Annotated Wizard'', pp. lxvi–lxxi.</ref> However, Baum ran into trouble and could not pay his debts to the company who produced the films. He did not get back to a stable financial situation for several years, after he sold the royalty rights to many of his earlier works, including ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. This resulted in the M.A. Donahue Company publishing cheap editions of his early works with advertising which purported that Baum's newer output was inferior to the less expensive books that they were releasing. He claimed bankruptcy in August 1911.<ref>{{cite news |title="Wizard of Oz" Bankrupt |access-date=5 July 2020 |publisher=The Los Angeles Times |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/380255853/?terms=wizard%2Bof%2Boz |date=15 August 1911 |page=22}}</ref> However, Baum had shrewdly transferred most of his property into Maud's name, except for his clothing, his typewriter, and his library (mostly of children's books, such as the fairy tales of [[Andrew Lang]], whose portrait he kept in his study)—all of which, he successfully argued, were essential to his occupation. Maud handled the finances anyway, and thus Baum lost much less than he could have.

{{anchor|pseudonyms}}Baum made use of several pseudonyms for some of his other non-Oz books. They include:
* Edith Van Dyne (the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'' series)
* Laura Bancroft (''[[The Twinkle Tales]]'', ''[[Policeman Bluejay]]'')
* Floyd Akers (''The Boy Fortune Hunters'' series, continuing the ''Sam Steele'' series)
* Suzanne Metcalf (''Annabel'')
* Schuyler Staunton (''[[The Fate of a Crown]]'', ''[[Daughters of Destiny (novel)|Daughters of Destiny]]'')
* John Estes Cooke (''Tamawaca Folks'')
* Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald (the ''Sam Steele'' series)

Baum also anonymously wrote ''[[The Last Egyptian]]: A Romance of the Nile''. He continued theatrical work with Harry Marston Haldeman's [[gentlemen's club|men's social group]] [[The Uplifters (club)|The Uplifters]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 182–3.</ref> for which he wrote several plays for various celebrations. He also wrote the group's parodic [[by-laws]]. The group also included [[Will Rogers]], but was proud to have had Baum as a member and posthumously revived many of his works despite their ephemeral intent. Many of these play's titles are known, but only ''[[The Uplift of Lucifer]]'' is known to survive (it was published in a limited edition in the 1960s). Prior to that, his last produced play was ''The Tik-Tok Man of Oz'' (based on ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' and the basis for ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]''), a modest success in Hollywood that producer [[Oliver Morosco]] decided did not do well enough to take to Broadway. Morosco, incidentally, quickly turned to film production, as did Baum.

In 1914, Baum started his own film production company [[The Oz Film Manufacturing Company]],<ref>Rogers, pp. 110, 177, 181, 202–5 and ff.</ref> which came as an outgrowth of the Uplifters. He served as its president and principal producer and screenwriter. The rest of the board consisted of [[Louis F. Gottschalk]], Harry Marston Haldeman, and Clarence R. Rundel. The films were directed by [[J. Farrell MacDonald]], with casts that included [[Violet MacMillan]], [[Vivian Reed (silent film actress)|Vivian Reed]], [[Mildred Harris]], [[Juanita Hansen]], [[Pierre Couderc]], Mai Welles, Louise Emmons, [[J. Charles Haydon]], and early appearances by [[Harold Lloyd]] and [[Hal Roach]]. Silent film actor Richard Rosson appeared in one of the films (Rosson's younger brother [[Harold Rosson]] was the [[cinematographer]] on ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', released in 1939). After little success probing the unrealized children's film market, Baum acknowledged his authorship of ''The Last Egyptian'' and made a film of it (portions of which are included in ''[[Decasia]]''), but the Oz name had become box office poison for the time being, and even a name change to [[Dramatic Feature Films]] and transfer of ownership to [[Frank Joslyn Baum]] did not help. Baum invested none of his own money in the venture, unlike ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'', but the stress probably took its toll on his health.

==Death==
[[File:L. Frank Baum grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.JPG|thumb|Baum's grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California, in 2011]]

On May 5, 1919, Baum suffered a [[stroke]], slipped into a coma and died the following day, at the age of 62. His last words were spoken to his wife during a brief period of lucidity: "Now we can cross the [[Deadly Desert|Shifting Sands]]."<ref>Abrams p.99</ref>  He was buried in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>Rogers, p. 239.</ref>

His final Oz book, ''[[Glinda of Oz]]'', was published on July 10, 1920, a year after his death. The Oz series was continued long after his death by other authors, notably [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who wrote an additional twenty-one Oz books.<ref name="RuthPlumlyThompson">{{cite web|url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |title=Ruth Plumly Thompson |work=psu.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501121254/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Thompson__Ruth_Plumly.html |archive-date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>

==Baum's beliefs==

===Literary===
Baum's avowed intentions with the Oz books and his other [[fairy tale]]s was to retell tales such as those which are found in the works of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] or [[Jinn|genies]], and remove the association of [[violence]] and moral teachings.<ref>Sale, p. 223.</ref> His first Oz books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased as the series progressed; in ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]'', [[Princess Ozma|Ozma]] objects to the use of violence, even to the use of violence against the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion.<ref>Riley, p. 164.</ref> His introduction is often cited as the beginning of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great deal more than eliminate harsh moral lessons.

Another traditional element that Baum intentionally omitted was the emphasis on [[Romance (love)|romance]]. He considered romantic love to be uninteresting to young children, as well as largely incomprehensible. In ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'', the only element of romance lay in the background of the [[Tin Woodman]] and his love for [[Nimmie Amee]], which explains his condition and does not otherwise affect the tale, and that of [[Gayelette]] and the enchantment of the [[Winged monkeys]]. The only other stories with such elements were ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'' and ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'', both based on dramatizations, which Baum regarded warily until his readers accepted them.<ref>Hearn, pp. 138–9.</ref>

===Political===
====Women's suffrage advocate====
Sally Roesch Wagner of The [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] Foundation has published a pamphlet titled ''The Wonderful Mother of Oz'' describing how Matilda Gage's [[feminist]] politics were sympathetically channeled by Baum into his Oz books. Much of the politics in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' dealt with trying to convince the populace to vote for [[women's suffrage]]. Baum was the secretary of [[Aberdeen, South Dakota Aberdeen]]'s Woman's Suffrage Club. [[Susan B. Anthony]] visited Aberdeen and stayed with the Baums. Nancy Tystad Koupal notes an apparent loss of interest in editorializing after Aberdeen failed to pass the bill for women's enfranchisement.

Some of Baum's contacts with suffragists of his day seem to have inspired much of his second Oz story ''The Marvelous Land of Oz''. In this story, General [[Jinjur]] leads the girls and women of Oz in a revolt, armed with knitting needles; they succeed and make the men do the household chores. Jinjur proves to be an incompetent ruler, but [[Princess Ozma|a female]] advocating [[gender equality]] is ultimately placed on the throne. His Edith Van Dyne stories depict girls and young women engaging in traditionally masculine activities, including the ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces]]'', ''[[The Flying Girl]]'' and its sequel, and his girl sleuth Josie O'Gorman from [[The Bluebird Books]].

====Racial views====
During the period surrounding the 1890 [[Ghost Dance]] movement and  [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], Baum wrote two editorials about Native Americans for the ''Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer'' which have provoked controversy in recent times because of his assertion that the safety of white settlers depended on the wholesale [[genocide]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. Sociologist Robert Venables has argued that Baum was not using sarcasm in the editorials.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venables|first=Robert|title=Twisted Footnote to Wounded Knee|url=http://www.dickshovel.com/TwistedFootnote.html|publisher=Northeast Indian Quarterly}}</ref>

The first piece was published on December 20, 1890, five days after the killing of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] [[Sioux]] [[Medicine man|holy man]], [[Sitting Bull]].<ref name="editorials">{{cite web|title=L. Frank Baum's Editorials on the Sioux Nation|url=http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209193251/http://www.northern.edu/hastingw/baumedts.htm|archive-date=December 9, 2007|access-date=2007-12-09}} Full text of both, with commentary by professor A. Waller Hastings</ref><ref>Rogers, p. 259.</ref> The piece opined that with Sitting Bull's death, "the nobility of the [[Redskin]]" had been extinguished, and that the safety of the frontier would not be established until there was "total annihilation" of the remaining Native Americans, who, he claimed, lived as "miserable wretches." Baum said that their extermination should not be regretted, and that their elimination would "do justice to the manly characteristics" of the early Native Americans.<ref name="editorials" /> 

Baum wrote a second editorial following the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890, being published on January 3, 1891. Baum alleged that the weak leadership of General [[Nelson A. Miles]] over the Native Americans had led to a "terrible loss of blood" to American soldiers, in a "battle" which had been a disgrace to the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]. He found that the "disaster" could have easily been prevented with proper preparations. Baum reiterated that he believed, due to the history of mistreatment of Native Americans, that extermination of the "untamed and untamable" tribes was necessary to protect American settlers. Baum ended the editorial with the following anecdote: "An eastern contemporary, with a grain of wisdom in its wit, says that 'when the whites win a fight, it is a victory, and when the Indians win it, it is a massacre.'"<ref name="editorials2" /><ref>Professor Robert Venables, Senior Lecturer Rural Sociology Department, Cornell University, "Looking Back at Wounded Knee 1890", ''Northeast Indian Quarterly'', Spring 1990</ref>

These two editorials have haunted his modern legacy. In 2006, two descendants of Baum apologized to the Sioux nation for any hurt that their ancestor had caused.<ref name=apology>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Ray |title='Oz' Family Apologizes for Racist Editorials |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5662524 |work=[[Morning Edition]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=August 17, 2006 |access-date=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>

The short story "The Enchanted Buffalo" claims to be a legend of a tribe of bison, and states that a key element made it into legends of Native American tribes.<!---preceding sentence makes no sense.---> Baum mentions his characters' distaste for a [[Hopi]] [[snake dance]] in ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces and Uncle John]]'', but also deplores the horrible situation of [[Indian Reservation]]s. ''[[Aunt Jane's Nieces on the Ranch]]'' has a hard-working [[Mexican people|Mexican]] present himself as an exception to counter Anglo stereotypes of Mexican laziness.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Baum's mother-in-law and Woman's Suffrage leader Matilda Joslyn Gage had great influence over Baum's views. Gage was initiated into the Wolf Clan and admitted into the Iroquois Council of Matrons for her outspoken respect and sympathy for Native American people. <ref>Reneau, Reneau H.

====Political imagery in ''The Wizard of Oz''====
{{Main|Political interpretations of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}

Numerous political references to the "Wizard" appeared early in the 20th century. Henry Littlefield, an upstate New York high school history teacher, wrote a scholarly article which was the first full-fledged interpretation of the novel as an extended political metaphor of the politics and characters of the 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |title=The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism.first=Henry |last=LittlefieldHenry |work=American Quarterly. v. 16, 3, Spring 1964, 47–58 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819173851/http://www.amphigory.com/oz.htm |archive-date=August 19, 2010 }}</ref> He paid special attention to the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] metaphors and debates over silver and gold.<ref>Attebery, pp. 86–7.</ref> Baum was a Republican and avid supporter of Women's Suffrage, and it is thought{{by whom|date=October 2020}} that he did not support the political ideals of either the Populist movement of 1890–1892 or the [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryanite]]-silver crusade of 1896–1900. He published a poem in support of [[William McKinley]].<sup><ref>[http://www.halcyon.com/piglet/Populism.htm Oz Populism Theory<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.halcyon.com</ref></sup>

Since 1964, many scholars, economists, and historians have expanded on Littlefield's interpretation, pointing to multiple similarities between the characters (especially as depicted in Denslow's illustrations) and stock figures from editorial cartoons of the period. Littlefield wrote to ''The New York Times'' letters to the editor section spelling out that his theory had no basis in fact, but that his original point was "not to label Baum, or to lessen any of his magic, but rather, as a history teacher at Mount Vernon High School, to invest turn-of-the-century America with the imagery and wonder I have always found in his stories."<ref>{{cite web|access-date=December 20, 2008|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D9143CF934A35751C0A964958260&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/M/Motion%20Pictures|title='Oz' Author Kept Intentions to Himself|date=February 7, 1992|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref>

Baum's newspaper had addressed politics in the 1890s, and Denslow was an editorial cartoonist as well as an illustrator of children's books. A series of political references is included in the 1902 stage version, such as references to the President, to a powerful senator, and to John D. Rockefeller for providing the oil needed by the Tin Woodman. Scholars have found few political references in Baum's Oz books after 1902. Baum was asked whether his stories had hidden meanings, but he always replied that they were written to "please children".<ref>{{cite book|last=Tuerk|first=Richard|title=Oz in Perspective: Magic and Myth in the L. Frank Baum Books|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-786-48291-7|page=6}}</ref>

===Religion===
Baum was originally a Methodist, but he joined the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota|Aberdeen]] to participate in community theatricals. Later, he and his wife were encouraged by [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] to become members of the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1892.<ref>Algeo, pp. 270–3; Rogers, pp. 50–1 and ff.</ref> Baum's beliefs are often reflected in his writing, however, the only mention of a church in his Oz books is the [[porcelain]] one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz''. The Baums sent their older sons to "[[Ethical Culture]] Sunday School" in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.<ref>F. J. Baum, ''To Please a Child'', p. 84</ref><ref>Michael Patrick Hearn.
