A '''sextet''' (or '''hexad''') is a formation containing exactly six members. The former term is commonly associated with vocal ensembles (e.g. [[The King's Singers]], [[Affabre Concinui]]) or musical instrument groups, but can be applied to any situation where six similar or related objects are considered a single unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sextet |title=Sextet - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sextet |title=sextet - definition of sextet by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |access-date=2013-09-15}}</ref>

Musical compositions with six parts are sextets. Many musical compositions are named for the number of musicians for which they are written. If a piece is written for six performers, it may be called a "sextet". [[Steve Reich]]'s "[[Sextet (Reich)|Sextet]]", for example, is written for six percussionists. However, much as many string quartets do not include "string quartet" in the title (though many do), many sextets do not include "sextet" in their title. See: [[string sextet]] and [[piano sextet]].

In [[jazz music]] a sextet is any group of six players, usually containing a [[drum set]] (bass drum, snare drum, hi-hat, ride cymbal), [[string bass]] or [[bass guitar|electric bass]], piano, and various combinations of the following or other instruments: [[guitar]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]], [[trombone]].

In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[rock music]], a sextet typically contains, but is not restricted to, a [[lead vocalist]], two [[guitarist]]s, a [[bassist]], [[drummer]], and [[keyboardist]].
