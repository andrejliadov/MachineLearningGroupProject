'''Andriana''' refers to both the noble class and a title of nobility in [[Merina Kingdom|Madagascar]]. Historically, many Malagasy ethnic groups lived in highly stratified caste-based social orders in which the ''andriana'' were the highest strata. They were above the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] (free commoner castes) and [[Andevo]] (slaves).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Encyclopedia of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC |year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533770-9|page=104}}</ref> The Andriana and the Hova were a part of ''Fotsy'', while the Andevo were ''Mainty'' in local terminology.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Ottino | first = Paul | year = 1973 | title = La hiérarchie sociale et l'alliance dans le royaume de Matacassi | journal = Bulletin de l'Académie malgache | volume = IV | issue = 4 | pages = 55, 74 | url = http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_06-07/07183.pdf|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=John A.

The use of the word "Andriana" to denote nobility occurs among numerous other Malagasy ethnic groups such as the [[Betsileo]], the [[Betsimisaraka people|Betsimisaraka]], the [[Tsimihety]], the [[Bezanozano]], the [[Antambahoaka]] and the [[Antemoro]].  ''Andriana'' often traditionally formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes, and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests its origin is traceable back to an ancient Javanese nobility title, although alternate theories have been proposed.

==Etymology==
[[File:Andriantsoly.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Andriana is a prefix for the noble strata in many Malagasy ethnic groups, such as Andriantsoly (above) of [[Sakalava people]].]]
According to K.A. Adelaar, the Malagasy title "andriana" probably originated from the ancient [[Javanese people|Java-Indonesian]] nobility title ''Rahadyan'' (''Ra-hady-an''), "hady" meaning "Lord" or "Master."<ref name="Adelaar">{{cite book | last = Adelaar | first = K.A. | year = 2006 | title = The Indonesian migrations to Madagascar: Making sense of the multidisciplinary evidence | publisher = in Adelaar, Austronesian diaspora and the ethnogenesis of people in Indonesian Archipelago, LIPI PRESS | url = http://www.santafe.edu/events/workshops/images/6/6d/IndonesianMigrations.pdf | access-date = 2008-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091122232505/http://www.santafe.edu/events/workshops/images/6/6d/IndonesianMigrations.pdf | archive-date = 2009-11-22 | url-status = dead }}</ref> In Malagasy the term became ''Rohandryan'' and later ''Roandriana'', mainly used in the Southeastern part of the island among the Zafiraminia, Antemoro and Antambahoaka ethnic groups.<ref name="Ottino">{{cite journal | last = Ottino | first = Paul | year = 1973 | title = La hiérarchie sociale et l'alliance dans le royaume de Matacassi | journal = Bulletin de l'Académie malgache | volume = IV | issue = 4 | pages = 53&ndash;89 | url = http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_06-07/07183.pdf|language=fr}}</ref> In the central Highlands among the Merina, Betsileo, Bezanozano, and [[Sihanaka]], the term became ''Randryan'' and later ''Randriana'' or simply ''andriana''.<ref name="Callet">{{cite book | last = Callet | first = F. | year = 1908 | title = Tantara ny Andriana (Histoire des rois)  | publisher = Imprimerie Catholique}}</ref>

Other proposed etymology for ''Andriana'' includes the root ''Handrina'' which means "head or forehead" in Malagasy.<ref name="Richardson">{{cite book|author=James Richardson|title=A New Malagasy-English Dictionary|url=https://archive.org/details/anewmalagasyeng01richgoog|year=1885|publisher=London Missionary Society|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anewmalagasyeng01richgoog/page/n110 44], 226}}</ref>

In Madagascar, the name of a Malagasy sovereign, prince or nobleman was often historically composed by placing "Andriana" as a prefix to the remainder of the name.  For example, the name of Merina king [[Andrianampoinimerina]] is a composite of "''Andriana''" and "''Nampoinimerina''", while that of the celebrated [[Sakalava]] warrior Andriamisara is formed from "''Andriana''" and "''Misara''".

In [[Madagascar]] today, names beginning with the "Andria" prefix are common.  However, unlike in Western cultures where children automatically inherit the family name of a parent, [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] parents are free to choose their child's first and last name as they please.  Following the end of the [[Merina Kingdom|monarchy in Imerina]], many parents have chosen to give their children names including the "Andriana" prefix, despite lacking any family connection to the former aristocracy.

==History==
[[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] people started settling in Madagascar between 200 and 500 CE. They arrived by boats and were from various southeast Asian groups.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=An Economic History of Imperial Madagascar, 1750-1895: The Rise and Fall of an Island Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13Yt9jLuKzsC&pg=PA120|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83935-8|pages=49–51}}</ref> African slaves were brought to the island's coasts between the 13th and the 18th centuries.

This influx of diverse people led to various [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sub-ethnicities in the mid-2nd millennium. The Merina were probably the early arrivals, though this is uncertain and other ethnic groups on Madagascar consider them relative newcomers to the island.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=David Griffiths and the Missionary "History of Madagascar"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va8yAQAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-19518-9|pages=409–410}}</ref> The Merina people's culture likely mixed and merged with the Madagascar natives named ''Vazimba'' about whom little is known.<ref name="Green1997p16">{{cite book|author=Rebecca L.

In and after the 16th century, slaves were brought into Madagascar's various kingdoms, and social strata emerged in Merina kingdom. The Hova emerged as the free commoners caste below the nobles hierarchy. During the rule of King [[Andriamanelo]], a subset of Hova related to the king by blood came under the title ''Andriana''.<ref name = KUS95>{{Cite book | last = Kus | first = Susan | chapter = Sensuous human activity and the state: towards an archaeology of bread and circuses | year = 1995 | title = Domination and Resistance | editor1-last = Miller | editor1-first = Daniel  | editor2-last = Rowlands | editor2-first = Michael | location = London | publisher = Psychology Press | isbn = 978-0-415-12254-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQzW77L_GlgC}}, pp. 140–154</ref><ref name="Miller, D 1995">Miller, D. and Rowlands, M.

===Sub-castes among the Merina===
King [[Andriamanelo]]<ref name="Miller, D 1995"/> (1540&ndash;1575) is credited with establishing the Andriana as a separate class in early Merina society.  This class was sub-divided into four groups by his son, the King [[Ralambo]]<ref name="Raison-Jourde">Raison-Jourde, Françoise. ''Les Souverains de Madagascar.'' Karthala Editions, 1983. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> (1575&ndash;1600):

* ''Andriantompokoindrindra'', the Eldest son of the King Ralambo and his direct descendants,
* ''Andrianamboninolona'', the son of Andriamananitany, brother of the King Andriamanelo, and his direct descendants.
* ''Andriandranando'', the uncle of the King Ralambo and his direct descendants.
* ''Zanadralambo amin'Andrianjaka'', the other sons of the King Ralambo.
The descendants of these three princes (Andriantompokoindrindra, Andrianamboninolona and Andriandranando) was called Andrianteloray.

And further it was divided into six groups by Ralambo's great-great-grandson King [[Andriamasinavalona]]<ref name="UNESCO"/> (1675&ndash;1710) based on locality and genealogical proximity to the ruling family. The andriana class was divided again into seven groups by King Andrianampoinimerina (1778-1810). In rank order, these groups are:<ref name=Standing>Standing, H.F. (1885).

=== Occupations and privileges ===
The Andriana caste were originally the source of nobility and they specialized in the rituals and warrior occupations in the Merina society. However, in 19th century when Merina conquered the other kingdoms and ruled most of the island, a much larger army was needed, and the soldiers then included the Hova caste as well.<ref name=gwyn623>{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=David Griffiths and the Missionary "History of Madagascar"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Va8yAQAAQBAJ |year=2012 |publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-19518-9|pages=623–624}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Ottino | first = Paul | year = 1973 | title = La hiérarchie sociale et l'alliance dans le royaume de Matacassi | journal = Bulletin de l'Académie malgache | volume = IV | issue = 4 | pages = 53–56, 74 | url = http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_06-07/07183.pdf|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=An Economic History of Imperial Madagascar, 1750-1895: The Rise and Fall of an Island Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13Yt9jLuKzsC&pg=PA120|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83935-8|pages=121–123}}</ref>

The Andriana benefited from numerous privileges in precolonial Madagascar.  Land ownership in Imerina was reserved for the andriana class, who ruled over fiefs called ''menakely''.  The populace under the rule of an andriana lord owed him&mdash;and the king&mdash;a certain amount of free labor each year (''fanompoana'') for public works such as the construction of dikes, rice paddies, roads and town walls. Posts of privilege within the government, such as judges or royal advisers, were likewise reserved for certain groups of andriana.<ref name="Kent">Kent, R.K. "Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700." ''The Journal of African History, 9''(4), 1968, 517&ndash;546.</ref>

The ''[[valiha]]'', the national instrument of Madagascar, was originally an instrument of the masses but came to be affiliated with the noble class in the 19th century.<ref name="Musical Standard">{{Cite journal | last = Shaw  | first = Geo  | title = Music among the Malagasy  | journal = The Musical Standard  | volume = 17  | issue = 797| page = 297  | date = November 8, 1879 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQAtAAAAYAAJ&q=Music+among+the+Malagasy+musical+standard&pg=PA297}}</ref> The valiha featured heavily in the [[Music of Madagascar|music of the Merina royal court]] performed at palaces such as [[Ambohimanga]] or the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova]] at [[Antananarivo]]. The strings of the valiha were more easily plucked with the fingernails, which were commonly grown long for this purpose; long fingernails became fashionable and symbolic of belonging to the andriana class within the Kingdom of Imerina.<ref name="Musical Standard"/>

At Antananarivo, only andriana tombs were allowed to be constructed within town limits. Hovas (freemen) and slaves were required to bury their dead beyond the city walls.  The highest ranks of andriana were permitted to distinguish their tombs by the construction of a small, windowless wooden tomb house on top of it, called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|''trano masina'']] (sacred house) for the king and ''trano manara'' (cold house) for the Zanakandriana, Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona.<ref name=Standing/> This tradition may have originated with King Andriantompokoindrindra, who is said to have ordered the first ''trano masina'' to be built on his tomb in honor of his memory.<ref name="Rasamimanana">{{cite book | last1 = Rasamimanana | last2 = Razafindrazaka | year = 1930 | title = Ny Andriantopokoindrindra: Fanasoavana ny tantaran'i Madagasikara | publisher = Librairie Mixte  |language=fr}}</ref>

===Marriage===
Andriana were also subjected to certain restrictions.  Marriage outside the caste was forbidden by law among the lowest three ranks of andriana. A high-ranking woman who married a lower-ranking man would take on her husband's lower rank. Although the inverse situation would not cause a high-ranking man to lose status, he would be unable to transfer his rank or property to his children. For these reasons, intermarriage across andriana caste divisions was relatively infrequent.<ref name=Standing/>

The Andriana, the Hova and the Andevo strata were endogamous in the Merina society. According to the colonial era missionary William Ellis memoir in 1838, an Andriana in the Malagasy society was prohibited from marrying a Hova or an Andevo.<ref name="Ellis1838p164">{{cite book|author=William Ellis|title=History of Madagascar |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmadagas01elli_0|year=1838|publisher=Fisher|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmadagas01elli_0/page/n195 164] with footnote}}</ref> The exception, stated Ellis, was the unmarried Queen who could marry anyone from any strata including the Hova, and her children were deemed to be royal.<ref name="Ellis1838p164"/> In contrast, Sandra Evers states that the social taboo on inter marriage was weaker between the Andriana and Hova, but strong against that between Andriana and Andevo.<ref name="Evers2002">{{cite book|author=Sandra Evers|title=Constructing History, Culture and Inequality: The Betsileo in the Extreme Southern Highlands of Madagascar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgAUbW_qmU8C&pg=PA57 |year=2002|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-12460-8|pages=57–58, 40–47}}</ref> The social mores and restrictions on inter-marriage between social strata were historically present among other Malagasy ethnic groups.<ref name="Evers2002"/>

==Contemporary society==
The Law of Annexion of Madagascar was abolished on October 14, 1958.

The Andriana, along with the other castes, played an important part in the independence of Madagascar.  

Ny Andriana Émile Ramarosaona of the Zanadralambo amin'Andrianjaka royal family and Ny Andriana Blaise Rabetafika of the Andrianamboninolona Royal family were among the pillars of the negociation for the transfert of power and the return of the independence (1960's). 


Ny Andriana Alfred Ramangasoavina of the Zanadralambo amin'Andrianjaka royal family, graduated of the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sc. Po) and Doctor in Law (France) was the Vice-President of the First Republic (1960's).



Ny Andriana Joseph Ravoahangy-Andrianavalona, a Merina nationalist and deputy, was andriana of the Andriamasinavalona sub-caste.<ref name="ravoahangy">{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/ravoahangy-joseph-28101893.asp|title=Biographie de Joseph Ravoahangy |accessdate=2010-11-23|language=fr}}</ref> He was a minister of Health during the First Republic (1970's).

The secret nationalist organization V.V.S. (''[[Vy Vato Sakelika]]'') was composed of some Andriana of the intelligentsia. A 1968 study showed that 14% of the population of Imerina was Andriana.

Next, Ny Andriana Division General Roland Rabetafika, Officier from Saint-Cyr, recreated the Fianakaviambe or the Great Family of the Nobility in the Kingdom of Imerina in the years 1980-1990s.

The andriana have been key players in Madagascan political and cultural life after independence as well. The andriana were deeply affected by the 1995 destruction of the royal palace, the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova]], in Antananarivo, and their approval and participation were periodically solicited throughout the reconstruction process.

Ny Andriana Émile Ramarosaona of Manandriana-Avaradrano was the Chief of the Zanadralambo amin'Andrianjaka Royal family. He was the founder of the Civic Service (1967's) which is an Army for the Development. He was Minister of Plan, then Minister of Economy during the First Republic (1970's). After, he was the Minister of Foreign Office during the Third Republic (1990's).

Ny Andriana Blaise Rabetafika was the Chief of the Andrianamboninolona Royal family. He was the Ambassador of Madagascar (1967-1992) and the Dean of all Ambassadors at the United-Nations (UN). He was the only man in the world who was two times President of the Council of the Security at the United-Nations (UN). He received the International Golden Medal Prize which is given for rare Chiefs of State.



After, Ny Andriana Étienne Ralitera, from the Elder branch of the Royal House, was the Head of the Royal House of Madagascar and the Chief of Aristocratic Associations of Madagascar in 2003-2015.



Ny Andriana Étienne Ralitera, Grand Chancelor of the National Order of Madagascar, Grand Cross of First Class of the National Order of Madagascar, met His Excellency Mr. Koffi Annan and His Excellency Mr. Ban Khi Moon, successively General Secretary of the United-Nations (UN).

In 2011, the Council of Kings and Princes of Madagascar promoted the revival of a Christian andriana monarchy that would blend modernity and tradition.<ref>http://www.royal-house-of-madagascar.blogspot.com</ref>


After that, following Divines Promises and royal Traditions, after seven steps during more than seven years, His Royal Majesty King Ndriana Rabarioelina of Madagascar, from the Elder branch of the Royal House, Head of the Royal House of Madagascar, was anointed and consecrated Traditional King of Imerina and Madagascar in the sacred and royal site of Ambohidrabiby Hasin'Imerina in the Kingdom of Imerina, in the Central Highlands of Madagascar, in the presence of chosen members of the Royal House, in 2015.


Later, Ny Andriana Étienne Ralitera transmitted the Royal Traditional Power and the Royal scepter to His Royal Majesty King Ndriana Rabarioelina of Madagascar, Head of the Royal House of Madagascar, in the presence of the Chiefs and Elders of the Aristocratic Associations of the Kingdom of Imerina and Traditional kings of other regions of Madagascar.



In 2016, the [[London School of Economics]] enrolled their first Andriana, making them the first Malagasy royal to join the ranks of LSE's famous alumnus. It has been reported that they are directly descended from Queen Rabodozafimanjaka, wife of [[Andrianampoinimerina|King Andrianampoinimerina]] and daughter of King Andriantsimitoviaminandriana who ruled the [[Merina Kingdom]].{{cn|date=June 2020}}


Moreover, His Royal Majesty King Ndriana Rabarioelina of Madagascar met more than one hundred Kings in twelve countries in the world.

== Genealogy: ''Tantara ny Andriana'' ==
Much of the known genealogical history of the Andriana of Imerina comes from Father François Callet's book ''[[Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara]]'' ("History of the Nobles"). This collection of oral tradition about the history of the Merina Dynasty was originally written in Malagasy and published between 1878 and 1881. Callet summarized and translated it in [[French language|French]] under the title  "Tantara ny Andriana (Histoire des rois)" in 1908.<ref name="Callet"/> Tantara ny Andriana constitutes the core material for the historians studying the Merina history, and has been commented, criticised, and challenged ever since by historians from Madagascar, [[Europe]], and [[North America]].
