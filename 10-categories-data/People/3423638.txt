'''Jennings Cox''', an [[United States|American]] mining engineer, is said to have invented the drink known as the [[daiquiri]] in the late nineteenth century.  Cox was an American expatriate working in [[Cuba]].  He worked for the Spanish-American Iron Company, situated near the village of [[Daiquirí]], about 14 miles east south-east of [[Santiago de Cuba]].

It is said that the drink was invented when Cox ran out of gin while entertaining American guests.  Wary about serving local rum straight up, Cox added lime juice and sugar to improve the rum’s taste.  Consumption of the drink remained localized until 1909, when Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a US Navy medical officer, tried Cox’s drink.  Johnson subsequently introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], and to ports of call around the world. Through to the navy's supply of vitamins by adding citrus to their rum in hope to defeat scurvy, he amongst other had acquired a taste for citrus.  So the success of the newly born Daiquiri at the Army and Navy was enormous [https://web.archive.org/web/20051211000218/http://www.wetwillies.com/facts.htm]

The credit given to Cox remains disputed, with some sources stating that he was assisted by a Cuban engineer named Pagliuchi, or that the drink had already been a Cuban specialty.

Cox lived in [[Santiago de Cuba]].  The writer and journalist [[Richard Harding Davis]] wrote his novel ''Soldiers of Fortune'' (1897) while a guest at Cox's house (O’Toole, 79).
