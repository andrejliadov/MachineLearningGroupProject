'''Seyed Ashrafedin Hosseini Gilani''' (born in 1870 in [[Qazvin]], died in 1934 in [[Tehran]]) was a combatant poet in [[Iran]]'s [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|constitutional revolution]] and the editor of the newspaper ''Nasim-e-Shomal'' (Northern Breeze).<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/asraf-gilani-poet AŠRAF GĪLĀNĪ]</ref>

== Early life ==
Ashrafedin lost his father when he was only six months old. His paternal heritage was usurped. This brought him and his family into extreme poverty.

Ashrafedin finished his elementary education in his home town then went to [[Najaf]] ([[Iraq]]) for religious education. He came back to Iran after five years and continued his studies there.

It was in 1906 while living in [[Rasht]] (north of Iran) that he got to know the leaders of the constitutional revolution and started publishing the weekly newspaper, ''Naseem- e -  Shomal''.

== Constitutional Revolution ==
The revolution was suppressed at its early stages. After the bombardment and dissolution of the parliament by [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar]], Ashrafedin fled to [[Eshtehard]], in the suburb of capital Tehran. A few months later when he returned to Rasht he became influenced by the leaders of the Social-Democrats of the [[Caucasus]]. This effect was later visible in the Naseem-e- Shomal's articles.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276248180_A_Study_of_the_Sayed_Ashraf-Al-Din_Gilani_Nasim-e-Shomal_Poems_in_the_Light_of_Frankfurt_School_and_Constitutional_Mashrooteh_Movement A Study of the Sayed Ashraf-Al-Din Gilani]</ref>
