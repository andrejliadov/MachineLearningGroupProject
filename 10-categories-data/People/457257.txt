The [[Mahamayuri|Mahamayuri Tantra]] dated to between 1-3rd century mentions a number of popular Yaksha shrines.

In the seventh century, the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited Laghman, which he called "Lan-p'o" and considered part of India.  He indicated the presence of [[Mahayana]] Buddhists and numerous Hindus:

{{quote|"For several centuries the native dynasty had ceased to exist, great families fought for preeminence, and the state had recently become a dependency of [[Kapisa Province|Kapis]]. The country produced upland rice and sugar-cane, and it had much wood but little fruit; the climate was mild with little frost and no snow. [...] There were above ten Buddhist monasteries and a few Brethren the most of whom were [[Mahayana|Mahayanists]].

The [[Hudud al-'alam]] which was finished in 982 AD mentioned the presence of some idol worshipping temples in the area.<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpY3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA649 |title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Volume V |contribution=Islam in India and Pakistan |first1=Annemarie |last1=Schimmel |editor-first1=CE |editor-last1=Bosworth |editor-first2=E |editor-last2=van Donzel |editor-first3=B |editor-last3=Lewis |editor-first4=Ch. |editor-last4=Pellet |page=649 |isbn= 90-04-07819-3 }}</ref>

The Kabul Shahis only retained Lamghan in the [[Kabulistan|Kabul]]-[[Gandhara]] area by the time of [[Alp-tegin]]. According to [[Firishta]], [[Sabuktigin]] had already begun raiding Lamghan under Alp-tegin.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2m7_R5P2oAC&pg=PA126|title=Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries|year=2002|publisher=Brill|page=126|isbn=0391041738}}</ref> He crossed the [[Khyber Pass]] many times and raided the territory of [[Jayapala]].<ref name=Sastri>{{cite book|title=History of India, Volume 2|author=[[K.

The battle stretched on several days until a snow storm affected Jaipala's strategies, forcing him to sue for peace.<ref name=Sastri/>

Jayapala then returned to Waihind but broke the treaty and mistreated the amirs sent to collect the tribute. Sabuktigin launched another invasion in retaliation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xx7ICQAAQBAJ&pg=PA87|title=Warfare in Pre-British India – 1500BCE to 1740CE|last=Roy|first=Kaushik|date=3 June 2015|publisher=Routledge|page=87|isbn=9781317586920}}</ref> According to al-Utbi, Sabuktigin attacked Lamghan, conquering it and burning the residences of the "infidels" while also demolishing its idol-temples and establishing Islam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Essays on Islam and Indian History|author=Richard Maxwell Eaton|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=98}}</ref> He advanced and butchered the idolaters, destroying the temples and plundering their shrines, even risking frostbite on their hands counting the large booty.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&pg=PT212|title=India: A History.

To avenge the savage attack of Sabuktigin, Jayapala, who has earlier taken his envoys as hostage, decided to go to war again in revenge. The forces of Kabul Shahi were however routed and those still alive were killed in the forest or drowned in the river.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&pg=PT212|title=India: A History.

The area later fell to the [[Ghurids]] followed by the [[Khalji dynasty|Khilis]] and [[Timurids]].

During the early years of the 16th century, the [[Moghul Empire|Mughal]] ruler [[Babur]] spent much time in Laghman, and in ''[[Baburnama]]'' (memoirs of Babur) he expatiated on the beauty of forested hillsides and the fertility of the valley bottoms of the region.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> Laghman was recognized as a dependent district of [[Kabulistan]] in the Mughal era,<ref>The Garden of Eight Paradises: Babur and the Culture of Central Asia, Afghanistan</ref> and according to Baburnama, "Greater Lamghanat" included the Muslim-settled part of the [[Kafiristan]], including the easterly one of [[Kunar River]]. Laghman was the base for expeditions against the [[kafirs|non-believers]] and was frequently mentioned in accounts of [[jihad]]s led by Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]'s younger brother, Mohammad Hakim, who was the governor of Kabul.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> In 1747, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] defeated the Mughals and made the territory part of the [[Durrani Empire]]. In the late nineteenth century, [[Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] forced the remaining kafirs ([[Nuristani people]]) to accept [[Islam]].

The [[Alingar River|Alingar]] and Alinshang rivers pass through Laghman, as the province is known for its lushness. Laghman has sizable amounts of irrigated land as one can find scores of fruits and vegetables from Laghman in [[Kabul]]. Other main crops in Laghman include rice, wheat and cotton as many people living in the area are involved in agricultural trade and business.

Laghman also has an array of precious stones and minerals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palagems.com/afghanistan_bariand.htm|title=Pegmatites of Laghman, Nuristan, Afghanistan|work=palagems.com}}</ref> as it is well known for being a relatively untapped source of the [[Tourmaline]] and [[Spodumene]] gemstones which are reported to be in abundance at the northern portions of the province.<ref>Gemstones of Afghanistan, Chamberline, pg. 146</ref>
