'''Apotheosis''' ({{Lang-gr|ἀποθέωσις|italic=yes}}, from {{lang-gr|ἀποθεόω/ἀποθεῶ|label=none|italic=yes|link=no|lit='to deify'|transliteration=apotheoo/apotheo}}; also called '''divinization''' and '''deification''' from {{Lang-la|deificatio|lit='making divine'}}) is the glorification of a subject to [[divinity|divine]] level and most commonly, the treatment of a human like a [[Deity|god]]. The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].

In theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.

==Ancient Middle East==
{{further|imperial cult|divine king}}
Before the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] to [[Hammurabi]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]]. The architect [[Imhotep]] was deified after his death.

==Ancient Greece==
{{Main|Greek hero cult}}
From at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or "hero-temple".

In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; "his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome".<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)</ref> Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the
[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].

Archaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason, hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.

==Ancient Rome==
{{main|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}
Up to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the god [[Quirinus]] was the only one the Romans accepted as having undergone apotheosis, for his identification/[[syncretism]] with [[Romulus]]. (See [[Euhemerism]]).{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

At the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones—heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]—were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.

In the Roman story [[Cupid and Psyche]], Zeus gives the [[ambrosia]] of the gods to the mortal Psyche, transforming her into a god herself.

==Ancient China==
The [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest-ranking heavenly generals.<ref>Liu, James T. C. "Yueh Fei (1103–41) and China's Heritage of Loyalty." ''The Journal of Asian Studies''. Vol. 31, No. 2 (Feb. 1972), pp. 291–297 [296]

==Ancient India, Southeast Asia and North Korea==
Various Hindu and Buddhist rulers in the past have been represented as deities, especially after death, from [[Monarchy of India|India]] to [[Indonesia]].

Deceased North Korean leader [[Kim Il-Sung]] is the principal object of the [[North Korean cult of personality]] in which he is treated similarly to an explicitly apotheosized leader, with statues of and monuments dedicated to the "[[Eternal President]]", the annual commemoration of his birth, the paying of respects by newlyweds to his nearest statue,<ref name="North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bow before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang">[https://www.reddit.com/domain/nimg.sulekha.com/search?q=North+Korean+newlywed+couples+in+their+best+attire+bow+before+the+statues+of+Kim+Il+Sung+and+Kim+Jong+Il+in+Pyongyang], Photograph of North Korean newlywed couples in their best attire bowing before the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, from Reddit.</ref> and the [[North Korean calendar]] being a [[Juche]] calendar based on Kim Il-sung's date of birth.

==Christianity==
{{main|Divinization (Christian)}}
Instead of the word "apotheosis", Christian theology uses in English the words "deification" or "divinization" or the Greek word "''theosis''". Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became human to make humans "partakers of the divine nature"<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}</ref>{{or inline|date=December 2020}} "For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''"<ref>[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1</ref> "For He was made man that we might be made God."<ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3">St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.</ref> "The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods."<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1–4</ref>

The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled "Deification":

:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9–17; Gal. 4.5–7), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21–23).''

:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century, St. Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''

===Roman Catholic Church===
The Roman Catholic Church does not use the term "apotheosis".

Corresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words "divinization" and "deification" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: "By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity."<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article "deification"</ref> The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, "The Son of God became man so that we might become God."<ref name="AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3"/><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, "a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature"<ref>Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160</ref> (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being "the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Stephen M.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or [[Mormons]]) believes in apotheosis along the lines of the Christian tradition of [[divinization (Christian)|divinization]] or deification but refers to it as [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]], or eternal life, and considers it to be accomplished by "sanctification." They believe that people may live with God throughout eternity in families and eventually become gods themselves but remain subordinate to God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. While the primary focus of the LDS Church is on [[Jesus of Nazareth]] and his atoning sacrifice for man,<ref>[[Joseph Smith]] declared, "The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it" (See ''Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith'', sel. Joseph Fielding Smith [1976], 121).</ref> Latter-day Saints believe that one purpose for Christ's mission and for his atonement is the exaltation or [[Divinization (Christian)|Christian deification]] of man.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng | title = Gospel Topics: Becoming Like God | work = churchofjesuschrist.org | publisher = LDS Church}}</ref> The third [[Articles of Faith (Latter Day Saints)| Article of Faith]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that all men may be saved from sin by the atonement of Jesus Christ, and LDS Gospel Doctrine (as published) states that all men will be saved and will be resurrected from death. However, only those who are sufficiently obedient and accept the atonement and the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ before the resurrection and final judgment will be "exalted" and receive a literal Christian [[Divinization (Christian)|deification]].

Members of the Church believe that the original Christian belief in man's divine potential gradually lost its meaning and importance in the centuries after the death of the apostles, as doctrinal changes by post-apostolic theologians caused Christians to lose sight of the true nature of God and his purpose for creating humanity. The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture<ref>Thomas Mozley ''The creed or a philosophy'', 1893 p. 303</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archive-date=2014-09-25 }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms "substance," "essence," and "ousia" since they were not included in the scriptures)</ref> but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity > History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=plato.stanford.edu}}</ref> such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that he is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in his image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28–29), humans have the potential to be heirs of his glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in his intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40–41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).

The LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&C 78:7, D&C 78:22, D&C 84:4, D&C 84:23, D&C 88:68, D&C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: "Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).

In early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref> The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deification, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.

==In art==
In art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons "in glory"—that is, in their roles as "God revealed" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).

[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]

[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827.jpg|thumb|Ingres, ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]'']]
[[File:Mucha Apoteoza.jpg|thumb|[[Alphonse Mucha]]'s ''[[The Slav Epic]]'' cycle No. 20: ''The Apotheosis of the Slavs, Slavs for Humanity'' (1926)]]
[[File:Allegory of Gdańsk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gdańsk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]

Later artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dalí]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.

Many modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life—for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].

==In music==
''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].

Apotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. [[François Couperin]] wrote two apotheosises, one for [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (''Le Parnasse, ou L'Apothéose de Corelli''), and one for [[Jean Baptiste Lully]] (''[[L'Apothéose de Lully]]''). [[Hector Berlioz]] used "Apotheose" as the title of the final movement of his ''[[Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale]]'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayadère]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]] composed two ballets, ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' and ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'', which both contain episodes entitled "Apotheose". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma mère l'Oye]]'' is also titled  "Apotheose." Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' "Sunrise and Apotheosis." [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the "apotheosis of the dance".<ref name="grove">{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |author-link= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228–271}}</ref>  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.

Musical theater has a tendency to use apotheosis often, although that can become easily confused with [[motif (narrative)]]s. One meta example of this is [[The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals]], where musical theater itself is deified by the characters within the play, excluding the titular character.

==In poetry==
[[Samuel Menashe]] (1925–2011) wrote a poem entitled ''Apotheosis,'' as did [[Barbara Kingsolver]]. [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830–1886) wrote ''Love, Poem 18: Apotheosis.'' The poet [[Dejan Stojanović]]'s ''Dancing of Sounds'' contains the line, "Art is apotheosis." [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] wrote a poem entitled ''Love's Apotheosis.'' [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote a poem entitled "The Apotheosis, or the Snow-Drop" in 1787. 


==In science==
In an essay entitled ''The Limitless Power of Science'', [[Peter Atkins]] described science as an apotheosis, writing: <blockquote>Science, above all, respects the power of the human intellect. Science is the apotheosis of the intellect and the consummation of the Renaissance. Science respects more deeply the potential of humanity than religion ever can.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Atkins |first1=Peter |title=The Limitless Power of Science in: Nature's Imagination edited by John Cornwell |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0198517750 |page=125}}</ref></blockquote>
