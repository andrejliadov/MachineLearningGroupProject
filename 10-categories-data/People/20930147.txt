''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'' is published twice a year. Occasionally, it publishes special issues.

==Controversy==
In 2002, philosopher [[Andrew Bernstein]], who is intellectually affiliated with the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], contributed a brief reply to a review of the [[CliffsNotes]] for Ayn Rand's novels.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bernstein |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Bernstein |date=Spring 2002 |title=Reply to Kirsti Minsaas: On the Ayn Rand CliffsNotes |journal=Journal of Ayn Rand Studies |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=349}}</ref> He subsequently issued an apology for having contributed to the journal. Bernstein wrote, "I deeply regret my thoughtless decision to contribute to this journal, and hereby irrevocably repudiate any and all association with it", and asserted that the journal was "filled with writings by people with whom I refuse to knowingly associate under any circumstances."<ref name="glenn2007a">{{Cite journal |last=Glenn |first=David |date=July 13, 2007 |title=Advocates of Objectivism Make New Inroads |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |volume=53 |issue=45 |pages=A6–A8, A10–A13 |url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i45/45a00601.htm}}</ref> In 2007, the Department of Philosophy at [[Texas State University]] turned down a grant from the Anthem Foundation to support a visiting faculty position that would specialize in Objectivism. Bernstein was a candidate to fill the position. According to Rebecca Raphael, a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Texas State, Bernstein's apology for publishing in the journal indicated that the Anthem Foundation was expecting the person hired to meet an "ideological litmus test."<ref name="glenn2007a" /> According to reporter David Glenn, "When asked by ''The Chronicle'' about his 2002 comments, Mr. Bernstein replied that rejecting ''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'' was a moral and intellectual obligation."<ref name="glenn2007a" />
