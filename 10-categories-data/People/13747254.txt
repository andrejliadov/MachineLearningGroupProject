By definition, however, the term is alien to [[British heraldry]], which follows other rules.

In some European countries, certain armorial bearings have traditionally been restricted to a particular social class (usually the [[nobility]]), e.g. the use of [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] in [[Coat of arms#United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] in [[Portuguese heraldry|Portugal]] or [[coronets]] in [[Swedish heraldry#Noble arms|Sweden]]. Notwithstanding, in most countries outside the [[United Kingdom]], any individual, family and community has usually been free to adopt arms and use them as they please, provided they refrain from wrongfully assuming the preexisting arms of another.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pastoureau |first=Michel |author-link=Michel Pastoureau |translator-last=Garvie |translator-first=Francisca |year=1997 |title=Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning |series='[[Découvertes Gallimard|New Horizons]]' series |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |page=14 |isbn=0-500-30074-7}}</ref> In addition to the [[bourgeoisie]], [[peasant]]s sometimes made use of this tradition.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Arms of the [[clergy]] are classified as [[ecclesiastical heraldry]]. 
 
Use of coats of arms by burghers and [[artisan]]s began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]].

[[House mark]]s are another type charges usually only used in burgher arms.

Crest-[[coronet]]s in burgher arms are correct only if the arms were granted by a [[sovereign]] and the coronet is explicitly mentioned in the grant.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. The Art of Heraldry. Tiger Books International, London. 1991, p. 59 {{ISBN|1-85501-154-9}}</ref>
	
== By country ==
=== Belgium ===
{{Main|Belgian heraldry}}
Bourgeois arms, such as those of the [[bourgeois of Brussels]], were, and remain, common in Belgium and were granted except during the [[French Revolution]]ary period and subsequent [[French First Republic|republic]]. 

Men admitted to the [[Seven Noble Houses of Brussels]], many of whom were ''not'' noble, were also granted arms.

Today, the [[Council of Heraldry and Vexillology]] for the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] and the [[Flemish Heraldic Council]] for the [[Flemish Community]] grant a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] with torse, [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], and [[mantling]] as well as a [[motto]] as external ornaments of the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]]. The additaments reserved for the nobility, such as crowned helmets and rank [[Crown (heraldry)|crowns]], [[supporter]]s and supports, [[banner]]s and [[Battle cry|battle cries]], mantles and pavilions, are prohibited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oghb.be/heraldique-en-belgique|title=Héraldique en Belgique {{!}} Association Royale Office Généalogique et Héraldique de Belgique|website=oghb.be|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref>

=== France ===
Bourgeois arms used to be common in [[France]], but they disappeared in the [[French Revolution]], which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in ''[[Armorial général (of France)|Armorial général]]'' as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients.<ref>[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames & Hudson 1997), p. 33-36</ref> In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.

=== Germany ===
Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “[[Hofpfalzgraf|Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court]]” ({{lang-de|[[:de:Hofpfalzgraf|Hofpfalzgrafen]]}}), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.

The [[tilting helmet]] was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.<ref>[[Ottfried Neubecker]]: A Guide to Heraldry. Cassell, London 1981, p.161. {{ISBN|0-304-30751-3}}</ref>
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city [[Patricianship|patricians]].<ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173">[[Handbuch der Heraldik: Wappenfibel]]. (19th expanded edition). Edited by Ludwig Biewer. (Degener & Co, Neustadt an der Aisch 1998), p. 173</ref> Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German-Nordic heraldic tradition]], e.g. in [[Swedish heraldry]].

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms [[law of arms|are protected by law]].

=== Portugal ===
Burgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the [[Portuguese nobility]].<ref>Stephen Slater: The Complete Book of Heraldry. Lorenz Books 2002, p. 204</ref> This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until the establishment of the Republic in 1910.

== Arms of peasants ==
In some regions ([[Normandy]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]) even peasants sometimes bore arms.<ref>[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames & Hudson 1997), p. 20</ref>
In [[Switzerland]] 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century,<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 108</ref> as well as in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Frisia]] and [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], where farmers had personal freedom.<ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173" /> In [[Denmark]] arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300.<ref>[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 112</ref> In [[Norway]] peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.<ref>Hans Krag: ''Norsk heraldisk mønstring fra Frederik IV's regjeringstid 1699-1730'', Bind II Bønder, (1942 – 1955) and Allan Tønnesen (ed.): ''Magtens besegling.
