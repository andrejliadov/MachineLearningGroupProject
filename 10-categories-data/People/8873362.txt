The '''biographical novel''' is a [[genre]] of [[novel]] which provides a [[fiction]]al account of a contemporary or historical person's life. This kind of novel concentrates on the experiences a person had during his lifetime, the people they met and the incidents which occurred. Like other forms of [[biographical fiction]], details are often trimmed or reimagined to meet the artistic needs of the fictional genre, the [[novel]]. These reimagined biographies are sometimes called '''semi-biographical novels''', to distinguish the relative [[historicity]] of the work from other biographical novels 

The genre rose to prominence in the 1930s with best-selling works by authors such as [[Robert Graves]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Irving Stone]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. These books became best-sellers, but the genre was dismissed by literary critics. It later years it became more accepted and has become both a popular and critically accepted genre.<ref name="Lackey2016">{{cite book|author=Michael Lackey|title=The American Biographical Novel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mn57CwAAQBAJ|date=7 April 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-62892-635-4}}</ref>

Some biographical novels bearing only superficial resemblance to the historical novels or introducing elements of other [[Genre fiction|genres]] that supersede the retelling of the historical narrative, for example ''[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]]'' follows the plot devices of a [[vampire fiction]] closely.  Biographical fiction often also falls within the genres of [[historical fiction]] or [[alternative history]].

Some novels that are known best for their fictional prowess, but include extensive biographical information that is less obvious to readers. A very good example of this kind is Goldsmith's "[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]", believed to be the biography of a  person the author had known and observed very closely. 

Biographical novels are frequently the foundation for [[film adaptations]] into the filmographic genre of [[biographical film]].
