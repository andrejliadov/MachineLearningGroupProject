'''George Worrall Counsel''' (c. July 1758 – 19 January 1843) was a Gloucester solicitor, [[antiquarian]], [[alderman]], and property developer.

He was first apprenticed to an ironmonger but left that to study law and qualified as a solicitor and proctor. He was a noted antiquarian, helping [[Thomas Fosbroke]] with his work, and in 1829 published his own ''History and Description of the City of Gloucester''.

He was a leading property developer in Gloucester and from 1822 developed the area later known as [[Clapham, Gloucester|Clapham]], now part of Kingsholm, on Monkleighton Grounds.
