==History==
Al-Masri was a member of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] alongside [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and fled the country in the mid-1980s along with many other Islamic militants.
He headed al-Qaeda's political committee and was a member of the Shura Council. He has been described as operating as a "trusted lieutenant" of the leader of [[al-Qaeda]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] with whom al-Masri worked in Sudan and Afghanistan.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/senior-al-qaida-leader-killed-in-drone-strike-n6868zd7j|title=Al-Qaida’s deputy leader ‘killed in drone strike’|last=Spencer|first=Richard|date=2017-02-27|work=The Times|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en|url-access=subscription }}</ref>
