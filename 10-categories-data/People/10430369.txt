<!-- When adding people to this list, please make sure their polyamory is documented via citation here. See Talk page for discussion of this. Also, note that "free love" does not always imply polyamory; sometimes it was closer to "serial monogamy". There is a similar list at Open_marriage#Notable_people_in_open_marriages where people on that list are not necessarily polyamorous but are married.-->

This is a list of notable and historic figures who have been or are polyamorous. [[Polyamory]] is the desire, practice, or acceptance of more than one romantic and/or [[intimate relationship]] at a time, with the full knowledge and [[consent]] of all involved. Polyamory also includes or not includes sexual intimacy between all the involved parties.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/26481516 |title=Polyamory |first=Daniella |last=Cutas |work=The International Encyclopedia of Ethics |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd |year=2016}}</ref> Various justifications of the claim may be found in the biographies of the famous individuals from this category.

<!-- When adding people to this list a reliable source must be added that explicitly identifies the subject as "polyamorous". Living people added to this list without such a source may violate our [[WP:BLP]], our policy on biographies of living people, and may be reverted. -->
