'''Budai''' ({{lang-zh|c=布袋|p=Bùdài}}; {{lang-ja|布袋|Hotei}}) is a semi-historical Chinese [[Buddhist monk|monk]] who is venerated as [[Maitreya|Maitreya Buddha]] in [[Chan Buddhism]]. He was also introduced into the [[Japanese Buddhist pantheon]].<ref name="leighton">{{cite book |last=Leighton |first=Taigen Dan |author-link=Taigen Dan Leighton |title=Bodhisattva Archetypes: Classic Buddhist Guides to Awakening and Their Modern Expression |publisher=Penguin Arkana |year=1998 |location=New York |pages=260–261|oclc=37211178 |isbn=0140195564}}</ref> He is said to have lived around the 10th century in the [[Wuyue]] kingdom. His name literally means "cloth sack",<ref name="leighton"/> and refers to the bag that he is conventionally depicted as carrying as he wanders aimlessly. His jolly nature, humorous personality, and [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] lifestyle distinguish him from most Buddhist masters or figures. He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the "'''Laughing Buddha'''".{{efn|{{lang-zh|c=笑佛|p=Xiào Fó|links=no}}}}<ref name="dojuncook">{{cite book|title=How to Raise an Ox|last=Cook|first=Francis Dojun|publisher=[[Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition#Publications|Wisdom Publications]]|isbn=9780861713172|page=166 note 76}}</ref><ref name="laughing">{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/deities/laughing_buddha.htm|title=The Laughing Buddha|publisher=Religionfacts.com|accessdate=2011-12-26}}</ref> As he is traditionally depicted as fat, he is also referred to as the "'''Fat Buddha'''", especially in the [[Western world]].<ref name=":2" />

The main textual evidence pointing to Budai resides in a collection of [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] monks' biographies known as ''[[Transmission of the Lamp|The Transmission of the Lamp]]''.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Chan Master Pu-tai |last=Chapin |first=H. B. |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society|year=1933|volume=53|issue =1|jstor=593188 |doi=10.2307/593188 |pages=47-52 }}</ref>

==Hagiography==
Budai has origins centered around cult worship and local legend.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan|last=Levine|first=Gregory|publisher=Japan Society|year=2007}}</ref> He is traditionally depicted as a fat, bald monk wearing a simple robe. He carries his few possessions in a cloth sack, being poor but content.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Legend of the Laughing Buddha|last=Seow|publisher=Asiapac Books|year=2002}}</ref> He would excitingly entertain the adoring children that followed him and was known for patting his large belly happily. His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of both contentment and abundance. Budai attracted the townspeople around him as he was able to predict people’s fortunes and even weather patterns.<ref name=":1" /> The wandering monk was often inclined to sleep anywhere he came to, even outside, for his mystical powers could ward off the bitter colds of snow and his body was left unaffected. A recovered death note dated to 916 A.D., which the monk himself wrote, claims that he is an incarnation of the [[Maitreya]], the Buddha of the Future.<ref name=":1" />

==Chan/Zen Buddhism==
Budai was one of several "uncommitted saints"{{efn|Chinese: ''san sheng''}} that became incorporated into the Chan pantheon.<ref name=":0" />  Similar "eccentric" figures from the lamp histories were never officially inducted or appropriated into the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] patriarchal line. Instead, these obscure figures represented the "special transmission" that occurred during the early to mid 12th century. This transmission did not rely on patriarchal lineage legitimacy but instead used the peculiar personalities and qualities of various folkloric figures to illustrate the Chan tradition's new commitment to the idea of "awakening" and the propagation of Chan to a larger congregation. The Chan Masters, [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089&ndash;1163) and [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]] (1091&ndash;1157), were both leaders in the initial merging of local legend and Buddhist tradition.<ref name=":0" />  They hoped the induction of likable and odd figures would attract all types of people to the Chan tradition, no matter their gender, social background, or complete understanding of the dharma and patriarchal lineage.<ref name=":0" /> Bernard Faure summarizes this merging of local legend and Chan tradition by explaining, "One strategy in Chan for domesticating the occult was to transform thaumaturges into tricksters by playing down their occult powers and stressing their thus world aspect..."<ref name=":0" /> The movement allocated the figures as religious props and channeled their extraordinary charismas into the lens of the Chan pantheon in order to appeal to a larger population. Ultimately, Budai was revered from both a folkloric standpoint as a strange, wandering vagabond of the people as well as from his newfound personage within the context of the Chan tradition as a 'mendicant priest'<ref name=":0" /> who brought abundance, fortune, and joy to all he encountered with the help of his mystical "cloth sack" bag.

==In Art==
As Zen Buddhism was transmitted to Japan around the 13th century, the devout monastics and laymen of the area utilized figure painting to portray the characters central to this "awakening" period of Zen art.<ref name=":0" /> Many of the eccentric personalities that were inducted into the Zen tradition like Budai were previously wrapped up in the established culture and folklore of the Japanese people. The assimilation and reapplication of these wondrous charismas to the Zen pantheon assisted in the expansion of the Zen tradition.
Budai is almost always depicted with his cloth sack that looks like a large bag. The bag serves as a prominent motif within the context of Zen Buddhism as it represents abundance, prosperity, and contentment. Ink paintings such as these attributed to Budai often had an inscription and seal that signaled to high ranking officials. For example, ''Budai and Jiang Mohe'' was inscribed by Chusi Fanqi, who was closely related to [[Song Lian]] (1310–1381) and Wei Su (1295–1372).

As the images demonstrate, Budai is most jubilant when in the presence of others, especially children. When depicted with other gods in the [[Seven Lucky Gods]], Budai maintains a solemn or even depressed countenance. Budai's round figure comes into practical use through the sculpting of the incense box (18th century) that splits the monk's body into two halves. The newer images such as ''Hotei and Children Carrying Lanterns'' (19th century) employs much more color, dramatization of physical features, and detail than the older pieces such as ''Hotei'' from [[Mokuan Reien]] (1336) that employs much more wispy and heavily contrasting outlines of his figure with no color or assumed setting.

==Confusion with other religious figures==

===Gautama Buddha===
In the [[Western World]], Budai is often mistaken for [[Gautama Buddha]] himself, and thus is nicknamed the "Fat Buddha".<ref name=":2">{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Christopher|title=When Did the Buddha Become Fat?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-good-life/201207/when-did-the-buddha-become-fat|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

===Angida===
[[File:Wang Zhen Budai under a pine tree 1921 RCH 1027 img02.jpg|thumb|right|''Budai under a pine tree'', by Wang Zhen. 1921]]

Angida was one of the original [[Eighteen Arhats]]. According to legend, Angida was a talented Indian snake catcher whose aim was to catch venomous snakes to prevent them from biting passers-by. Angida would also remove the snake's venomous fangs and release them. Due to his kindness, he was able to attain [[bodhi]].

In Chinese art, Angida is sometimes portrayed as Budai, being rotund, laughing, and carrying a bag.<ref name="sound">{{cite book|title=The Sound of One Hand: Paintings and Calligraphy by Zen Master Hakuin|last1=Seo|first1=Audrey Yoshiko|last2=Addiss|first2=Stephen|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2010|ISBN=9781590305782|page=205}}</ref>

===Phra Sangkajai===
In [[Thailand]], Budai is sometimes confused with the [[arhat]] [[Katyayana (Buddhist)|Kaccāna]], known in Thailand as ''Phra Sangkajai'' or ''Phra Sangkachai''. Buddha praised Phra Sangkajai for his excellence in explaining sophisticated concepts of the [[dharma|dhamma]] in an easily and correctly understandable manner. Phra Sangkajai is also known for composing the ''Madhupindika Sutta''.

One story from [[Thai folklore]] relates that Phra Sangkajai was so handsome that even a man once wanted him for a wife. To avoid a similar situation, Phra Sangkajai decided to transform himself into a fat monk. Another tale says he was so attractive that angels and men often compared him with the Buddha. He considered this inappropriate, so disguised himself in an unpleasantly fat body.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Although both Budai and Phra Sangkajai may be found in both Thai and Chinese temples, Phra Sangkajai is found more often in Thai temples, and Budai in Chinese temples. Two points to distinguish them from one another are:
# Phra Sangkajai has a trace of hair on his head (looking similar to the Buddha's) while Budai is clearly bald.
# Phra Sangkajai wears the robes in [[Theravada]] fashion, with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered. Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.
===Kangxi Emperor===
In Mongolia, Budai is called Enkh Amaglan Khan, which is identical to the Mongolian name for the [[Kangxi Emperor]]. Because of this, Budai is often mistaken for the Kangxi Emperor.
