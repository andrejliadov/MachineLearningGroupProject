A '''clerihew''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|ɛr|ᵻ|h|j|uː}}) is a whimsical, four-line biographical poem invented by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. The first line is the name of the poem's subject, usually a famous person put in an absurd light, or revealing something unknown or spurious about them. The rhyme scheme is AABB, and the rhymes are often forced.  The line length and metre are irregular. Bentley invented the clerihew in school and then popularized it in books. One of his best known is this (1905):

{{quote|<poem>Sir [[Christopher Wren]]
Said, "I am going to dine with some men.
If anyone calls
Say I am designing St. Paul's."<ref name=bentley>{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|year=1905|title=Biography for Beginners|isbn=978-1-4437-5315-9}}</ref></poem>}}

==Form==
A clerihew has the following properties:
* It is biographical and usually whimsical, showing the subject from an unusual point of view; it mostly pokes fun at famous people
* It has four lines of irregular length and metre for comic effect
* The rhyme structure is AABB; the subject matter and wording are often humorously contrived in order to achieve a rhyme, including the use of phrases in Latin, French and other non-English languages<ref>[http://www.verse.org.uk/what-is-a-clerihew.html What is a Clerihew?]</ref>
* The first line contains, and may consist solely of, the subject's name.  According to a letter in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in the 1960s, Bentley said that a true clerihew has to have the name "at the end of the first line", as the whole point was the skill in rhyming awkward names.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=William|title=The Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|page=xiv|chapter=Introduction|date=1965}} Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>

Clerihews are not satirical or abusive, but they target famous individuals and reposition them in an absurd, [[anachronism|anachronistic]] or commonplace setting, often giving them an over-simplified and slightly garbled description.

==Practitioners==
The form was invented by and is named after [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley]]. When he was a 16-year-old pupil at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London, the lines of his first clerihew, about [[Humphry Davy]], came into his head during a science class.<ref name=gale>{{cite book|last=Gale|first=Steven H.|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese|page=139|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0-8240-5990-5}}</ref> Together with his schoolfriends, he filled a notebook with examples.<ref name=First>{{cite book|first=E. Clerihew|last=Bentley|title=The First Clerihews|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-212980-5}}</ref> The first use of the word in print was in 1928.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> Bentley published three volumes of his own clerihews: ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), published as "edited by E. Clerihew";<ref name=gale/> ''More Biography'' (1929); and ''Baseless Biography'' (1939), a compilation of clerihews originally published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' illustrated by the author's son [[Nicolas Bentley]].

[[G. K. Chesterton]], a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated ''Biography for Beginners''.<ref name=gale/> Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including [[W. H. Auden]],<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Michael|year=2007|title=The All-sustaining Air: Romantic Legacies and Renewals in British, American, and Irish Poetry Since 1900|url=https://archive.org/details/allsustainingair1900onei_049|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/allsustainingair1900onei_049/page/n106 94]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929928-7}}</ref> and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist [[Craig Brown (satirist)|Craig Brown]] has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.

There has been newfound popularity of the form on [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Clerihew&src=tyah Twitter].

==Examples==
Bentley's first clerihew, published in 1905, was written about Sir Humphry Davy:
{{quote|<poem>Sir [[Humphry Davy]]
Abominated gravy.
He lived in the odium
Of having discovered [[sodium]].<ref name=First/></poem>}}

The original poem had the second line "Was not fond of gravy";<ref name=First/> but the published version has "Abominated gravy".

Other clerihews by Bentley include:
{{quote|<poem>[[George III of the United Kingdom|George the Third]]
Ought never to have occurred.
One can only wonder
At so grotesque a blunder.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=Morton S. (ed.)|year=1997|title=A New Dictionary of Eponyms|url=https://archive.org/details/newdictionaryepo00free|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdictionaryepo00free/page/n62 50]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-509354-2}}</ref></poem>}}
and
{{quote|<poem>[[John Stuart Mill]],
By a mighty effort of will,
Overcame his natural bonhomie
And wrote ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]''.<ref>''Biography for Beginners''. {{cite book|last=Swainson|first=Bill (ed.)|year=2000|title=Encarta Book of Quotations|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encartabookofquo00swai/page/642 642–43]|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-23000-1|url=https://archive.org/details/encartabookofquo00swai/page/642}}</ref></poem>}}

W. H. Auden's ''[[Academic Graffiti]]'' (1971) includes:
{{quote|<poem>Sir [[Henry Rider Haggard]]
Was completely staggered
When his bride-to-be
Announced, "I am [[She (novel)|She]]!"</poem>}}

Satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' noted Auden's work and responded:
{{quote|<poem>W. H. Auden
Suffers from acute boredom
But for his readers he's got some merry news
He's written a collection of rather bad clerihews</poem>}}
A second stanza aimed a jibe at Auden's publisher, [[Faber and Faber]].

Alan Turing, one of the founders of computing, was the subject of a clerihew written by the pupils of his ''alma mater'', [[Sherborne School]] in England:
{{quote|<poem>[[Turing]]
Must have been alluring
To get made a don
So early on.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hodges|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Hodges|year=1983|title=Alan Turing: The Enigma|title-link=Alan Turing: The Enigma|page=[https://archive.org/details/alanturing00andr/page/94 94]|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-671-52809-2}}</ref></poem>}}

A clerihew appreciated by chemists is cited in ''Dark Sun'' by [[Richard Rhodes]], and regards the inventor of the thermos bottle (or [[Dewar flask]]): 
{{quote|<poem>[[Sir James Dewar]]
Is a better man than you are
None of you asses
Can liquefy gases.</poem>}}

''Dark Sun'' also features a clerihew about the German-British physicist and [[Soviet]] nuclear spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]:
{{quote|<poem>[[Klaus Fuchs|Fuchs]]
Looks 
Like an ascetic
Theoretic<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dark Sun : The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |url=https://archive.org/details/darksunmakinghyd00rhod |url-access=limited |last=Rhodes |first=Richard |date=1995 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=068480400X |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/darksunmakinghyd00rhod/page/n52 57], 488|oclc = 32509950}}</ref></poem>}}

In 1983, ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]'' magazine ran a contest titled "Do You Clerihew?" The winning entry was:
{{quote|<poem>Did [[Descartes]]
Depart
With the thought
"[[Cogito ergo sum|Therefore I'm not]]"?</poem>}}

==Other uses of the form==
The clerihew form has also occasionally been used for non-biographical verses. Bentley opened his 1905 ''Biography for Beginners'' with an example, entitled "Introductory Remarks", on the theme of biography itself:

{{quote|<poem>The Art of Biography
Is different from Geography.
Geography is about Maps,
But Biography is about Chaps.</poem>}}

The third edition of the same work, published in 1925, included a "Preface to the New Edition" in 11 [[stanza]]s, each in clerihew form. One stanza ran:

{{quote|<poem>On biographic style
(Formerly so vile)
The book has had an effect
Greater than I could reasonably expect.</poem>}}
