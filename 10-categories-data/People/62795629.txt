A '''private citizen''' is someone who does not have an official or professional role in a given situation.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2014, [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/33513 ''s.v.'', definition 5]</ref>

The same person may be a private citizen in one role, and an [[official]] in another. For example, a [[legislator]] is an official when voting in the legislature, but a private citizen when paying taxes or when undertaking a [[citizen's arrest]] in a public place.

A person may remain a private citizen even when having considerable political power and influence:
<blockquote>
...Pericles, '''in his capacity as a private citizen''', was able to dominate the affairs of the Athenian assembly, and to direct and guide the ''demos'' for nearly a generation.<ref>Graham Maddox, "Democratic theory and the face to face society", ''Politics'' '''9''':1:56-62 (1974) as quoted in {{cite journal |last1=Sparkes |first1=A. W. |title=Idiots, ancient and modern |journal=Australian Journal of Political Science |date=1988 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=101â€“102 |doi=10.1080/00323268808402051 |ref=harv}}</ref></blockquote>

==In law==

Private citizens in ''[[qui tam]]'' actions bring suit on behalf of the state but are not [[officers of the court]], and are possibly eligible for a reward.<ref>Gerald N. Hill, Kathleen Hill, ''Nolo's Plain English Law Dictionary'', 2009, {{isbn|1413310370}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Nolo_s_Plain_English_Law_Dictionary/LUQ-AQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22private%20citizen%22%20%22law%20dictionary%22&pg=PA350 ''s.v.'' "qui tam action", p. 350]</ref>

Private citizens may have the right to make citizen's arrests under certain circumstances, despite not being [[oath|sworn]] [[Police officer|law-enforcement officials]].

Private citizens may have the right to bring [[citizen suits]] to enforce a [[statute]].

A government employee may be considered to be a private citizen in the context of law enforcement actions. For example, an emergency medical technician who discovered contraband on a patient was ruled not to be a "government agent" for the purposes of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional restrictions on government searches]].<ref>Ken Wallentine, ''Street Legal: A Guide to Pre-trial Criminal Procedure for Police, Prosecutors, and Defenders'', 2007, {{isbn|1590318226}}, [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Street_Legal/YlFsR2voQ1AC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22private%20citizen%22&pg=PA145 p. 145]</ref><ref>[[Walter v.
