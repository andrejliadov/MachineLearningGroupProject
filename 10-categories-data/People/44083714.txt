'''''El buner d'Ordino''''' ({{lang-ca|"The Piper of Ordino Parish"}}) is an [[Andorra]]n folktale of a [[bagpipes|bagpiper]] chased up a tree by wolves who fends them off with the sound of his instrument, the ''buna'' or ''[[sac de gemecs]]'' of Catalonia.

==Plot==
In the tale, the people of the town of [[Canillo]] decide to hire a piper for a festival, but as night begins to fall the piper still has not arrived. It turns out the piper had been walking on his way to the festival, but was surprised by a pack of wolves on [[Casamanya]] mountain. The piper turned to flee, and just managed to climb a tree to escape the pack, but the wolves remained at the base of the tree waiting for him to come down. In fear, the piper clutched his bagpipes, causing the pipes to blare out their sound. This sound startled the wolves, who then ran away.<ref name="RomànOliva2010">{{cite book|author1=Àlvar Valls Oliva - Roser Carol Romàn|author2=Àlvar Valls i Oliva|author3=Roser Carol i Romàn|title=Llegendes d'Andorra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grNP6uNi7OcC&pg=PA95|date=15 November 2010|publisher=L'Abadia de Montserrat|isbn=978-84-9883-340-9|pages=95–}}</ref>

Depending on the version of the legend, the piper was either found the next day by a search party, still playing his pipes to keep the wolves away, or else arrived at the party late, having walked the rest of the way to Canillo playing his pipes all along the way.
