He was a university professor and  a prominent linguist in the  languages spoken by the [[Sami people]]. He is widely recognized as the founder of the studies of the [[Sami languages]].

==Background==
Friis was born in [[Sogndal]] in [[Sogn og Fjordane]], Norway. He was the son of church vicar Soren Hjelm Friis (1781–1856) and Charlotte Lovise Cammermeyer (1789–1869). He was the brother of priest and politician [[Nicolai Friis]]. Friis completed  his final exams from  Møllers Institute  in [[Oslo|Christiania]] in 1840 and earned his [[cand.theol.]] in  1844. From 1847 to 1849, he was a research fellow in [[Sami languages|Sami]] and [[Finns|Finnish]]. By the autumn of 1849, he went on a grant to [[Kajaani]], [[Finland]] to continue his studies under [[Lönnrot Elias]], the founder of Finnish folklore studies. Friis stayed for a time in [[Finnmark]] and in return he assumed teaching ministry for priests.<ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_sogn_og_fjordane/fylkesleksikon/1307860.html

==Career==
Friis was appointed reader in Sami languages at the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]] (now University of Oslo) in 1863. Three years later he was awarded a chair in the [[Sami languages|Lapp]] and [[Kven language]]s, with a special duty in translation. He published on the Sami language and mythology as well as travel literature about Northern Norway.  Friis established the northern Sami orthography, which although modified through three spelling reforms is in common usage. Until the [[Konrad Nielsen]]'s dictionary '' Lappisk ordbok''  was published in three volumes between 1932 and 1938, Friis' Sami dictionary was the most important of its kind. Friis also translated  ''With Nansen over Greenland in 1888: My journey from Lapland to Greenland'' by [[Samuel Balto]] from the original Sami into the [[Norwegian language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/J_A_Friis|title=   J A Friis, Forfatter, Språkforsker|publisher=    Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Hans Lindkjølen|accessdate= June 20, 2016}}</ref>

==Friis' ethnographic maps==
Friis published three series of [[thematic map]]s covering Norway north of the [[Ofotfjord]]. The first edition was published in 1861, and the second in  1888/1890. Each household was coded with a three-way symbol denoting 1) ethnic group 2) household member's fluency in Norwegian, Sami, and Kven, and 3) whether the family lived in a [[goahti]]. These maps, in addition to the [[census]]es of 1865, 1875, 1891, and 1900, provide a valuable resource of knowledge of the ethnicity and language in the [[Arctic|circumpolar]] region decades before the enforcement of Norwegian as the single official language in schools.
