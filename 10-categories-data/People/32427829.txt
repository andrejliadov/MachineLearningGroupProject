'''''The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid''''' is a biography and partly first-hand account written by [[Pat Garrett]], sheriff of [[Lincoln County, New Mexico]], in collaboration with a [[ghostwrite]]r, [[Marshall Ashmun Upson|Marshall Ashmun "Ash" Upson]].  During the summer of 1881 in a small New Mexican village, Garrett shot and killed the notorious outlaw, William H. Bonney, better known as [[Billy the Kid]].  Due to the first publisher's inability to widely distribute this book beginning in 1882,<ref>{{cite book |last = LeMay |first = John and Stahl, Robert J. |date = 2020

|location =  Roswell, NM |publisher = Bicep Books |pages = 127–133 |isbn = 978-1-953221-91-9}}</ref> it sold relatively few copies during Garrett's lifetime.<ref name="utley198" />  By the time the fifth publisher purchased the copyright in 1954, this book had become a major reference for historians who have studied the Kid's brief life.  The promotion and distribution of the fifth version of this book to libraries in the United States and Europe sent it into a sixth printing in 1965, and by 1976 it had reached its tenth printing.<ref>Tuska (1983), p. 114.</ref>  For a generation after Sheriff Garrett shot the Kid, his account was considered to be factual,<ref>Tuska (1983), p. 125.</ref> but historians have since found in this book many embellishments and inconsistencies with other accounts of the life of Billy the Kid.

== Purpose ==
In the days and weeks that followed the death of Billy the Kid, there were several articles written mostly in New Mexican newspapers and [[dime novel]]s that depicted the Kid's death in ways that put Pat Garrett in a bad light.  As the author wrote in his introductory to this biography, "I am incited to this labor, in a measure, by an impulse to correct the thousand false statements which have appeared in the public newspapers and in yellow-covered, cheap novels."<ref name="Garrett">Quotation from the introductory to ''The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid'' by Pat Garrett.</ref>  Garrett's purpose comes in two parts; firstly, he wanted to publicly respond to the speculative accusations against him about Billy the Kid's death that were being printed, and secondly, he wanted to set the record straight regarding the more notable incidents that had involved the notorious outlaw beginning with his early life and leading up to his untimely death.  Many people had begun to gossip about the unfairness of Garrett's final encounter with the Kid, so his first reason, which was to clear his name, was decidedly his main purpose.<ref>Tuska (1983), p. 192.</ref>

Still smarting from local outrage in New Mexico over his shooting of the Kid,<ref name="Boggs2013">{{cite book|author=Johnny D. Boggs|title=Billy the Kid on Film, 1911-2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SiXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|date=20 September 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0335-3|page=12}}</ref> Garrett wanted to present his side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life and death in 1882.<ref name="Nolan2014358">{{cite book|author=Frederick Nolan|title=The Billy the Kid Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MwjjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA358|date=20 October 2014|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8254-4|page=358}}</ref> It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]]'s postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist.<ref name="Keleher2008">{{cite book|author=William A.

The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, ''The Authentic Life'' served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s.<ref name="Nolan2014358" /><ref name="Tatum1982123">{{cite book|author=Stephen Tatum|title=Inventing Billy the Kid: Visions of the Outlaw in America, 1881-1981|url=https://archive.org/details/inventingbillyki00tatu|url-access=registration|date=1 January 1982|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0-8263-0610-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/inventingbillyki00tatu/page/123 123]–124}}</ref><ref name="Tuska1994">{{cite book|author=Jon Tuska|title=Billy the Kid, his life and legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijLXAAAAMAAJ|date=30 May 1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=237}}</ref> Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid.<ref name="Tuska1994114">{{cite book|author=Jon Tuska|title=Billy the Kid, his life and legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijLXAAAAMAAJ|date=30 May 1994|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=114}}</ref>

Garrett, who did not consider himself a writer, called upon his friend, [[Marshall Ashmun Upson|Marshall Ashmun "Ash" Upson]], to ghostwrite this book with him.<ref name="utley198">Utley (1989), pgs. 198-9.</ref>  Ash Upson was an itinerant journalist who had a gift for graphic prose.  Upson and Garrett shared equally in the [[royalties]].<ref>Tuska (1983), p. 37.</ref> As was noted in the introduction to the fifth version of this book:
{{Quote|Garrett and Upson became very close friends, and this friendship endured until Upson's death at Uvalde, Texas, in 1894.  He was buried there in a cemetery lot owned by Pat Garrett.
