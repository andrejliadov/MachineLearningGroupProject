A '''septet''' is a formation containing exactly seven members. It is commonly associated with musical groups but can be applied to any situation where seven similar or related objects are considered a single unit, such as a seven-line stanza of poetry. In [[jazz music|jazz]], a septet is any group of seven players, usually containing a [[drum set]], [[string bass]] or [[bass guitar|electric bass]], and groups of one or two of the following instruments, [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]], or [[trombone]].

One of the most famous classical septets is [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet in E{{music|flat}} major]], Op. 20, composed around 1799–1800, for [[soprano clarinet|clarinet]], [[bassoon]], [[French horn|horn]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]].<ref>[https://imslp.org/wiki/Septet_in_E-flat_major,_Op.20_(Beethoven,_Ludwig_van) Septet in E-flat major, Op.20 (Beethoven, Ludwig van)] ''imslp.org'', accessed 5 October 2020</ref> The popularity of Beethoven's septet made its combination of instruments a standard for subsequent composers, including [[Conradin Kreutzer]] (Op. 62, 1822), [[Franz Berwald]], and [[Adolphe Blanc]] (Op. 40, ca. 1864),<ref>[https://imslp.org/index.php?title=Category:For_clarinet%2C_bassoon%2C_horn%2C_violin%2C_viola%2C_cello%2C_double_bass&transclude=Template:Catintro Category:For clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello, double bass] ''imslp.org'', accessed 5 October 2020</ref> and, with small changes in the instrumentation, [[Franz Lachner]] (1824; violin, viola, violoncello, contrabass, flute, clarinet, horn),<ref>See: [Mus.ms. 5793 D-Mbs Mus.ms. 5792] & [https://opac.rism.info/search?id=456081795&View=rism D-Mbs Mus.ms. 5793 @ RISM] ''opac.rism.info'', and Beyer's {{OCLC|19557729}} completion published in 1988 (perhaps in 1967 and reprinted - unclear).</ref> and [[Max Bruch]] (1849; No Opus; Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon, two Violins, Cello and Contrabass). When [[Franz Schubert]] added a second violin in 1824 for his [[Octet (Schubert)|Octet]], he created a standard octet that influenced many other subsequent composers <small>{{harv|Kube|2001}}</small>. [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]'s Septet in E{{music|flat}} major, Op. 65 (1881) is for [[trumpet]], [[piano]], [[string quartet]], and double bass.<ref>[https://imslp.org/wiki/Septet%2C_Op.65_(Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%2C_Camille) Septet, Op.65 (Saint-Saëns, Camille)] ''imslp.org'', accessed 5 October 2020</ref>

The [[20th-century classical music|modern composer]] [[Bohuslav Martinů]] wrote three septets: a group of six dances called ''Les Rondes'' for [[oboe]], clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, two violins, and piano (1930); a piece called Serenade No. 3 for oboe, clarinet, four violins, and cello (1932); and ''Fantasie'' for [[theremin]], oboe, piano, and string quartet (1944). [[Darius Milhaud]] composed a string septet in 1964 for [[string sextet]] and double bass. [[Paul Hindemith]] composed a wind septet in 1948 for [[flute]], oboe, clarinet, [[bass clarinet]], bassoon, horn, and trumpet. [[Hanns Eisler]] composed two septets, both scored for flute, clarinet, bassoon, and string quartet: Septet No. 1 Op.&nbsp;92a ("Variations on American Children's Songs") (1941), and Septet No. 2 ("Circus") (1947), after Chaplin’s 1928 movie ''[[The Circus (1928 film)|The Circus]]''. Two component works in the series of ''[[Chôros]]'' by the Brazilian composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] are scored for seven instruments: [[Chôros No. 3|No. 3]] (1925), subtitled "Pica-páo" (Woodpecker), is for clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, 3 horns, and trombone (or for male chorus, or for both together), and [[Chôros No. 7|No. 7]] (1924), actually subtitled "Septet", is for flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, violin, and cello (with tam-tam ad lib.).

There are some 20th-century works for seven instruments for which it is difficult to be certain that the term "septet" should be extended, if they are not obviously [[chamber music]] and may have titles pointing in other directions. Examples include [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Introduction and Allegro (Ravel)|Introduction and Allegro]]'' (1905), [[Rudi Stephan]]'s ''Music for Seven String Instruments'' (1911), [[Leoš Janáček]]'s [[Concertino (Janáček)|Concertino]] (1925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Suite, Op. 29 (1925–26), [[Isang Yun]]'s ''Music for Seven Instruments'' (1959), [[Aribert Reimann]]'s ''Reflexionen'' (1966), and [[Dieter Schnebel]]'s ''In motu proprio'' canon for seven instruments of the same kind (1975) {{harv|Kube|2001}}. [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] wrote his string septet, ''[[Shaker Loops]]'', in 1978.
