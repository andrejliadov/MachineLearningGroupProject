The series, developed by [[Jason Rothenberg (television producer)|Jason Rothenberg]], is loosely based on the [[The 100 (novel series)|novel series of the same name]] by [[Kass Morgan]].<ref name="thefutoncritic">{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/100/ |title=100, THE (CW) |website=The Futon Critic |access-date=May 10, 2013}}</ref>

The series follows a group of post-apocalyptic survivors, chiefly a group of criminal adolescents, including [[Clarke Griffin]] ([[Eliza Taylor]]), [[Finn Collins]] ([[Thomas McDonell]]), [[Bellamy Blake]] ([[Bob Morley]]), [[Octavia Blake]] ([[Marie Avgeropoulos]]), Jasper Jordan ([[Devon Bostick]]), Monty Green ([[Christopher Larkin (actor)|Christopher Larkin]]), Raven Reyes ([[Lindsey Morgan]]), John Murphy ([[Richard Harmon]]), and Wells Jaha ([[Eli Goree]]). They are among the first people from a [[space habitat]], the ''Ark'', to return to Earth after a devastating [[Nuclear holocaust|nuclear apocalypse]]. Other lead characters include Dr. Abby Griffin ([[Paige Turco]]), Clarke's mother; Marcus Kane ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), a council member on the ''Ark''; and Thelonious Jaha ([[Isaiah Washington]]), the Chancellor of the ''Ark'' and Wells' father.

==Synopsis==
<!---As per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], season summaries should each be a maximum 100 words--->
Ninety-seven years after a devastating [[Nuclear holocaust|nuclear apocalypse]] wipes out almost all life on Earth, thousands of people now live in a [[Space habitat|space station]] orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three [[Generation|generations]] have been born in space, but when life-support systems on the Ark begin to fail, one hundred juvenile [[detainees]] are sent to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is habitable, or at least save resources for the remaining residents of the Ark. They discover that some survived the apocalypse: the grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the Reapers, another group of grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain Men, who live in [[Mount Weather]], descended from those who locked themselves away before the apocalypse. Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke, the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface conditions, battle hostile grounders and establish communication with the Ark.

In the second season, forty-eight of the remaining detainees are captured and taken to Mount Weather by the Mountain Men. The Mountain Men are transfusing blood from imprisoned grounders as an anti-radiation treatment as their bodies have not adapted to deal with the remaining radiation on Earth. Medical tests of the forty-eight show their bone marrow will allow the Mountain Men to survive outside containment, so the Mountain Men begin taking the youths' bone marrow. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the Ark have crash-landed various stations on Earth and begin an alliance with the grounders to save both their people, naming the main settlement at Alpha Station "Camp Jaha". The season ends with the massacre of the Mountain Men to save the prisoners. During this time, former Chancellor Jaha leads a group in search of a fabled "City of Light." Jaha discovers an [[artificial intelligence]] named A.L.I.E. while John Murphy finds an alarming video implying a connection between the AI and the destruction of the world.

In the third season, Alpha Station renamed Arkadia, comes under new management when Pike, a former teacher, and mentor on the Ark, is elected as chancellor and begins a war with the grounders. Pike kills an encampment of grounder warriors while they sleep, which further damages their already fragile relationship with the grounders. Furthermore, the grounder leader Lexa is killed by her mentor during a failed assassination attempt on Clarke. A.L.I.E.{{snd}} who was commanded to make life better for mankind{{snd}} is revealed to have responded by solving the problem of [[human overpopulation]] by launching the nuclear apocalypse that devastated Earth, and begins to use ingestible computer chips to take control of peoples' minds. A.L.I.E. is ultimately destroyed by Clarke, but not before warning of an impending apocalyptic disaster.

In the fourth season, hundreds of nuclear reactors around the world are melting down due to decades of neglect that will result in the majority of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Clarke and the others search for ways to survive the coming wave of radiation. When it is discovered that the grounders with black blood – known as the Nightbloods – can metabolize radiation, Clarke and the others attempt to recreate the formula, but fail to test it. An old bunker is discovered that can protect 1,200 people for over five years from the new apocalypse; each of the twelve clans selects a hundred people to stay in the bunker. A small group decides to return to space and attempt to survive in the remnants of the Ark. Clarke, who is now a nightblood, remains on the Earth's surface alone.

In the fifth season, six years after the meltdown of the nuclear reactors, a prisoner transport ship arrives in the only green spot left on Earth, where Clarke and Madi, a Nightblood grounder who also survived the wave of radiation that swept the planet after the meltdown, have been living. Those who survived in space and in the bunker have returned safely on the ground. A struggle for the Shallow Valley between the prisoners and a new, united clan, known as ''Wonkru'', begins, resulting in a battle ending with the valley being destroyed. The survivors escape to space and go into [[cryosleep]] while they wait for the Earth to recover. However, Monty discovers that Earth will apparently never recover and, before dying of old age, sets the prison ship on a course for a new world.

In the sixth season, after 125 years in cryosleep, Clarke, Bellamy, and the others wake up to find out that they are no longer orbiting Earth and have been brought to a new habitable world, Alpha, also known as Sanctum. After landing on this world, they discover a new society, led by ruling families known as the Primes. They also discover new dangers in this new world, and a mysterious rebel group, known as the Children of Gabriel as well as a mysterious Anomaly. Clarke falls victim to the Primes and ends up in a battle with one for control of her body, a fight which she ultimately wins. The season ends with the deaths of most of the Primes, but also with the loss of Abby Griffin and Marcus Kane. Throughout the season, Madi is haunted through the Flame AI by the spirit of the Dark Commander, an evil grounder leader that had ruled when Indra was a child. In order to save Madi, Raven is forced to destroy the Flame, but the Dark Commander escapes.

The seventh season finds the inhabitants of Sanctum trying to find a way to live together in peace following the aftermath of the events of the previous season while battling the resurrected Dark Commander. At the same time, Clarke and others come into conflict with the mysterious Disciples, humans from another world who are convinced that Clarke holds the key to winning a last war that is coming. The season also explores the mysterious Anomaly introduced in the sixth season, now identified as a [[wormhole]] linking six planets, one of them being a regenerated Earth, together. After vanishing and being believed dead for some time, Bellamy returns, but converts to the Disciple cause, ultimately leading to his death at Clarke's hands. At the end of the series, the Dark Commander is permanently killed by Indra and humanity achieves Transcendence aside from Clarke who committed murder during the test. Clarke returns to Earth where her surviving friends and Octavia's new boyfriend Levitt choose to join her for a peaceful new life, although Madi remains Transcended.

Post-production work, including [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|ADR recording]] for the series, was done at the [[Cherry Beach Sound]] recording studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cherrybeachsound.com/2014/10/07/recording-adr-for-the-100/ |title=Recording ADR in the studio for The 100 via ISDN |date=October 7, 2014 |work=Cherry Beach Sound |access-date=October 7, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020092009/http://www.cherrybeachsound.com/2014/10/07/recording-adr-for-the-100/ |archive-date=October 20, 2014}}</ref>
[[David J. Peterson]], who created [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] for ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', developed the Trigedasleng language for The Grounders. Jason Rothenberg said it was similar to [[Creole English]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hypable.com/the-100-season-2-grounder-language-peterson/ |title='The 100' language creator explains 'Grounder speak' |last=Wilken |first=Selina |publisher=Hypable |date=November 7, 2014 |access-date=November 7, 2017}}</ref> The language is called "Trig" on the show.<ref>{{cite episode |title=[[List_of_The_100_episodes#Season_5_(2018)|The Dark Year]] |series=The 100 |credits=Heidi Cole McAdams (writer) & Alex Kalymnios (director) |network=[[The CW]] |airdate=May 21, 2018 |season=5 |number=11 |time=6:14}}</ref>
After his constructed language work on ''[[Star-Crossed (TV series)|Star-Crossed]]'', Peterson was contacted by the producers of ''The 100'' to create a language for the Grounders, an evolution of English.<ref name="conlangery2" /> In the setting, 97 years have passed since the apocalypse,<ref name="97years">{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episode-link=List of The 100 episodes#ep1 |series=The 100 |network=[[The CW]] |date=March 19, 2014 |season=1 |number=1 |minutes=00:28 |quote=It's been 97 years since a nuclear apocalypse killed everyone on Earth}}</ref> which is a very short time for significant language change.<ref name="conlangery2">{{Cite web |url=http://conlangery.com/2016/07/04/conlangery-121-trigedasleng/ |title=Conlangery #121: Trigedasleng |date=July 4, 2016 |website=Conlangery Podcast |access-date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> Because of this, Peterson posited an accelerated evolution in which the early Grounders used a [[cant (language)|cant]] specifically to obfuscate their speech and to differentiate between friend or foe.

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show holds a 92% average approval rating across its 6 seasons. Its first season has a 76% approval rating based on 37 reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 6.98/10. The site's consensus reads: "Although flooded with stereotypes, the suspenseful atmosphere helps make ''The 100'' a rare high-concept guilty pleasure".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_100/s01|title=The 100: Season 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]]|access-date=July 22, 2019}}</ref> 

On [[Metacritic]], the first season scores 63 out of 100 points, based on 26 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web |title=The 100 on metacritic |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-100 |website=Metacritic |access-date=December 10, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106210322/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-100 |archive-date=January 6, 2015}}</ref>

The second season was met with more favorable reviews, holding a rating of 100% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 11 reviews, with an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average score]] of 8.77/10. The site's consensus reads: "''The 100'' hones all of the things that make it tick for a dynamic second season complete with fast-paced storylines, vivid visuals, and interesting characters to root for -- or against."<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100: Season 2 |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-100/s02 |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=February 26, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602145939/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/-CW/ |archive-date=June 2, 2014}}</ref> In a review of the second-season finale, Kyle Fowle of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said, "Very few shows manage to really push the boundaries of moral compromise in a way that feels legitimately difficult. ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' did it. ''[[The Sopranos]]'' did it. ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' has done it. Those shows never back down from the philosophical murkiness of their worlds, refusing to provide a tidy, [[happy ending]] if it doesn't feel right. With 'Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two,' ''The 100'' has done the same, presenting a finale that doesn't shy away from the morally complex stakes it's spent a whole season building up".<ref>{{cite web |title= The 100: "Blood Must Have Blood, Part Two" |url= https://tv.avclub.com/the-100-blood-must-have-blood-part-two-1798183046 |website=A.V.

This is a show about moral choices and the consequences of those choices, and it's been laudably committed to those ideas from Day 1".<ref>{{cite web |title= What Happened On The Season Finale Of 'The 100'?|url= https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-100-season-finale_n_6850268 |work=HuffPost|author=Maureen Ryan |access-date=March 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313043004/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/11/the-100-season-finale_n_6850268.html |archive-date=March 13, 2015}}</ref>

The third season received an overall rating of 83% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7.29/10. The Critical consensus is, "''The 100'' goes macro in season 3, skillfully expanding the literal scope of the setting and figurative moral landscape".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-100/s03 |title=The 100: Season 3 |website=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=February 26, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527011216/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the-100/s03 |archive-date=May 27, 2016}}</ref> [[Maureen Ryan]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote in an early review of the third season: "When looking at the epic feel and varied array of stories on display in season three, which overtly and covertly recalls "The Lord of the Rings" saga in a number of ways, it's almost hard to recall how limited the scope and the ambitions of "The 100" were two years ago, when a rag-tag band of survivors first crash-landed on Earth. In season three (which the cast and showrunner previewed here), the show is more politically complicated than ever, and the world-building that accompanies the depiction of various factions, alliances and conflicts is generally admirable".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/the-100-season-3-premiere-review-1201685186 |title=Review: 'The 100' Season 3 |first=Maureen |last=Ryan |website=Variety |date=January 21, 2016 |access-date=June 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531233206/http://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/the-100-season-3-premiere-review-1201685186/ |archive-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref> In a review of the season 3 finale "Perverse Instantiation: Part Two", Mariya Karimjee of [[Vulture.com]] wrote: "Every moment of this finale is pitch-perfect: the choreography of the fight scenes, the plotting and pacing, and the stunning way in which the episode finally reaches it apex. "Perverse Instantiation: Part Two" elevates the season's themes and pulls together its disparate story lines, setting us up nicely for season four".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/05/100-recap-season-3-episode-16.html |title=The 100 Season Finale Recap: The City of Light |website=Vulture |date=May 20, 2016 |access-date=June 2, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523101446/http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/100-recap-season-3-episode-16.html |archive-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref> In another review of the season 3 finale and the season overall, Kyle Fowle of [[The A.V. Club]] wrote: "Before we even get to tonight's action-packed finale of The 100, it needs to be said that this has been a rocky season. The first half of it was defined by shoddy character motivations and oversized villains. The second half of this season has done some work to bring the show back from the brink, focusing on the City of Light and issues of freewill and difficult moral choices, bringing some much needed depth to the third season. That work pays off with "Perverse Instantiation: Part Two," a thrilling, forward-thinking finale that provides some necessary closure to this season". He gave the finale itself an "A-" rating.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fowle |first=Kyle |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-100-closes-out-its-season-in-a-blaze-of-glory-1798187842 |title=The 100 closes out its season in a blaze of glory · |website=The A.V.

The fourth season is generally considered to be an improvement over the third season, receiving a 93% with an average rating of 8.22/10 based on 14 reviews. The critical consensus is, "Season 4 of ''The 100'' rewards longtime viewers with a deeper look at their favorite characters, as well as adding exceptional nuance and depth to their thrilling circumstances".<ref>{{Citation |title=The 100: Season 4 – Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_100/s04 |access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref> The second portion of the fourth season has received better reception than the first portion, with the episodes ''Die All, Die Merrily'' and ''Praimfaya'' often cited as the two best episodes of the season.

The fifth season currently has a 100% with an average of 8.31/10, based on 13 reviews.

Brian Lowry of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said: "Our attraction to Apocalypse TV runs deep, as our culture plays out different futuristic possibilities. That's still no reason to clone material, nor is it a reason to deliver characters who are little more than stereotypes".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matthew |first1=Gilbert |title=Boston globe review |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2014/03/18/the-more-apocalyptic-worry/xkASNaHzN4clNQoOqaqRTI/story.html |website=Boston Globe |access-date=July 9, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151945/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2014/03/18/the-more-apocalyptic-worry/xkASNaHzN4clNQoOqaqRTI/story.html |archive-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Allison Keene of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote a negative review, stating: "The sci-fi drama presents The CW's ultimate vision for humanity: an Earth populated only by attractive teenagers, whose parents are left out in space".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/100-tv-review-688980 |title=The 100: TV Review |work=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321235711/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/100-tv-review-688980 |archive-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref>
Kelly West of ''Cinema Blend'' gave it a more positive review while noting: "CW's Thrilling New Sci-fi Drama Is A Keeper. CW's The 100 seeks to explore that concept and more with a series that's about equal parts young adult drama, sci-fi adventure and thriller. It takes a little while for the series to warm up, but when ''The 100'' begins to hit its stride, a unique and compelling drama begins to emerge".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/100-Review-CW-Thrilling-Sci-fi-Drama-Keeper-62872.html |title=The 100 Review: CW's Thrilling New Sci-fi Drama Is A Keeper |work=Cinema Blend |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322045639/http://www.cinemablend.com/television/100-Review-CW-Thrilling-Sci-fi-Drama-Keeper-62872.html |archive-date=March 22, 2014}}</ref>
[[IGN]]'s editor Eric Goldman also gave the show a more positive review, writing: "Overcoming most of its early growing pains pretty quickly, ''The 100'' was a very strong show by the end of its first season. But Season 2 elevated the series into the upper echelon, as the show become one of the coolest and most daring series on TV these days".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/15/the-100-season-2-review |title=The 100: Season 2 Review |work=IGN |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102455/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/15/the-100-season-2-review |archive-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref> Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' named the show one of the best of 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/top-tv-shows-2015-1201654935/ |title=The Top 20 TV Shows of 2015 |work=Variety |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6dgE95CA3?url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/features/top-tv-shows-2015-1201654935/ |archive-date=December 10, 2015}}</ref>
