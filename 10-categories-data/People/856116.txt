'''Liu Ying''' ({{zh|s=刘英|t=劉英|p=Liú Yīng}}) (died 71) was a son of [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]], and half-brother of [[Emperor Ming of Han]]. After becoming Prince of [[Chu Kingdom (Han dynasty)|Chu]], he was a known supporter of many religions. In particular, his sponsorship of [[Buddhism]] in 65 CE is the first documented case of Buddhist practices in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Life of Laozi| publisher =taoism.org| url =http://www.eng.taoism.org.hk/general-daoism/eminent-philosophers&accomplished-daoists/pg1-4-2.asp| accessdate =2008-04-17| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080131115042/http://www.eng.taoism.org.hk/general-daoism/eminent-philosophers%26accomplished-daoists/pg1-4-2.asp| archivedate =2008-01-31}} See also Zürcher 1972, p. 26.</ref>

Born to the Lady Xu ({{zh|t=許氏}}), a junior consort of Emperor Guangwu, Liu Ying was given the rank of [[duke]] in 39 CE, and [[prince]] (''wáng'') in 41 CE. The next year he received [[Chu (state)|Chu]] as his hereditary fiefdom, with his capital at Pengcheng (modern [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). The young Liu Ying seems to have been close to his half-brother Liu Zhuang, the future Emperor Ming. He is also said to have travelled widely and gained an interest in [[Huang-Lao|Huang-Lao Daoism]] ({{zh|t=黃老}}) and Buddhism ({{zh|t=浮屠}}, literally "[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]"). After Liu Ying became a prince, he actively supported both religions in the hope of finding a drug of [[longevity]] or [[immortality]]. 

Because of these activities, Liu Ying was suspected of treasonous intrigue and the subject of an imperial edict from Emperor Ming. The edict, which survives in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' shows that at the time the Buddha was associated in the opinion of the Chinese imperial court with [[Taoism|Daoism]]. He was treated like a god to whom [[sacrifice]]s and [[fasting]] took place. Buddhism was described as "humane" and generally accepted by the elite. Citing Liu Ying's support of Daoism and Buddhism, [[Henri Maspero]] noted, "It is a very curious fact that, throughout the whole Han dynasty, Taoism and Buddhism were constantly confused and appeared as a single religion."<ref>Henri Maspero, 1981, ''Taoism and Chinese Religion'', tr. by Frank A. Kierman Jr., [[University of Massachusetts Press]], p. 405.</ref>

Five years later, in 70, Liu Ying's activities were again denounced by high officials and he was accused of plotting against the throne, a crime punishable by death. Among his supposed crimes was the most heinous of those in Han law: usurping the prerogatives of the emperor, and great impropriety and immorality in his conduct toward the throne ({{zh|t=大逆不道}}). Nevertheless, Emperor Ming refused to execute Liu Ying, instead demoting him to the rank of a commoner and exiling him to [[Danyang (Chu)|Danyang]] in the lower [[Yangtze]]. Liu Ying committed suicide upon reaching his destination the next year. He was [[burial|buried]] with the honours of a full [[marquess]] ({{zh|t=侯}}).

As part of the purges following Liu Ying's downfall, thousands of his supposed adherents were arrested and implicated each other under [[torture]]. Nevertheless, the Buddhist community at Pengcheng survived. More than a century later, it was still thriving under the patronage of [[Ze Rong]], a native of Danyang. A number of Liu Ying's followers may also have followed him to the lower Yangtze and established Buddhist communities there also.
