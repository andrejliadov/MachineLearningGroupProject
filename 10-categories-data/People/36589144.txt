'''Basilea''' was the first queen of the legendary [[Kingdom of Atlantis]] in  [[ancient Greek]] folk tradition.

Basilea was the eldest and one of the most celebrated daughters of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], who had forty-five children by various wives, including [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Pandora]]. Basilea became known as the “Great Mother” due to the solicitous way in which she cared for her younger brothers.<ref name=Spence>{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Lewis|title=The History of Atlantis|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.}}</ref> After her father’s death, she was elected Queen of [[Atlantis]] by popular vote. She married her brother [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and had two children: [[Selene]] and [[Helios]], the goddess of the moon and god of the sun, respectively. However, her other brothers murdered Hyperion, for fear that he might usurp the throne, and drowned Helios in the River [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanus]] or [[River Po|Po]] in Italy. Out of love for her brother, Selene committed [[suicide]] by jumping from a rooftop. Upon learning of the death of her children, Basilea went mad and “wandered up and down, with hair disheveled and bedizened with ornaments, playing wildly on the timbrel and cymbal.”<ref name=Spence/> When the people of Atlantis tried to restrain her, she disappeared into a terrible lightning storm. In honor of Basilea and her children, divine rites were established.

Basilea is often confused for [[Theia]], the more accepted mother of Selene, Helios, and in addition, Eos, and wife to Hyperion. It is unsure whether or not they are the same figure.

Basilea is also mentioned quite differently in other versions. She is listed as a daughter of [[Coelus]] and [[Terra (mythology)|Terra]],<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=A compendium of heathen mythology|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|author=Gilbert, E.A.|date=1849|url=https://archive.org/details/acompendiumheat00gilbgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/acompendiumheat00gilbgoog/page/n26 14]|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref><ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=10,000 Names for Your Baby|author=Ishizuka, K.|date=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780307756947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcSiNRKiAPEC|page=116|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref> and is implied to be the mother of all gods.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcSiNRKiAPEC&pg=PA116 |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |title=10,000 Names for Your Baby |isbn=9780307756947 |last1=Ishizuka |first1=Kathy |date=2010-11-24 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> It is also implied that she is another version of [[Aphrodite]] ([[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]).<ref name="google3">{{cite book|title=The Gods of Homer and Virgil; Or, Mythology for Children|date=1837|publisher=J.
