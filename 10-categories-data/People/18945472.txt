The '''Empress Crown''' is part of the [[Coronation|coronation regalia]] used by the only [[Shahbanu]] (Empress) of Iran, [[Farah Pahlavi]].  It is part of the [[Iranian Crown Jewels]] and is currently on display at the [[Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Central Bank of Iran]] in [[Tehran]].

==Background==
Following in the footsteps of policies initiated under the [[White Revolution]] that directed the further emancipation of Iranian women, [[Mohammad Reza Shah]] determined to make a symbolic gesture by crowning his [[Queen consort|consort]], Empress Farah, during his own elaborate coronation ceremony in October 1967.  Until that date, the wives of Persian monarchs had never been crowned since the [[Muslim conquest of Iran]], so it was therefore necessary to design a new crown for the occasion. That honor was bestowed upon the French jewelers, [[Van Cleef & Arpels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/museum/royal_jewels/national_iranian_jewels07.php |title=Iran Chamber Society: Iranian National -Royal- Jewels |publisher=Iranchamber.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref> 

In accordance with tradition, the gems used were selected from loose stones already in the Imperial [[treasury]].  Since it was against the law for items from the Imperial Treasury to leave Iran, [[Van Cleef & Arpels]] were obliged to send a team of jewelers to Tehran in order to construct the crown,<ref name="Pahlavi">Pahlavi, Farah. ''An Enduring Love: My Life with the Shah: A Memoir''. 2004</ref> a process which occupied them for six months.

==Composition==
The frame of the crown is made of white gold and is lined with a cap of green velvet.  The crown contains 36 [[emerald]]s, 105 [[pearl]]s, 34 [[ruby|rubies]], two [[spinel]]s, and 1,469 [[diamond]]s.  The largest emerald is located in the center of the sunburst on the front of the crown, and weighs approximately 92 cts. The two largest [[Spinal lock|spinels]] are approximately 83 cts., and the largest pearl is approximately 22&nbsp;mm long. 

In her memoir, [[Farah Pahlavi|the former Empress]] extolls the beauty of the crown but notes that it was also quite heavy, weighing nearly two kilograms.<ref name="Pahlavi"/>
