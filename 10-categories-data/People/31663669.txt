[[File:Martirio de San Andrés, por Juan Correa de Vivar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Crucifixion of Saint Andrew'', by [[Juan Correa de Vivar]] (1540–1545)]]
The name "[[Andrew (name)|Andrew]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: manly, brave, from ἀνδρεία, ''Andreia'', "manhood, valour"), like other Greek names, appears to have been common among the [[Jews]] and other [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] people of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]]. No [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] name is recorded for him.

''The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'', Vol. III]</ref> and likewise a son of John, or Jonah. He was born in the village of [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]]. "The first striking characteristic of Andrew is his name:  it is not Hebrew, as might have been expected, but Greek, indicative of a certain cultural openness in his family that cannot be ignored. We are in Galilee, where the Greek language and culture are quite present."<ref name=Benedict>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2006/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20060614.html Pope Benedict XVI.

Both he and his brother Peter were fishermen by trade, hence the tradition that [[Jesus]] called them to be his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] by saying that he will make them "[[Apostle (Christian)#Their apostolate as "Fishers of Men"|fishers of men]]" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἁλιεῖς ἀνθρώπων}}, ''halieis anthrōpōn'').{{sfn|Metzger|Coogan|1993|p=27}} At the beginning of Jesus' public life, they were said to have occupied the same house at [[Capernaum]].

In the [[Gospel of Matthew]]{{bibleref2c|Matt|4:18–22|NIV}} and in the [[Gospel of Mark]]{{bibleref2c|Mark|1:16–20|NIV}} Simon Peter and Andrew were both called together to become disciples of Jesus and "fishers of men". These narratives record that Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, observed Simon and Andrew fishing, and called them to discipleship.

In the parallel incident in the [[Gospel of Luke]]{{bibleref2c|Luke|5:1–11|NIV}} Andrew is not named, nor is reference made to Simon having a brother. In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (''they signalled to their partners in the other boat …''{{bibleref2c|Luke|5:7|NIV}}) but it is not until the next chapter{{bibleref2c|Luke|6:14|NIV}} that Andrew is named as Simon's brother. However, it is generally understood that Andrew was fishing with Simon on the night in question. [[Matthew Poole]], in his ''Annotations on the Holy Bible'', stressed that 'Luke denies not that Andrew was there'.<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm Matthew Poole's Commentary] on Luke 5, accessed 19 February 2017</ref>

In contrast, the [[Gospel of John]]{{bibleref2c|John|1:35–42|NIV}} states that Andrew was a disciple of [[John the Baptist]], whose testimony first led him, and another unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, to follow Jesus. Andrew at once recognized Jesus as the [[Messiah]], and hastened to introduce him to his brother.<ref name="shrine">{{cite web|url=http://www.stmaryscathedral.co.uk/standrew/|title=National Shrine of St Andrew in Edinburgh Scotland|publisher=Stmaryscathedral.co.uk|access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref>  The Byzantine Church honours him with the name ''Protokletos'', which means "the first called".<ref name=Benedict/> Thenceforth, the two brothers were disciples of Christ. On a subsequent occasion, prior to the final call to the [[Apostolates|apostolate]], they were called to a closer companionship, and then they left all things to follow Jesus.

Subsequently, in the gospels, Andrew is referred to as being present on some important occasions as one of the disciples more closely attached to Jesus.{{efn|{{bibleref2|Mark|13:3}}; {{Bibleref2|John|6:8}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|John|12:22}}; but in [[Acts of the Apostles]] there is only one mention of him.{{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|1:13}} }} Andrew told Jesus about the boy with the loaves and fishes,{{bibleref2c|John|6:8|NIV}} and when [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] wanted to tell Jesus about certain Greeks seeking Him, he told Andrew first.{{bibleref2c|John|12:20–22|NIV}} Andrew was present at the [[Last Supper]].{{sfn|MacRory|1907}} Andrew was one of the four disciples who came to Jesus on the [[Mount of Olives]] to ask about the signs of [[Parousia|Jesus' return]] at the "end of the age".{{bibleref2c|Mark|13:3|NIV}}

[[Eusebius]] in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' 3.1 quoted [[Origen]] as saying that Andrew preached in [[Scythia]]. The [[Primary Chronicle|Chronicle of Nestor]] adds that he preached along the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] river as far as [[Kiev]], and from there he travelled to [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]]. Hence, he became a [[patron saint]] of [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]] and [[Russia]]. According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], Andrew preached in [[Thrace]], and his presence in Byzantium is mentioned in the apocryphal [[Acts of Andrew]]. According to tradition, he founded the [[Episcopal see|See]] of [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]] and [[Istanbul]]) in AD 38, installing [[Stachys the Apostle|Stachys]] as bishop. This diocese would later develop into the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Andrew, along with [[Stachys the Apostle|Saint Stachys]], is recognized as the patron saint of the Patriarchate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patriarchate.org/home|title=Home – The Ecumenical Patriarchate}}</ref> [[Basil of Seleucia]] also knew of Apostle Andrew's missions in Thrace, Scythia and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]].{{sfn|Ferguson|2013|p=51}}


Andrew is said to have been [[Christian martyrs|martyred]] by [[crucifixion]] at the city of [[Patras]] (Patræ) in [[Achaea]], in AD 60.{{sfn|MacRory|1907}} Early texts, such as the [[Acts of Andrew]] known to [[Gregory of Tours]],<ref>In ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' II, cols. 821–847, translated in M.R. James, ''The Apocryphal New Testament'' (Oxford) reprinted 1963:369.</ref> describe Andrew as bound, not nailed, to a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] of the kind on which Jesus is said to have been crucified; yet a tradition developed that Andrew had been crucified on a cross of the form called ''[[Saltire|crux decussata]]'' (X-shaped cross, or "saltire"), now commonly known as a "[[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]]" — supposedly at his own request, as he deemed himself unworthy to be crucified on the same type of cross as Jesus had been.{{efn|The legends surrounding Andrew are discussed in {{harvnb|Dvornik|1958|p=}} }} The [[iconography]] of the martyrdom of Andrew — showing him bound to an X-shaped cross — does not appear to have been standardized until the later [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Calvert|1984|p=545|loc= note 12}}{{efn|According to {{harvnb|Réau|1958|p=79}}, St. Andrew's Cross appeared for the first time in the tenth century, but did not become an iconographic standard before the seventeenth. {{harvnb|Calvert|1984}} was unable to find a sculptural representation of Andrew on the [[saltire]] cross earlier than an [[architectural]] [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] from Quercy, of the early twelfth century.}}

==The Acts of Andrew==
[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_106v_1.png|thumb|Martyrdom of Saint Andrew in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' ]]
{{Main|Acts of Andrew}}
The [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Andrew]], mentioned by [[Eusebius]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] and others, is among a disparate group of Acts of the Apostles that were traditionally attributed to [[Leucius Charinus]]. "These Acts (...) belong to the third century: ''ca.'' A.D. 260," in the opinion of [[M. R. James]], who edited them in 1924. The Acts, as well as a ''Gospel of St Andrew'', appear among rejected books in the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' connected with the name of [[Pope Gelasius I]]. The Acts of Andrew was edited and published by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] in the ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' ([[Leipzig]], 1821), putting it for the first time into the hands of a critical professional readership. Another version of the Andrew legend is found in the ''Passio Andreae'', published by Max Bonnet (''Supplementum II Codicis apocryphi'', [[Paris]], 1895).

==Relics==
[[File:Patras Cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|[[St Andrew's Cathedral, Patras|Saint Andrew of Patras cathedral]], where Saint Andrew's relics are kept]]
[[File:Andreas San Giovanni in Laterano 2006-09-07.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Andrew in the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]] by [[Camillo Rusconi]] (1713–1715)]]
[[Relic]]s of the Apostle Andrew are kept at the [[Saint Andrew of Patras|Basilica of Saint Andrew]] in [[Patras]], [[Greece]]; in [[Amalfi Cathedral]] (the Duomo di Sant'Andrea), [[Amalfi]] and in [[Sarzana Cathedral]]<ref name="cattedraledisarzana.it">http://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s=200&l=</ref> in [[Sarzana]], [[Italy]]; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]];<ref name=shrine/> and the Church of St Andrew and St Albert, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. There are also numerous smaller [[reliquaries]] throughout the world.

Andrew's remains were preserved at Patras. According to one legend, Saint Regulus (Rule), a monk at Patras, was advised in a dream to hide some of the bones. Shortly thereafter, most of the relics were translated from [[Patras]] to [[Constantinople]] by order of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantius II]] around 357 and deposited in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].{{sfn|MacRory|1907}}

Regulus was said to have had a second dream in which an angel advised him to take the hidden relics "to the ends of the earth" for protection. Wherever he was shipwrecked, he was to build a shrine for them. St. Rule set sail, taking with him a kneecap, an upper arm bone, three fingers and a tooth. He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of [[Fife, Scotland]]. However, the relics were probably brought to Britain in 597 as part of the [[Gregorian mission|Augustine Mission]], and then in 732 to Fife, by Bishop [[Acca of Hexham]], a well-known collector of religious relics.<ref name=shrine/>

The skull of Saint Andrew, which had been taken to Constantinople, was returned to Patras by Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled from 867 to 886.<ref name=Christodoulou>[http://pemptousia.com/2013/11/st-andrew-christs-first-called-disciple-30-november/ Christodoulou, Alexandros.

In 1208, following the [[sack of Constantinople]], those relics of Saint Andrew and Saint Peter which remained in the imperial city were taken to [[Amalfi]], [[Italy]],<ref>{{cite web|author=National Archives of Scotland |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/051124.asp |title=St. Andrew in the National Archives of Scotland |publisher=Nas.gov.uk |date=23 November 2011 |access-date=6 September 2013 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916085046/http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/051124.asp |archive-date=16 September 2013 }}</ref> by Cardinal [[Peter of Capua]], a native of Amalfi. A cathedral (''[[Duomo]]''), was built, dedicated to Saint Andrew (as is the town itself), to house a tomb in its crypt where it is maintained that most of the relics of the apostle, including an occipital bone, remain.

[[Thomas Palaeologus]] was the youngest surviving son of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Thomas ruled the province of [[Morea]], the medieval name for the Peloponnese. In 1461, when the Ottomans crossed the Strait of Corinth, Palaeologus fled Patras for exile in Italy, bringing with him what was purported to be the skull of Saint Andrew. He gave the head to [[Pope Pius II]], who had it enshrined in one of the four central piers of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] and then in [[Pienza]],{{sfn|Williams|Maxwell|2018|p=300}} [[Italy]].

In September 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]], as a gesture of goodwill toward the Greek Orthodox Church, ordered that all of the relics of Saint Andrew that were in [[Vatican City]] be sent back to Patras. Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]] along with many other cardinals presented the skull to Bishop Constantine of Patras on 24 September 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.i-m-patron.gr/i-m-patron-old.gr/keimena/epanakomidi/kara.html|title=Η ΤΙΜΙΑ ΚΑΡΑ ΤΟΥ ΑΠΟΣΤΟΛΟΥ ΑΝΔΡΕΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΠΡΩΤΟΚΛΗΤΟΥ}}</ref> The cross of Saint Andrew was taken from Greece during the Crusades by the Duke of Burgundy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vexil.prov.free.fr/emblemes/croix%20st%20andr%E9.html |title=La croix de Saint André |publisher=Vexil.prov.free.fr |access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Denoël|2004|p=}} It was kept in the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|church of St. Victor]] in Marseilles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monumentshistoriques.free.fr/abbayes/victor/crypte.html |title=Abbaye Saint-Victor de Marseille, monuments historiques en France (in French) |publisher=Monumentshistoriques.free.fr |access-date=6 September 2013}}</ref> until it returned to Patras on 19 January 1980. The cross of the apostle was presented to the Bishop of Patras Nicodemus by a Catholic delegation led by Cardinal [[Roger Etchegaray]]. All the relics, which consist of the small finger, the skull (part of the top of the cranium of Saint Andrew), and the cross on which he was [[martyr]]ed, have been kept in the [[Saint Andrew of Patras|Church of St. Andrew]] at Patras in a special shrine and are revered in a special ceremony every 30 November, his [[feast day]].

In 2006, the Catholic Church, again through Cardinal Etchegaray, gave the Greek Orthodox Church another relic of Saint Andrew.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/relic-of-st-andrew-given-to-greek-orthodox-church Relic of St. Andrew Given to Greek Orthodox Church].

==Traditions and legends==
{{more references|date=August 2020}}
=== Georgia ===
[[File:St Andrew fresco (Kintsvisi, Georgia).JPG|thumb|A 13th-century fresco depicting Saint Andrew, from [[Kintsvisi Monastery]], Georgia]]
The [[Georgian Orthodox Church|church tradition of Georgia]] regards Saint Andrew as the first preacher of Christianity in the territory of Georgia and as the founder of the Georgian church. This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that "Andrew preached to the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]], [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]], [[Taurica|Taurians]], and [[Scythians]] and to every region and city, on the [[Black Sea]], both north and south."{{sfn|Peterson|1958|p=20}} The version was adopted by the 10th–11th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the [[Georgian Chronicles]]. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defence argument to [[George the Hagiorite]] against the encroachments from the [[Church of Antioch|Antiochian church]] authorities on [[autocephaly]] of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]], produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by [[Saint Nino]] and explaining the necessity of the "second Christening" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.{{sfn|Rapp|2003|p=433}}{{sfn|Djobadze|1976|pp=82-83}} The Georgian Orthodox Church marks two feast days in honour of Saint Andrew, on 12 May and 13 December. The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a [[public holidays in Georgia (country)|public holiday in Georgia]].

===Cyprus===
Cypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] negotiated his surrender to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.

Other pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.<ref name="whatson-northcyprus.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/dipkarpaz/andreas.htm |title=Apostolos Andreas Monastery, Karpaz, North Cyprus |publisher=Whatson-northcyprus.com |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

'''Apostolos Andreas Monastery''' ({{lang-el|Απόστολος Ανδρέας}}) is a [[monastery]] dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of [[Cape Apostolos Andreas]], which is the north-easternmost point of the island of [[Cyprus]], in [[Rizokarpaso]] in the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. The monastery is an important site to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.

===Malta===
[[File:AndrewFrescoSPOW.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic of St. Andrew|Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at [[St. Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome]]

The first reference regards the small chapel at [[Luqa]] dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing ''Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul'' was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The ''Martyrdom of Saint Andrew'' on the main altar of the church was painted by [[Mattia Preti]] in 1687.

===Romania===
[[File:Peșterile Sf. Apostol Andrei - detalii 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, [[Constanța County]]]]

{{main|Saint Andrew in Romania}}

The official stance of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of [[Dobruja]] ([[Scythia Minor]]) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century.

According to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his ''Commentaries on the Genesis'' (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845–865, and Jacobus de Voragine's ''Golden Legend'' (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to [[Scythia Minor]], whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century.

According to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of [[protochronism]] which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,{{sfn|Stan|Turcescu|2007|p=48}} although this is disputed.

=== East Slavs ===
[[File:Predskazanie Kiev sv Andrey.jpg|thumb|Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev, depicted in the ''[[Radzivill Chronicle]]'']]
Tradition regarding the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Early history|early Christian history of Ukraine]] holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day [[Ukraine]], along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has it that he travelled up the [[Dnieper River]] and reached the future location of [[Kyiv]], where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St Andrew's Church, Kyiv|Saint Andrew's Church of Kyiv]] currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.<ref>Lytvynchuk, Janna. ''St. Andrew's Church'', p. 7, Kyiv: Anateya, 2006, {{ISBN|966-8668-22-7}}</ref> Because of this connection to Kyiv, Saint  Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] nations descended from the [[Kievan Rus]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], the latter country using the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] on its [[Russian Navy Ensign|naval ensign]]. The third East Slavic nation, [[Belarus]], however, reveres [[Euphrosyne of Polotsk]], a local saint, as its patron instead.

===Scotland===
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|The [[Saltire]] (or "Saint Andrew's Cross") is the national [[flag of Scotland]].]]

Several legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from [[Constantinople]] to the place where the modern [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[St Andrews]] stands today ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], ''Cill Rìmhinn''). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and willed to [[Louis XIV of France]], now in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], Paris; the other is the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian Mss]] in the [[British Library]], London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one [[St Regulus|Regulus]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[Óengus I of the Picts|Óengus mac Fergusa]] (729–761). The only historical Regulus ([[Riagail]] or Rule) whose name is preserved in the [[St Andrews Cathedral#St Rule's tower|tower of St Rule]] was an Irish monk expelled from [[Ireland]] with Saint [[Columba]]; his dates, however, are c. 573 – 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in [[Galloway]], but on the site of St Andrews.

According legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, [[Óengus II of the Picts|Óengus II]] in AD 832 led an army of [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] into battle against the [[Angles]], led by [[Æthelstan]], near modern-day [[Athelstaneford]], [[East Lothian]]. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the ''crux decussata'' upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the [[flag of Scotland]] on the basis of this legend.{{sfn|Parker Lawson|1848|p=169}} However, there is evidence that Andrew was venerated in Scotland before this.

[[File:Cottage interior, Ryedale Folk Museum.jpg|thumb|Traditional stone fireplace in northern England. The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left-hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney. In [[Ryedale Folk Museum]], [[Hutton-le-Hole]].]]
Andrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the [[Synod of Whitby]], when the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]] felt that Columba had been "outranked" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher-ranking patron. The 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]] cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, "the first to be an Apostle". Numerous parish churches in the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in [[Rome]], [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] is dedicated to Saint Andrew.

A local [[superstition]] uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a [[hex sign]] on the fireplaces in northern [[England]] and [[Scotland]] to prevent [[witch]]es from flying down the [[chimney]] and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the [[fireplace]] posts or [[lintel]]s, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a [[witch ball]], although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, whereas the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.

===Spain===
A form of St. Andrew's cross called the [[Cross of Burgundy|Cross of Bourgogne]] was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and forms part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco.

In [[Spain]], Saint Andrew is the patron of several locations: [[San Andrés, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andrés]] ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]), [[San Andrés y Sauces]] ([[La Palma]]), [[Navalmoral de la Mata]] ([[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]]), [[Éibar]] ([[Guipúzcoa]]), [[Baeza, Spain|Baeza]] ([[Province of Jaén (Spain)|Jaén]]), [[Pobladura de Pelayo García]] and [[Pobladura de Yuso]] ([[Province of León|León]]), [[Berlangas de Roa]] ([[Burgos]]), [[Ligüerzana]] ([[Palencia]]), [[Castillo de Bayuela]] ([[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]), [[Almoradí]] ([[Alicante]]), [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] ([[Navarra]]), [[San Andrés de Palomar]], ([[Barcelona]]), [[Pujalt]] ([[Catalonia]]), [[Adamuz]] ([[Province of Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]]) and {{Interlanguage link multi|San Andrés (La Rioja)|es|lt=San Andrés}} in [[Cameros]] ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).

==Legacy==
[[File:St Andrew the Apostle - Bulgarian icon.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Andrew the Apostle'' by Yoan from Gabrovo, 19th century]]
Andrew is the [[patron saint]] of several countries and cities including: [[Barbados]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Scotland]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sarzana]],<ref name="cattedraledisarzana.it">http://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s=200&l=</ref> [[Pienza]]{{sfn|Williams|Maxwell|2018|p=300}} and [[Amalfi]] in Italy, [[Esgueira]] in Portugal, [[Luqa]] in Malta, [[Parañaque]] in the Philippines and [[Patras]] in Greece. He was also the patron saint of [[Prussia]] and of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. He is considered the founder and the first bishop of the Church of [[Byzantium]] and is consequently the [[patron saint]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The Apostle Andrew is also the patron of the [[Russian Navy]].

The [[flag of Scotland]] (and consequently the [[Union Flag]] and those of some of the former colonies of the [[British Empire]]) feature Saint Andrew's [[saltire]] cross. The saltire is also the [[flag of Tenerife]], the former [[flag of Galicia]] and the [[Russian Navy Ensign]]. The [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, [[William Porcher Miles]], said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device. The [[flag of Alabama|Alabama]] flag also shows that device.

The [[St Andrew's Day|feast of Andrew]] is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is the [[national day]] of Scotland. In the traditional liturgical books of the Catholic Church, the feast of Saint Andrew is the first feast day in the Proper of Saints.

==In Islam==
The [[Qur’an]]ic account of the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] does not include their names, numbers, or any detailed accounts of their lives. Muslim [[exegesis]], however, more or less agrees with the [[New Testament]] list and says that the disciples included [[Peter in Islam|Peter]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]], [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], Andrew, [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Jude the Apostle|Jude]], [[John the Apostle|John]] and [[Simon the Zealot]].{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2002|p=86|ps=: Muslim exegesis identifies the disciples of Jesus as Peter, Andrew, Matthew, Thomas, Philip, John, James, Bartholomew, and Simon}}
