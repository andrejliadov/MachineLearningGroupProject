In [[classical mythology]], '''Cupid''' (Latin '''Cupīdō''' {{IPA-la|kʊˈpiːdoː|}}, meaning "passionate desire") is the god of desire, [[lust|erotic love]], attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. He is also known in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Amor}}'' ("Love"). His [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Eros]].<ref name="Lar">''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref>
Although Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in [[Classical Greece|Classical]] [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]], during the [[Hellenistic period]], he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the [[bow and arrow]] that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire. In myths, Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion. He is a main character only in the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], when wounded by his own weapons, he experiences the ordeal of love. Although other extended stories are not told about him, his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as "Love conquers all" and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid.
His powers are similar, though not identical, to [[Kamadeva]] the [[Hindu]] god of human love.

In art, Cupid often appears in multiples as the '''Amores''', or ''{{lang|it|amorini}}'' in the later terminology of [[art history]], the equivalent of the Greek [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]. Cupids are a frequent motif of both [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]] and later [[Western art]] of the [[classical tradition]]. In the 15th century, the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the [[putto]].

Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the [[Middle Ages]], when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the [[Renaissance]], a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex [[allegory|allegorical]] meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>This introduction is based on the entry on "Cupid" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 244–246.</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Cupīdō'' ('passionate desire') is a derivative of [[Latin]] ''cupiō'', ''cupiere'' ('to desire'), stemming from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*kupi'', ''*kupei'' ('to desire'), ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*kup(e)i'' ('to tremble, desire').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=155}}

==Origins and birth==
[[File:Duquesnoy Cupid prewar photo.jpg|thumb|''[[Cupid Carving His Bow]]'' (1620s) by [[François Duquesnoy]], [[Bode Museum]], [[Berlin]]]]

The Romans [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art, and medieval and Renaissance mythographers [[conflation|conflate]] the two freely. In the Greek tradition, Eros had a dual, contradictory genealogy. He was among the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial gods]] who came into existence asexually; after his generation, deities were begotten through male-female unions.<ref>Leonard Muellner, ''The Anger of Achilles: ''Mễnis'' in Greek Epic'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 57–58; [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], "One ... Two ... Three: Erōs," in ''Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World'' (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 467.</ref> In [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'', only [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) are older. Before the existence of gender dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained.<ref>Vernant, "One ... Two ... Three: Erōs," p. 465ff.</ref>

At the same time, the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple, the identity of whom varied by source. The influential Renaissance mythographer [[Natale Conti]] began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage: Heaven and Earth,<ref>[[Sappho]], fragment 31.</ref> [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]],<ref>[[Simonides]], fragment 54.</ref> [[Nyx|Night]] and [[Aether (mythology)|Ether]],<ref>[[Acusilaus]], ''[[FGrH]]'' 1A 3 frg. 6C.</ref> or [[Eris (mythology)|Strife]] and [[Zephyros|Zephyr]].<ref>[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], fragment 13. Citations of ancient sources from Conti given by John Mulryan and Steven Brown, ''Natale Conti's ''Mythologiae'' Books I–V'' (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 1, p. 332.</ref> The Greek travel writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], he notes, contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world, and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods.<ref>Natale Conti, ''Mythologiae'' 4.14.</ref>

In [[Latin literature]], Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father. [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that [[Volcanus|Vulcan]], as the husband of Venus, is the father of Cupid.<ref>Seneca, ''Octavia'' 560.</ref> [[Cicero]], however, says that there were three Cupids, as well as three Venuses: the first Cupid was the son of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the second of Mercury and the second Venus, and the third of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the third Venus. This last Cupid was the equivalent of [[Anteros]], "Counter-Love," one of the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]], the gods who embody aspects of love.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]] 3.59–60.</ref> The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires. During the [[English Renaissance]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote of "ten thousand Cupids"; in [[Ben Jonson]]'s wedding [[masque]] ''[[Hymenaei]]'', "a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room".<ref>M.T. Jones-Davies and Ton Hoenselaars, introduction to ''Masque of Cupids'', edited and annotated by John Jowett, in ''Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 1031.</ref>

In the later [[classical tradition]], Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars, whose love affair represented an [[allegory]] of Love and War.<ref name="Cupid-p244">"Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.</ref> The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros accommodated philosophical concepts of Heavenly and Earthly Love even in the Christian era.<ref>Entry on "Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.</ref>

==Attributes and themes==
[[File:Piero della Francesca - Cupid Blindfolded - WGA17587.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A blindfolded, armed Cupid (1452/66) by [[Piero della Francesca]]]]
[[File:Edme Bouchardon, Cupid, 1744, NGA 41708.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edme Bouchardon]], Cupid, 1744, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]

Cupid is winged, allegedly because lovers are flighty and likely to change their minds, and boyish because love is irrational. His symbols are the arrow and torch, "because love wounds and inflames the heart." These attributes and their interpretation were established by late antiquity, as summarized by [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636 AD) in his ''[[Etymologiae]]''.<ref>Isidore, ''Etymologies'' 8.11.80.</ref> Cupid is also sometimes depicted blindfolded and described as blind, not so much in the sense of sightless—since the sight of the beloved can be a spur to love—as blinkered and arbitrary. As described by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1590s):<ref>Geoffrey Miles, ''Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology'' (Routledge, 1999), p. 24.</ref>
[[File:Bertel Thorvaldsen - Cupid.jpg|thumb|upright|Cupid sculpture by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]]]
{{quote|<poem>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is love said to be a child
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<ref>Shakespeare, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' 1.1.234–239.</ref></poem>}}

In [[Botticelli]]'s ''[[Primavera (painting)|Allegory of Spring]]'' (1482), also known by its Italian title ''La Primavera'', Cupid is shown blindfolded while shooting his arrow, positioned above the central figure of Venus.<ref>Jennifer Speake and [[Thomas G. Bergin]], entry on "Cupid," ''Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation'' (Market House Books, rev. ed. 2004), p. 129.</ref>

Particularly in ancient Roman art, cupids may also carry or be surrounded by fruits, animals, or attributes of the [[Horae|Seasons]] or the wine-god [[Dionysus]], symbolizing the earth's generative capacity.<ref>Jean Sorabella, "A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal'' 36 (2001), p. 75.</ref>

Having all these associations, Cupid is considered to share parallels with the Hindu god [[Kamadeva|Kama]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Roshen Dalal]] |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |date=2014|isbn=9788184752779 }} Entry: "Kama"</ref>

===Cupid's arrows===

[[File:Roman de la Rose f. 13r (The god of love shoots an arrow at the lover).jpg|thumb|left|The god of love (Cupid) shoots an arrow at the lover. From a 14th-century text of [[Roman de la Rose]].]]
Cupid carries two kinds of arrows, or darts, one with a sharp golden point, and the other with a blunt tip of lead. A person wounded by the golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee. The use of these arrows is described by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Latin poet]] [[Ovid]] in the first book of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. When [[Apollo]] taunts Cupid as the lesser archer, Cupid shoots him with the golden arrow, but strikes the object of his desire, the nymph [[Daphne (mythology)|Daphne]], with the lead. Trapped by Apollo's unwanted advances, Daphne prays to her father, the river god [[Peneus]], who turns her into a laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo. It is the first of several unsuccessful or tragic love affairs for Apollo.<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1.463–473.</ref>

A variation is found in ''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', a 15th-century poem attributed to [[James I of Scotland]], in which Cupid has three arrows: gold, for a gentle "smiting" that is easily cured; the more compelling silver; and steel, for a love-wound that never heals.<ref>''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', lines 92–99; [[Walter W. Skeat]], ''Chaucerian and Other Pieces'' (Oxford University Press, 1897, 1935), sup. vol., note 1315, p. 551.</ref>

===Cupid and the bees===

[[File:Cranach, Cupid Complaining to Venus.jpg|thumb|upright|''Cupid the Honey Thief'', by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]
In the tale of Cupid the honey thief, the child-god is stung by bees when he steals honey from their hive. He cries and runs to his mother Venus,<ref>Susan Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 118: "When he runs crying to his mother Venus".</ref> complaining that so small a creature shouldn't cause such painful wounds. Venus laughs, and points out the poetic justice: he too is small, and yet delivers the sting of love.

The story was first told about Eros in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] (3rd century BC).<ref>Theocritus, ''Idyll'' 19. It also appears in [[Anacreontea|Anacreontic poetry]].</ref> It was retold numerous times in both art and poetry during the Renaissance. The theme brought the ''[[Amoretti]]'' poetry cycle (1595) of [[Edmund Spenser]] to a conclusion,<ref>Jane Kingsley-Smith, ''Cupid in Early Modern Literature and Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 12.</ref> and furnished subject matter for at least twenty works by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and his workshop.<ref>Charles Sterling ''et al.'', ''Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-Century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 43–44.</ref> The German poet and classicist [[Karl Philipp Conz]] (1762–1827) framed the tale as ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' ("taking pleasure in someone else's pain") in a poem by the same title.<ref>Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', p. 119.</ref> In a version by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], a writer of the [[German Enlightenment]], the incident prompts Cupid to turn himself into a bee:
<blockquote>Through this sting was Amor made wiser.<br>The untiring deceiver<br>concocted another battle-plan:<br>he lurked beneath the carnations and roses<br>and when a maiden came to pick them,<br>he flew out as a bee and stung her.<ref>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, ''Die Biene''; Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', p. 119.</ref></blockquote>

The image of Cupid as a bee is part of a complex tradition of poetic imagery involving the flower of youth, the sting of love as a deflowering, and honey as a secretion of love.<ref>Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His Mörike Songs'', pp. 117–120.</ref>
[[File:Herculaneum - Lyre and Cupids.jpg|thumb|upright|Cupids playing with a [[lyre]], [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] from [[Herculaneum]]]]

===Cupid and dolphins===

In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a [[dolphin]]. On [[ancient Roman sarcophagi]], the image may represent the soul's journey, originally associated with [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian religion]].<ref>Janet Huskinson, ''Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance'' (Oxford University Press, 1996), ''passim''; Joan P. Alcock, "''Pisces in Britannia'': The Eating and Portrayal of Fish in Roman Britain," in ''Fish: Food from the Waters. Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1997'' (Prospect Books, 1998), p. 25.</ref> A mosaic from late [[Roman Britain]] shows a procession emerging from the mouth of the sea god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], first dolphins and then sea birds, ascending to Cupid. One interpretation of this allegory is that Neptune represents the soul's origin in the matter from which life was fashioned, with Cupid triumphing as the soul's desired destiny.<ref>Dominic Perring, "'Gnosticism' in Fourth-Century Britain: The Frampton Mosaics Reconsidered," ''Britannia'' 34 (2003), p. 108.</ref>

In other contexts, Cupid with a dolphin recurs as a playful motif, as in garden statuary at [[Pompeii]] that shows a dolphin rescuing Cupid from an octopus, or Cupid holding a dolphin. The dolphin, often elaborated fantastically, might be constructed as a spout for a fountain.<ref>Anthony King, "Mammals: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Sculpture, Mosaics, Faunal Remains, and Ancient Literary Sources," in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 419–420.</ref> On a modern-era fountain in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence, Italy]], Cupid seems to be strangling a dolphin.<ref>"Archaeological News," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 11.2 (1896), p. 304.</ref>

Dolphins were often portrayed in antiquity as friendly to humans, and the dolphin itself could represent affection. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] records a tale of a dolphin at [[Puteoli]] carrying a boy on its back across a lake to go to school each day; when the boy died, the dolphin grieved itself to death.<ref>Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 9.8.24; Alcock, "''Pisces in Britannia''," p. 25.</ref>

In erotic scenes from mythology, Cupid riding the dolphin may convey how swiftly love moves,<ref>Marietta Cambareri and Peter Fusco, catalogue description for a Venus and Cupid, ''Italian and Spanish Sculpture: Catalogue of the J. Paul Getty Museum Collection'' (Getty Publications, 2002), p. 62.</ref> or the Cupid astride a sea beast may be a reassuring presence for the wild ride of love.<ref>Thomas Puttfarken, ''Titian and Tragic Painting: Aristotle's Poetics And the Rise of the Modern Artist'' (Yale University Press, 2005), p. 174.</ref> A dolphin-riding Cupid may attend scenes depicting the wedding of Neptune and [[Amphitrite]] or the Triumph of Neptune, also known as a marine ''[[thiasos]]''.

===Demon of fornication===
To adapt myths for Christian use, medieval mythographers interpreted them morally. In this view, Cupid might be seen as a "demon of [[fornication]]".<ref>''Daemon fornicationis'' in Isidore of Seville, ''moechiae daemon'' in Theodulf of Orleans; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433–1177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 129ff., especially p. 138.</ref> The innovative [[Theodulf of Orleans]], who wrote during the reign of [[Charlemagne]], reinterpreted Cupid as a seductive but malicious figure who exploits desire to draw people into an allegorical underworld of vice.<ref>[[Theodulf of Orleans]], ''De libris'', ''carmen'' 45; Chance, ''Medieval Mythography,'' p. 133.</ref> To Theodulf, Cupid's quiver symbolized his depraved mind, his bow trickery, his arrows poison, and his torch burning passion. It was appropriate to portray him naked, so as not to conceal his deception and evil.<ref>Theodulf, ''De libris'' 37–38; Chance, ''Medieval Mythography,'' pp. 137, 156, 585. Similar views are expressed by the [[Second Vatican Mythographer]] (II 46/35) and [[Remigius of Auxerre]], ''Commentary on [[Martianus Capella]]'' 8.22.</ref>

===Sleeping Cupid===
[[File:WLA vanda Sleeping Cupid.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Bronze ''Cupid Sleeping'' on a lion skin (1635–40), signed ''F,'' based on the marble attributed to [[Praxiteles]]]]
Cupid sleeping became a symbol of absent or languishing love in Renaissance poetry and art, including a ''[[Cupid (Michelangelo)|Sleeping Cupid]]'' (1496) by [[Michelangelo]] that is now lost.<ref>"Cupid," ''The Classical Tradition,'' p. 245; Stefania Macioe, "Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models," in ''The Rediscovery of Antiquity: The Role of the Artist'' (Collegium Hyperboreum, 2003), pp. 437–438.</ref> The ancient type was known at the time through descriptions in classical literature, and at least one extant example had been displayed in the sculpture garden of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] since 1488.<ref>Rona Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian'' (Yale University Press, 2002, 2004), p. 95.</ref> In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] had described two marble versions of a ''Cupid'' (Eros), one at [[Thespiae]] and a nude at [[Parium]], where it was the stained object of erotic fascination.<ref>Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.22, describes it as on a par with the [[Aphrodite of Cnidus|Cnidian Venus]] both in its nobility and in the wrong it had endured, as a certain main from [[Rhodes]] had fallen in love with it and left a visible trace of his love ''(vestigium amoris)''; Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals,'' p. 96.</ref>

Michelangelo's work was important in establishing the reputation of the young artist, who was only twenty at the time. At the request of [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici|his patron]], he increased its value by deliberately making it look "antique",<ref>Deborah Parker, ''Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 11.</ref> thus creating "his most notorious fake".<ref>Goffen, ''Renaissance Rivals'', p. 95.</ref> After the deception was acknowledged, the ''Cupid Sleeping'' was displayed as evidence of his virtuosity alongside an ancient marble, attributed to [[Praxiteles]], of Cupid asleep on a lion skin.<ref>Estelle Lingo, ''François Duquesnoy and the Greek Ideal'' (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 61.</ref>

In the poetry of [[Giambattista Marino]] (d. 1625), the image of Cupid or ''Amore'' sleeping represents the indolence of Love in the lap of Idleness. A [[madrigal]] by his literary rival [[Gaspare Murtola]] exhorted artists to paint the theme. A catalogue of works from antiquity collected by the [[House of Mattei|Mattei family]], patrons of [[Caravaggio]], included sketches of sleeping cupids based on sculpture from the [[Temple of Venus Erycina]] in Rome. Caravaggio, whose works Murtola is known for describing, took up the challenge with his 1608 ''[[Sleeping Cupid (Caravaggio)|Sleeping Cupid]]'', a disturbing depiction of an unhealthy, immobilized child with "jaundiced skin, flushed cheeks, bluish lips and ears, the emaciated chest and swollen belly, the wasted muscles and inflamed joints." The model is thought to have suffered from [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>John L. Varriano, ''Caravaggio'' (Penn State Press, 2006), pp. 57, 130.</ref> Caravaggio's sleeping Cupid was reconceived in [[fresco]] by [[Giovanni da San Giovanni]], and the subject recurred throughout Roman and Italian work of the period.<ref>Macioe, "Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models," p. 436–438.</ref>
[[File:Amor Vincet Omnia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Caravaggio's ''Amor Vincit Omnia'']]]]

===''Love Conquers All''===
Earlier in his career, Caravaggio had challenged contemporary sensibilities with his "sexually provocative and anti-intellectual" ''Victorious Love'', also known as ''[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Love Conquers All]]'' ''(Amor Vincit Omnia)'', in which a brazenly naked Cupid tramples on emblems of culture and erudition representing music, architecture, warfare, and scholarship.<ref>Varriano, ''Caravaggio'', pp. 22, 123.</ref>
The motto comes from the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan]] poet [[Vergil]], writing in the late 1st century BC. His collection of ''[[Eclogues]]'' concludes with what might be his most famous line:<ref>David R. Slavitt, ''Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1990), p. xvii.</ref><blockquote>''Omnia vincit Amor: et nos cedamus Amori.''<br>Love conquers all, and so let us surrender ourselves to Love.<ref>[[Vergil]], ''Eclogues'' 10.69.</ref></blockquote>

The theme was also expressed as the [[Roman triumph|triumph]] of Cupid, as in the ''[[Triumphs]]'' of [[Petrarch]].<ref>Aldo S. Bernardo, ''Petrarch, Laura, and the Triumphs'' (State University of New York, 1974), p. 102ff.; Varriano, ''Caravaggio'', p. 123.</ref>

==Roman ''Cupid''==
[[File:Altar Mars Venus Massimo n4.jpg|thumb|left|Fragmentary base for an altar of Venus and Mars, showing cupids handling the weapons and [[biga (chariot)|chariot]] of the war god, from the reign of [[Trajan]] (98–117 AD)]]
The ancient Roman ''Cupid'' was a god who embodied desire, but he had no [[Roman temple|temples]] or religious practices independent of other [[list of Roman deities|Roman deities]] such as Venus, whom he often accompanies as a side figure in cult statues.<ref name="Cupid-p244" /> A Cupid might appear among the several statuettes for private devotion in a [[lararium|household shrine]],<ref>Annemarie Kaufmann-Heinimann, "Religion in the House," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 199.</ref> but there is no clear distinction between figures for veneration and those displayed as art or decoration.<ref>John R. Clarke, ''Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy, 100 B.C.-A.D. 315'' (University of California Press, 2003), p. 89.</ref> Roman temples often served a secondary purpose as art museums, and [[Cicero]] mentions a statue of "Cupid" (Eros) by [[Praxiteles]] that was consecrated at a ''[[sacellum|sacrarium]]'' and received religious veneration jointly with [[Hercules]].<ref>[[Cicero]], ''Against Verres'' 4.2–4; David L. Balch, "From Endymion in Roman ''Domus'' to Jonah in Christian Catacombs: From Houses of the Living to Houses for the Dead.

Curchin, "Personal Wealth in Roman Spain," ''Historia'' 32.2 (1983), p. 230.</ref>

Cupid became more common in [[Roman art]] from the time of [[Augustus]], the first [[Roman emperor]]. After the [[Battle of Actium]], when [[Mark Antony|Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] were defeated, Cupid transferring the weapons of Mars to his mother Venus became a motif of Augustan imagery.<ref>Charles Brian Rose, "The Parthians in Augustan Rome," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 109.1 (2005), pp. 27–28</ref> In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', the national epic of Rome by the poet [[Vergil]], Cupid disguises himself as [[Ascanius|Iulus]], the son of [[Aeneas]] who was in turn the son of Venus herself, and in this form he beguiles [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido of Carthage]] to fall in love with the hero. She gives safe harbor to Aeneas and his band of refugees from [[Trojan War|Troy]], only to be abandoned by him as he fulfills his destiny to [[Founding of Rome|found Rome]]. Iulus (also known as [[Ascanius]]) becomes the mythical founder of the [[Julia (gens)|Julian family]] from which [[Julius Caesar]] came. Augustus, Caesar's heir, commemorated a beloved great-grandson who died as a child by having him portrayed as Cupid, dedicating one such statue at the Temple of Venus on the [[Capitoline Hill]], and keeping one in his bedroom where he kissed it at night.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 7; Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 18.</ref> A brother of this child became the emperor [[Claudius]], whose mother [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] appears in a surviving portrait-sculpture as Venus, with Cupid on her shoulder.<ref>Susann S.

Cupid was the enemy of [[chastity]], and the poet [[Ovid]] opposes him to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the virgin goddess of the hunt who likewise carries a bow but who hates Cupid's passion-provoking arrows.<ref>''Tela Cupidinis odit'': Ovid, ''Ars Amatoria'' 1.261; C.M.C.

==Cupid and Psyche==
{{Main article|Cupid and Psyche}}
[[File:Vouet-Psyché-Lyon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|''Psyché et l'amour'' (1626–29) by [[Simon Vouet]]: Psyche lifts a lamp to view the sleeping Cupid.]]

The story of Cupid and Psyche appears in [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] as early as the 4th century BC, but the most extended literary source of the tale is the Latin novel ''Metamorphoses'', also known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', by [[Apuleius]] (2nd century AD). It concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche ("Soul" or "Breath of Life") and Cupid, and their ultimate union in marriage.

The fame of Psyche's beauty threatens to eclipse that of Venus herself, and the love goddess sends Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid, however, becomes enamored of Psyche, and arranges for her to be taken to his palace. He visits her by night, warning her not to try to look upon him. Psyche's envious sisters convince her that her lover must be a hideous monster, and she finally introduces a lamp into their chamber to see him. Startled by his beauty, she drips hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He abandons her. She wanders the earth looking for him, and finally submits to the service of Venus, who tortures her. The goddess then sends Psyche on a series of quests. Each time she despairs, and each time she is given divine aid. On her final task, she is to retrieve a dose of [[Proserpina]]'s beauty from the underworld. She succeeds, but on the way back can't resist opening the box in the hope of benefitting from it herself, whereupon she falls into a torpid sleep. Cupid finds her in this state, and revives her by returning the sleep to the box. Cupid grants her immortality so the couple can be wed as equals.

The story's [[Neoplatonic]] elements and allusions to [[mystery religions]] accommodate multiple interpretations,<ref>Stephen Harrison, entry on "Cupid," ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 338.</ref> and it has been analyzed as an [[allegory]] and in light of [[folklore|folktale]], [[Fairy tale#Terminology|Märchen]] or [[fairy tale]], and [[myth]].<ref>[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Cupid and Psyche," reprinted in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), pp. 84–92.</ref> Often presented as an allegory of love overcoming death, the story was a frequent source of imagery for [[Roman sarcophagi]] and other extant art of antiquity. Since the rediscovery of Apuleius's novel in the [[Renaissance]], the [[reception theory|reception]] of ''Cupid and Psyche'' in the [[classical tradition]] has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and various media.<ref>Harrison, "Cupid and Psyche," in ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', p. 339.</ref>

Better known as "The Beauty and the Beast", it was originally written by [[Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve|Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve]] and abridged and later published by French author [[Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont|Jeanne Marie Leprince de Beaumont]] in 1740.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://humanitiesresource.com/ancient/articles/Beauty_and_Beast-Final.pdf|title=Beauty and the Beast|date=2011|website=humanitiesresource.com}}</ref> The story over the years has gained international acclaim and in 1991 inspired the Disney movie ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.

She eventually falls in love with him despite his appearance and breaks the curse placed on him to reveal a handsome prince.

==Depictions==

On gems and other surviving pieces, Cupid is usually shown amusing himself with adult play, sometimes driving a hoop, throwing darts, catching a butterfly, or flirting with a [[nymph]]. He is often depicted with his mother (in graphic arts, this is nearly always Venus), playing a horn. In other images, his mother is depicted scolding or even spanking him due to his mischievous nature. He is also shown wearing a helmet and carrying a buckler, perhaps in reference to [[Virgil]]'s ''Omnia vincit amor'' or as [[political satire]] on wars for love, or love as war.
