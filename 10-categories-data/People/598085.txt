A '''trans man''' is a [[man]] who was [[assigned female at birth]]. The label of transgender man is not always interchangeable with that of [[transsexual]] man, although the two labels are often used in this way. ''Transgender'' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes different types of gender variant people (including transsexual people). Many trans men choose to undergo surgical or hormonal transition, or both (see [[sex reassignment therapy]]), to alter their appearance in a way that aligns with their gender identity or alleviates [[gender dysphoria]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bariola |first1=Emily |last2=Lyons |first2=Anthony |last3=Leonard |first3=William |last4=Pitts |first4=Marian |last5=Badcock |first5=Paul |last6=Couch |first6=Murray |title=Demographic and Psychosocial Factors Associated With Psychological Distress and Resilience Among Transgender Individuals |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=October 2015 |volume=105 |issue=10 |pages=2108–2116 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302763 |pmid=26270284 |pmc=4566567 }}</ref>

== Transitioning ==

Originally, the term ''trans men'' referred specifically to female-to-male [[transsexual|transsexual people]] who underwent [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) or [[sex reassignment surgery female-to-male|sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS), or both. The definition of ''transition'' has broadened to include theories of psychological development or complementary methods of self-acceptance.<ref name="Hudson" /><ref name="IJSO">{{cite web |url=http://www.huc.edu/ijso/glossary/ |title=Glossary |publisher=Huc.edu |access-date=2015-02-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519234810/http://www.huc.edu/ijso/glossary/ |archive-date=2014-05-19 }}</ref> Many of those who identify as transgender may face [[gender dysphoria]].

[[Transsexual]] and transgender men may seek medical interventions such as hormones and surgery to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their gender presentation. However, many transgender and transsexual men cannot afford or choose not to undergo surgery or hormone replacement therapy.

Many who have not undergone [[mastectomy|top surgery]] choose to [[Breast binding|bind]] their breasts. There are a few different methods of binding, including using sports bras and specially made binders (which can be vest-type, or wrap-around style). Tape or bandages, although often depicted in popular culture, should never be used for binding as they tighten with wear and compress the ribcage, and could result in injury.<ref name=pmid25692791>{{cite journal |last1=Meriggiola |first1=Maria Cristina |last2=Gava |first2=Giulia |title=Endocrine care of transpeople part I.

Some trans men might also decide to [[packing (phallus)|pack]], to create a phallic bulge in the crotch of clothing. However, this is not universal. Trans men who decide to pack may use anything from rolled up socks to specially made packers, which resemble a penis. Some packers are also created for trans men to be able to urinate through them ([[female urination device|stand-to-pee]], or STP, devices), or for [[sexual penetration]] or other [[sexual activity]] (known as "pack-and-play").

Transitioning might involve some or all of the following steps:<ref>[http://www.ftmaustralia.org/treatment/whatis.html Ftmaustralia.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725044946/http://www.ftmaustralia.org/treatment/whatis.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}</ref>
* Social transition: using a preferred name and pronouns, wearing clothing seen as gender appropriate, disclosure to family, friends and usually at the workplace/school.

In a study by Kara Devaney, entitled ''Transgender Research Literature Review'', it is addressed that the term ''transgender'' encompasses a myriad of different and unique identities that do not follow the "normal" rules of gender.  Miriam J. Abelson writes, "There is no question that trans men's experiences are men's
experiences and give insight about men, masculinity, and gender inequality."<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Abelson |first1=Miriam |title=Men in Context: Transmasculinities and Transgender Experiences in Three US Regions |date=17 October 2014 |hdl=1794/18512 }}</ref>

A trans man may be [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[pansexual]], [[polysexual]], [[Asexuality|asexual]], [[Demisexuality|demisexual]], etc., and some trans men consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them.<ref name="Hrc.org">{{cite web |title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Definitions |url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions |website=Human Rights Campaign }}</ref> The literature commonly indicates that sexual attraction to those of their same gender (e.g., trans men liking men and trans women liking women) is considerably less common among trans men than among trans women; the vast majority of trans men are reported as heterosexual.<ref name="Shankle" /><ref name="Yitzchak" /> Surveys from the [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] show more variation in sexual orientation or sexual identity among trans men. In NCTE's 2015 Transgender Survey of respondents who identified as trans men, 23% identified as heterosexual or straight. The vast majority (65%) identified their sexual orientation or sexual identity as [[queer]] (24%), pansexual (17%), bisexual (12%), or gay/[[same-gender loving]] (12%).<ref name="NCTE USTS">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=S.E. |last2=Herman |first2=J.L. |last3=Rankin |first3=S. |last4=Keisling |first4=M. |last5=Mottet |first5=L. |last6=Anafi |first6=M. |title=The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey |url=https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf |website=2015 US Transgender Survey |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=1 June 2018 |ref=NCTE USTS}}</ref>

Some trans men date heterosexual women, while other trans men date queer-identified women; the latter might be because queer-identified women are less invested in the gender and sexual anatomy of a person when it comes to selecting an intimate partner.<ref name="Yitzchak" />  It is also common for trans men to have histories with the [[lesbian]] community or to feel that they identify better with that community because of its wide acceptance of [[gender variance]], with a number of trans men having identified as lesbian (often as a "[[Butch and femme|butch]] lesbian") before realizing that they are instead transgender.<ref name="Shankle" /><ref name="Yitzchak" /><ref name="Haggerty">{{cite book|authors=George Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=978-1-135-57870-1|year=2003|page=776|access-date=January 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAZ5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA776}}</ref>

Trans men have less success integrating socially within [[cisgender]] gay men's communities, which tend to be more body-focused, especially in terms of being [[phallocentric]].<ref name="Yitzchak" /><ref name="Schilt">{{cite book|author=Kristen Schilt|title=Just One of the Guys?: Transgender Men and the Persistence of Gender Inequality|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-73807-9|year=2010|page=153|access-date=January 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b534IfCEi_UC&pg=PA153}}</ref><ref name="Sumerau">{{cite book|vauthors=Sumerau JE, Mathers L|title=America through Transgender Eyes|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1538122082|year=2019|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK6LDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA60}}</ref> Yitzchak et al. state that, as a result, they more commonly see gay trans men partnering with each other than with cisgender gay men.<ref name="Yitzchak" /> There are, however, cases of women being likelier than men to thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies.<ref name="Schilt" />

Some scholars<!--NOTE: The text is worded this way because, based on the chapter title, it's probably not Ian Irving and Rupert Raj arguing these matters. -->  argue against assumptions that trans men are predominantly heterosexual and usually have lesbian histories. In scholars Ian Irving and Rupert Raj's book ''Trans Activism in Canada'', researchers state, "There is still a common misperception that trans men are largely heterosexual amongst those who conflate gender identity and sexual orientation. It is frequently assumed that trans men are exclusively attracted to women and have lesbian histories prior to transition." They add, "Recent data from the Trans PULSE project (Bauer, Redman, Bradley, & Scheim, 2013) challenge this assumption, with 63 percent of female-to-male spectrum trans people in Ontario reporting [[non-heterosexual]] identities and/or past-year sex with trans or non-trans men." They also argue that, based on some research, "many non-trans gay men have welcomed trans men into gay communities and have increasingly recognized trans men as potential sexual and romantic partners."<ref name="Irving">{{cite book|authors=Ian Irving, Rupert Raj|title=Trans Activism in Canada: A Reader|publisher=Canadian Scholars' Press|isbn=978-1-55130-537-0|year=2014|page=248|access-date=January 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpKDAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248}}</ref>

== Sexual violence ==
Trans men can be victims of [[sex crime]]s, and there are cases where rape has occurred, including with the intention of changing the sexual expressions and/or the sexuality of trans men; this is known as [[corrective rape]]. In a 2016 ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' article, a researcher stated, "Unlike in South Africa, where homophobic rape is rampant, with increasing trends as a large number of men still want to use violence to force trans people to abandon their sexual identity, there are no official surveys or studies about this problem in Thailand. [...] Recently some video clips emerged showing the rape of trans people." Furthermore, the article told about two cases of rape of trans men in Thailand, and a claim that "it seems that quite a few people [in Thailand] would say they have heard of, or known about, such cases in their communities".<ref>{{cite web|title=Trans community still faces violence|date=17 May 2016|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/976353/trans-community-still-faces-violence|author = Sulaiporn Chonwilai}}</ref>
