{{short description|Popular culture-depictions of librarians}}
'''Librarians in popular culture''' can be found across many different mediums, including film, television, music and literature. Their portrayal is varied and can represent or subvert various [[Stereotype|stereotypes]]. 

==Films==
[[File:Tracy_Hepburn_Desk_Set.jpg|thumb| Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in a publicity shot for ''Desk Set''.]]According to Ann Seidl, director of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''The Hollywood Librarian'', librarians in film are often portrayed as meek, timid, and unassertive in nature.<ref name="Kniffel">{{cite journal

By the 1950s, movies had established the stereotype of librarians as "[[Spinster|spinsters]]" and "eggheads".<ref name="Peresie">{{cite journal|last=Peresie|first=Michelle|author2=Linda B.

They are usually young and may be attractive, but dress drably and are sexually repressed.  The "fate-worse-than-death view of librarians" is particularly evident in movies such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[The Music Man]]''.<ref name="Walker"/><ref name="Gachman" /><ref name="gca">{{cite web |last1=Gooding-Call |first1=Anna |title= The History and Debunking of Librarian Stereotypes |url=https://bookriot.com/librarian-stereotypes/ |magazine=Book Riot |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923022544/https://bookriot.com/librarian-stereotypes/ |archive-date=September 23, 2020 |date=January 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), Mary Hatch Bailey (played by [[Donna Reed]]), is depicted as an "[[Spinster|old maid]]."<ref name="Walker" /> It is also evident in films like ''[[Foul Play (1978 film)|Foul Play]]'' which features a shy [[San Francisco]] librarian fall in love with a "goofy cop."<ref name="Gachman" /> In contrasts, male movie librarians – mild, intelligent, and timid – have fewer and less important roles.<ref name="Walker">{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Stephen|last2=Lawson|first2=V.

Another stereotype mentioned is the staggeringly rude and unhelpful librarian (John Rothman) in ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), who barks at Sophie Zawistowski (Meryl Streep) "Do you want me to draw you a map?!" More recently and continuing the stereotype of unpleasant librarians, in the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] film ''[[Monsters University]]'' (2013), Alison Nastasi of Flavorwire says the university librarian "isn’t fond of noise and doesn’t think twice about tossing rowdy students out the window into a pond below".<ref name="Nastasi">{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/424214/our-favorite-pop-culture-librarians/|title=Our Favorite Pop Culture Librarians|last=Nastasi|first=Alison|date=2013-11-09|newspaper=Flavorwire|access-date=2016-11-01|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322004557/https://www.flavorwire.com/424214/our-favorite-pop-culture-librarians|archive-date=March 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name="gca" /> Another example of this librarian depicted in ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name="Gachman" />

These negative portrayals are in contrast with such more well-rounded characters, such as librarian Bunny Watson (played by [[Katharine Hepburn]]) who teaches Richard Sumner (played by [[Spencer Tracy]]) a few things about modern research methods in the movie ''[[Desk Set]]'' (1957)<ref name="Nastasi" /> and the no-nonsense "Marian the Librarian" ([[Shirley Jones]]) in the movie ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]''.<ref name="oneal">{{cite web |last1=O'Neal |first1=Jeff |title=16 Great Library Scenes in Film |url=https://bookriot.com/great-library-scenes-in-film/ |magazine=Book Riot |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923022054/https://bookriot.com/great-library-scenes-in-film/ |archive-date=September 23, 2020 |date=January 23, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="gca" /> Mary (played by [[Parker Posey]]) as the ultimate ''[[Party Girl (1995 film)|Party Girl]]'' (1995) who discovers, "I want to be a librarian!" in a notable exception to the prim librarian stereotype.<ref name="Peresie" /><ref name="Gachman">{{cite web |last1=Gachman |first1=Dina |title=13 Of The Best Library Scenes In Movies |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/109055-13-of-the-best-library-scenes-in-movies |magazine=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200922200415/http://www.bustle.com/articles/109055-13-of-the-best-library-scenes-in-movies |archive-date=September 22, 2020 |date=September 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Librarians in film are usually ordinary people caught up in circumstances, rather than being heroes; likewise they are rarely villainous although they may have flaws, such as racism in ''[[Goodbye, Columbus]]''.<ref name="Walker" /> ''[[The Public (film)|The Public]]'', a 2018 movie by [[Emilio Estevez]] depicts a librarian, Stuart Goodson, who is comfortable with the [[Homelessness|homeless]] people who use his [[public library]] every day.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/the-public-review.html|title='The Public' Review: Emilio Estevez Takes Us to the Library for a Civics Lesson|last=Kenigsberg|first=Ben|date=2019-04-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511155550/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/the-public-review.html|archive-date=May 11, 2019}}</ref> Goodson becomes involved in a fight over doing the right thing: in this case finding shelter for the homeless on a bitterly cold night.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/emilio-estevezs-new-movie-has-a-good-message-if-you-dont-choke-on-it/2019/04/02/05dabb48-4f69-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html|title=Review {{!}} Emilio Estevez's new movie has a good message, if you don't choke on it|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=2019-04-03|work=Washington Post|access-date=2019-11-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200919041251/https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/emilio-estevezs-new-movie-has-a-good-message-if-you-dont-choke-on-it/2019/04/02/05dabb48-4f69-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html|archive-date=September 19, 2020}}</ref> Goodson, as the film reveals, has overcome his own personal demons in order to achieve a career as a librarian.<ref name=":0" /> Alicia Hull (played by [[Bette Davis]]), is a small town librarian, who befriends young Freddie Slater (Kevin Coughlin) but is herself ostracized for refusing to remove a book on [[Communism]] from the public library during the height of the Red Scare in ''[[Storm Center]]'' (1956). This movie was inspired by the real-life dismissal of [[Ruth W.

The comedy film [[Tomcats (2001 film)|''Tomcats'']] (2001) features [[Heather Stephens]] as Jill, a seemingly shy, repressed librarian who leads a double life as a lifestyle  (nonoccupational)  [[dominatrix]]. In ''[[Only Two Can Play]]'' (1962), [[Peter Sellers]] portrays a poorly paid and professionally frustrated [[Wales|Welsh]] librarian and occasional drama critic, whose affections fluctuate between glamorous Liz and his long-suffering wife Jean.<ref name="Nastasi" /> In the comedic ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], the character [[Conan the Librarian]] makes an brief appearance.<ref name="Nastasi" /><ref>Ruth Kneale, ''You Don't Look Like a Librarian: Shattering Stereotypes and Creating Positive New Images in the Internet Age'', Information Today: 2009, p 77</ref> This character has exaggerated muscles, speaks in Austrian-accented English patterned after Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of Conan, chastises a library patron for not knowing the Dewey Decimal System, and slices a patron in two for returning a book overdue.

Librarians can serve a function in [[fantasy]] films. In 1994's live-action animated film ''[[The Pagemaster]]'', frightened and pessimistic Richard Tyler ([[Macaulay Culkin]]) meets an eccentric librarian, Mr. Dewey ([[Christopher Lloyd]]), who encourages Richard to get a [[library card]] and starting off an adventure. By the end of the film, Mr. Dewey is hinted at being the titular Pagemaster and none of the adventure in the film was a dream. Mr. Dewey introduced Richard to the adventures possible in libraries and books as he "knows just how magical of a place a library can be."<ref name="Trombetta">{{cite web |last1=Trombetta |first1=Sadie |title=11 Of The Coolest Librarians From Pop Culture |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/65173-11-of-the-coolest-librarians-from-pop-culture-because-not-every-librarian-is-like-the-one |magazine=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225154513/https://www.bustle.com/articles/65173-11-of-the-coolest-librarians-from-pop-culture-because-not-every-librarian-is-like-the-one |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |date=March 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, a librarian appears in the beginning of the 1984 Hollywood box office hit, ''[[Ghostbusters]]''<ref name="Wood" /><ref name="oneal" /> and the "bitter old librarian" in ''[[Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade]]'' who thinks all the banging in the librarian is coming from his stamp, but it is actually coming from Indiana Jones "trying to break the floor apart.<ref name="Gachman" /><ref name="oneal" /> Similarly, in the 1983 film, ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' there is a librarian in a small town who is the only person other than the protagonists who wants to face "the mysterious leader of an evil carnival" and [[Hogwarts staff#The staff and their positions|Madam Irma Pince]] in the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter film series]]'' who heads the library at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is fiercely protective of the books.<ref name="oneal" /> Additionally, [[Henry DeTamble]] plays a reference librarian in ''[[The Time Traveler's Wife (film)|The Time Traveler's Wife]]'', who is thrust to the future or past but without his control.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Irani |first1=Rashid |title=Review: The Time Traveler’s Wife |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/movie-reviews/review-the-time-traveler-s-wife/story-uAUnAeG2CEkCc81QoqWkaO.html |magazine=[[Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923023814/https://www.hindustantimes.com/regional-movies/cu-soon-movie-review-fahadh-faasil-s-experimental-thriller-is-taut-genre-breaking/story-s1BghdojatiQIFuCcGIKGO.html |archive-date=September 23, 2020 |date=November 7, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Finally, the main character of ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999) is librarian named Evelyn Carnahan ([[Rachel Weisz]]), who is clumsy and later moves away from her profession in the sequels.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Morgan |first1=Alissa |title=How Evelyn Carnahan’s (Rachel Weisz) Role in ‘The Mummy’ (1999) and ‘The Mummy Returns’ (2001) Affirmed my Love of Storytelling |url=https://flipscreened.com/2019/01/18/how-evelyn-carnahans-rachel-weisz-role-in-the-mummy-1999-and-the-mummy-returns-2001-affirmed-my-love-of-storytelling/ |magazine=Flip Screened |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421053508/https://flipscreened.com/2019/01/18/how-evelyn-carnahans-rachel-weisz-role-in-the-mummy-1999-and-the-mummy-returns-2001-affirmed-my-love-of-storytelling/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |date=January 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> A memorable quote from her, upon introduction to the other main character shows a more positive depiction of librarians:

<blockquote>'''Evelyn''': "Look, I... I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure-seeker, or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell, but I am proud of what I am."

'''Rick:''' "And what is that?"

'''Evelyn:''' "I... am a librarian."</blockquote>

From 2004-2008, the [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]] fantasy-adventure television film franchise, [[The Librarian (franchise)|''The Librarian'']], aired on TNT. The three films focus on a librarian (portrayed by [[Noah Wyle]]) who protects secret artifacts in the Metropolitan Public Library in New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/04/10/tnt-greenlights-the-librarians-franchise-as-a-series-with-rebecca-romijn|title=TNT greenlights 'The Librarians' franchise as a series|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=2016-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803163946/http://ew.com/article/2014/04/10/tnt-greenlights-the-librarians-franchise-as-a-series-with-rebecca-romijn/|archive-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>

==Literature==

Children's literature offers a generally positive portrayal of librarians as knowledgeable, helpful, amazing and friendly, becoming more positive over the course of the 20th century.  Adult literature, however, portrays the profession more negatively.  Between these, portrayals of librarians in young adult fiction are neutral to negative.  Here librarians are predominantly female, middle-aged, usually unattractive in some way, and mostly unmarried.  Personality is mixed between positive traits such as intelligence, likeability, and kind-heartedness; and negative traits such as strictness, timidity, excess fastidiousness, and eccentricity.  While some provide assistance to the main characters, several are the villains of the story.  Duties generally include reference, but may only show clerical tasks; however the amount of technology used by librarian characters has increased over time.<ref name="Peresie"/> Ashanti White, author of the 2012 book, ''Not Your Ordinary Librarian: Debunking the Popular Perceptions of Librarians'', wrote that the shushing buttoned-down, older librarian was the most common depiction of librarians, in fiction, followed by the sexy librarian, stereotype.<ref name=NotYourOrdinaryLibrarian>{{cite news | url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=-P1DAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=%22Sexy+Librarian%22 | title       = Not Your Ordinary Librarian: Debunking the Popular Perceptions of Librarians | author      = Ashanti White | publisher   = [[Elsevier]] | year        = 2012 | pages        = 7–8, 26, 89, 104–105, 141–152, 177 | isbn        = 9781780632964 | accessdate  = 2017-11-19 | quote       = Although the spinster image of librarians persisted, the sexy librarian emerged as a formidable rival.  She found her way into advertisements and, surprisingly, into politics with the emergence of Sarah Palin.  Conservative yet fashionable in dress, she served as a voice for conventional values.  That coupled with her recognizable frames made her an example of what the sexy librarian looks like.}}</ref>

A disproportionate number of the librarians represented in novels are in the [[detective fiction]] genre, frequently as an amateur detective and protagonist.  Although the stereotype of the librarian as "passive bore" does not seem reconcilable with the intensity of a mystery, the stereotypical librarian does share many traits with the successful detective.  Their mindset is focused, calm, unbiased in considering viewpoints, and focused on the world around them.  By personality they are industrious perfectionists—and eccentric.  The drab and innocuous look of the stereotypical librarian is perfect for avoiding suspicion, while their research skills and ability to ask the right questions allow them to procure and evaluate the information necessary to solve the case.  The knowledge they have gained from wide reading successfully competes with a private investigator's personal experience.  For example, Jacqueline Kirby is drawn into the mystery in [[Elizabeth Peters]]' novel ''The Seventh Sinner'' (1972) due to her awareness of her surroundings.  Wearing the stereotypical bun, glasses, and practical clothes, together with an eccentrically large purse, she is self-possessed and resourceful, knowledgeable in a variety of fields and skilled at research.<ref name="Reiman">{{cite web

Librarians appeared in other literature as well. For instance,  [[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel ''[[Snow Crash]]'' features a commercialized melding of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Library of Congress]], along with a virtual librarian who assists the main character, and raises questions of the role of the librarian in an increasingly information-rich world.<ref name="Blackmore">{{cite journal | last = Blackmore| first = Tim| title = Agent of Civility: the Librarian in Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash| journal = SIMILE: Studies in Media & Information Literacy Education| volume = 4| issue = 4| pages = 1–10| date = November 2004 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251011743| doi = 10.3138/sim.4.4.001}}</ref> Also, the eponymous character in [[Garth Nix]]'s ''[[Lirael]]'' (2001) is an assistant librarian whose curiosity about the library she works in leads her into trouble and whose research skills save her.

There are other fictional librarians in literature as well. Allison Carroll in Jo Walton's ''[[Among Others]]'' serves as a mentor to the main protagonist and Madam Irma Pince is the librarian at Hogwarts during the [[Harry Potter]] series by J. K. Rowling. Madam Pince embodies many negative librarian stereotypes- she's controlling, intimidating, she shushes, and she values books over patrons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2017/04/14/our-favorite-fictional-librarians-ranked|title=Our Favorite Fictional Librarians, Ranked|website=The New York Public Library|access-date=2018-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529052227/https://www.nypl.org/blog/2017/04/14/our-favorite-fictional-librarians-ranked|archive-date=May 29, 2019}}</ref> Similarly, the [[Unseen University#Librarian|The Librarian]] in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy series, a once-human wizard who manages the library at the Unseen University,<ref name="OUP"/> Lucien serves on the Dream palace staff as chief librarian in Neil Gaiman's ''The Sandman'' series, and ''Welcome to Nightvale''<nowiki/>'s Rabid Librarians will go to incredibly violent ends to ensure that the community is reading.<ref name="gca" /> Finally, ,any of the central cast of characters in ''[[The Library at Mount Char]]'' by Scott Hawkins refer to themselves as librarians, though their skillsets tend to be far more magical and violent that your average librarian stereotype.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/scott-hawkins/the-library-at-mount-char/|title=The Library at Mount Char [Review]|website=Kirkus Reviews|access-date=September 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617060629/https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/scott-hawkins/the-library-at-mount-char/|archive-date=June 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Television and streamed media==
Librarians have often been depicted in [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[Streaming television|streamed]] television series.

[[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] had a number of shows which depicted librarians. For instance, in season 2 episode 6 ("Caged") of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', a CBS show, actor [[Michael A. Goorjian]] plays Aaron Pratt, an autistic librarian who witnesses the death of a colleague. Pratt states that he has "a master's in library science and an English degree from UNLV."<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Caged |url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=13218 |access-date=September 22, 2020 |series=[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] |network=[[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] |date=November 8, 2001 |season=2 |number=6 |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, in an episode of another CBS show, ''[[The Crazy Ones]]'', "The Monster", actress [[Melody Thomas Scott]] plays Flora, a drunk librarian who uses a lot of big and complex words, whose library is on a verge of shutting down but with the help of Simon and the group, her library was saved.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/amp/news/melody-thomas-scott-1078246/|title=Exclusive: The Young and the Restless' Melody Thomas Scott Guests on The Crazy Ones|last=Logan|first=Michael|date=2014-02-26|website=TVGuide|access-date=2020-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200407032628/https://www.tvguide.com/amp/news/melody-thomas-scott-1078246/|archive-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> NBC also featured librarians in one of its most popular shows. In the 2009 ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' episode "[[Ron and Tammy]]", Leslie Knope's dreams of a local park are almost squashed by Tammy, the new library director at the Pawnee Public Library and Ron Swanson's ex-wife.<ref name="Wood" /> Tammy places a claim for the lot that Leslie intended to use for her park. Tammy then tries to sexually manipulate Ron into giving her the lot for the library. Leslie calls librarians "diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats" as well as "punk-ass book jockeys." In "[[Ron & Tammy: Part Two|Ron and Tammy: II]]",<ref name="Trombetta" /> Leslie says Tammy is "just a manipulative, psychotic, library book-peddling, sex-crazed, she-demon." Tammy also has books on "Approved" and "Rejected" shelves, which insinuate that the library operates in a biased manner. The depictions of the library on ''Parks and Recreation'' "illuminate the nature of library anxiety."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tewell|first=Eamon|title="Punk-Ass Book Jockeys": Library Anxiety in the Television Programs Community and Parks and Recreation|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2587&context=libphilprac|journal=Library Philosophy and Practice (E-journal)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923013015/https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2587&context=libphilprac|archive-date=September 23, 2020}}</ref> A more positive depiction appears in an episode of Cartoon Network's ''[[We Bare Bears]]'', titled "The Library".

In an episode of the series, ''[[The Replacements (TV series)|The Replacements]]'', titled "Quiet Riot", Todd replaces Mrs. Shusher, the shush-happy librarian, with a rock star at the same time their semester projects are due.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} At the same time, in the animated series ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', Swampy (the drummer of Love Händel) became the librarian after Love Händel's disbandment and goes now by the name "Sherman".{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} In an episode of Disney's ''[[Big City Greens]]'', titled "Quiet Please," a librarian at a city library shushes the protagonists and threatens to push them out if they make a sound.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Appelbaum |first1=Lauren |title=Disney Channel’s Big City Greens Showcases Authentic ASL Representation |url=https://www.respectability.org/2020/09/disney-big-city-greens-asl/ |magazine=[[RespectAbility]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918192908/https://www.respectability.org/2020/09/disney-big-city-greens-asl/ |archive-date=September 18, 2020 |date=September 18, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result, the protagonists communicate with each other using [[American Sign Language|ASL]] after seeing two deaf library patrons communicating the same way. 

CBS, NBC, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel were not alone in having characters who were librarians. In the [[PBS]] puppet series ''[[Between the Lions]]'', which broadcast from 2000 to 2010, and promotes early reading to little children, features Theo and Cleo Lion as the librarians. Also, in an episode of ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]'' called "The Tale of the Quiet Librarian", an elderly librarian named Mercy MacGregor haunts the library during closing hours and uses the box to steal the patrons' voices, mostly noisy children. On the other hand, a SyFy show ''[[The Magicians (American TV series)|The Magicians]]'' (based on the series by [[Lev Grossman]]) has a strong focus on libraries. In the show, the Library of the Netherlands is an [[archive]] that contains all of the knowledge in the universe. Librarians formed the Order of the Librarians, a group that protects that knowledge. The Library is staffed by Zelda Schiff, a prim, glasses-and-cardigan wearing librarian whose biggest concern is possible defacement of library books. Uniquely, when creating the Australian [[miniseries]] ''[[The Librarians (2007 TV series)|The Librarians]]'', co-producers and writers Wayne Hope and Robyn Butler consulted with real librarians for research, and took their advice to avoid shushing and cardigan-wearing librarian characters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/have-a-lend-of-us/2007/10/28/1193548291359.html|title=Have a lend of us|last=Taffel|first=Jacqui|date=29 October 2007|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225211955/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/have-a-lend-of-us-20071029-gdrgdy.html|archive-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> This contrasts with the stereotypical school librarian, [[Rupert Giles]] in the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' series. The character wears old-fashioned clothes and spectacles, is intelligent and well-read although he dislikes computers, and is overly concerned with following regulations, although he later is given an opportunity to develop beyond these stereotypes.<ref name="Wood">{{cite web |last1=Wood |first1=Matthew |title=10 Most Awesome Librarians In Pop Culture |url=https://www.cbr.com/best-amazing-librarians-pop-culture/ |magazine=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830181029/https://www.cbr.com/best-amazing-librarians-pop-culture/ |archive-date=August 30, 2019 |date=September 21, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> There was also a [[TNT]] series, ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]'', an extension of the eponymous film franchise of the same name.

Various streamed shows have featured librarians. For instance, actress Christi Waldon appears in ''[[Stranger Things]]'' as Marissa, the [[librarian]] of the Hawkins Public Library, in season 1 episode 3 ("[[Holly, Jolly]]") and season 2 episode 3 ("[[The Pollywog]]").{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Secondly, in ''[[Hilda (TV series)|Hilda]]'', there is a character known as "The Librarian." One reviewer called her character "among the most positive pop culture depictions of librarians," apart with libraries in ''[[Cleopatra in Space (TV series)|Cleopatra in Space]]'' and ''[[She-Ra and the Princesses of Power]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hermann |first1=Burkely |title=A Mysterious Librarian is the Breakout Star of Netflix’s "Hilda" |url=http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/mysterious-librarian-breakout-star-netflix%E2%80%99s-hilda |magazine=[[I Love Libraries]] |publisher=[[American Library Association]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922191916/http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/mysterious-librarian-breakout-star-netflix%E2%80%99s-hilda |archive-date=September 22, 2020 |date=September 21, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The same reviewer states that that the nine minutes in the first season of ''Hilda'' within a library setting makes a "strong impression," as it includes an episode featuring a [[special collections]] room. They further argued that the series makes clear the "importance of librarians and libraries for years to come." In another article, the same reviewer looked at library settings in ''[[Cleopatra in Space (TV series)|Cleopatra in Space]]'' and ''[[She-Ra and the Princesses of Power]]''. In terms of the latter show, they noted the season 2 finale focuses "around two middle-aged gay Black librarians," which contrasts with the depiction of a white and long-haired stereotypical librarian in ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', and argued that the series, as a whole, "shows librarians as helpful, welcoming, and diverse."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hermann |first1=Burkely |title=These Animated Shows Defy Library Stereotypes |url=http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/these-animated-shows-defy-library-stereotypes |magazine=[[I Love Libraries]] |publisher=[[American Library Association]] |accessdate=August 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812145936/http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/these-animated-shows-defy-library-stereotypes |archive-date=August 12, 2020 |date=August 11, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Apart from the above named shows, ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', which streamed on Netflix as well, featured a librarian. Specifically, Tasha “Taystee” Jefferson, within the Litchfield Penitentiary with other women, is an outspoken librarian who is loyal, ambitious, and learned.<ref name="Trombetta" />

==Computer and Video Games==
Librarians have appeared in interactive entertainment and in online mediums. They are often portrayed as guides and/or purveyors of knowledge who help the user progress within the game like in ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Review |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1212033p1.html |magazine=[[IGN]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119165300/http://pc.ign.com/articles/121/1212033p1.html |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |date=November 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For instance, ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge|Monkey Island II: LeChuck's Revenge]]'', a PC game from 1991, features a notably large library, complete with a female librarian who wheels around in her chair between shelves and shushes the protagonist.<ref>{{cite web |title=Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge, PC, 1991 [Review] |url=https://librariesinvideogames.tumblr.com/post/102305753545/monkey-island-2-lechucks-revenge-pc-1991 |magazine=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=September 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529024702/https://librariesinvideogames.tumblr.com/post/102305753545/monkey-island-2-lechucks-revenge-pc-1991 |archive-date=May 29, 2016 |date=November 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Then there is ''[https://stardewvalley.net/ Stardew Valley]'' an indie role-playing game released in 2016, features a town library and museum, staffed by Gunther, the museum curator. The museum is empty at the beginning of the game, and Gunther asks players to help fill it by donating artifacts and minerals and finding the library's lost books. In the 2013 fantasy noir game ''[[The Wolf Among Us]],'' the librarian players must consult for information on both magic and crime is a flying monkey named Bufkin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bufkin (Video Game)|url=https://fables.fandom.com/wiki/Bufkin_(Video_Game)|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Fables Wiki|language=en}}</ref> He is depicted as a bit stuffy, but benevolent and helpful.

Some games actually contain librarians as enemies the player must combat, although generally these librarians are somehow altered, either by evil magic or technology, and no longer properly human. Examples of this phenomenon include ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', released in 2014, in which library closures affected the once benign librarians and twisted them into demons of fear, and the 2010 post-apocalyptic game ''Metro 2033,'' in which the Russian State library is guarded by hulking mutated monsters called librarians and cited as "some of the most dangerous creatures out here."<ref>{{Cite web|last=blog|first=MMU Library|date=2019-02-11|title=The Good, the Bad and the Ugly- Librarians in Video Games|url=https://medium.com/@mmulibrary/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-librarians-in-video-games-57d28fbc65c0|access-date=2020-11-28|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> Riffing off of the opening scene from the 1984 movie, the 2009 ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game|Ghostbusters]]'' video game contains a level that places players in a haunted library and pits them against a ghostly librarian.

Rarely, librarians are protagonists of computer games. One example is in the short, 2020 adventure game, appropriately titled ''The Librarian.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Save 10% on The Librarian (Special Edition) on Steam|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364010/The_Librarian_Special_Edition/|access-date=2020-11-28|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en}}</ref>

Similarly, various songs focus on librarians. For instance, the retrospective compilation album of [[Tori Amos]] is called ''[[Tales of a Librarian]]'', while  [[My Morning Jacket]]'s 2008 album ''[[Evil Urges]]'' features a song called "Librarian" and 2013 album of the American punk band [[Swingin' Utters]], ''[[Poorly Formed]]'' includes a song titled "The Librarians Are Hiding Something." Additionally, the song, "Karen" of the Go-Betweens' album ''Lee Remick'' (1978), is an ode to a librarian and Velocity Girl's 1993 album ''Copacetic'' contains the song titled "Lisa Librarian." In the same vein, Mrs. Phelps in ''[[Matilda the Musical|Matilda]]'' was a librarian. She worked to help young readers, giving their advice, saying things like "sit back and allow the words to wash around you, like music."<ref name="Trombetta" /> 

Librarians appeared in other media too, including [[Model figure|model figures]]. In 2003, [[Archie McPhee]] brought out a librarian [[action figure]], modeled on [[Seattle Public Library]] librarian [[Nancy Pearl]]. 28,000 action figures were sold in the first week of their availability.<ref name="archie">{{Cite web|url=https://mcphee.com/pages/history-of-the-librarian-action-figure|title=The History of the Librarian Action Figure and Nancy Pearl|website=Archie McPhee|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514013139/https://mcphee.com/pages/history-of-the-librarian-action-figure|archive-date=May 14, 2020}}</ref> Wearing a suit, hair bun and glasses, the action figure sparked controversy, particularly for the button-triggered shushing motion.

== Stereotypes ==
[[Stereotype]]s of librarians in popular culture are frequently negative: [[librarian]]s are portrayed as puritanical, punitive, unattractive, and introverted if female, or timid and effeminate if male.  Such inaccurate stereotypes are likely to have a negative impact on the attractiveness of librarianship as a profession to young people.<ref name="Peresie" /><ref name="PagowskyDeconstructing">

In modern times, the archetype of the "sexy librarian" has also begun to gain some traction, introduced in an effort to subvert the popular matriarchal image and make them more appealing to the average consumer. Both archetypes boil down to a similar idea, however – an authoritative, implacable guardian of the books who, through either power or sex appeal, keeps the library patrons in fear and thus remains exclusive guardian of the otherwise obscure organization system in the library.<ref name=LeadPipe>{{cite news | url         = http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2014/ice-ice-baby-2/ | title       = Ice ice baby: Are librarian stereotypes freezing us out of instruction? | work        = In the library with the leadpipe | first1      = Nicole | last1       = Pagowsky | first2      = Erica

<blockquote>
"We cannot separate our understanding of library stereotypes from the history of librarianship that influenced their development in the first place...There are numerous librarian stereotypes, with the most recognizable being the middle-aged, bun-wearing, comfortably shod, shushing librarian. Others include the sexy librarian, the superhero librarian, and the hipster or tattooed librarian. These stereotypes are all characterized predominantly as feminine, white women. Newer librarian stereotypes, particularly those proffered by librarians themselves, tend to be depicted as younger white women. The original librarian stereotype, which was superseded by the introduction of his prudish sister, was that of the fussy (white) male curmudgeon...Librarian stereotypes can be traced, in part, to cultural anxieties about the emergence of the profession...we can conclude that, despite being beloved by a number of prominent and not-so-prominent individuals, librarianship as we know it is often treated in popular culture as a low- status profession or not a profession at all...It is important to acknowledge that stereotype threat is at work within librarianship because of the raced, classed, and gendered reality of individual librarians’ lives."
