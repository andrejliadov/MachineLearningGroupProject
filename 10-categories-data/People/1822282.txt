== Overview ==
The existence of two sexes seems to have been selected independently across different [[lineage (evolution)|evolutionary lineages]] (see [[convergent evolution]]).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Sex|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/sex|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The repeated pattern is sexual reproduction in [[isogamy|isogamous]] species with two or more [[mating type]]s with gametes of identical form and behavior (but different at the molecular level) to [[anisogamy|anisogamous]] species with [[gamete]]s of male and [[female]] types to [[oogamy|oogamous]] species in which the female gamete is very much larger than the male and has no ability to move. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for [[sexual reproduction]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Living at Micro Scale |last=Dusenbery |first=David B. |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-674-03116-6 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |at=Chapter 20}}.</ref>

Accordingly, sex is defined across species by the type of gametes produced (i.e.: spermatozoa vs. ova) and differences between males and females in one lineage are not always predictive of differences in another.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|title=Why Sex?

[[sexual dimorphism|Male/female dimorphism]] between organisms or reproductive organs of different sexes is not limited to animals; male gametes are produced by [[chytrid]]s, [[diatom]]s and land [[plant]]s, among others. In land plants, ''female'' and ''male'' designate not only the female and male gamete-producing organisms and structures but also the structures of the [[sporophyte]]s that give rise to male and female plants.

== Symbol and usage ==
=== Symbol ===
A common [[gender symbol|symbol]] used to represent the male sex is the [[Mars symbol]] ♂, a circle with an arrow pointing [[Ordinal direction|northeast]].  The [[Unicode]] code-point is:
:{{unichar|2642|MALE SIGN|html=}}
The symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of [[Mars]]. It was first used to denote sex by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1751. The symbol is sometimes seen as a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]]. [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. According to Stearn, however, this derivation is "fanciful" and all the historical evidence favours "the conclusion of the French classical scholar [[Claude de Saumaise]] (Salmasius, 1588{{ndash}}1683)" that it is derived from ''θρ'', the contraction of a Greek name for the planet Mars, which is ''Thouros''.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1217734|title = The Origin of the Male and Female Symbols of Biology|journal = Taxon|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 109–113|last1 = Stearn|first1 = William T.|year = 1962|doi = 10.2307/1217734}}</ref>

=== Usage ===
In addition  to its meaning in the context of biology, ''male'' can also refer to [[gender]]<ref>{{cite book|authors= Laura Palazzani; Victoria Bailes; Marina Fella |title = Gender in Philosophy and Law | year= 2012 |page = v | quote='gender' means human gender, male/female gender | isbn= 9789400749917 | publisher = Dordrecht : Springer | series= SpringerBriefs in law }} (eBook)</ref> or [[gender of connectors and fasteners|a shape of connectors]].<ref>{{cite book| author =J.

The sex of a particular organism may be determined by a number of factors. These may be genetic or environmental, or may naturally change during the course of an organism's life. Although most species have only two sexes (either male or female),<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Fusco|first1=Giuseppe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKGsDwAAQBAJ&q=Number+of+sexes|title=The Biology of Reproduction|last2=Minelli|first2=Alessandro|date=2019-10-10|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-49985-9|language=en}}</ref> [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] animals, such as [[worm]]s, have both male and female reproductive organs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=hermaphroditism {{!}} Definition, Types, & Effects|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/hermaphroditism|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

=== Genetic determination ===
Most [[mammal]]s, including [[human]]s, are genetically determined as such by the [[XY sex-determination system]] where males have an XY (as opposed to XX) sex [[chromosome]]. It is also possible in a variety of species, including humans, to be [[XX male]] or have other [[karyotypes]]. During [[reproduction]], a male can give either an X sperm or a Y sperm, while a female can only give an X egg. A Y sperm and an X egg produce a male, while an X sperm and an X egg produce a [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-07-17|title=43.1C: Sex Determination|url=https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_General_Biology_(Boundless)/43%3A_Animal_Reproduction_and_Development/43.1%3A_Reproduction_Methods/43.1C%3A_Sex_Determination|access-date=2020-07-22|website=Biology LibreTexts|language=en}}</ref>

The [[ZW sex-determination system]], where males have a ZZ (as opposed to ZW) sex chromosome may be found in [[bird]]s and some [[insect]]s (mostly [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]]) and other organisms. Members of the insect order [[Hymenoptera]], such as [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, are often determined by [[haplodiploidy]], where most males are [[haploid]] and females and some sterile males are [[diploid]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Environmental determination ===
In some species of reptiles, such as [[alligator]]s, sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated.

== Secondary sex characteristics ==
{{Main|Secondary sex characteristic}}

In those species with two sexes, males may differ from females in ways other than the production of spermatozoa.

In many insects and fish, the male is smaller than the female. 

In seed plants, which exhibit [[alternation of generations]], the female and male parts are both included within the [[flower|sporophyte sex organ]] of a single organism. 

In mammals, including humans, males are typically larger than females.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Skw2mezpvO4C&q=sex+differences+in+size&pg=PA21|title=Sex Differences: Summarizing More than a Century of Scientific Research|last2=Hershberger|first2=Scott|last3=Field|first3=Evelyn|last4=Wersinger|first4=Scott|last5=Pellis|first5=Sergio|last6=Geary|first6=David|last7=Palmer|first7=Craig|last8=Hoyenga|first8=Katherine|last9=Hetsroni|first9=Amir|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-136-87493-2|language=en}}</ref>
