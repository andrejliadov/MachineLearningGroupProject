'''''The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper''''' is a book by the British historian [[Hallie Rubenhold]], published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 2019. The book examines the lives of the "canonical five", the five women largely believed to have been killed by [[Jack the Ripper]] in the [[Whitechapel murders]]. Rubenhold came to the conclusion that only two of the five women, [[Mary Jane Kelly]] and [[Elizabeth Stride]], were [[prostitution|prostitutes]].  In some cases the women may have been targeted by the Ripper just because they were sleeping rough.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/01/hallie-rubenhold-jack-the-ripper-victims|title=Hallie Rubenhold: ‘Jack the Ripper's victims have just become corpses.

==Critical reception==
Overall, the book was received positively.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Book Marks reviews of The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper by Hallie Rubenhold|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/the-five-the-untold-lives-of-the-women-killed-by-jack-the-ripper/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Book Marks|language=en-US}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' dubbed the book "important" and praised its illumination of the lives of the women, as well as challenging long held assumptions.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/13/the-five-by-hallie-rubenhold-review-the-untold-lives-of-the-rippers-victims</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that by "restoring 'the five' to humanity and dignity, Rubenhold’s book becomes a passionate indictment of the true-crime genre, with its fixation on the minds of murderers and its shallow, glancing sympathy for the dead."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Scutts|first=Joanna|title=Review {{!}} Jack the Ripper’s victims are famous in death, but what were their lives like?|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/jack-the-rippers-victims-are-famous-in-death-but-what-were-their-lives-like/2019/05/17/22ba31e8-50a5-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html|access-date=2020-11-12|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Also writing for ''The Washington Post'', Wendy Smith, describes the book as "a blistering counter-narrative to the 'male, authoritarian, and middle class' legend of a demonic superman preying on prostitutes".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Smith|first=Wendy|title=Review {{!}} Jack the Ripper’s identity has been endlessly scrutinized.

Her riveting work, both compassionate group portrait and stinging social history, finally gives them their due."<ref name=":1" /> [[Kirkus Reviews|''Kirkus Reviews'']] argues that, "Rubenhold urges us to see the victims as just that and not as the 'fallen women' of the received record."<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=February 3, 2019|title=The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/hallie-rubenhold/the-five/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2020|website=Kirkus Reviews}}</ref>
