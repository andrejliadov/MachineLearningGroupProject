The Albright Institute is notable for its emphasis on women's leadership and its nontraditional approach to international studies, which incorporates research and perspectives on global affairs from disciplines including [[literature]], the [[fine art]]s, [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[science]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

== History ==

The Albright Institute was established with the intention of addressing world affairs from an unconventionally interdisciplinary approach, setting it apart from traditional international studies programs which emphasize history, political science, and economics.<ref name=":0" />

Former [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] and [[diplomat]] [[Madeleine Albright]] graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1959 and has remained an active alumna and supporter of the college throughout her career.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/27/us/madeleine-albright-fast-facts/index.html|title=Madeleine Albright Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

Albright drew upon her own experience as a [[political science]] [[Academic major|major]] at Wellesley in the late 1950s while establishing the direction and philosophy of the Albright Institute. She cited her experience as a [[diplomat]] and serving as [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] under [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] from 1997 to 2001 for leading her to recognize the multidimensional complexity of current events and global conflicts.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/albright120696.htm|title=Albright's Personal Odyssey Shaped Foreign Policy Beliefs|last=Dobbs|first=Michael, John M.

Diplomat [[Rick Barton (diplomat)|Rick Barton]] of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] voiced approval of the institute's approach to global affairs studies, stating that the institute "recognize[s] that this is a very complex challenge and you have to approach it in an integrated fashion. That's still not the norm. If Wellesley does it successfully, they will be ahead of others."<ref name=":0" />

Former president of Wellesley College, [[H. Kim Bottomly|H. Him Bottomly]], noted the importance of women's leadership development to both the Albright Institute and Wellesley College at large, stating that the Albright Institute "play[s] a critical role in Wellesley's education of future women leaders across the world."<ref name=":0" /> This sentiment was echoed by current Wellesley President [[Paula Johnson]] who cited the advancement of women's leadership as the "surest way to bring positive change to our fast-moving, complex world."<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iran-will-continue-to-retaliate-in-many-forms-and-in-many-places-says-susan-rice-at-recent-wellesley-college-event-300984948.html|title=Iran Will Continue To Retaliate In Many Forms And In Many Places, Says Susan Rice At Recent Wellesley College Event|last=Wellesley College|first=|date=Jan 10, 2020|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

Madeleine Albright has used Albright Institute events as opportunities to connect with current Wellesley students and express personal reflections on her education and career. In 2012 Albright visited a student-run cooperative cafe on campus where she had worked and served as manager during her junior and senior years at Wellesley from 1957 to 1959.<ref name=":1" /> During a 2016 lunch event for Albright Fellows in which she discussed her path from refugee to college student to first female US Secretary of State, she stated "Madeleine Korbel did not become Madeleine Albright overnight. It takes time."<ref name=":4" />

Albright is known for wearing decorative [[brooch]]es (pins) to convey messages relating to politics, current events, and humor – a practice which was documented in her 2009 book ''Read My Pins: Stories from a Diplomat's Jewel Box'' and in a traveling exhibition of her personal jewelry collection at the [[Museum of Art and Design]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Lamb|first=Christina|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/madeleine-albright-reveals-brooch-diplomacy-pinned-down-adversaries-tz5q9vnbbqw|title=Madeleine Albright reveals brooch diplomacy pinned down adversaries|access-date=2020-03-14|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113278807|title=Madeleine Albright's Jewelry-Box Diplomacy|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> During a visit to Wellesley College to promote her jewelry exhibition and book, Albright explained, "Wellesley was one of the first places that gave me the opportunity to engage with global politics, develop my political views and explore creative ways to express those views so it’s only fitting to bring pins and politics back to Wellesley."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationaljeweler.com/fashion/style/1385-albright-s-alma-mater-latest-to-read-her-pins|title=Albright's alma mater latest to read her pins|last=Graff|first=Michelle|date=3 April 2014|website=National Jeweler|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> In keeping with Albright's penchant for symbolic pin-wearing, the Albright Institute created numerous commemorative pins which are given to Albright Fellows and affiliates of the institute.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2014/06/13/madeleine-albright-read-pins-davis-museum-wellesley-college/|title=Madeleine Albright to Talk 'Read My Pins' at Wellesley College|date=2014-06-13|website=Boston Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/article/20160207/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/160206728|title=Natick metalsmith designs Albright pin|last=Benson|first=Brian|date=7 February 2016|website=MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> A silversmith from the nearby town of [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], Massachusetts, designed a pin for the Albright Institute in 2010 in celebration of the first class of Albright Fellows and another in 2016 at the first fellows' reunion.
