On July 21, 2015, the Brantlys released a book written with biographer David Thomas titled ''Called for Life: How Loving Our Neighbor Led Us Into the Heart of the Ebola Epidemic'' published by [[WaterBrook Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=‘Called for Life’: Ebola survivor shares ordeal — his, Africa’s — in memoir|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150715-called-for-life-ebola-survivor-shares-ordeal--his-africas--in-memoir.ece/|last=Nishihara|first=Naomi|date=15 July 2015|website=The Dallas Morning News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717150106/http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20150715-called-for-life-ebola-survivor-shares-ordeal--his-africas--in-memoir.ece/|archive-date=17 July 2015}}</ref>

After surviving Ebola, Brantly made the decision to return to Africa for medical missions in 2019. Brantly gave a brief statement of why he decided to return despite his near-death situation of contracting Ebola. Brantly stated:<blockquote>“It’s been five years of emotional healing and spiritual healing and growth,” the doctor, 38, told The Christian Chronicle in an interview at the Southside Church of Christ in Fort Worth, his family’s home congregation for much of the last decade. “I think we’ve grown and been equipped in ways during this five years that we were not before we went to Liberia.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://religionnews.com/2019/07/17/ebola-survivor-dr-kent-brantly-returning-to-africa-as-medical-missionary/|title=Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly returning to Africa as medical missionary}}</ref></blockquote>
