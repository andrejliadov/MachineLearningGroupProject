'''Margaret Bartholomew''' (8 Oct 1903 â€“ 18 Oct 1943) was the first, and only female, [[Civil Air Patrol]] member to die in service during World War II.<ref>[http://www.ohwg.cap.gov/ohio-wing-wwii-history/ National Museum of the Civil Air Patrol]</ref>

==Biography==
Lieuteant Margaret Bartholomew was the 154th charter member of the Ohio Wing of Civil Air Patrol, as well as being the Flight Leader of Flight C from Squadron 5111-1. Squadron 5111-1 was the original Cincinnati Squadron, and was based at [[Lunken Airport]]. Flight C was an all-female flight, and was composed of 50 aviatrices.

Bartholomew was returning to Cincinnati on October 18, 1943, from a courier mission out of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, when a sudden snowstorm plunged visibility to zero. She flew lower as she tried to find a safe place to land, but visibility was so poor that she crashed into a hill 55 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, approximately in Indiana, Pennsylvania.<ref>Dunkman, Elizabeth.
