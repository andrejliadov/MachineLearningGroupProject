'''Salome Sellers''' (''née'' '''Sylvester'''; October 19, 1800 &ndash; January 9, 1909) was an American [[centenarian]] who was the last known person born in the [[18th century]].

==Biography==
Sellers was born as Salome Sylvester was in [[Deer Isle, Maine]] (then part of [[Massachusetts]]), the daughter of Captain Edward and Deborah (''née'' Cushman) Sylvester. Descending from [[Mayflower]] Stock, her father served during the [[American Revolution]]. She grew up on Deer Isle and married Joseph Sellers on 23 December 1830. The couple had six children together, Salome outliving all but her oldest son, William. She was widowed in 1865.

Due to her unusually long life, Sellers was often featured in local newspapers and visited by people interested in her long life. On her fame, she remarked, "I've lived too long. I'm only a curiosity now for people to come and stare at."

Sellers died in the same house she and her husband had built in 1830 in Deer Isle, Maine on 9 January 1909, aged 108 years, 82 days. Her house is now known as the [[Salome Sellers House]] and home to the Deer Isle-Stonington Historical Society. There has been a book published in 1998 by Peg Mitten Pr. and written by Caroline Smith Rittenhouse that details her life: "An Island Woman: Salome Sylvester Sellers, Deer Isle, Maine 1800-1909".
