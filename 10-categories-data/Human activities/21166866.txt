Another differentiator of computer science education is that it has primarily only been taught at [[university]] level until recently, with some notable exceptions in [[Israel]], [[Poland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[BBC Micro]] in the [[1980s]] as part of [[Computer science education in the United Kingdom]].<ref name=after/><ref name="RogersShum2017">{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Yvonne|last2=Shum|first2=Venus|last3=Marquardt|first3=Nic|last4=Lechelt|first4=Susan|last5=Johnson|first5=Rose|last6=Baker|first6=Howard|last7=Davies|first7=Matt|title=From the BBC micro to micro:bit and beyond|journal=Interactions|volume=24|issue=2|year=2017|pages=74–77|issn=1072-5520|doi=10.1145/3029601}}</ref> Computer science has been a part of the school [[curricula]] from age 14 or age 16 in a few countries for a few decades, but has typically as an elective subject.

==Computing education research==
[[Educational research]] on computing and [[teaching methods]] in computer science is usually known as ''Computing Education Research''.<ref name=cup/><ref name="CooperGrover2014">{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Steve|last2=Grover|first2=Shuchi|last3=Guzdial|first3=Mark|last4=Simon|first4=Beth|title=A future for computing education research|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=57|issue=11|year=2014|pages=34–36|issn=0001-0782|doi=10.1145/2668899}}</ref> The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) runs a [[Special Interest Group]] (SIG) on Computer science education known as [[SIGCSE]] which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, making it one of the oldest and longest running ACM Special Interest Groups.<ref name="MorrisonSettle2018">{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Briana|last2=Settle|first2=Amber|authorlink2=Amber Settle|title=Celebrating SIGCSE's 50th anniversary!|journal=ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|volume=50|issue=1|year=2018|pages=2–3|issn=0097-8418|doi=10.1145/3183559.3183560}}</ref>

==Women in computer science==
In many countries, there is a significant gender gap in computer science education. In 2015, 15.3% of computer science students graduating from non-doctoral granting institutions in the US were women while at doctoral granting institutions, the figure was 16.6%.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Mixed News on Diversity and the Enrollment Surge|url=https://cra.org/data/generation-cs/diversity/|date=2017-02-10|website=CRA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref> The number of female PhD recipients in the US was 19.3% in 2018.<ref>2018 Taulbee Survey, Computing Research Association. https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2018_Taulbee_Survey.pdf</ref> The gender gap also exists in other western countries.<ref name="gender">{{cite web|title=IT gender gap: Where are the female programmers? |url =http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/it-gender-gap-where-are-the-female-programmers/|first = Justin |last = James |work = TechRepublic}}</ref> The gap is smaller, or nonexistent, in some parts of the world. In 2011, women earned half of the computer science degrees in [[Malaysia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=what ''[sic!]'' gender is science|url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/mariacharles/documents/WhatGenderisScience.pdf|accessdate=July 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924103245/http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/faculty/mariacharles/documents/WhatGenderisScience.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2001, 55 percent of computer science graduates in [[Guyana]] were women.<ref name="gender"/>
