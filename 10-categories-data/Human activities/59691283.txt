'''Transportation and health''' is a branch of [[public health]] dealing with efforts to improve health outcomes related to [[transport]]ation.

== Background and safety measures ==
Transportation is a core part of a functioning society, and managing the health impact of transportation falls under the branch of [[public health]]. Many measures have been taken over the years to improve health outcomes related to transportation. Accidents are the third leading cause of death in the United States, and one quarter of those are [[Traffic collision|motor vehicle accidents]], accounting for 40,327 deaths per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/accidental-injury.htm|title=FastStats|date=2018-11-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> Starting in the 1960s, campaigns began popping up all over the United States to promote motor [[vehicle safety]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.myparkingsign.com/blog/history-seat-belt-usage/|title=The history of seat belt usage {{!}} MyParkingSign.com Blog|date=2016-03-30|website=MyParkingSign Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> These campaigns used a multi-pronged approach to increase the safety of automobiles. They lobbied locally and in [[Washington DC]] to mandate certain safety features such as [[airbag]]s and [[seatbelt]]s, both of which reduce injury in the event of an accident.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.nationwide.com/car-safety-timeline-infographic/|title=A History of Car Safety Innovations [Infographic]|date=2014-06-25|website=Now from Nationwide ®|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>  These campaigns also used a variety of public health intervention methods to spread awareness of motor vehicle safety.<ref name=":0" /> In the states where interventions took place, seat belt usage skyrocketed.<ref name=":0" /> Motor vehicles contribute greatly to aggregate emissions all over the globe, which can have serious negative impacts on the health of the population.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/accomplishments-and-success-air-pollution-transportation|title=History of Reducing Air Pollution from Transportation in the United States|last=US EPA|first=OAR|date=2015-09-10|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref> In the 1970s, the [[Nixon administration]] created the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] as well as passing the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].<ref name=":1" /> Both of these measures not only helped to reduce the amount of harmful emissions being produced by motor vehicles in the US, but they also helped improve health measures. For example, it was found that reducing the amount of [[lead]] in [[gasoline]] directly correlated with decreasing blood lead content from 1976 to 1980.<ref name=":1" /> 

[[Biking]] is an essential form of transportation for many citizens. Biking comes with its own set of health benefits and detriments. Biking is one of the few forms of transportation that keeps the traveler active. This activity gives the rider a cardiovascular workout increasing [[muscle strength]] and joint mobility while reducing [[stress (psychological)|stress]] levels and [[body fat]] content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au:443/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits|title=Cycling - health benefits|last=Services|first=Department of Health & Human|website=www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> Although biking does have wonderful health outcomes for the body, the risks biking poses does have an impact on overall health outcomes. While [[helmet]]s do protect the rider in the event of crash or accident, the mere presence of a helmet increases the likelihood of a rider getting into an accident with a car.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/do-bike-helmet-laws-really-save-people/2013/06/03/6a6532b4-c6df-11e2-9245-773c0123c027_story.html|title=Do bike helmet laws really save people?|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref> More bike-specific infrastructure such as [[bike lane]]s and [[bike path]]s is needed to keep bikers safe.<ref name=":2" /> Commercial air travel ranks as the safest form of transportation in terms of deaths per billion miles traveled, with .07 deaths/billion miles traveled, followed by [[bus]] travel at .11 deaths/billion miles traveled and [[train]] transport at .43 deaths/billion miles traveled.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3857202/amtrak-philadelphia-crash-safety/|title=You Asked: How Safe Is Train Travel?|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Automotive travel ranked as the most dangerous with 7.3 deaths/billion miles traveled.<ref name=":3" />

== Air quality and emissions production ==
[[File:Comparison of Growth Areas and Emissions 1980-2015 US EPA.png|thumb|564x564px|Comparison of Growth Areas and Emissions 1980-2015, US]]
The six main pollutants monitored by the EPA that can have serious health consequences are particulate matter, ground-level [[ozone]], lead, [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]].<ref name=":4"/> Particulate matter consists of a mix of solid and liquid matter such as [[dust]], [[dirt]], or smoke that makes up two categories, PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the former being anything smaller than 10 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s and the latter being anything smaller than 2.5 micrometers.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants|title=Criteria Air Pollutants|last=US EPA|first=OAR|date=2014-04-09|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> PM<sub>10</sub> can get deep within your [[lungs]] while PM<sub>2.5</sub> is so small it can get into your [[blood stream]] both of which cause damage and is overall harmful for your health.<ref name=":4" /> When nitrogen oxides interact with volatile [[organic compound]]s near the surface of the Earth, ground-level ozone is formed which can cause a variety of respiratory issues and exacerbate existing conditions like [[COPD]] and [[asthma]] which is common in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children.<ref name=":4" /> Lead is a soft metal that when introduced to the human body, can cause damage throughout many body systems including the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[cardiovascular system|cardiovascular]], [[immune system|immune]], and [[renal system]]s.<ref name=":4" /> Carbon monoxide is introduced into the air through combustion reactions, and when inhaled, the carbon monoxide mimics [[oxygen]] molecules and binds to [[hemoglobin]], not allowing for proper oxygenation, which can exacerbate pre-existing conditions such as asthma and COPD.<ref name=":4" /> Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide both are synthesized through combustion reactions and have negative impacts on the respiratory systems.<ref name=":4" /> All six of the criteria [[air pollutant]]s are created either directly or indirectly from combustion reactions of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref name=":4" /> 
 
Measures have been taken starting in the 1970s to start to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air, thus aiming to improve health outcomes related to air quality.<ref name=":4" /> For example, the [[catalytic converter]] was introduced to the automotive industry. It functions by filtering exhaust from a combustion engine in a vehicle for potentially harmful gases and catalyzes reactions to transform them into less harmful chemicals such as [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[nitrogen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/catalytic-converter|title=Catalytic converter|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Also, reducing the amount of lead in gasoline did directly correlate with a decrease in blood lead content during a four year period in the 1970s.<ref name=":4" /> Although continuous measures have been taken to reduce the emissions content due to cars, they still rank unfavorably compared with other forms of travel.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/greener-travel-car-or-rail|title=Is it greener to travel by rail or car?|last=Henley|first=Will|date=2013-07-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-26|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> <blockquote>"In absolute terms, the picture is clear. Worldwide, road users account for about 71% of transport CO2 emissions, with railway companies making up less than 1.8%, next to 12.3% for aviation and 14.3% for shipping, according to the International Energy Agency and International Union of Railways."<ref name=":5" /></blockquote>In terms of emission production, bikes are the obvious leader in this category considering they produce nearly no emissions to run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eesi.org/topics/public-transit-walking-biking/description|title=Public Transit, Walking, and Biking {{!}} EESI|website=www.eesi.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> They are also smaller and create less pollution in terms of production.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/are-bikes-environmentally-friendlier-than-cars-green-lantern-runs-the-numbers/2011/08/22/gIQAYDBknJ_story.html|title=Are bikes environmentally friendlier than cars? Green Lantern runs the numbers.|last=Palmer|first=Brian|date=2011-08-29|work=The Washington Post|access-date=March 10, 2019}}</ref> On average, the production of a single [[bicycle]] creates around 530 pounds of carbon dioxide, which can be generally offset by about 400 miles of biking instead of driving.<ref name=":6" /> There are arguments that bikers need to consume more food, which leads to emissions productions in other ways and that drastically adds to the total emissions produced by bikers in comparison to drivers, but a biker would have to have a diet extremely high in [[beef]] consumption in order to substantially offset the emissions benefits of biking.<ref name=":6" /> Of course, like any other mode of transportation, feasibility and practicality play a role in the use of bikes in a different setting. Biking is impractical for long distance journeys or journeys where one would need to bring many things with them. But, for the most part, biking is most practical in [[suburban]] and [[urban area|urban]] environments for short journeys. Over 60% car journeys in the US in 2008 were between 0–10 miles long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/pl08021/fig4_5.cfm|title=Office of Highway Policy Information - Policy {{!}} Federal Highway Administration|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> This statistic illustrates that bikes are a very feasible option for a lot of journeys in the US. On top of the feasibility of bike usage due to distance, biking is also the quickest way to travel around urban areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2018/11/07/data-from-millions-of-smartphone-journeys-proves-cyclists-faster-in-cities-than-cars-and-motorbikes/|title=Data From Millions Of Smartphone Journeys Proves Cyclists Faster In Cities Than Cars And Motorbikes|last=Reid|first=Carlton|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> Considering that 62.7% of the population of the US lives in cities, biking is a feasibility for a large percentage of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-33.html|title=U.S. Cities Home to 62.7% of Population but Comprise 3.5% of Land Area|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=The United States Census Bureau|language=EN-US|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>

== Urban centers and public transportation ==
Public transportation is broad term encompassing a wide variety of methods of transportation including [[commuter rail]]s, light rails, heavy rails, trolleys, and buses. These diverse methods of transportation provides millions of Americans with a way to travel around the area in which they live. [[Public transportation]] as a whole has a variety of health benefits. Using public transportation makes a person more active, therefore making them more likely to be healthier and decreasing risk for diseases such as [[cardiovascular disease]], [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/policy/hst/hi5/publictransportation/index.html|title=Public Transportation System: Introduction or Expansion {{!}} Health Impact in 5 Years {{!}} Health System Transformation {{!}} AD for Policy {{!}} CDC|date=2018-10-19|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.transloc.com/blog/6-health-benefits-of-public-transportation|title=6 Health Benefits Of Public Transportation|last=Marketing|first=TransLoc|website=blog.transloc.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> Taking public transit makes a rider safer compared to drivers in personal vehicles.<ref name=":3" /> Public transit produces less emissions than cars which reduces levels in the air, decreasing risk for the harmful effects of emissions.<ref name=":7" />
