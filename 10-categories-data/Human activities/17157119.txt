'''Friendship''' is a relationship of mutual [[affection]] between people.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford Dictionary Press |title=Definition for friend |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/friend |access-date=25 May 2012}}</ref> It is a stronger form of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal bond]] than an association, and has been studied in academic fields such as [[Communication studies|communication]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[philosophy]]. Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including [[social exchange theory]], [[equity theory]], [[relational dialectics]], and [[attachment styles]].

Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. Such characteristics include [[affection]]; [[kindness]], [[love]], [[virtue]], [[sympathy]], [[empathy]], [[honesty]], [[altruism]], [[loyalty]], [[generosity]], [[forgiveness]], mutual [[understanding]] and [[compassion]], enjoyment of each other's company, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], and the ability to be oneself, express one's feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend. Friendship is an essential aspect of relationship building skills.

==Developmental psychology==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Childhood friends at a carnival.jpg|thumb|Childhood friends]]
The understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.<ref name="bremner">{{cite book|last1=Bremner|first1=J.

They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.<ref name="Newman, B. M. 2012"/>

Based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. This figure rose to 78% through the [[fifth grade]], as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.<ref name="oxford"/>{{rp|247}} About 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.<ref name="oxford"/>{{rp|250}}

Coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] describes three key ingredients of children's friendship formation: (1) openness, (2) similarity, and (3) shared fun.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 1)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 2)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kennedy-Moore|first= E. |year=2012|title= How children make friends (part 3)|url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201209/how-children-make-friends-part-3}}</ref> Parents can also help children understand social guidelines they haven't learned on their own.<ref>Elman, N.M. & Kennedy-Moore, E.

===Adolescence===
[[File:Bhutan, Friends - Flickr - babasteve.jpg|thumb|Two friends in Bhutan]]

In adolescence, friendships become "more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous." Adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocal relationship]], and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs.<ref name="reisman"/> Relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, [[loyalty]], and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.<ref name="oxford"/>{{rp|246}}

A study performed at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that adolescents were less likely to engage in problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good [[mental health]]. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether adolescents were influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups "fit in" at school.<ref>Crosnoe, R., & Needham, B. (2004) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15015689 Holism, contextual variability, and the study of friendships in adolescent development]. [[University of Texas at Austin]].</ref>

A study by researchers from [[Purdue University]] found that friendships formed during [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] last longer than friendships formed earlier.<ref>Sparks, Glenn (August 7, 2007).

Friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.<ref name="enc">{{cite book|last1=Schulz|first1=Richard|title=The Encyclopedia of Aging: Fourth Edition, 2-Volume Set|date=2006|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer Publishing Company]]|isbn=978-0-8261-4844-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tgS29D0Mr4gC|access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>{{rp|426}}

Adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Alex|title=Friends of a Certain Age: Why Is It Hard To Make Friends Over 30?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 25, 2012|date=13 July 2012}}</ref> Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bryant|first=Susan|title=Workplace Friendships: Asset or Liability?|url=http://career-advice.monster.com/in-the-office/workplace-issues/workplace-friendships-asset-or-liab/article.aspx|website=[[Monster.com]]|access-date=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Older adults===
[[Old age|Older adults]] continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. This satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish [[activities of daily living]], as well as a reduced decline in [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]].<ref name="enc"/>{{rp|427}} The overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blieszner|first1=Rosemary|last2=Adams|first2=Rebecca G.|title=Adult Friendship|date=1992|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0-8039-3673-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGs5DQAAQBAJ|access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>{{rp|53}}

As one review phrased it:

<blockquote>Research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.<ref name="brain">{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=Jon F.|last2=Federowicz|first2=Molly|last3=Nussbaum|first3=Paul D.|title=Brain Health and Optimal Engagement for Older Adults|year=2010|publisher=Editorial Aresta S.C.|isbn=978-84-937440-0-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwxrMe5Fo6QC|access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

As family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.<ref name="yearbook">{{cite book|last1=Burleson|first1=Brant R.|title=Communication Yearbook 19|year=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-87317-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8mMAgAAQBAJ|access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>{{rp|32–33}} Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction.

==Developmental issues==
===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Children with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships, due to a limited ability to build [[social skills]] through [[observational learning]], difficulties attending to [[social cues]], and because of the social impacts of [[impulsive behavior]] and a greater tendency to engage in behavior that may be seen as disruptive by their peers.<ref name="hoza"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wiener|first1=Judith|last2=Schneider|first2=Barry H.|title=A multisource exploration of the friendship patterns of children with and without learning disabilities|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=2002|volume=30|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11369370|pages=127–41|access-date=26 September 2017|pmid=12002394|doi=10.1023/A:1014701215315}}</ref> In a 2007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with ADHD, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.<ref name="hoza">{{cite journal|last1=Hoza|first1=[[Betsy Hoza|Betsy]]|title=Peer Functioning in Children With ADHD|journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology|date=June 7, 2007|volume=32|issue=6|pages=101–06|doi=10.1016/j.ambp.2006.04.011|pmid=17261489|pmc=2572031}}</ref>

===Autism===
Certain symptoms of [[autism spectrum]] disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of [[social skills]]. Children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. Additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon |first2=Marjorie |last3=Aviezer|first3=Anat|last4=Heung|first4=Kelly|last5=Gazit|first5=Lilach|last6=Brown|first6=John|last7=Rogers|first7=Sally J.|title=Children with Autism and Their Friends: A Multidimensional Study of Friendship in High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|date=3 January 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=135–50|doi=10.1007/s10802-007-9156-x|pmid=18172754}}</ref> A sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with one's parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bauminger|first1=Nirit|last2=Solomon|first2=Marjorie|last3=Rogers|first3=Sally J.|title=Predicting Friendship Quality in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Typical Development|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=29 December 2009|volume=40|issue=6|pages=751–61|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8|pmid=20039110|pmc=2864904}}</ref>

A study done by Frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Frankel|first1=Fred|last2=Myatt|first2=Robert|last3=Sugar|first3=Catherine|author3-link=Catherine Sugar|last4=Whitham|first4= Cynthia|last5=Gorospe|first5=Clarissa M.|last6=Laugeson|first6=Elizabeth|title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Parent-assisted Children's Friendship Training with Children having Autism Spectrum Disorders|journal= Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=8 January 2010|volume=40|issue=7|pages=827–42|doi=10.1007/s10803-009-0932-z|pmid=20058059|pmc=2890979}}</ref> Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rossetti|first1=Zachary|first2=Deborah|last2=Goessling|title=Paraeducators' Roles in Facilitating Friendships Between Secondary Students With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorders or Developmental Disabilities|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children|date=July–August 2010|volume=42|issue=6|series=6|pages=64–70|doi=10.1177/004005991004200608}}</ref>

Although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', bullying is most likely to occur against children with autism spectrum disorders who have the most potential to live independently. Such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with lower-functioning (more obvious) autism, but they are more likely to be [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstreamed]] in school, since they are on the higher-functioning (less obvious) end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to [[social cue]]s, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|title=School Bullies Prey on Children With Autism|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/school-bullies-prey-on-children-with-autism/|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 September 2012}}</ref>

===Down syndrome===
Children with [[Down syndrome]] have increased difficulty forming friendships. They experience a [[language delay]] causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play ''alongside'' a friend but not ''with'' them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.<ref>"Recreation & Friendship."

==Health==
Studies have found that strong social supports improve a person's prospects for good health and longevity. Conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], viral [[infection]]s, and [[cancer]], as well as higher mortality rates overall. Two researchers have even termed friendship networks a "behavioral [[vaccine]]" that boosts both physical and mental health.<ref>Friendship, social support, and health. 2007 Sias, Patricia M; Bartoo, Heidi. In L'Abate, Luciano. ''Low-cost approaches to promote physical and mental health: Theory, research, and practice''. (pp. 455–72). xxii, 526 pp. New York: Springer Science + Business Media.</ref>

There is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large [[Prospective cohort study|prospective studies]] that follow people over time, and while there may be a [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation]] between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.<ref>Social networks and health: It's time for an intervention trial. 2005.

===Mental health===
The lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of [[suicidal ideation]] among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another. However, no similar effect was observed for males.<ref>{{cite web|title=Friendships play key role in suicidal thoughts of girls, but not boys|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2004-01/osu-fpk010604.php|website=EurekAlert!|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|access-date=26 September 2017|date=January 6, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bearman|first1=Peter S.|last2=Moody|first2=James|title=Suicide and Friendships Among American Adolescents|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=January 1, 2004|volume=94|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.1.89|pmid=14713704|pmc=1449832}}</ref> Having few or no friends is a major indicator in the diagnosis of a range of [[mental disorders]].<ref name="reisman">{{cite journal|last1=Reisman|first1=John M.|title=Friendship and its Implications for Mental Health or Social Competence|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=September 1, 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=383–91|doi=10.1177/0272431685053010}}</ref>

==Dissolution==
The dissolution of a friendship may be viewed as a personal rejection, or may be the result of natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant both physically and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anger]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the dissolution of a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.<ref name="oxford"/>{{rp|248}}

===Gender differences===
In general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and [[social support|mutual support]], while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on [[social status]], and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Margaret|title=Developmental Psychology: A Student's Handbook|date=2002|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-84169-192-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yLl11fWXr8C|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref>{{rp|320–02}} Females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization.

Males are less likely to make emotional or personal disclosures to other males, because this could potentially be information used against them. They will disclose this to females however (as they are not in competition with them) and males tend to regard friendships with females as more meaningful, intimate and pleasant. Male-male friendships are generally more like alliances while female-female friendships are generally much more attachment based. This also means that the end of male-male friendships tends to be less emotionally upsetting than that of female-female friendships.<ref>Campbell, Anne.

Friendship is found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher [[mammal]]s and some [[bird]]s. Cross-species friendships are common between humans and [[domestic animal]]s. Cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s.
