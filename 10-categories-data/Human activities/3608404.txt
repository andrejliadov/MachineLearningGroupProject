'''Corruption''' is a form of [[dishonesty]] or [[criminal offense]] undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, to acquire illicit benefit or abuse power for one's private gain. Corruption may include many activities including [[bribery]] and [[embezzlement]], though it may also involve practices that are legal in many countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|title=Report|website=siteresources.worldbank.org|access-date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505185227/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|archive-date=5 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Political corruption]] occurs when an office-holder or other governmental employee acts in an official capacity for personal gain. Corruption is most commonplace in [[Kleptocracy|kleptocracies]], [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], [[narco-state]]s and [[mafia state]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Corruption {{!}} Peer Reviewed Journals|url=https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/corruption-24499.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.longdom.org}}</ref>

Corruption and crime are endemic sociological occurrences which appear with regular frequency in virtually all countries on a global scale in varying degree and proportion. Individual nations each allocate domestic resources for the control and regulation of corruption and crime. Strategies to counter corruption are often summarized under the umbrella term [[anti-corruption]]. Additionally, global initiative like the United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 16]] also has a target to substantially reduce corruption of all forms.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Doss|first=Eric|title=Sustainable Development Goal 16|url=https://www.un.org/ruleoflaw/sdg-16/|access-date=2020-09-25|website=United Nations and the Rule of Law|language=en-US}}</ref>

Stephen D. Morris,<ref>Morris, S.D. (1991), Corruption and Politics in Contemporary Mexico. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa</ref> a professor of politics, wrote that [[Politics|politic]]al corruption is the illegitimate use of public power to benefit a private interest. Economist Ian Senior defined corruption as an action to  secretly provide a good or a service to a third party  so that he or she can influence certain actions which  benefit the corrupt, a third party, or both  in which the corrupt agent has authority.<ref>Senior, I.

Corruption can occur on different scales. Corruption ranges from small favors between a small number of people (petty corruption),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Kimberly Ann|date=1997|title=Corruption as an international policy problem: overview and recommendations|url=https://piie.com/publications/chapters_preview/12/10ie2334.pdf|journal=Washington, DC: Institute for International Economics}}</ref> to corruption that affects the government on a large scale (grand corruption), and corruption that is so prevalent that it is part of the everyday structure of society, including corruption as one of the symptoms of organized crime.

A number of indicators and tools have been developed which can measure different forms of corruption with increasing accuracy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf|title=Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand?

=== Petty corruption ===
'''Petty corruption''' occurs at a smaller scale and takes place at the implementation end of public services when public officials meet the public. For example, in many small places such as registration offices, police stations, state licensing boards,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mishler v. State Bd. of Med. Examiners|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/nevada/supreme-court/1993/22397-1.html|website=Justia Law|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-534_19m2.pdf|title=Report|website=supremecourt.org}}</ref> and many other private and government sectors.

===Grand corruption===
'''Grand corruption''' is defined as corruption occurring at the highest levels of government in a way that requires significant subversion of the political, legal and economic systems. Such corruption is commonly found in countries with authoritarian or dictatorial governments but also in those without adequate policing of corruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/NGO/Grand_Corruption_definition_with_explanation_19_August_2016_002_1.pdf|title=Material on Grand corruption|website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}</ref>

The government system in many countries is divided into the legislative, [[Executive (government)|executive]] and judicial branches in an attempt to provide independent services that are less subject to grand corruption due to their independence from one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|title=Political And Judicial Checks on Corruption: Evidence From American State Governments|last=Alt|first=James|website=Projects at Harvard|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203043655/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/gov2126/files/altlassen.pdf|archive-date=3 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Systemic corruption===
'''Systemic corruption''' (or endemic corruption)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/glossary/|title=Glossary|publisher=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre|accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> is corruption which is primarily due to the weaknesses of an organization or process. It can be contrasted with individual officials or agents who act corruptly within the system.

Factors which encourage systemic corruption include [[conflict of interest|conflicting incentives]], [[discretion|discretionary powers]]; [[monopoly|monopolistic powers]]; lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]]; low pay; and a culture of [[impunity]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Diagnosis corruption| pages=135–136 |author=Lorena Alcazar, Raul Andrade |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-931003-11-7 }}</ref> Specific acts of corruption include "bribery, extortion, and embezzlement" in a system where "corruption becomes the rule rather than the exception."<ref>{{cite book|last=Znoj|first=Heinzpeter|editor=Monique Nuijten, Gerhard Anders|title=Corruption and the secret of law: a legal anthropological perspective|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P52bOZFExesC&pg=PA53|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7682-9|pages=53–54|chapter=Deep Corruption in Indonesia: Discourses, Practices, Histories}}</ref> Scholars distinguish between centralized and decentralized systemic corruption, depending on which level of state or government corruption takes place; in countries such as the [[Post-Soviet states]] both types occur.<ref>{{cite book|last=Legvold|first=Robert|editor=Robert I.

Some scholars argue that there is a negative duty{{clarify|reason=change wording. Does this mean Western governments should NOT protect... in order that the undeveloped country develop its own?

Corruption has been a major issue in China, where society depends heavily on personal relationships. By the late 20th century that combined with the new lust for wealth, produced escalating corruption. Historian Keith Schoppa says that bribery was only one of the tools of Chinese corruption, which also included, "embezzlement, nepotism, smuggling, extortion, cronyism, kickbacks, deception, fraud, squandering public monies, illegal business transactions, stock manipulation and real estate fraud." Given the repeated anti-corruption campaigns it was a prudent precaution to move as much of the fraudulent money as possible overseas.<ref>R. Keith Schoppa, ''Revolution and Its Past: Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History'' (3rd ed.  2020) p . 383.</ref>

== Causes{{anchor|Causes_of_corruption}} ==
Per [[Robert Klitgaard|R. Klitgaard]]<ref>[[Robert Klitgaard|Klitgaard, Robert]] (1998), Controlling Corruption, University of California Press, Berkeley, CA</ref> corruption will occur if the corrupt gain is greater than the penalty multiplied by the likelihood of being caught and prosecuted:

Corrupt gain > Penalty × Likelihood of being caught and prosecuted

Klitgaard has also coined a metaphorical formula to illustrate how the amount of corruption depends on three variables: 
[[monopoly]] (M) on the supply of a good or service, the [[discretion]] (D) enjoyed by suppliers, and the supplier's accountability and transparency (A) to others. The amount of corruption (C) could be expressed as:<ref name="klitgaard">{{Cite book |title=Corrupt cities : a practical guide to cure and prevention |last=Klitgaard, Robert E. |date=2000 |publisher=ICS Press |isbn=0-585-26666-2 |location=Oakland, Calif. |oclc=45728341}}</ref>{{rp|26}}

C = M  +  D  –  A.

Since a high degree of monopoly and discretion accompanied by a low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption, a fourth variable of "morality" or "integrity" has been introduced by others. The moral dimension has an intrinsic component and refers to a "mentality problem", and an extrinsic component referring to circumstances like poverty, inadequate remuneration, inappropriate work conditions and inoperable or over-complicated procedures which demoralize people and let them search for "alternative" solutions.<ref name=constantin>Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, MV Wissenschaft, Muenster, 3rd edition 2012, pp. 26–28, {{ISBN|978-3-86582-452-3}}</ref> Hence the amended Klitgaard equation is

Degree of corruption = Monopoly + Discretion – Transparency – Morality

According to a 2017 survey study, the following factors have been attributed as causes of corruption:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dimant|first1=Eugen|last2=Tosato|first2=Guglielmo|date=1 January 2017|title=Causes and Effects of Corruption: What Has Past Decade's Empirical Research Taught Us? a Survey|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=32|issue=2|language=en|pages=335–356|doi=10.1111/joes.12198|s2cid=3531803|issn=1467-6419}}</ref>

It has been noted that in a comparison of the most corrupt with the least corrupt countries, the former group contains nations with huge socio-economic inequalities, and the latter contains nations with a high degree of social and economic justice.<ref>[https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-root-cause-of-corruption/article26038081.ece ''The root cause of corruption'' Tabish Khair]</ref>

==In different sectors==
Corruption can occur in many sectors, whether they be public or private industry or even [[NGOs]] (especially in public sector). However, only in democratically controlled institutions is there an interest of the public (owner) to develop internal mechanisms to fight active or passive corruption, whereas in private industry as well as in NGOs there is no public control. Therefore, the owners' investors' or sponsors' profits are largely decisive.

===Government/public sector===
{{anchor|Government/Public corruption}}

Public corruption includes corruption of the political process and of government agencies such as the police as well as corruption in processes of allocating public funds for contracts, grants, and hiring. Recent research by the World Bank suggests that who makes policy decisions (elected officials or bureaucrats) can be critical in determining the level of corruption because of the incentives different policy-makers face.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Alexander|year=2013|title=Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf|website= World Bank}}</ref>

Political corruption is the abuse of public power, office, or resources by elected government officials for personal gain, by extortion, soliciting or offering bribes. It can also take the form of office holders maintaining themselves in office by purchasing votes by enacting laws which use taxpayers' money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.mo.gov/archives/pubs/article/article.asp |title=SOS, Missouri – State Archives Publications |publisher=Sos.mo.gov |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref> Evidence suggests that corruption can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country or region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|website=Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14|access-date=30 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003707/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The political act of '''graft''' (American English), is a well known and now global form of political corruption, being the unscrupulous and illegal use of a politician's authority for personal gain, when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected in order to maximize the benefits to illegally private interests of the corrupted individual(s) and their cronies. In some cases government institutions are "repurposed" or shifted away from their official mandate to serve other, often corrupt purposes.<ref>Chipkin, Ivor and Swilling, Mark, 2018, Shadow State: the Politics of State Capture, Johannesburg: Wits University Press</ref> See too [[State Capture]]. 

[[File:"Golden toilet" in ((Kaunas)), ((Lithuania)).png|thumb|250px|right|The Kaunas "Golden Toilet".]]

The [[Corruption in Lithuania#Kaunas golden toilet case|Kaunas golden toilet case]] was a major Lithuanian scandal. In 2009, the municipality of Kaunas (led by mayor Andrius Kupčinskas) ordered that a shipping container was to be converted into an outdoor toilet at a cost of 500,000 [[litas|litai]] (around 150,000 euros). It was to also require 5,000 litai (1,500 euros) in monthly maintenance costs.<ref name="archive.org5">{{cite web|url=https://www.delfi.lt/news/daily/lithuania/auksinis-tualetas-per-menesi-atsieis-5-tukst-lt.d?id=59903123|title="Auksinis" tualetas per mėnesį atsieis 5 tūkst.

The city was also called a haven for trade-based [[money laundering]], has it gives space to free trade zones, with minimal regulatory laws and customs enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/07/07/dubai-s-role-in-facilitating-corruption-and-global-illicit-financial-flows-pub-82180|title=Dubai's Role in Facilitating Corruption and Global Illicit Financial Flows|accessdate=7 July 2020|website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}</ref>

====Within the police====
{{main|Police corruption}}
Police corruption is a specific form of [[police misconduct]] designed to obtain financial benefits, personal gain, career advancement for a police officer or officers in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing an investigation or arrest or aspects of the "[[thin blue line]]" itself where force members collude in lies to protect other members from accountability. One common form of police corruption is soliciting or accepting [[bribe]]s in exchange for not reporting organized drug or [[prostitution]] rings or other illegal activities.

Another example is police officers flouting the police [[code of conduct]] in order to secure convictions of suspects—for example, through the use of [[surveillance abuse]], [[forced confessions]] and/or [[falsified evidence]]. More rarely, police officers may deliberately and systematically participate in [[organized crime]] themselves. In most major cities, there are [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] sections to investigate suspected police corruption or misconduct. Similar entities include the British [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]].

====In the judicial system{{anchor|Judicial_corruption}}====
[[File:Mau Juiz, pormenor2 (cropped).png|300px|thumb|right|In the Renaissance fresco ''[[Allegory of the Good and Bad Judge|The Good and the Bad Judge]]'' ([[Monsaraz]], [[Portugal]]), the Bad Judge, depicted as having [[Hypocrisy|two faces]], is shown taking bribes: the [[Fidalgo|nobleman]] to the right offers him gold coins from a purse, and the [[villein]] to the left gives him a pair of [[partridge]]s.]]
Judicial corruption refers to corruption-related [[judicial misconduct|misconduct of judges]], through receiving or giving bribes, improper sentencing of convicted criminals, bias in the hearing and judgement of arguments and other such misconduct. Judicial corruption can also be conducted by prosecutors and defense attorneys. An example of [[prosecutorial misconduct]], would be a [[politician]] or a [[crime boss]] bribing a prosecutor to open investigations and file charges against an opposing politician or a rival crime boss, in order to hurt the competition.<ref>https://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/corruption</ref> An example of [[attorney misconduct]], would be a defense attorney refusing to represent a client for [[Politics|political]] or professional motives.<ref>https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/attorney-misconduct/</ref>

Governmental corruption of judiciary is broadly known in many transitional and [[developing countries]] because the [[budget]] is almost completely controlled by the executive. The latter undermines the separation of powers, as it creates a critical financial dependence of the judiciary. The proper national wealth distribution including the government spending on the judiciary is subject to the [[constitutional economics]].

It is important to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the government (through budget planning and various privileges), and the private.<ref>{{cite book |first= Peter |last=Barenboim |title= Defining the rules |publisher= The European Lawyer |volume= Issue 90 |date=October 2009}}</ref> Judicial corruption can be difficult to completely eradicate, even in developed countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pahis|first1=Stratos|title=Corruption in Our Courts: What It Looks Like and Where It Is Hidden|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=2009|volume=118|accessdate=1 August 2015|url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/corruption-in-our-courts-what-it-looks-like-and-where-it-is-hidden}}</ref>
Corruption in judiciary also involves the government in power using the judicial arm of government to oppress the opposition parties in the detriments of the state.

====Within the military====
Military corruption refers to the abuse of power by members in the armed forces, in order for career advancement or for personal gain by a soldier or soldiers. One form of military corruption in the [[United States Armed Forces]], is a military soldier being promoted in [[Military rank|rank]] or being given better treatment then their colleagues by their officers, due to their [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]], [[Sexual orientation in the United States military|sexual orientation]], [[Ethnic groups in the United States|ethnicity]], [[Gender inequality in the United States|gender]], [[Religion in the United States|religious beliefs]], [[Social class in the United States|social class]] or [[Cronyism|personal relationships]] with higher ranking officers in spite of their merit.<ref>https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-military-discrimination</ref> In addition to that, the US military has also had many instances of officers [[Sexual assault in the United States military|sexually assaulting fellow officers]] and in many cases, there were allegations that many of the attacks were covered up and victims were coerced to remain silent by officers of the same rank or of higher rank.<ref>http://www.ncpolicywatch.com/2020/07/29/metoo-movement-exposes-failure-of-u-s-military-to-take-seriously-sexual-assault/</ref> Another example of military corruption, is a military officer or officers using the power of their positions to commit activities that are illegal, such as skimming logistical supplies such as food, medicine, fuel, body armor or weapons to sell on the local [[black market]].<ref>https://publicintegrity.org/national-security/u-s-military-personnel-have-been-convicted-of-50-million-worth-of-crimes-in-iraq-and-afghanistan/</ref><ref>https://www.thebalancecareers.com/gang-activity-in-the-u-s-military-3354199</ref> There have also been instances of military officials, providing equipment and combat support to [[Organized crime|criminal syndicates]], [[private military companies]] and [[Terrorism|terrorist groups]], without approval from their superiors.<ref>https://fas.org/irp/threat/pub45270chap3.html</ref> As a result, many countries have a [[Military police|military police force]] to ensure that the military officers follow the laws and conduct of their respective countries but sometimes the military police have levels of corruption themselves.<ref>https://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/publications/core_factors.pdf</ref>

===In healthcare===
Corruption, the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, as defined by [[Transparency International]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.transparency.org/what-is-corruption |title=Transparency International – What is Corruption? |date=n.d. |website=www.transparency.org |access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref> is systemic in the health sector. 
The characteristics of health systems with their concentrated supply of a service, high discretionary power of its members controlling the supply, and low accountability to others are the exact constellation of the variables described by Klitgaard, on which corruption depends.<ref name="klitgaard"/>{{rp|26}}

Corruption in health care is more dangerous than in any other sector, because it affects health outcomes and is literally deadly.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/governance/brief/anti-corruption |title=Combating Corruption |date=4 October 2018 |website=World Bank |language=en |access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref> It is widespread and yet, little has been published in medical journals about this topic and as of 2019 there is no evidence on what might reduce corruption in the health sector.<ref name="lancet">{{Cite journal |last=García |first=Patricia J. |date=7 December 2019 |title=Corruption in global health: the open secret |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32527-9/abstract |journal=The Lancet |language=English |volume=394 |issue=10214 |pages=2119–2124 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(19)32527-9 |issn=0140-6736 |pmid=31785827|doi-access=free }}</ref> Corruption occurs within the private and public health sectors and may appear as theft, embezzlement, nepotism, bribery up til extortion, or as undue influence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Taryn Vian and Carin Norberg |date=2008 |title=Corruption in the Health Sector |url=https://www.u4.no/publications/corruption-in-the-health-sector-2/ |publisher=Bergen: Chr.

In 2019, Transparency International has described the 6 most common ways of service corruption as follows: [[absenteeism]], informal payments from patients, embezzlement, inflating services and the costs of services, favouritism and manipulation of data (billing for goods and services that were never sent or done).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ti-health.org/content/the-ignored-pandemic/ |title=The Ignored Pandemic |date=19 March 2019 |website=Transparency International Health Initiative |language=en-US |access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref>

In [[criminology]], '''[[corporate crime]]''' refers to crimes committed either by a [[corporation]] (i.e., a [[business entity]] having a separate legal personality from the [[natural person]]s that manage its activities), or by individuals acting on behalf of a corporation or other business entity (see [[vicarious liability (criminal)|vicarious liability]] and [[corporate liability]]). Some negative behaviours by corporations may not be criminal; laws vary between jurisdictions. For example, some jurisdictions allow [[insider trading]].

===Within labor unions===
The Teamsters ([[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]]) is an example of how the civil [[RICO]] process can be used. For decades, the Teamsters had been substantially controlled by [[La Cosa Nostra]]. Since 1957, four of eight Teamster presidents were indicted, yet the union continued to be controlled by organized crime elements. The federal government has been successful at removing the criminal influence from this 1.4 million-member union by using the civil process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI – Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=24 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524172413/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=24 May 2014 }}</ref>

===In religion===
{{Main|Simony|Cardinal-nephew|Benefice#Pluralism|Mental reservation|Casuistry#Early modern times|Detraction#Controversies involving detraction}}
{{wikiquote|Corruption in religion}}
The history of religion includes numerous examples of religious leaders calling attention to corruption in the religious practices and institutions of their time. Jewish prophets [[Isaiah]] and [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] berate the rabbinical establishment of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Ancient Judea]] for failing to live up to the ideals of the [[Torah]].<ref>[[Isaiah]] 1:2–31, [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]] 5:21–24.</ref> In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] accuses the rabbinical establishment of his time of hypocritically following only the ceremonial parts of the Torah and neglecting the more important elements of justice, mercy and faithfulness.<ref>[[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 23:13–33.</ref> Corruption was one of the important issues during the [[Investiture Controversy]]. In 1517, [[Martin Luther]] accuses the [[Catholic Church]] of widespread corruption, including selling of [[w:Indulgence|indulgences]].<ref>See ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]''.</ref>

In 2015, [[Princeton University]] professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]] advances the thesis that business leaders in the 1930s and 1940s collaborated with clergymen, including [[James W. Fifield Jr.]], to develop and promote a new [[hermeneutical]] approach to Scripture that would de-emphasize the [[social Gospel]] and emphasize themes, such as [[individual salvation]], more congenial to [[free enterprise]].<ref>[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 7.</ref>

::Business leaders, of course, had long been working to "[[w:Merchandising|merchandise]]" themselves through the appropriation of religion. In organizations such as [[w:James W. Fifield Jr.#Spiritual Mobilization|Spiritual Mobilization]], the prayer breakfast groups, and the [[w:Freedoms Foundation|Freedoms Foundation]], they had linked [[capitalism]] and [[Christianity]] and, at the same time, likened the welfare state to godless paganism.<ref>[[Kevin M. Kruse]], ''One Nation Under God: How Corporate America Invented Christian America'' (2015), p. 86.</ref>

===In philosophy===
19th-century German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] acknowledged that academics, including philosophers, are subject to the same sources of corruption as the society they inhabit. He distinguished the corrupt "university" philosophers, whose "real concern is to earn with credit an honest livelihood for themselves and ... to enjoy a certain prestige in the eyes of the public"<ref>[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], "On Philosophy in the Universities", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E. Payne, trans. (1974) Vol. 1, p. 141.</ref> from the genuine philosopher, whose sole motive is to discover and bear witness to the truth.

::To be a philosopher, that is to say, a lover of wisdom (for wisdom is nothing but truth), it is not enough for a man to love truth, in so far as it is compatible with his own interest, with the will of his superiors, with the dogmas of the church, or with the prejudices and tastes of his contemporaries; so long as he rests content with this position, he is only a φίλαυτος [lover of self], not a φιλόσοφος [lover of wisdom]. For this title of honor is well and wisely conceived precisely by its stating that one should love the truth earnestly and with one’s whole heart, and thus unconditionally and unreservedly, above all else, and, if need be, in defiance of all else. Now the reason for this is the one previously stated that the intellect has become free, and in this state, it does not even know or understand any other interest than that of truth.<ref>[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], "Sketch for a history of the doctrine of the ideal and the real", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', E.

===Arms for cash===
{{Globalize|section|date=January 2018}}
{{Expert needed|2=section|date=January 2018}}

"Arms for cash" can be done by either a state-sanctioned arms dealer, firm or state itself to another party it just regards as only a good business partner and not political kindred or allies, thus making them no better than [[Arms trafficking|regular gun runners]]. Arms smugglers, who are already into [[arms trafficking]] may work for them on the ground or with shipment. The [[money laundering|money is often laundered]] and records are often destroyed.

===Bribery===
{{main|Bribery}}
[[File:ElectionLeafletwithMoney.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An election leaflet with money stapled to it.]]
Bribery involves the improper use of gifts and favours in exchange for personal gain. This is also known as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] or, in the Middle East, as [[baksheesh]]. It is a common form of corruption. The types of favors given are diverse and may include [[money]], [[gifts]], [[Promotion (rank)|promotions]], [[sexual favors]], [[company shares]], [[entertainment]], [[employment]] and political benefits. The personal gain that is given can be anything from actively giving preferential treatment to having an indiscretion or crime overlooked.<ref>

Bribery can sometimes form a part of the systemic use of corruption for other ends, for example to perpetrate further corruption. Bribery can make officials more susceptible to blackmail or to extortion.

===Embezzlement, theft and fraud===
{{main|Embezzlement}}
[[Embezzlement]] and [[theft]] involve someone with access to funds or assets illegally taking control of them. [[Fraud]] involves using deception to convince the owner of funds or assets to give them up to an unauthorized party.

Examples include the misdirection of company funds into "shadow companies" (and then into the pockets of corrupt employees), the skimming of [[foreign aid]] money, scams, [[electoral fraud]] and other corrupt activity.

===Graft===
{{main|Graft (politics)}}
The political act of '''graft''' is when funds intended for public projects are intentionally misdirected to maximize the benefits to private interests of the corrupt individuals.

===Extortion and blackmail===
{{main|Extortion}}
While [[bribery]] is the use of positive inducements for corrupt aims, [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]] centre around the use of threats. This can be the threat of [[physical violence]] or [[false imprisonment]] as well as exposure of an individual's secrets or prior crimes.

This includes such behavior as an influential person threatening to go to the media if they do not receive speedy medical treatment (at the expense of other patients), threatening a public official with exposure of their secrets if they do not vote in a particular manner, or demanding money in exchange for continued secrecy. Another example can be a police officer being [[Threat|threatened]] with the loss of their job by their superiors, if they continued with investigating a high-ranking official.

===Influence peddling===
[[Influence peddling]] is the illegal practice of using one's influence in government or connections with persons in authority to obtain favors or preferential treatment, usually in return for payment.

===Networking===
{{main|Business networking}}
Networking (both [[Business networking|Business]] and [[Personal Network|Personal]]) can be an effective way for job-seekers to gain a competitive edge over others in the job-market. The idea is to cultivate personal relationships with prospective employers, selection panelists, and others, in the hope that these personal affections will influence future hiring decisions. This form of networking has been described as an attempt to corrupt formal hiring processes, where all candidates are given an equal opportunity to demonstrate their merits to selectors. The networker is accused of seeking non-meritocratic advantage over other candidates; advantage that is based on personal fondness rather than on any objective appraisal of which candidate is most qualified for the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|title=Just what are you trying to pull?|date=30 September 2013|access-date=12 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009201017/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/just-what-are-you-trying-to-pull-20130928-2ul2m.html|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Networking, Corruption, and Subversion|first=Ned|last=Dobos|date=14 September 2015|journal=J Bus Ethics|volume = 144|issue=3|pages=467–478|doi=10.1007/s10551-015-2853-4|s2cid=142568212}}</ref>

===Abuse of discretion===
{{main|Abuse of discretion}}
[[Abuse of discretion]] refers to the misuse of one's powers and [[decision-making]] facilities. Examples include a judge improperly dismissing a criminal case or a customs official using their discretion to allow a banned substance through a port.

===Favoritism, nepotism and clientelism===
{{main|Nepotism}}
[[Cronyism|Favouritism]], [[nepotism]] and [[clientelism]] involve the favouring of not the perpetrator of corruption but someone related to them, such as a friend, family member or member of an association. Examples would include hiring or promoting a family member or staff member to a role they are not qualified for, who belongs to the same political party as you, regardless of merit.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/government-ethics/resources/what-is-government-ethics/favoritism-cronyism-and-nepotism/|title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism|work=Santa Clara|access-date=28 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Some states do not forbid these forms of corruption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Relationship to economic growth ==
Corruption is strongly negatively associated with the share of private investment and, hence, it lowers the rate of economic growth.<ref name=":0">Mo, P.H. (2001). Corruption and Economic Growth. ''Journal of Comparative Economics, 29'', 66–79.</ref>

Corruption reduces the returns of productive activities. If the returns to production fall faster than the returns to corruption and rent-seeking activities, resources will flow from productive activities to corruption activities over time. This will result in a lower stock of producible inputs like human capital in corrupted countries.<ref name=":0" />

Corruption creates the opportunity for increased inequality, reduces the return of productive activities, and, hence, makes rentseeking and corruption activities more attractive. This opportunity for increased inequality not only generates psychological frustration to the underprivileged but also reduces productivity growth, investment, and job opportunities.<ref name=":0" />

== Prevention==

According to the amended Klitgaard equation,<ref name=constantin/> limitation of monopoly and regulator discretion of individuals and a high degree of transparency through independent oversight by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the media plus public access to reliable information could reduce the problem. Djankov and other researchers<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Corruption in Developing Countries|journal=Annual Review of Economics|volume=4|pages=479–509|doi = 10.1146/annurev-economics-080511-110917|year = 2012|last1 = Olken|first1 = Benjamin A|last2=Pande|first2=Rohini|hdl=1721.1/73081|s2cid=16399354|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/73081/1/Olken_Corruption%20in.pdf}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> have independently addressed the role information plays in fighting corruption with evidence from both developing and developed countries. Disclosing financial information of government officials to the public is associated with improving institutional accountability and eliminating misbehavior such as vote buying. The effect is specifically remarkable when the disclosures concern politicians' income sources, liabilities and asset level instead of just income level. Any extrinsic aspects that might reduce morality should be eliminated. Additionally, a country should establish a culture of ethical conduct in society with the government setting the good example in order to enhance the intrinsic morality.

In 1969,{{efn|In 1962, a letter writing campaign attempted but ultimately failed to prevent the construction of the [[Watergate complex#Approval controversies|Watergate complex]] on the grounds that zoning waivers would not have been given had the Vatican not been a major investor.}} Christian anarchist [[Dorothy Day]] argued that God will resolve economic abuses such as corruption. She wrote,<ref>"Hutterite Communities," ''Catholic Worker'' (July–August 1969)</ref>{{quote|Fortunately, the [[Papal States]] were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have good will and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us.}}

===Enhancing civil society participation ===
Creating bottom-up mechanisms, promoting citizens participation and encouraging the values of integrity, accountability, and transparency are crucial components of fighting corruption. As of 2012, the implementation of the "Advocacy and Legal Advice Centres (ALACs)” in Europe had led to a significant increase in the number of citizen complaints against acts of corruption received and documented<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00460|title=Increase in the number of civil complaints against acts of corruption.

[[File:UNCAC 1.png|thumb|[[United Nations Convention against Corruption]]]]
The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA, USA 1977) was an early paradigmatic law for many western countries i.e. industrial countries of the [[OECD]]. There, for the first time the old principal-agent approach was moved back where mainly the victim (a society, private or public) and a passive corrupt member (an individual) were considered, whereas the active corrupt part was not in the focus of legal prosecution. Unprecedented, the law of an industrial country directly condemned active corruption, particularly in international business transactions, which was at that time in contradiction to anti-bribery activities of the World Bank and its spin-off organization [[Transparency International]].

As early as 1989 the OECD had established an ad hoc Working Group in order to explore "...the concepts fundamental to the offense of corruption, and the exercise of national jurisdiction over offenses committed wholly or partially abroad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf|title=IMF on OECD Convention, (page 3) Historical Background and Context|website=imf.org}}</ref>
Based on the FCPA concept, the Working Group presented in 1994 the then "OECD Anti-Bribery Recommendation" as precursor for the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm|title=OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Bearer of Transactions|website=oecd.org}}</ref> which was signed in 1997 by all member countries and came finally into force in 1999. However, because of ongoing concealed corruption in international transactions several instruments of Country Monitoring<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|website=oecd.org}}</ref> have been developed since then by the OECD in order to foster and evaluate related national activities in combating foreign corrupt practices. One survey shows that after the implementation of heightened review of multinational firms under the convention in 2010 firms from countries that had signed the convention were less likely to use bribery.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Nathan M.|last2=Malesky|first2=Edmund J.|title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|journal=International Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=33–69|doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|language=en|issn=0020-8183|year=2017}}</ref>

In 2013, a document<ref name="partnerplatform">{{cite web|url=http://partnerplatform.org/?7vz3z60x |title=Forgues-Puccio, G.F. April 2013, Existing practices on anti-corruption, Economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services helpdesk request |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> produced by the economic and private sector professional evidence and applied knowledge services help-desk discusses some of the existing practices on anti-corruption. They found:
* The theories behind the fight against corruption are moving from a [[Principal agent problem|Principal agent approach]] to a [[collective action problem]]. [[Principal-agent]] theories seem not to be suitable to target systemic corruption.
* The role of multilateral institutions has been crucial in the fight against corruption. [[UNCAC]] provides a common guideline for countries around the world. Both [[Transparency International]] and the [[World Bank]] provide assistance to national governments in term of diagnostic and design of anti-corruption policies.
* The use of anti-corruption agencies have proliferated in recent years after the signing of [[UNCAC]]. They found no convincing evidence on the extent of their contribution, or the best way to structure them.
* Traditionally anti-corruption policies have been based on success experiences and common sense. In recent years there has been an effort to provide a more systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of anti-corruption policies. They found that this literature is still in its infancy.
* Anti-corruption policies that may be in general recommended to developing countries may not be suitable for post-conflict countries. Anti-corruption policies in fragile states have to be carefully tailored.
* Anti-corruption policies can improve the business environment. There is evidence that lower corruption may facilitate doing business and improve firm's productivity. [[Rwanda]] in the last decade has made tremendous progress in improving governance and the business environment providing a model to follow for post-conflict countries.<ref name="partnerplatform" />

==Legal corruption==
Though corruption is often viewed as illegal, a concept of legal corruption has been described by [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]] and Pedro Vicente.<ref name="Legal Corruption"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website= Economics and Politics, v23 |pages= 195–219}}</ref> It might be termed as processes which are corrupt, but are protected by a legal (that is, specifically permitted, or at least not proscribed by law) framework.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|first2=Pedro|last2=Vicente|year=2011|url=http://www.pedrovicente.org/legal.pdf|title=Legal Corruption (revised)|website=Economics and Politics, v23|page=195}}</ref>

=== Examples===
In 1994, the German Parliamentary Financial Commission in Bonn presented a comparative study on "legal corruption" in industrialized OECD countries<ref name=study>{{cite web|url=http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf|title=Drucksache 12/8468|website= Bonn Parliament records|date=8 September 1994|pages= 4–6}}</ref> They reported that in most industrial countries foreign corruption was legal, and that their foreign corrupt practices ranged from simple , through governmental subsidization (tax deduction), up to extreme cases as in Germany, where foreign corruption was fostered, whereas domestic was legally prosecuted.
The German Parliamentary Financial Commission rejected a Parliamentary Proposal by the opposition, which had been aiming to limit German foreign corruption on the basis of the US ''[[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]'' (FCPA from 1977), thus fostering national export corporations.<ref>[http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf Drucksache 12/8468:] "Die Ablehnung erfolgte mit den Stimmen der Koalitionsfraktionen gegen die Stimmen der Fraktion der SPD bei Abwesenheit der Gruppen BÜNDNIS 90/DIE GRÜNEN und der PDS/Linke Liste."</ref> In 1997 a corresponding [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] was signed by its members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf |title=Report |website= oecd.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/2406452.pdf|title= Report |website=oecd.org}}</ref>
It took until 1999, after the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention came into force, that Germany withdrew the legalization of foreign corruption.<ref>§ 4 chapter 5 no. 10 Income Tax Act, valid until 19 March 1999</ref>

====Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 study====
The Foreign corrupt practices of industrialized OECD countries 1994 (Parliamentary Financial Commission study, Bonn).<ref name=study />

Belgium: bribe payments are generally tax deductible as business expenses if the name and address of the beneficiary is disclosed. Under the following conditions kickbacks in connection with exports abroad are permitted for deduction even without proof of the receiver:
* Payments must be necessary in order to be able to survive against foreign competition
* They must be common in the industry
* A corresponding application must be made to the Treasury each year
* Payments must be appropriate
* The payer has to pay a lump-sum to the tax office to be fixed by the Finance Minister (at least 20% of the amount paid).
In the absence of the required conditions, for corporate taxable companies paying bribes without proof of the receiver, a special tax of 200% is charged. This special tax may, however, be abated along with the bribe amount as an operating expense.

Denmark: bribe payments are deductible when a clear operational context exists and its adequacy is maintained.

France: basically all operating expenses can be deducted. However, staff costs must correspond to an actual work done and must not be excessive compared to the operational significance. This also applies to payments to foreign parties. Here, the receiver shall specify the name and address, unless the total amount in payments per beneficiary does not exceed 500 FF. If the receiver is not disclosed the payments are considered "rémunérations occult" and are associated with the following disadvantages:
* The business expense deduction (of the bribe money) is eliminated.
* For corporations and other legal entities, a tax penalty of 100% of the "rémunérations occult" and 75% for voluntary post declaration is to be paid.
* There may be a general fine of up 200 FF fixed per case.

Japan: in Japan, bribes are deductible as business expenses that are justified by the operation (of the company) if the name and address of the recipient is specified. This also applies to payments to foreigners. If the indication of the name is refused, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses.

Canada: there is no general rule on the deductibility or non-deductibility of kickbacks and bribes. Hence the rule is that necessary expenses for obtaining the income (contract) are deductible. Payments to members of the public service and domestic administration of justice, to officers and employees and those charged with the collection of fees, entrance fees etc. for the purpose to entice the recipient to the violation of his official duties, can not be abated as business expenses as well as illegal payments according to the Criminal Code.

Luxembourg: bribes, justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authorities may require that the payer is to designate the receiver by name. If not, the expenses are not recognized as operating expenses.

Netherlands: all expenses that are directly or closely related to the business are deductible. This also applies to expenditure outside the actual business operations if they are considered beneficial as to the operation for good reasons by the management. What counts is the good merchant custom. Neither the law nor the administration is authorized to determine which expenses are not operationally justified and therefore not deductible. For the business expense deduction it is not a requirement that the recipient is specified. It is sufficient to elucidate to the satisfaction of the tax authorities that the payments are in the interest of the operation.

Austria: bribes justified by the operation (of a company) are deductible as business expenses. However, the tax authority may require that the payer names the recipient of the deducted payments exactly. If the indication of the name is denied e.g. because of business comity, the expenses claimed are not recognized as operating expenses. This principle also applies to payments to foreigners.

Switzerland: bribe payments are tax deductible if it is clearly operation initiated and the consignee is indicated.

US: (rough résumé: "generally operational expenses are deductible if they are not illegal according to the FCPA")

UK: kickbacks and bribes are deductible if they have been paid for operating purposes. The tax authority may request the name and address of the recipient."

===="Specific" legal corruption: exclusively against foreign countries====
Referring to the recommendation of the above-mentioned Parliamentary Financial Commission's study,<ref name=study /> the then Kohl administration (1991–1994) decided to maintain the legality of corruption against officials exclusively in foreign transactions<ref>the term "official" had been limited to German jurisdiction. Officials of other states legally were no "officials". See [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQYc-dAIF0MC&pg=PA109 für Rolf Keller"] Essay in Memory for Rolf Keller, 2003, Edited by Criminal Law professors from the Law Faculty of Tübingen and the Ministry of Justice of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, page 104: "Nach der Legaldefinition des §11 I Nr.2a StGB versteht man unter einem Amtsträger u.&nbsp;a. eine Person, die >>nach deutschem Recht Beamter oder Richter ist. Die Vorschrift enthält also eine vom Wortlaut her eindeutige Einschränkung auf das deutsche Recht. Ausländische Amtsträger werden somit nicht erfasst."</ref> and confirmed the full deductibility of bribe money, co-financing thus a specific nationalistic corruption practice (§4 Abs. 5 Nr. 10 EStG, valid until 19 March 1999) in contradiction to the 1994 OECD recommendation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/investment/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/1952622.pdf|title=OECD: Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions}}</ref> The respective law was not changed before the OECD Convention also in Germany came into force (1999).<ref>Britta Bannenberg, ''Korruption in Deutschland und ihre strafrechtliche Kontrolle'', page VII (Introduction): "Durch die OECD-Konvention und europaweite Abkommen wurden auch in Deutschland neue Anti-Korruptions-Gesetze geschaffen, so dass nun die Auslandsbestechung durch deutsche Unternehmen dem Strafrecht unterfällt und die Bestechungsgelder nicht mehr als Betriebsausgaben von der Steuer abgesetzt werden können."</ref>
According to the Parliamentary Financial Commission's study, however, in 1994 most countries' corruption practices were not nationalistic and much more limited by the respective laws compared to Germany.<ref>Parliamentary Financial Commission's study 1994, pp. 6–7: [http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/btd/12/084/1208468.pdf "Nach Auffassung der Fraktion der SPD belegt auch der Bericht der Bundesregierung eindeutig, daß in den meisten ausländischen Industriestaaten Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder in wesentlich geringerem Umfang als in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland steuerlich abgesetzt werden könnten. So müsse in fast allen Staaten bei Zahlungen in das Ausland der Empfänger angegeben werden... Die Abzugsfähigkeit der genannten Ausgaben (Schmier- und Bestechungsgelder) stelle eine steuerliche Subvention dar..."]</ref>

Particularly, the non-disclosure of the bribe money recipients' name in tax declarations had been a powerful instrument for Legal Corruption during the 1990s for German corporations, enabling them to block foreign legal jurisdictions which intended to fight corruption in their countries. Hence, they uncontrolled established a strong network of clientelism around Europe (e.g. SIEMENS)<ref name=blackaccounts>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#67|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}</ref> along with the formation of the [[European Single Market]] in the upcoming [[European Union]] and the [[Eurozone]].
Moreover, in order to further strengthen active corruption the prosecution of tax evasion during that decade had been severely limited. German tax authorities were instructed to refuse any disclosure of bribe recipients' names from tax declarations to the German criminal prosecution.<ref>Transparency International: [http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/ach_das_mit_der_prostitution "Geschützt durch das Steuergeheimnis dürfen die Steuerbehörden Hinweise auf Korruption nicht an die Staatsanwaltschaft melden."]</ref> As a result, German corporations have been systematically increasing their informal economy from 1980 until today up to 350 bn € per annum (see diagram on the right), thus continuously feeding their black money reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/20063/umfrage/entwicklung-des-umfangs-der-schattenwirtschaft-seit-1995|title= Schattenwirtschaft – Umfang in Deutschland bis 2015 – Statistik|website=Statista}}</ref>

=== Siemens corruption case ===
In 2007, [[Siemens]] was convicted in the District Court of [[Darmstadt]] of criminal corruption against the Italian corporation [[Enel Green Power|Enel Power SpA]]. Siemens had paid almost €3.5 million in bribes to be selected for a €200 million project from the Italian corporation, partially owned by the government. The deal was handled through [[black money]] accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] that were established specifically for such purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? – hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}</ref>
Because the crime was committed in 1999, after the OECD convention had come into force, this foreign corrupt practice could be prosecuted. It was the first time a German court of law convicted foreign corrupt practices like a national practice, although the corresponding law did not yet protect foreign competitors in business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/archiv/08-02/index.php?sz=6#62|title=HRRS Februar 2008: Saliger/Gaede – Rückwirkende Ächtung der Auslandskorruption und Untreue als Korruptionsdelikt – Der Fall Siemens als Start-schuss in ein entgrenztes internationalisiertes Wirtschaftsstrafrecht? · hrr-strafrecht.de|website=hrr-strafrecht.de}}</ref>

During the judicial proceedings it was disclosed that numerous such black accounts had been established in the past decades.<ref name=blackaccounts />

== Historical responses in philosophical and religious thought ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=August 2020}}

Philosophers and religious thinkers have responded to the inescapable reality of corruption in different ways. [[Plato]], in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', acknowledges the corrupt nature of political institutions, and recommends that philosophers "shelter behind a wall" to avoid senselessly martyring themselves.

''Disciples of philosophy ... have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is, and have also seen and been satisfied of the madness of the multitude, and known that there is no one who ever acts honestly in the administration of States, nor any helper who will save any one who maintains the cause of the just. Such a savior would be like a man who has fallen among wild beasts—unable to join in the wickedness of his fellows, neither would he be able alone to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and would have to throw away his life before he had done any good to himself or others. And he reflects upon all this, and holds his peace, and does his own business. He is like one who retires under the shelter of a wall in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along; and when he sees the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart in peace and good will, with bright hopes.<ref>Plato, [[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', 496d</ref>''

The [[New Testament]], in keeping with the tradition of Ancient Greek thought, also frankly acknowledges the corruption of the world (ὁ [[wikt:κόσμος|κόσμος]])<ref>2 Peter 1:4, 2:20.</ref> and claims to offer a way of keeping the spirit "unspotted from the world."<ref>James 1:27.</ref> [[Paul of Tarsus]] acknowledges his readers must inevitably "deal with the world,"<ref>1 Cor 7:31.</ref> and recommends they adopt an attitude of "as if not" in all their dealings. When they buy a thing, for example, they should relate to it "as if it were not theirs to keep."<ref>1 Cor 7:30.</ref> New Testament readers are advised to refuse to "conform to the present age"<ref>Romans 12:2.</ref> and not to be ashamed to be peculiar or singular.<ref>1 Peter 2:9.</ref> They are advised not be friends of the corrupt world, because "friendship with the world is enmity with God."<ref>James 4:4.</ref> They are advised not to love the corrupt world or the things of the world.<ref>1 John 2:15.</ref> The rulers of this world, Paul explains, "are coming to nothing"<ref>1 Cor 2:6.</ref> While readers must obey corrupt rulers in order to live in the world,<ref>Romans 13:1.</ref> the spirit is subject to no law but to love God and love our neighbors as ourselves.<ref>Romans 13:8.</ref> New Testament readers are advised to adopt a disposition in which they are "in the world, but not of the world."<ref>Andrew L. Fitz-Gibbon, ''In the World But Not of the World: Christian Social Thinking at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (2000), See also John 15:19.</ref> This disposition, Paul claims, shows us a way to escape "slavery to corruption" and experience the freedom and glory of being innocent "children of God".<ref>Roman 8:21.</ref>
