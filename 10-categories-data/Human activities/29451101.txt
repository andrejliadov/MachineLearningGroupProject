'''Activity-centered design''' ('''ACD''') is an extension of the Human-centered design paradigm in [[interaction design]].<ref>Norman, D. (2015), The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition</ref> ACD features heavier emphasis on the activities that a [[user (system)|user]] would perform with a given piece of technology. ACD has its theoretical underpinnings in [[activity theory]],<ref>Donald, N. (July 01, 2005). Human-centered design considered harmful. ''Interactions, 12.4'', 14-19.</ref> from which activities can be defined as actions taken by a user to achieve a goal.<ref>Kaptelinin V, Nardi B (1997). [http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/tutorial/bn.htm Activity Theory: Basic Concepts and Applications] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330215158/http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/tutorial/bn.htm |date=2012-03-30 }} ''CHI 97 Electronic Publications: Tutorials''.</ref> 

When working with activity-centered design, the designers use [[research]] to get insights of the users. Observations and interviews are typical approaches to learn more about the users' [[behavior]]. By mapping users' activities and tasks, the designer may notice missing tasks for the activity to become more easy to perform, and thus design solutions to accomplish those tasks.
