==Methodology==
Ranks and scores are assigned by weighing various indicators and rewarding or penalizing the city as appropriate.  These indicators are classified into two broad categories: ''Personal Health'', which measures the health habits and outcomes for city residents, including their physical activity, diet, and chronic health problems, and ''Community and Environment'', which includes scores to measure the availability and convenience of local parks, farmers' markets, alternative transportation, and community recreation facilities like pools, tennis courts, and baseball diamonds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanfitnessindex.org/methodology/|title=Methodology|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>
