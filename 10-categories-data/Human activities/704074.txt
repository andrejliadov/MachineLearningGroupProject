The USS ''Arizona'' Memorial is one of several sites in Hawaii that are part of the [[Pearl Harbor National Memorial]].

==Memorial==
[[File:USS Arizona (BB-39) wreck in the 1950s.jpg|thumb|USS ''Arizona'' in the 1950s.]]

===Conception and funding===
During and following the end of World War II, ''Arizona''{{'}}s wrecked [[superstructure]] was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull.

[[Robert Ripley]], of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' fame, visited Pearl Harbor in 1942. Six years later, in 1948, he did a radio broadcast from Pearl Harbor. Following that broadcast, with the help of his longtime friend Doug Storer, he got in contact with the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]. He wrote letters to Rear Admiral [[J.J. Manning]] of the [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] regarding his desire for a permanent memorial.

[[File:Letter from RADM J.J. Manning to Robert Ripley.jpg|thumb|left|A letter RAdm J.J. Manning to Robert Ripley regarding the need for a permanent Pearl Harbor memorial]]

While Ripley's original idea for a memorial was disregarded due to the cost, the Navy continued with the idea of creating a memorial. The [[Pacific War Memorial Commission]] was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], commander of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], attached a flag pole to the main mast of the ''Arizona'' in 1950, and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion of the deckhouse.<ref>''After The Battle'' magazine, Issue 38</ref> Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952, but was denied because of budget constraints during the [[Korean War]].

The Navy placed the first permanent memorial, a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on|0}}-tall basalt stone and plaque, over the mid-ship deckhouse on December 7, 1955.<ref name=Bergman37>Bergman, p. 37.</ref> President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] approved the creation of a National Memorial in 1958. Enabling legislation required the memorial, budgeted at $500,000, be privately financed; however, $200,000 of the memorial cost was government subsidized.

* $150,000 from federal funds in legislation initiated by Hawaii Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] in 1961

During planning stages, the memorial's purpose was the subject of competing visions. Some were eager to keep it a tribute to the sailors of the ''Arizona'', while others expected a dedication to all who died in the Pacific theater.<ref name=Bergman39>{{Cite book |title=Exhibiting Patriotism: Creating and Contesting Interpretations of American Historic Sites |last=Bergman |first=Teresa |year=2013 |publisher=Left Coast Press |isbn=9781598745979 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E98o_LKZy_8C }}</ref> In the end, the legislation authorizing and funding the memorial (HR 44, 1961) declared that the ''Arizona'' would "be maintained in honor and commemoration of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who gave their lives to their country during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941."<ref>{{USPL|87|201}}</ref><ref name=Bergman39/>

===Design===
[[File:USS Arizona Memorial.JPG|thumb|left]]
The national memorial was designed by [[Honolulu]] architect [[Alfred Preis]], who was detained at [[Sand Island (Hawaii)|Sand Island]] at the start of the war as an enemy of the country, because of his Austrian birth.<ref name=Bergman36>Bergman, p. 36.</ref> The [[United States Navy]] specified the memorial be in the form of a bridge floating above the ship and accommodating 200 people.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The {{convert|184|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} structure has two peaks at each end connected by a sag in the center of the structure. Critics initially called the design a "squashed milk carton".<ref name="ShapiroStarBulletin">{{cite web |url= http://starbulletin.com/2002/05/27/news/story4.html |title= Arizona Memorial seen as a dedication to peace |author= Treena Shapiro |work= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date= May 27, 2002 }}</ref>

The architecture of the USS ''Arizona'' Memorial is explained by Preis as, "Wherein the structure sags in the center but stands strong and vigorous at the ends, expresses initial defeat and ultimate victory&nbsp;... The overall effect is one of serenity. Overtones of sadness have been omitted, to permit the individual to contemplate his own personal responses&nbsp;... his innermost feelings."<ref name="HistoryCultureNPS">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/usar/historyculture/index.htm |title=USS Arizona Memorial - History & Culture |website=[[National Park Service]] |date=September 18, 2006}}</ref>

===Description===
[[File:US Navy 021205-N-3228G-003 A participant of the upcoming Dec. 7th USS Arizona commemoration ceremony, scans the 1177 names of Arizona crewmembers on the huge marble wall in the shrine room of the memorial prior to rehearsal.jpg|thumb|"To the Memory of the Gallant Men Here Entombed and their shipmates who gave their lives in action on December 7, 1941, on the U.S.S. Arizona"<br>—&nbsp;inscription in marble with the names of ''Arizona''{{'}}s honored dead]]
The national memorial has three main parts: entry, assembly room, and shrine. The central assembly room features seven large open windows on either wall and ceiling, to commemorate the date of the attack. Rumor says the 21 windows symbolically represents a [[21-gun salute]] or 21&nbsp;[[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] standing at eternal parade rest over the tomb of the fallen, but guides at the site will confirm this was not the architect's intention. The memorial also has an opening in the floor overlooking the sunken decks. It is from this opening that visitors can pay their respects by tossing flowers in honor of the fallen sailors. In the past, [[Lei (garland)|leis]] were tossed in the water, but because string from leis poses a hazard to sea life, leis now are placed on guardrails in front of the names of the fallen.

One of ''Arizona''{{'}}s three {{convert|19585|lb|adj=on}} anchors is displayed at the visitor center's entrance. ([[:File:Arizona anchor bolin plaza.JPG|One of the other two]] is at the Arizona State Capitol in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].) One of the two [[ship's bell]]s is in the visitor center. (Its twin is in the clock tower of the Student Memorial Center at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].)

The shrine at the far end is a marble wall that bears the names of all those killed on ''Arizona'', protected behind velvet ropes. To the left of the main wall is a small plaque which bears the names of thirty or so crew members who survived the 1941 sinking. Any surviving crew members of ''Arizona'' (or their families on their behalf) can have their ashes interred within the wreck by U.S. Navy divers<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pastfoundation.org/Arizona/ArizonaInterments.htm | publisher = USS Arizona Preservation Project 2004 | title = USS Arizona Interments | accessdate = December 5, 2011 | date = December 18, 2007 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120123221922/http://www.pastfoundation.org/Arizona/ArizonaInterments.htm | archive-date = January 23, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===History===
[[File:USS Arizona oil seepage.jpg|thumb|The "tears of the ''Arizona''". Oil slick visible on water's surface above the sunken battleship.]]
The USS ''Arizona'' Memorial was formally dedicated on May 30, 1962 ([[Memorial Day]]) by [[Texas]] Congressman and Chairman of Veteran Affairs [[Olin E. Teague]] and future-[[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]] [[John A. Burns]].

It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966. While the wreck of the ''Arizona'' was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1989, the memorial does not share this status. Rather, it is listed separately from the wreck on the National Register of Historic Places. The joint administration of the memorial by the United States Navy and the National Park Service was established on September 9, 1980.

Oil leaking from the sunken battleship can still be seen rising from the wreckage to the water's surface. This oil is sometimes referred to as "the tears of the ''Arizona''"<ref name="Bendzulla">{{cite web |url= http://www.tearsofthearizona.org/ |title= The Tears of the Arizona |author= Horst Bendzulla |work= Artist's website |accessdate= October 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090511102823/http://www.tearsofthearizona.org/ |archive-date= May 11, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="HansenHanaHou">{{cite web |url= http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&ArticleID=598&MagazineID=38 |title= Little Big Store |author= Christine Hansen |work= [[Hana Hou!]] Vol. 10, No. 4 |date= September–October 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2009}}</ref> or "black tears."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tritten|first=Larry|title='Black Tears' Still Shed For U.S.S.

The Park Service, as part of its Centennial Initiative celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2016, developed a "mobile park" to tour the continental United States to increase exposure of the park. The mobile park also collected oral histories of the attack on Pearl Harbor.<ref>{{cite web | last =Bomar | first =Mary A. | author-link =Mary A.

==USS ''Missouri''==
[[File:Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.JPG|thumb|The {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} and {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} memorials.]]
Upon the deck of the [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} in [[Tokyo Bay]], the Japanese surrendered to United States General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], ending World War&nbsp;II. In 1999, ''Missouri'' was moved to Pearl Harbor from the United States west coast and docked behind, and in line, with USS ''Arizona'', placing it perpendicular to the USS ''Arizona'' Memorial. The pairing of the two ships became an evocative symbol of the beginning and end of the United States' participation in the war.

USS ''Arizona'' Memorial staff initially criticized the placement of ''Missouri'', saying the large battleship would "overshadow" the ''Arizona'' Memorial. To guard against this perception, ''Missouri'' was placed well back of the ''Arizona'' Memorial, and positioned in Pearl Harbor to prevent those participating in military ceremonies on ''Missouri''{{'}}s aft decks from seeing the ''Arizona'' Memorial. The decision to have ''Missouri''{{'}}s [[Bow (ship)|bow]] face the Memorial was intended to convey that ''Missouri'' now watches over the remains of ''Arizona'' so that those interred within ''Arizona''{{'}}s hull may rest in peace. These measures have helped preserve the identities of the ''Arizona'' Memorial and the ''Missouri'' Memorial, thereby improving the public's perception of having ''Arizona'' and ''Missouri'' in the same harbor.<ref name="KakesakoStarBulletin">{{cite web |url= http://starbulletin.com/97/10/15/news/story3.html |title= Will 'Mighty Mo' be too much? |author= Gregg K.

==Visiting the memorial==

The visitor center operated by the [[National Park Service]] is free to the public and has a museum with exhibits about the Pearl Harbor attack, such as the ship's bell from ''Arizona''.

Access to the USS ''Arizona'' Memorial is by U.S. Navy boat, for which a numbered ticket, obtained at the visitor center and valid for a designated departure time, is required. More than one million people visit the memorial each year.<ref name=NPSTwHP /> Because of the large number of visitors and the limited number of boat departures, the 4,500 tickets available each day are often fully allocated by mid-morning.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plan Your Visit (USS ''Arizona'' Memorial) |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=http://www.nps.gov/usar/planyourvisit/index.htm |accessdate=April 4, 2008 }}</ref> Before boarding the boat for the short trip to the Memorial, visitors view a 23-minute documentary film depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor. Touring of the Memorial is self-guided. The National Park Service Web site provides visitor information, including hours of operation and ticketing advisories.

[[File:USSArizona Bridge Bowfin Stadium.jpg|thumb|USS ''Arizona'' and museum (center left) and the [[Admiral Clarey Bridge]]]]

A one-hour audio tour of the Memorial and Center exhibits, narrated by actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], whose father, [[Tony Curtis]] was a [[World War II]] and Navy veteran, is available for rent at the visitor center. On the center's grounds along the shoreline are more exhibits and a "Remembrance Circle". Nearby is {{USS|Bowfin|SS-287|6}}, a World War II diesel [[submarine]], which may be toured with separate, paid admission. The battleship USS ''Missouri'' and the [[Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor]] may also be visited, but require a bus ride to [[Ford Island]].

On May 6, 2018, boat transportation to the memorial was suspended after one of the vessel operators noticed a crack on its outside. Although repairs were made, the cracks reappeared. The memorial was closed on May 26, 2018, and remained closed until fall 2019, when it was announced it will be re-opening to the public on September 1, 2019. However, boat tours around the memorial and the other ships on Battleship Row continue to be made.<ref>{{cite news |title=The USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor will stay closed through fall.

''Arizona'' is no longer in commission, but is an active U.S. military cemetery. As survivors of the attack on ''Arizona'' die, many choose either to have their ashes scattered in the water over the ship, or to have their urns placed within the well of the [[barbette]] of Turret No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=USS Arizona Interments |website=[[World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument]] |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |url=https://www.nps.gov/valr/learn/historyculture/ussarizonainterments.htm}}</ref>  As a special tribute to the ship and her lost crew, the United States flag flies from the flagpole, which is attached to the severed mainmast of the sunken battleship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/ExtendWeb1.html |title=USS Arizona Memorial (National Park Service website) |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>
The USS ''Arizona'' National Memorial was one of the nine major historical sites incorporated into the wide-ranging [[World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument]], established by Congress in 2008 and dedicated on December 7, 2010.<ref name=Bergman36/> The [[John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act]] divided the monument by the three states in which it was located, naming the Hawaii site as [[Pearl Harbor National Memorial]].

Since it was formally dedicated in 1962, every U.S. President has made a pilgrimage to the memorial, presenting a wreath and scattering flowers over ''Arizona'' in honor of the Americans who perished there.<ref>
