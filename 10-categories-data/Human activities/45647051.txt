In the field of ageing studies, '''activist ageing''' refers to activism and research that empowers the elderly. This approach investigates how ageing is imagined (in mostly Western societies), how [[ageism]] operates, and how elders respond to exclusion.<ref>Gullette, M. (2004). Aged by culture.

(2013). “Tactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,” in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson.</ref>

Many elders, and especially women, are involved in organizations that aim to effect social change on issues related to ageing or in general.<ref>Charpentier, Michèle, Anne Quéniart et Julie Jacques (2008). Femmes, militance et vieillissement. Amnis 8 : http://amnis.revues.org/583 ; DOI : 10.4000/amnis.583</ref> Retirement engenders a form of social exclusion. In this context becoming an activist or a volunteer represents one's agency and participation in social change, outside the market system. Instead of assuming a passive role, they act. As [[elder rights]] [[activists]] and members of community organizations, they try to prevent elder abuse, raise awareness, build resources and networks.<ref>Sawchuk, K. (2013). “Tactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,” in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson.</ref> Activist ageing is different from [[active ageing]].

== Ageivism - The Ideology of Activist Ageing ==
For many years the action around rights of older persons and social activism of older adults was not anchored in a unique ideological framework. It is only in recent years that attempts to frame the global elder rights movement within an ideology began to build up. One such an attempt is the development of [http://www.ageivism.org Ageivism] as an ideology of aging. 
Ageivism is defined as follows:
"Ageivism" refers to an ideology which serves as the basis for calls for social action (echoing similar "isms", e.g. feminism, or socialism) on the protection and promotion of the rights of older persons based on the grounds of political, social and economic principles of identity, dignity and social justice.<ref>Doron, I. (2018). Re-thinking old age: Time for Ageivism. ''The Human Rights Defender, 27(1),'' 33-36.</ref> 
 


== Mediatization ==
Canadian governmental services offered through various Internet portals require greater technological skills from the part of elders, who need to comply in order to get information about their rights or specific programs.<ref>Middleton, C. & Sorensen, C. (2005). How connected Are Canadians ? Inequities in Canadian households’ Internet access. Canadian Journal of Communication, 30(4): 463-483.</ref> The development of digital technologies forces activists and community organizations to consider including media in their actions. Many organizations use digital technologies to contact other organizations at a distance, to document their organization's history and actions, and to develop intergenerational ties. Contrary to popular discourses that represent the elderly as passive and dependent, their uses of digital media show their [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and ability to produce media content.<ref>Sawchuk, K. (2013). “Tactical Mediatization and Activist Ageing: pressures, pushbacks and the story of RECAA,” in MediKulture special issue on mediatization edited by Stig Hjarvard and Line Nybro Peterson.</ref> Other kinds of projects also aim to enhance digital literacy among elders, such as the workshops taking place at the Atwater Library in Montreal.<ref>http://digital-literacy.atwaterlibrary.ca/?p=1061&upm_export=pdf</ref>
