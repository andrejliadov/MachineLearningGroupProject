In religious studies, an '''ethnic religion''' is a [[religion]] or [[Belief#Religion|belief]] associated with a particular [[ethnic group]]. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from [[universalizing religion|universal religions]], such as [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]],  which are not limited in ethnic, national or racial scope.<ref name="Hinnells">{{cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-33311-3 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=2009-09-17}}</ref>

== Terminology ==
A number of alternative terms have been used instead of ''ethnic religion''. The term ''primal religion'' was coined by [[Andrew Walls]] in the University of Aberdeen in the 1970s to provide a focus on non-Western forms of religion as found in Africa, Asia, and Oceania.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=James L.|last2=Sutcliffe|first2=Steven J.|date=1 March 2006|title=Religious studies in Scotland: A persistent tension with divinity|journal=Religion|volume=36|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1016/j.religion.2005.12.001|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>Max Assimeng,  "Traditional religion in Ghana: a preliminary guide to research." ''Thought and Practice Journal: The Journal of the Philosophical Association of Kenya'' 3.1 (1976): 65-89.</ref> Terms such as ''primal religion'', ''primitive religion'', and ''tribal religion'' have been contested by Walls' student, Jim Cox, who argues that such terms suggest an undeveloped religion which can be seen as a preparation for conversion to [[Christianity]]. Cox prefers to use the term ''indigenous religion''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Primitive to Indigenous: The Academic Study of Indigenous Religions|last=Cox|first=James L.|publisher=Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-754-65569-5|location=Aldershot|pages=9–31}}</ref>

Another term that is often used is ''[[folk religion]]''. While ''ethnic religion'' and ''folk religion'' have overlapping uses, the latter term implies "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|last=Bowker|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-191-72722-1|location=New York|chapter=Folk Religion}}</ref> The term ''folk religion'' can therefore be used to speak of [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese]] and [[Traditional African religion|African]] indigenous religions, but can also refer to popular expressions of more multi-national and institutionalized religions such as [[Folk Christianity]] or [[Folk Islam]].

==Usage ==
Ethnic religions are distinctive in their relationship with a particular [[ethnic group]] and often in the shaping of one's solidarity with an ethnic identity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethnicity and Religion: Intersections and Comparisons|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-1-138-88037-5|editor-last=Ruane|editor-first=Joseph B.|location=London|editor-last2=Todd|editor-first2=Jennifer}}</ref> Some ethnic religions include [[Judaism]] of the [[Jews]], [[Druidism]] of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Hellenistic religion|Hellenism]] of the [[Greeks]], [[Druze]] religion of the Druze, Alawism of [[Alawites]], [[Alevism]] of the Alevites, [[Mandaeism]] of the [[Mandaeans]], [[Yazidism]] of the [[Yazidis]], [[Zoroastrianism]] of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Chinese folk religion]] of the [[Han Chinese]], [[Kejawèn]] of the [[Javanese people]], [[Sikhism]] of the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]s, [[Shinto]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Sunda Wiwitan]] of the [[Sundanese people]] and [[Serer religion|A ƭat Roog]] of the [[Serer people|Serer]] of [[Senegal]], [[The Gambia]], and [[Mauritania]].<ref>[[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann, Diedrich]]; Smith, Edwin William; Forde, Cyril Daryll; [[International African Institute]]; [[International Institute of African Languages and Cultures]]; [[Project Muse]]; [[JSTOR]] (Organization), ''Africa: journal of the International African Institute, Volume 63'', pp 86-96, 270-1, [[Edinburgh University Press]] for the International African Institute (1993)</ref> [[Diaspora|Diasporic]] groups often maintain ethnic religions as a means of maintaining a distinct ethnic identity such as the role of [[Traditional African religion|African traditional religion]] and [[Afro-American religions]] among the [[African diaspora in the Americas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thegrio.com/2011/10/19/african-religions-gain-following-among-black-christians/|title=Are blacks abandoning Christianity for African faiths?|last=Oduah|first=Chika|date=19 October 2011|website=theGrio|access-date=27 May 2016}}</ref>

Some ancient ethnic religions, such as those historically found in pre-modern Europe, have found new vitality in [[Modern Paganism|neopaganism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements|last=Lewis|first=James R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-195-36964-9|location=New York}}</ref> Moreover, non-ethnic religions, such as Christianity, have been known to assume ethnic traits to an extent that they serve a role as an important ethnic identity marker,<ref name="Chong">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3711911 |last=Chong |first=Kelly H. |year=1997 |title=What It Means to Be Christian: The Role of Religion in the Construction of Ethnic Identity and Boundary Among Second- Generation Korean Americans |journal=Sociology of Religion |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=259–286|jstor=3711911 }}</ref> a notable example of this is the Serbian "Saint-Savianism" of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UxDRgBAOKLAC&q=serbian+nationalism+st+sava&pg=PA158|title=Fundamentalism in the Modern World Vol 1: Fundamentalism, Politics and History: The State, Globalisation and Political Ideologies|first1=Ulrika|last1=Martensson|first2=Jennifer|last2=Bailey|first3=Priscilla|last3=Ringrose|first4=Asbjorn|last4=Dyrendal|date=15 August 2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books|isbn=9781848853300}}</ref>

Some neopagan movements, especially in Europe, have adopted ''ethnic religion'' as their preferred term, aligning themselves with [[ethnology]]. This notably includes the [[European Congress of Ethnic Religions]], which chose its name after a day-long discussion in 1998, where the majority of the participants expressed that ''Pagan'' contained too many negative connotations and ''ethnic'' better described the root of their traditions in particular nations. In the United States and Canada a popular alternative term has been ''[[nature religion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Strmiska|first=Michael F.|title=Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=9781851096084|pages=15–16, 276}}</ref> In the English-language popular and scholarly discourse ''Paganism'', with a capital P, has become an accepted term.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ivakhiv |first=Adrian |title=In Search of Deeper Identities: Neopaganism and "Native Faith" in Contemporary Ukraine |journal=[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]] |volume=8 |number=3 |year=2005 |pages=30 |doi=10.1525/nr.2005.8.3.7 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~aivakhiv/Insearch.pdf |jstor=10.1525/nr.2005.8.3.7}}</ref>
