It uses [[GPS]] to provide performance statistics and is run on a GPS-enabled cell phone. The GPS gives Allsport GPS a precise way of measuring statistics such as pace, speed, time and distance.<ref name="rcrnews.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.rcrnews.com/article/20070618/SUB/70618011 |title=REVIEW: Trimble's AllSport GPS Platinum tracks your trip but only so far - RCR Wireless News |publisher=Rcrnews.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183438/http://www.rcrnews.com/article/20070618/SUB/70618011 |archivedate=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>  Users can view their route overlaid on a map.

== History ==
Allsport GPS is a part of the Trimble Outdoors product family. It is owned by [[Trimble Navigation]] which was founded in 1978. The Allsport GPS application was bought by Trimble in April 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/news/release.aspx?id=082806a |title=Trimble News Release |publisher=Trimble.com |date=2006-08-28 |accessdate=2011-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100825/http://www.trimble.com/news/release.aspx?id=082806a| archivedate= 17 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>  The software continues to be updated periodically. Allsport GPS started out as only available on limited phone models and carriers, but this list has steadily been expanding since then. In 2007 Allsport GPS was released on Blackberry phones.<ref>http://pdasoftwareaccessories.cell-iphone-voip.com/pda/blackberry-gps/blackberry-gps-you-have-a-choice-of-using-internal-or-external-gps-receivers/</ref> Allsport GPS was released on AT&T phones in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=26284 |title=AT&T- News Room |publisher=Att.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>

== Functions ==
The purpose of Allsport GPS is to support fitness and performance tracking. It is part of a trio of cell phone applications called Trimble Outdoors. It can be used for workouts such as [[running]], [[jogging]], [[mountain biking]], [[road biking]], and [[walking]]. The application is downloaded onto a GPS cell phone. The user then straps the phone onto themselves or onto their bike, or holds the phone for the duration of their workout. During the workout Allsport GPS supplies real time statistics such as calories burned, time, speed and distance. These statistics are updated every ten seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/on-the-run-with-trimble-outdoors-allsport-gps/ |title=On the Run with Trimble Outdoors AllSport GPS – Cell Phones & Mobile Device Technology News & Updates |publisher=Geek.com |date=2007-01-04 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603014342/http://www.geek.com/on-the-run-with-trimble-outdoors-allsport-gps/ |archive-date=2008-06-03 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>

After the workout, the data is automatically uploaded wirelessly to the website. The data can then be viewed, as well as a trip calendar showing all workouts over time, and elevation and speed profiles. On the Allsport map function, the workout can be viewed on a map both on the phone and on the website. The route can be made public and shared with others. The user can do a trip search on the website and view other users' shared workouts as well as workouts from ''[[Bicycling Magazine]]''. These routes can be downloaded from the website. The phone application has a race-against-yourself feature that enables the user to compare their times and distances multiple times over the same track.
