The '''New Orleans Recreation Department''' is the department of the local government of the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] USA, that operates and maintains recreational facilities for the people of the city. It is commonly known by the [[acronym]] '''NORD'''.<ref name="NOLAPope" />

Formed in 1946, NORD was among the first of its kind in the United States. It won accolades early in its history, being considered [[Progressivism|progressive]] by the standards of the mid-twentieth century.<ref name="Life1949">{{cite news |title=Life Congratulates New Orleans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkkEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22new+orleans%22 |accessdate=23 December 2019 |agency=Life Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc. |date=September 5, 1949}}</ref>

As of 2010, the New Orleans Recreation Department Commission provides administrative oversight for NORD.<ref name="NOLAPope" /> In 2017, NORD was accredited by the National Recreation and Park Association.<ref name="NRPA">{{cite web |title=CAPRA Accredited Agencies |url=https://www.nrpa.org/certification/accreditation/CAPRA/accreditedagencies/ |website=nrpa.org |publisher=National Recreation and Park Association |accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref> Although its activities emphasize sports, they are not limited to sports and include activities such as music, theater and dance.<ref name="Programs">{{cite web |title=NORD Programs & Events |url=https://nordc.org/activities/ |website=nordc.org |publisher=New Orleans Recreation Department Commission |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===Founding===
The New Orleans City Council created NORD with City Ordinance No. 16,630 on September 27, 1946, going into effect on January 1, 1947. [[DeLesseps S. Morrison|Mayor deLesseps S. Morrison]] had started to press for its creation from his time campaigning for mayor while still a member of the [[Louisiana State Legislature]]. Morrison maintained his interest in the organization through his term of office.<ref name="First Years">{{cite web |title=A Place to Play: The First Years of NORD, 1947-1948 |url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/nord/nordcontents.htm |website=nutrias.org |publisher=New Orleans Public Library |accessdate=13 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="NOLAPope">{{cite news |last1=Pope |first1=John |title=Remembering When NORD Taught New Orleans to Play Ball (and Swim and Act and ...) |url=https://www.nola.com/300/article_d756cd26-edfc-5e3f-9d3c-883a8d9982fe.html |accessdate=16 February 2020 |agency=nola.com |publisher=Georges Media Group |date=July 21, 2017}}</ref> By 1949, the [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquency rate]] in New Orleans declined by 50%, with NORD receiving some credit for the change.<ref name="Life1949" />

The immediate forerunner of NORD was the New Orleans Juvenile Sports Association which was established during [[World War II]].<ref name="NOLAPope" /> This association did not manage recreational activities and facilities in a comprehensive way, and administration was inefficiently divided among approximately 16 different government agencies.<ref name="Life1949" />

Morrison's interest in creating NORD began with a [[Sales Pitch|pitch]] by [[Lester Lautenschlaeger]], John Brechtel, G. Gernon Brown, and Morris Jeff. Lautenschlaeger was a noted local athlete and civic leader. Brechtel was an administrator for the New Orleans Juvenile Sports Association. Brown was a prominent local high school football coach; and Jeff was the [[athletic director]] at [[Xavier University of New Orleans]], an [[historically black university]]. This pitch presentation occurred while Morrison was engaged in his political campaign to become mayor of New Orleans.<ref name="Gambit2010">{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Matt |title=Special Report: New Orleans Recreation Department |url=https://www.nola.com/gambit/news/article_e806e13e-b0c0-5be3-b104-cceec1851398.html |accessdate=26 February 2020 |agency=Gambit |publisher=Georges Media Group |date=July 11, 2010}}</ref>

With Mayor Morrison's sponsorship, the city of New Orleans appropriated $300,000 to create NORD, which was a large sum of money for the time. Morrison appointed Lautenschlaeger as NORD's first director, with Brechtel as assistant director. Lautenschlaeger voluntarily served as director for a salary of $1 per year. Henry Beter served as athletic director for NORD from its inception. Lautenschlaeger, Brechtel, and Beter all had long tenures with NORD and provided forceful administration of the organization.<ref name="NOLA1994">{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Jimmy |title=When NORD Was the Nation's Best |agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune |publisher=Georges Media Group |date=August 22, 1994}}</ref>

Within 16 months of its inception, NORD constructed 58 new playgrounds and 8 new swimming pools. NORD made use of existing facilities to the extent possible, and so, with the new constructions, had 91 playgrounds, 17 swimming pools, and 8 sports stadiums. At that time, it sponsored 25 [[baseball]] leagues. Nearly from the start, its programs included classes and workshops for theater, dance, [[arts & crafts]], and youth day camps. NORD has also provided programs for senior citizens since its earliest days.<ref name="Life1949" />

Under Morrison's city leadership, the city government funded NORD from the city's general funds, while Lautenschlaeger supplemented funding by soliciting private donations.<ref name="Gambit2010" />

===Olive A. Stallings===
[[File:GentillyOliveStallingPlaygroundGate.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Olive Stallings Playground in [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]] (photo courtesy of Infrogmation)]]
Public recreation facilities in New Orleans can be traced to the work of civic leader '''Olive A. Stallings''' (1866-1940). Following her attendance at a 1906 meeting of the National Recreation Association in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] USA, Stallings became interested in providing publicly available recreation facilities in her hometown of New Orleans. In 1906, Stallings funded and established the Poydras Playground which was the first play center in New Orleans.<ref name="Gambit">{{cite web |last1=London |first1=Charles |title=Gambit Remembers Olive Stallings |url=https://katrinafilm.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/gambit-remembers-olive-stallings/ |website=katrinafilm.wordpress.com |publisher=Charlie's Neighborhood News |accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref>

Stallings served on the New Orleans Playground Commission from 1911 to 1940 and was the commission's first president. She was the founder and first president of the New Orleans Outdoor Art and Improvement Association which was the forerunner of the New Orleans Parkway Commission. Stallings served on the zoning board of the city and was the founder of the first [[Girl Scouts]] organization in the New Orleans. By 1938, aided by Stallings's efforts, New Orleans had 18 playgrounds and 6 swimming pools for purposes of general recreation.<ref name="Gambit" />

In 1929, the [[New Orleans Times-Picayune]] newspaper presented Stallings with its [[The_Times-Picayune/The_New_Orleans_Advocate#Loving_Cup_Award|Loving Cup Award]] for her efforts on civic improvement, especially children's recreation. NORD has a Stallings Playground, [[eponymous]] to her.<ref name="Gambit" />

===Segregation in NORD===
The 1947 creation of NORD coincided with the [[Jim Crow era]] of the [[southern United States]]. For this reason, NORD facilities were [[racially segregated]] through its early history. Shortly after inception, NORD provided 19 facilities for the black community and more than 100 for the white community.<ref name="Segregation1">{{cite web |last1=McQueeney |first1=Kevin |title=Segregation in Palmer Park |url=https://neworleanshistorical.org/items/show/661 |website=neworleanshistorical.org |publisher=University of New Orleans and Tulane University |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> At that time, the [[demographics]] of New Orleans were about 32% African-American, and so NORD was disproportionately supporting the white people of the city.<ref name="Demographics">{{cite web |last1=Plyer |first1=Allison |last2=Gardere |first2=Lamar |title=The New Orleans Prosperity Index: Tricentennial Edition |url=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/reports_analysis/prosperity-index/ |website=datacenterresearch.org |publisher=The Data Center |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>

In 1947, at the time that the city of New Orleans created NORD, Mayor Morrison established an advisory commission of African American community leaders as part of NORD's organization. In 1948, NORD opened Shakespeare Park and Julius Rosenwald Center specifically for African-Americans as segregated operations.<ref name="Masters Diss">{{cite web |last1=McQueeney |first1=Kevin G. |title=Masters Dissertation: Playing With Jim Crow: African American Private Parks in Early Twentieth Century New Orleans |url=https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3032&context=td |website=scholarworks.uno.edu |publisher=University of New Orleans |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>

During the period of segregation, NORD maintained a "negro division". While NORD disproportionately supported the white population, NORD provided facilities for the African-American population when previously they had none. An example of such a facility was Lincoln Beach.<ref name="Simmons">{{cite book |last1=Simmons |first1=LaKisha Michelle |title=Crescent City Girls: The Lives of Young Black Women in Segregated New Orleans |date=2015 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1469622804 |pages=54–55}}</ref>

NORD remained racially segregated until after the 1963 Barthe v. City of New Orleans court decision.<ref name="BartheCase">{{cite web |title=BARTHE v. CITY OF NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19631007219fsupp7881879 |website=leagle.com |publisher=Leagle, Inc. |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> In 1964, the [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the decision, initiating the desegregation of NORD.<ref name="Segregation1" /><ref name="SCRuling">{{cite web |title=CITY OF NEW ORLEANS v. BARTHE, 376 U.S. 189 (1964) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/376/189/ |website=supreme.justia.com |publisher=Justia Corporate Center |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> Lester Lautenschlaeger was still serving as NORD's director at the time of the Supreme Court decision, and he refused to comply with the court's decision. Then mayor [[Moon Landrieu]] removed Lautenschlaeger from the post, thereby clearing the way for racial integration of NORD's programs and facilities.<ref name="NOLA1994" />

===Period of decline===
[[File:Samuel Square New Orleans January 2019.jpg|thumb|Samuel Square, a NORD facility that was racially integrated soon after court order]]
City leaders in New Orleans reacted to the requirement by the courts to integrate NORD facilities by closing swimming pools and other NORD facilities. Public funding for NORD also diminished.<ref name="Segregation1" /> These events led to the subsequent decline of the quality and quantity of NORD's programs and facilities.<ref name="Germany" /><ref name="NOLA1994" />

Voters in New Orleans rejected a proposal to incorporate Palmer Park in the Carrollton section of New Orleans into NORD, which would have resulted in racial integration of this all-white park. Opponents of the proposal claimed that racial integration of the park would result in declining property values in the neighborhood and accelerate the departure of white people to the suburbs. The opponents of the proposal pointed to the integration of the Samuel Square park as a "public disgrace", claiming the same would happen to Palmer Park should it become part of NORD. Although this proposal to New Orleans voters failed, Palmer Park subsequently became part of the city's park system in 1977, resulting in decisive racial integration.<ref name="Segregation1" />

Members of the black community in New Orleans responded by forming the Target Areas Recreation Committee (TARC), which was established to call attention to the inadequate focus on black children in the city.<ref name="Germany">{{cite book |last1=Germany |first1=Kent B. |title=New Orleans after the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship, and the Search for the Great Society |date=2007 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0820329000 |pages=83–87}}</ref>

===Impact of Hurricane Katrina===
NORD was already in a state of decline by the time of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. Many of NORD's facilities were seriously damaged by the hurricane, remaining in a state of significant disrepair and neglect at least until 2010 when reform movements began.<ref name="NOLAKatrina">{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Richard |title=NORD has gone from 'Progressive' to 'Terrible' |url=https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_5462e4a9-6d5f-5d6f-b7c0-85f794df6cbf.html |accessdate=17 February 2020 |agency=nola.com |publisher=Georges Media Group |date=January 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Weekly 2019">{{cite news |last1=Whirty |first1=Ryan |title=New NORDC CEO Lays Out Plans for New Orleans Recreation |url=http://www.louisianaweekly.com/new-nordc-ceo-lays-out-plans-for-new-orleans-recreation/ |accessdate=9 March 2020 |agency=The Louisiana Weekly |publisher=Dejoie Family |date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>

At the time of a 2010 survey of NORD facilities, five years after Hurricane Katrina, seven of NORD's sixteen swimming pools were open, with many of its community centers closed or destroyed. The survey showed that the NORD facilities in the more affluent sections of New Orleans received preferential treatment. NORD facilities on the west bank of the city were undamaged in comparison to those on the east bank. Reconstruction of the NORD facilities after the hurricane was slow. Some New Orleans residents attempted reconstruction with private funds, although city government had not cooperated as of 2010.<ref name="Gambit2010" />

===Revitalization===
Revitalization of NORD began in earnest when Mitch Landrieu became mayor of New Orleans in 2010. In his first State of the City speech, on July 8,2010, Landrieu stated: "... when I came into office 67 days ago, I found a recreation department that would make you weep, one that is underfunded and under-prioritized. We found many of NORD's facilities are in shambles — swimming pools without filtration systems, no restrooms and no shower facilities."<ref name="Gambit2010" />

As part of his efforts to reform NORD, Landrieu established the NORD Commission in 2010, to serve as a governing body for NORD. At nearly the same time, Landrieu created the NORD Foundation, which is a [[501(c)(3) nonprofit organization]] charged with supplementing the finances of NORD.<ref name="Mission" />

==Governance and organization==
NORD states its mission as being "to advance the physical, mental, and social well-being of New Orleanians by providing safe and welcoming environments for recreational, athletic, and cultural experiences."<ref name="Mission">{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://nordfoundation.org/about-us |website=nordfoundation.org |publisher=NORD Foundation |accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> 

Day-to-day operations of NORD are the responsibility of its [[chief executive officer]]. NORD is directed by the NORD Commission, which is a group of community leaders appointed by the mayor of New Orleans and who serve on the commission without compensation. City funding of NORD is supplemented by the NORD Foundation, and, in this way, NORD operates as a [[public-private partnership]].<ref name="NOLAMitch" /><ref name="Weekly 2019" /> The government of the State of Louisiana has funded some NORD projects.<ref name="NRPA Magazine">{{cite web |last1=Reckdahl |first1=Katy |title=The Andrew 'Pete' Sanchez Multi-Service Center |url=https://www.nrpa.org/parks-recreation-magazine/2017/september/the-andrew-pete-sanchez-multi-service-center/ |website=nrpa.org |publisher=National Recreation and Park Association |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref> The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] has provided public funding for some projects that were part of NORD's recovery from Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="FEMA Funding">{{cite web |title=City Center Celebrates Opening Of New Stallings St. Claude Center And Pool |url=https://www.bizneworleans.com/city-center-celebrates-opening-of-new-stallings-st-claude-center-and-pool/ |website=bizneworleans.com |publisher=Renaissance Publishing LLC |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>

Improvements to NORD's Joe W. Brown Park were completed as a result of a public-private partnership between the city of New Orleans, the [[Sugar Bowl|AllState Sugar Bowl]], the [[Nike (company)|Nike Corporation]], and the [[Drew_Brees#Brees_Dream_Foundation|Brees Dream Foundation]].<ref name="Brown Park">{{cite web |title=Joe Brown Park |url=https://allstatesugarbowl.org/other-events/joe-brown-park/ |website=allstatesugarbowl.org |publisher=Allstate Sugar Bowl |accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref>

==Programs and facilities==
[[File:Wesley Barrow Stadium (New Orleans, LA).jpg|thumb|Wesley Barrow Stadium. Its sign shows the NORD logo.]]
Although NORD emphasizes programs for children, it provides programs for people of all ages. As of 2017, NORD operated 15 swimming pools and 12 [[community centers]]. In addition to sports, NORD provides music instruction, exercise programs, youth summer camps, art classes, programs for professional development, and homework help for school-age children.<ref name="NOLAMitch" />

Programs include ones for people with [[special needs]]. NORD has programs specifically designed to encourage participation of girls and young women in sports.<ref name="SWAAG">{{cite web |title=S.W.A.A.G. |url=https://nordc.org/sports/swaag/ |website=nordc.org |publisher=NORD Commission |accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref>

Representative NORD facilities include, among others:
* Joe W. Brown Park, including Victory Field
* A.L. Davis Park (formerly known as Shakespeare Park)
* Rosenwald Recreation Center
* Sanchez Multi-Service Center
* Stallings Playground
* [[Wesley Barrow Stadium]]

==Recognition==
A 1949 article by Life Magazine reported that [[Tom C. Clark|Associate Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark]] referred to NORD as the most progressive municipal recreation program in the United States.<ref name="Life1949" />

In 1967, NORD was named Outstanding Organization by the [[Allstate Sugar Bowl]].

With its 2017 accreditation by the National Recreation and Park Association, NORD became part of just 1% of all the recreation departments in the United States which have earned this distinction.<ref name="NOLAMitch">{{cite news |last1=Landrieu |first1=Mitch |title=Accreditation Reflects How Far NORD has Come |url=https://www.nola.com/opinions/article_547755d5-0ca4-51e2-9d99-a8edb1804150.html |accessdate=19 February 2020 |agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune |publisher=Georges Media Group |date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>
