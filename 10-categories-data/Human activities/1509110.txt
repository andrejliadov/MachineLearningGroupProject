'''Air cargo''' is any property carried or to be carried in an [[aircraft]]. Air cargo comprises air freight, air express and [[airmail]].<ref>Allaz, Camille (2005): The History of Air Cargo and Airmail from the 18th Century, p. 8</ref>

==Aircraft types==
Different cargo can be transported by passenger, cargo or combi aircraft:
* [[Passenger aircraft]] use the spare volume in the airplane's baggage hold (the "belly") that is not being used for passenger luggage—a common practice used by [[passenger airline]]s, who additionally transport cargo on scheduled passenger flights. Cargo can also be transported in the [[Aircraft cabin|passenger cabin]] as hand-carry by an “on-board courier”.  This practice can often be used to cross-subsidise loss-making passenger routes that would otherwise be uneconomical to operate.
* [[Cargo aircraft]] are dedicated for the job—they carry freight on the main deck and in the belly by means of nose-loading or side loading. 
* [[Combi aircraft]] carry cargo on part of the main deck, before or after a passengers’ section, with side loading, and in the belly.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Airmail 1930s Detroit Smykowski.jpg|thumb|Loading airmail, late 1930s, [[Detroit]]]]

The first cargo flight took place on the 7 November 1910 in the USA, between [[Dayton]] and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]]. [[Philip Orin Parmelee]] piloted a [[Wright Model B]] aeroplane 65 miles (105&nbsp;km) carrying a package of 200 pounds of silk for the opening of a store. Newspaper clippings quoted the [[Wright brothers]] as stating he covered the distance in 66 minutes, but the flight was officially recorded at 57 minutes, a world speed record at the time. It was the first “cargo only” flight solely for the transport of goods; the first flight commissioned by a client, and the first example of multimodal air transport, since the pieces of silk were transported by car from Columbus aerodrome to the store.

The world's first official airmail flight by airplane took place on 18 February 1911, at a large exhibition in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], [[British India]]. The organizer of the aviation display, [[Walter Windham|Sir Walter Windham]], was able to secure permission from the postmaster general in India to operate an airmail service in order to generate publicity for the exhibition and to raise money for charity. This first airmail flight was piloted by [[Henri Pequet]], who flew 6,500 letters a distance of 13&nbsp;km (8.1&nbsp;mi), from [[Allahabad]] to [[Naini]]—the nearest station on the [[Howrah–Nagpur–Mumbai line|Bombay-Calcutta line]] to the exhibition. The aircraft used was a [[Sommer 1910 biplane|Humber-Sommer biplane]] with about fifty horsepower (37&nbsp;kW), and it made the journey in thirteen minutes. 
The world's first scheduled airmail post service took place in the [[United Kingdom]] between the [[London]] suburb of [[Hendon]], and the [[Postmaster General]]'s office in [[Windsor, Berkshire]], on September 9, 1911. It was part of the celebrations for [[King George V]]'s coronation and at the suggestion of [[Walter Windham|Sir Walter Windham]], who based his proposal on the successful experiment he had overseen in India. The service ran for just under a month, transporting 35 bags of mail in 16 flights.

In the early 20s, air cargo developed rapidly because numerous entrepreneurs realized aircraft could move high value and low volume consignments much faster than the railroads and shipping companies. The first scheduled flight from [[London]] to [[Paris]] in 1919 had only one passenger but carried leather for a shoe manufacturer and [[grouse]] for a restaurant. Cinema [[films]] were also a frequent consignment: original news’ bulletins were first carried to a central laboratory to make copies, and then distributed by air throughout Europe for their release in cinemas.

===Post-war years===

Although there were a few attempts to organize [[Cargo airline|air freight airlines]] from the 1920s on, the first commercial airlines that were all-cargo did not emerge until after [[World War II]]. In 1945, at a conference in Havana, 57 airlines formed the [[International Air Transport Association]].

In 1948 Berlin was jointly controlled by the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] and [[Soviet Union|Russians]], although the Russians held the area surrounding the city and thus land access. As this access was closed, in the so-called [[Berlin blockade]], an airlift remained the only option to get increasingly urgent deliveries of food, coal, and other supplies to [[West Berlin]]. Over 330 days to 12 May 1949 a total of 2.26 million tons of cargo were airlifted to Berlin, an average of 6,800 tons a day, 80% by the US and 20% by the UK.<ref>Morrell, Peter S. (2011): Moving Boxes by Air. The Economics of International Air Cargo</ref>

Although freight traffic developed modestly, reaching only 800,000 tonnes worldwide by the mid-1950s, the world economy was hitting its post-war stride. [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] were emerging from their period of purgatory and were poised to take the world of business by storm, the United States was approaching the height of its economic dominance, and Western Europe had recovered from the war. In 1968, [[Boeing]] launched the four engine [[Boing 747|747]], the first [[wide-body aircraft]]. The 747 was the first aircraft capable of transporting full [[pallet]]s in the cargo hold, revolutionizing the air cargo industry.

===Modern air cargo===

Despite widespread hopes for a vibrant industry, for decades the air freight sector did not grow as expected and remained a very small part of total air traffic. For much of the first five post-war decades most carriers saw it as a secondary activity, although there had always been specialized cargo airlines.  Some passenger airlines have found the practice of carrying "belly cargo" a highly lucrative enterprise (in fact, it is estimated that 50% of all air freight is moved in this way), to the point where it has lessened the demand for dedicated large cargo aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnsson|first1=Julie|title=Big-Belly Boeing 777 Blunts Demand for Cargo-Only Jets|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-26/big-belly-boeing-777-blunts-demand-for-cargo-only-jets.html|website=Bloomberg|access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

Cargo emerged as a solid pillar of the industry in the 1990s. The catalysts for the renewed growth in the sector were the express parcel carriers, typified by [[FedEx]], [[DHL]], [[TNT N.V.|TNT]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], and changes in practices in the manufacturing sector. In 1992, FedEx sent software on computer disks to thousands of customers, allowing them to track shipments from their own workstations.

The rise of internet in the years that followed contributed to increase the reliability and accessibility to the air cargo industry. Most airlines now offer to their customers real-time flight status and the booking and tracking options. In addition, the industry is adopting [[Document automation|electronic procedures]],<ref>[[IATA]]. [http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/e/Pages/cargo-xml.aspx Cargo-XML Standards: Modernizing air cargo communication].</ref> such as the electronic [[air waybill]], to reduce the amount of paper documentation accompanying each shipment and increasing the security and safety of the transportation. Many retailers are making an effort to integrate the air cargo delivery process with their customer service offering to respond to increasing consumer pressure.<ref>"[https://www.sekologistics.com/en/services/omni-channel-logistics/resources-white-papers/ecommerce-delivery-what-do-your-customers-want/ eCommerce delivery – What do your customers want?]" ''SEKO Logistics'', 22 August 2018. Accessed: 12 February 2019.</ref>

An industry expert estimates that 15-20 tonnes of air cargo is worth 30-40 economy passenger seats, when both are on passenger planes.<ref>"[http://www.runwaygirlnetwork.com/2014/07/03/a-barrier-to-a380-sales-in-the-united-states/ A barrier to A380 sales in the United States]" ''RunwayGirl'', 3 July 2014. Accessed: 20 July 2014.</ref>

However, with the exception of the integrators (FedEx, UPS, DHL and TNT) the air cargo industry continues to suffer as the by-product 'poor-relation' of the passenger business.<!--Amedeo CEO Mark Lapidus-->{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In 2017, the [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] observed a 9% rise in freight [[tonne kilometer]]s: air cargo demand is strong due to [[industrial production]] and [[global trade]] growth above expansion of [[e-commerce]], outpacing capacity as available tonne kilometers grew by 3%.<!--<ref name=Randy26apr2018>-->
