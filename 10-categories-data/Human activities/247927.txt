'''Border control''' is the measures taken by a [[state (polity)|state]] or a bloc of states to monitor its [[border]]s<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/b/border-control/ | title=Border Control Law and Legal Definition &#124; USLegal, Inc}}</ref> and regulate the movement of people, animals, and goods across the border.

==History==

States and rulers have always regarded the ability to determine who enters or remains in their territories as a key test of their sovereignty, but prior to [[World War I]], border controls were only sporadically implemented.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Economic Consequences of the Peace |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |author-link=John Maynard Keynes |year=1920 |publisher=Harcourt Brace |location=New York|chapter=II Europe Before the War|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15776/15776-h/15776-h.htm#CHAPTER_II }}</ref> In medieval Europe, for example, the boundaries between rival countries and centres of power were largely symbolic or consisted of amorphous borderlands, ‘marches’ and ‘debatable lands’ of indeterminate or contested status and the real ‘borders’ consisted of the fortified walls that surrounded towns and cities, where the authorities could exclude undesirable or incompatible people at the gates, from vagrants, beggars and the ‘wandering poor’, to ‘masterless women’, lepers, Romani or Jews.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/matt-carr/beyond-border | title=Beyond the Border &#124; History Today}}</ref>

The concept of a travel document such as a passport needed to clear border controls in the modern sense has been traced back to the reign of [[Henry V of England]], as a means of helping his subjects prove who they were in foreign lands. The earliest reference to these documents is found in a [[Safe Conducts Act 1414|1414 Act of Parliament]].<ref name="brief history">[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/nov/17/travelnews "A brief history of the passport"].

In 1794, issuing British passports became the job of the Office of the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].<ref name="brief history"/> The 1548 Imperial Diet of Augsburg required the public to hold imperial documents for travel, at the risk of permanent exile.<ref>[[John Torpey]], "Le contrôle des passeports et la liberté de circulation. Le cas de l'Allemagne au XIXe siècle", ''Genèses'', 1998, n° 1, pp. 53–76</ref> During World War I, European governments introduced border passport requirements for security reasons, and to control the emigration of people with useful skills. These controls remained in place after the war, becoming a standard, though controversial, procedure. British tourists of the 1920s complained, especially about attached photographs and physical descriptions, which they considered led to a "nasty dehumanisation".<ref>Marrus, Michael, ''The Unwanted: European Refugees in the Twentieth Century''.  New York: Oxford University Press (1985), p. 92.</ref>

One of the earliest systematic attempts of a modern nation state to implement border controls to restrict entry of particular groups was the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 in America. This act aimed to implement discriminatory immigration controls on East Asians. The strict and racist border control policies had a negative impact not only on the Chinese alone but also on whites and other races as well which lasted for about thirty years.<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|last=Tian|first=Kelly|title=The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and Its Impact on North American Society|url=http://www.kon.org/urc/v9/tian.html|volume=9}}</ref> The U.S. economy suffered a great loss as a result of this Act.<ref name="auto"/> The Act was a sign of injustice and unfair treatment to the Chinese workers because the jobs they engaged in were mostly menial jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bodenner|first=Chris|date=February 6, 2013|title=Chinese Exclusion Act; Issues and Controversies in American History|url=http://www.ndhs.org/s/1012/images/editor_documents/library/issues_and_controversies_in_american_history_-_chinese_exclusion_act.pdf?sessionid=7aa0a591-8d60-4578-ba02-e7cfe36e74ab&cc=1|pages=5|access-date=August 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208122340/http://www.ndhs.org/s/1012/images/editor_documents/library/issues_and_controversies_in_american_history_-_chinese_exclusion_act.pdf?sessionid=7aa0a591-8d60-4578-ba02-e7cfe36e74ab&cc=1|archive-date=December 8, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> A similarly discriminatory approach to border control was taken in Canada through the [[Chinese Immigration Act of 1885]], imposing what came to be called the [[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese head tax]].

Starting in the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] established quarantine stations on many of its borders to control disease. For example, along the Greek-Turkish border, all travelers entering and exiting the Ottoman Empire would be quarantined for 9–15 days. These stations would often be manned by armed guards. If plague appeared, the [[Ottoman army]] would be deployed to enforce border control and [[disease monitoring|monitor disease]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Plague and Contagion in the Islamic Mediterranean|editor=Nukhet Varlik|author=[https://www.risd.edu/people/andrew-robarts/ Andrew Robarts]|pages=236–7|publisher=Arc Humanities Press}}</ref>

Decolonisation during the twentieth century saw the emergence of mass emigration from nations in the [[Global South]], thus leading former colonial occupiers to introduce stricter border controls.<ref name=newint>{{Cite web | url=https://newint.org/features/1991/09/05/simply |title = Simply... The History of Borders|date = 1991-09-05}}</ref> In the United Kingdom this process took place in stages, with British nationality law eventually shifting from recognising all [[Commonwealth citizen]]s as British subjects to today’s complex [[British nationality law]] which distinguishes between British citizens, modern [[British Subjects]], [[British Overseas Citizens]], and [[British National (Overseas)|overseas nationals]], with each non-standard category created as a result of attempts to balance border control and the need to mitigate [[statelessness]]. This aspect of the rise of border control in the 20th century has proven controversial. The British Nationality Law 1981 has been criticised by experts,{{efn|For example, [[Ann Dummett]], an activist for racial equality, criticised the legislation, saying that "there is no indication at all in our nationality law of ethnic origin being a criterion. But the purpose of the law since 1981, and the manner in which it is implemented, make sure that ethnic origin is in fact and in practice a deciding factor."<ref>[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2006/oct/eu-meijers-cttee-vis-proposal.pdf], Letter to Franco FRATTINI, Standing committee of experts on international immigration, refugee and criminal law.

The committee criticised the arrangements of the BN(O) nationality under "Principal subjects of concern": "The Government's statement that South Asian residents of Hong Kong are granted some form of British nationality, whether that of a British National Overseas (BNO) or a British Overseas Citizen (BOC), so that no resident of Hong Kong would be left stateless following the transfer of sovereignty is noted with interest. It is, however, a matter of concern that such status does not grant the bearer the right of abode in the United Kingdom and contrasts with the full citizenship status conferred upon a predominantly white population living in another dependent territory. It is noted that most of the persons holding BNO or BOC status are Asians and that judgements on applications for citizenship appear to vary according to the country of origin, which leads to the assumption that this practice reveals elements of racial discrimination."<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/5ff3d725d136a1fcc12563e0003dbc08?Opendocument Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination : United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 28/03/96.]</ref>}} on the grounds that the different classes of British nationality it created are, in fact, closely related to the ethnic origins of their holders.

The creation of British Nationality (Overseas) status, for instance, (with fewer privileges than British citizen status) was met with criticism from many Hong Kong residents who felt that British citizenship would have been more appropriate in light of the "moral debt" owed to them by the UK.{{efn|For example, the legislative councilor [[Henrietta Ip Man-Hing|Dr Henrietta Ip]] criticised the idea of British National (Overseas) and again urged the UK Parliament, to grant full British citizenship to Hong Kong's British nationals in the council meeting held on 5 July 1989, saying that "we were born and live under British rule on British land.... It is therefore... our right to ask that you should give us back a place of abode so that we can continue to live under British rule on British land if we so wish.... I represent most of all those who live here to firmly request and demand you to grant us the right to full British citizenship so that we can, if we so wish, live in the United Kingdom, our Motherland... I say to you that the right of abode in the United Kingdom is the best and the only definitive guarantee....'' With your failure to give us such a guarantee, reluctant as I may, I must advise the people of Hong Kong, and urgently now, each to seek for themselves a home of last resort even if they have to leave to do so''. I do so because, as a legislator, my duty is with the people first and the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong second, although the two are so interdependent on each other...."}}{{efn|The legislation is sometimes compared with [[Macau]], a former colony of Portugal, where many residents of Chinese descent were granted right of abode in Portugal when Macau was still under colonial rule. They were not deprived of their right of abode after the [[transfer of sovereignty of Macau]] in 1999, their [[Portuguese passport]]s and citizenship are valid and inheritable, and it turned out that many of them still choose to stay in Macau.}} Some British politicians{{efn|Then [[Shadow Home Secretary]], [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], said in a letter to the then [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] dated 30 January 1997 that a claim that British National (Overseas) status amounts to British nationality "is pure [[sophistry]]".<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=48962 "Labour call for British citizenship for Hong Kong ethnic Asians"], ''PR Newswire Europe Ltd.'', 1997.</ref>}} and magazines{{efn|''The Economist'' also wrote critically in an article published on 3 July 1997 that "the failure to offer citizenship to most of Hong Kong’s residents was shameful", and "it was the height of cynicism to hand 6m people over to a regime of proven brutality without allowing them any means to move elsewhere." The article commented that the real reason that the new [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour government]] still refused to give full British citizenship to other British Dependent Territories Citizens in around 1997 – because the United Kingdom was waiting until Hong Kong had been disposed of – "would be seen as highly cynical", as [[Elizabeth Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean|Baroness Symons]], a [[Foreign Office]] minister, has conceded.<ref>"Britain’s colonial obligations", ''The Economist'', 3 July 1997.</ref>}} also criticised the creation of BN(O) status.

Ethnic tensions created during colonial occupation also resulted in discriminatory policies being adopted in newly independent African nations, such as Uganda under [[Idi Amin]] which banned [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asians from Uganda]], thus creating a mass exodus of the (largely Gujarati<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/international/story/19790515-hopes-soar-among-ugandan-asians-as-idi-amin-dictatorial-regime-falls-822011-2014-02-28|title=Hopes soar among Ugandan Asians as Idi Amin's dictatorial regime falls|date=February 28, 2014|first=K|last=Srinivas|magazine=India Today}}</ref><ref name=toi>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujaratis-survived-Idi-Amin-fuelled-East-Africas-economy/articleshow/3625352.cms|title=Gujaratis survived Idi Amin, fuelled East Africa's economy|date=October 22, 2008|first1=Ashish|last1=Vashi|first2=Ankur|last2=Jain|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref>) Asian community of Uganda. Such ethnically driven border control policies took forms ranging from anti-Asian sentiment in East Africa to [[Apartheid]] policies in South Africa and Namibia (then known as [[Southwest Africa]] under South African rule) which creates [[bantustan]]s{{efn|Bantustans within the borders of South Africa were classified as "self-governing" or "independent" and theoretically had some sovereign powers. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had no economic infrastructure worth mentioning and with few exceptions encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant all the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa. Throughout the existence of the independent Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. Nevertheless, internal organisations of many countries, as well as the South African government, lobbied for their recognition. For example, upon the foundation of Transkei, the [[Swiss-South African Association]] encouraged the Swiss government to recognise the new state. In 1976, leading up to a [[United States House of Representatives]] resolution urging the President to not recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill. While the bill fell short of its needed two-thirds vote, a simple majority of lawmakers nevertheless supported the resolution.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pitterman |first=Shelly |title=A Fine Face for Apartheid |work=Southern Africa Perspectives |url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf}}</ref> Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.}} and [[pass laws]]{{efn|In South Africa, pass laws were designed to segregate the population,  manage urbanisation, and allocate migrant labour. Also known as the natives law, pass laws severely limited the movements of not only blacks, but other peoples as well (e.g. Asians) by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950s, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. Pass laws would be one of the dominant features of the country's [[apartheid]] system, until it was effectively ended in 1986.

It was replaced in 1945 by the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, which imposed "influx control" on black men, and also set up guidelines for removing people deemed to be living idle lives from urban areas.

==Aspects==
There are multiple aspects of border control.

===Quarantine===
[[File:Insignia of China Inspection and Quarantine 2012 (2).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Quarantine operations deployed by mainland Chinese border control.]]
{{main|Quarantine}}

Quarantine policies exist to control the spread of disease. When applied as a component of border control, such policies focus primarily on mitigating the entry of infected individuals, plants, or animals into a country.<ref>Champion P.D.; Hofstra D.E.; Clayton J.S. (2007) Border control for potential aquatic weeds. Stage 3. Weed risk assessment. ''Science for Conservation 271''. p. 41. Department of Conservation, New Zealand.

===Customs===
[[File:Ports of Auckland Customs Boundary.jpg|thumb|right|Southern edge (customs border) of Captain Cook wharf, [[Ports of Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. An [[electric fence]] is faintly visible behind the historical fence]]

{{main|Customs}}

Each country has its own laws and regulations for the [[international trade|import]] and [[export]] of goods into and out of a country, which its customs authority enforces. The import or export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden, in which case customs controls enforce such policies.<ref name="Chowdhury 1992">
Chowdhury, F. L. (1992) Evasion of Customs Duty in Bangladesh, unpublished MBA dissertation submitted to Monash University, Australia.
</ref> Customs enforcement at borders can also entail collecting [[excise tax]] and preventing the smuggling of dangerous or illegal goods. A [[customs duty]] is a [[tariff]] or [[tax]] on the importation (usually) or exportation (unusually) of goods.

In many countries, border controls for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels in order to prioritise customs enforcement.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Dual-Channel System (Customs Clearance)|url = http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=98#red-or-green|website = Ica.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-09-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150906070322/http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=98#red-or-green|archive-date = 2015-09-06|url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319202853/http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref> Within the European Union’s common customs area, airports may operate additional blue channels for passengers arriving from within that area. For such passengers, border control may focus specifically on prohibited items and other goods that are not covered by the common policy. [[Bag tag|Luggage tags]] for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/baggage_controls/index_en.htm#exit|title=EUROPA – Taxation and Customs Union / Baggage controls|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|date=2007-02-21|accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328205916/http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |archive-date=2007-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In most EU member states, travellers coming from other EU countries within the [[Schengen Area]] can use the green lane, although airports outside the Schengen Area or with frequent flights arriving from jurisdictions within Schengen but outside the European Union may use blue channels for convenience and efficiency.

====Customs area====
A customs area is an area designated for storage of commercial goods that have not cleared border controls for customs purposes. It is surrounded by a customs border. Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are often stored in a type of customs area known as a [[bonded warehouse]], until processed or re-exported.<ref name="ANTW">[http://www.haven.antwerpen.be/html/17_FAQ/page_FAQ_00.html Port of Antwerp FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030517113119/http://www.haven.antwerpen.be/html/17_FAQ/page_FAQ_00.html |date=2003-05-17 }} (from the official website of the [[Port of Antwerp]].

Retrieved 2007-10-12)</ref> Ports authorised to handle international cargo generally include recognised bonded warehouses.

For the purpose of [[customs duties]], goods within the customs area are treated as being outside the country. This allows easy [[transshipment]] to a third country without customs authorities being involved.<ref name="ANTW"/> For this reason, customs areas are usually carefully controlled and fenced to prevent [[smuggling]]. However, the area is still territorially part of the country, so the goods within the area are subject to other local laws (for example [[drug laws]] and [[biosecurity]] regulations), and thus may be searched, [[Search and seizure|impounded]] or turned back.

The term is also sometimes used to define an area (usually composed of several countries) which form a [[customs union]], a [[customs territory]], or to describe the area at airports and ports where travellers are checked through customs.

====Duty-free shops====
[[File:Pyongyang airport.JPG|thumb|Duty Free Shop at [[Pyongyang Sunan International Airport]]]]
{{main|Duty-free shop}}
Common at international airports and occasionally at seaports or land crossings, duty-free shops sell products tax-free to customers who have cleared exit border controls prior to boarding an international flight and, in some airports, to passengers arriving from overseas. Most countries impose limits on how much of each type of duty-free goods, may be purchased by each passenger. The airport with the most duty-free sales is [[Seoul Incheon Airport]] with US$1.85 billion in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url =http://www.trbusiness.com/regional-news/asia-pacific/incheon-airport-duty-free-sales-hit-us2bn-in-2016/114119}}</ref> Dubai International Airport is second, recording transactions worth $1.82 billion in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/retail/dubai-duty-free-sales-drop-on-currency-fluctuations-1.1956773|title=Dubai Duty Free sales drop on currency fluctuations|last=Reporter|first=Cleofe Maceda, Senior Web|date=2017-01-05|newspaper=GulfNews|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

===Border security===

Border security measures are border control policies adopted by a country or group of countries to fight against unauthorised travel or trade across its borders, to limit illegal immigration, combat [[transnational crime]], and prevent wanted criminals from travelling.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dhs.gov/border-security |title=Border Security |website=Department of Homeland Security |access-date=2018-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327050413/https://www.dhs.gov/border-security |archive-date=2018-03-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On the Pakistani border, the [[Border Security Force]] aims to prevent the infiltration of Indian territory by terrorists from Pakistan and other countries in the west (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, etc.).

U.S. border security focuses primarily on the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican–U.S. border]]. Security along this border is composed of many distinct elements, including physical barriers, patrol routes, lighting, and the deployment of border patrol personnel. President [[Donald Trump]]'s proposal to build [[Mexico–United States barrier|a new wall along the border]] was a major feature of his campaign, and he has since attempted to have Congress pay US$18 billion for its cost in the short term. Many citizens, including [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]], and members of the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]] who do not support President Trump, argue the necessity of border escalation, asserting that other measures would be more effective at reducing illegal immigration than building a wall, including tackling the economic issues that lead to immigration being a relevant issue altogether, border surveillance or an increase in the number of customs agents.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/us/politics/trump-border-wall-funding-surveillance.html |title=To Pay for Wall, Trump Would Cut Proven Border Security Measures |last=Nixon |first=Ron |date=2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-04 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Similar to India's barrier with Bangladesh and the proposed wall between America and Mexico, Iran has constructed a [[Iran–Pakistan border|wall on its frontier with Pakistan]]. The wall aims to reduce unauthorised border crossings<ref>{{cite news

Border security has, over the first two decades of the century, also become a major concern in the [[Schengen Area]], specifically as a result of the [[European migrant crisis]]. The [[Melilla border fence|walls at Melilla]] and [[Ceuta border fence|at Ceuta]] on Spain’s border with Morocco are a part of the trend towards increasing border security in response to an unprecedented rise in both refugees and economic migrants from countries in Sub Saharan Africa. Similar, though less drastic, measures have been taken on the Schengen area’s borders with Turkey in response to the refugee crisis created in Syria by [[terrorism|terrorist organisations]] such as [[Daesh]] and the [[Syrian Free Army]]. The creation of European Union’s collective border security organisation, [[#Frontex|Frontex]], is another aspect of the bloc’s growing focus on border security. Within the Schengen Area, border security has become an especially prominent priority for the Hungarian government under right-wing [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/30/danger-hungary-verge-full-blown-autocracy-viktor-orban-vengeance|title=Here lies danger.

[[File:ISR denied stamp.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|A misspelt stamp from the Israeli [[Taba Border Crossing]]. (Some jurisdictions - such as Germany and Israel - have historically stamped "Entry Denied" on passports.)]]
Another example of border security is the [[Barrier against tunnels along the Israel-Gaza Strip border|Israeli anti-tunnel barrier]] along its border with the [[Gaza Strip]], a part of the [[State of Palestine]] under the control of [[Hamas]] (a militant group backed by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a [[Qatar–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|Qatari-sponsored]] . In order to curtail Hamas’s ability to build tunnels into Israeli-controlled territory, Israel have built a [[slurry wall]]. Similarly, [[Saudi Arabia]] has begun construction of a border barrier or fence between its territory and [[Yemen]] to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods. The difference between the countries' economic situations means that many Yemenis head to Saudi Arabia to find work. Saudi Arabia does not have a barrier with its other neighbors in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], whose economies are more similar. In 2006 Saudi Arabia proposed constructing a security fence along the entire length of its 900 kilometre long desert border with Iraq in a multimillion-dollar project to secure the Kingdom's borders in order to improve internal security, control illegal immigration, and bolster its defences against external threats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-2126835,00.html/ |title=The Times & The Sunday Times |website=Timesonline.co.uk |accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref> As of July 2009 it was reported that Saudis will pay $3.5 billion for security fence.<ref>[http://infoprod.co.il/main/siteNew/index.php?langId=1&mod=article&action=article&Admin=qwas&stId=275 ]{{dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref> The combined wall and ditch will be 600 miles long and include five layers of fencing, watch towers, [[night-vision]] cameras, and radar cameras and manned by 30,000 troops.<ref>{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11344116/Revealed-Saudi-Arabias-Great-Wall-to-keep-out-Isil.html |title=Revealed: Saudi Arabia's 'Great Wall' to keep out Isil |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref> Elsewhere in Europe, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] began erecting a fence on its border with Greece in November 2015.<ref>Yannis Behrakis.

In 2003, [[Botswana]] began building a 480 kilometre long [[electric fence]] along its border with [[Zimbabwe]]. The official reason for the fence is to stop the spread of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] among livestock. Zimbabweans argue that the height of the fence is clearly intended to keep out people. Botswana has responded that the fence is designed to keep out cattle, and to ensure that entrants have their shoes disinfected at legal border crossings. Botswana also argued that the government continues to encourage legal movement into the country. Zimbabwe was unconvinced, and the barrier remains a source of tension.<ref>{{Cite news|periodical=BBC News|title=Zimbabwe crisis spills over border|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3582459.stm|last=Phillips|first=Barnaby|date=2004-03-30 | accessdate=January 4, 2010}}</ref>

====Border zones====

[[File:Finnish border zone sign on a tree.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Border zone marked on a tree on the [[Finland–Russia border]]: no entry.]]

Border zones are areas near borders that have special restrictions on movement. Governments may forbid unauthorised entry to or exit from border zones and restrict property ownership in the area. The zones function as [[buffer zone]]s specifically monitored by [[border guard|border patrols]] in order to prevent illegal entry or exit. Restricting entry aids in pinpointing illegal intruders, since by ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' ("no penalty without a law"), any person could be present in the area near the border, and illegal intruders, such as illegal immigrants, smugglers or spies could blend in. However, if all unauthorised presence is forbidden, their mere presence of intruders allows the authorities to arrest them. Border zones between hostile states can be heavily militarised, with [[minefield]]s, barbed wire and [[watchtower]]s. Some border zones are designed to prevent illegal immigration or emigration, and do not have many restrictions but may operate checkpoints to check immigration status. In most places, a [[border vista]] is usually included and/or required. In some nations, movement inside a border zone without a licence is an offence and will result in arrest. No probable cause is required as mere presence inside the zone is an offence, if it is intentional.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |title=Valtionrajarikos koskee Suomen rajaa - Minilex |accessdate=2016-09-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210740/http://www.minilex.fi/a/valtionrajarikos-koskee-suomen-rajaa |archive-date=2016-06-09 }}</ref> Even with a licence to enter, photography, making fires, and carrying of firearms and hunting are prohibited.

Examples of international border zones are the [[Border Security Zone of Russia]] and the Finnish border zone on the [[Finnish–Russian border]]. There are also intra-country zones such as the [[Cactus Curtain]] surrounding the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]] in Cuba, the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]] along the [[North Korea]]-[[South Korea]] demarcation line and the [[Frontier Closed Area]] in [[Hong Kong]]. Important historical examples are the [[Wire of Death]] set up by [[the German Empire]] to control the [[Belgium–Netherlands border]] and the [[Iron Curtain]], a set of border zones maintained by the Soviet Union and its satellite states along their borders with Western states. One of the most militarised parts was the [[Inner German border#Restricted zone|restricted zone of the inner German border]]. While initially and officially the zone was for border security, eventually it was engineered to prevent escape from the Soviet sphere into the West. Ultimately, the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]] governments resorted to using lethal countermeasures against those trying to cross the border, such as mined fences and orders to shoot anyone trying to cross into the West. The restrictions on building and habitation made the area a "green corridor", today established as the [[European Green Belt]].

In the area stretching inwards from its [[#Internal border controls|internal border]] with the [[Mainland China|mainland]], Hong Kong maintains a [[Frontier Closed Area]] [[Exclusion zone|out of bounds]] to those without special authorisation. The area was established in the 1950s when Hong Kong under British occupation as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]] during the [[Opium Wars]], prior to the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong]] in 1997. The purposes of the area were to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling; smuggling had become prevalent as a consequence of the Korean war. Today, under the [[one country, two systems]] policy, the area continues to be used to curtail unauthorised migration to Hong Kong and the smuggling of goods in either direction.

[[File:DMZ from North Korea side (14319637755).jpg|left|thumb|125px|Korean Demilitarised Zone as seen from the North]]

As a result of the partition of the Korean peninsula by America and the Soviet Union after World War II, and exacerbated by the subsequent [[Korean war]], there is a [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarised Zone]] spanning the [[de facto]] border between [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]. The Demilitarised Zone follows the effective boundaries as of the end of the Korean War in 1953. Similarly to the Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong, this zone and the defence apparatus that exists on both sides of the border serve to curtail unauthorised passage between the two sides. In South Korea, there is an additional fenced-off area between the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone#Civilian Control Line|Civilian Control Line]] and the start of the Demilitarised Zone, further strengthening border security

===Immigration policy===
Immigration policy is the aspect of border control concerning the transit of people into a country, especially those that intend to stay and work in the country. Taxation, tariff and trade rules set out what goods immigrants may bring with them, and what services they may perform while temporarily in the country. [[Investment policy]] sometimes permits wealthy immigrants to invest in businesses in exchange for favourable treatment and eventual naturalisation. [[Agricultural policy]] may make exemptions for migrant farm workers, who typically enter a country only for the harvest season and then return home to a country or region in the [[Global South]] (such as Mexico or Jamaica from where America and Canada, respectively, often import temporary agricultural labour).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nardep.info/uploads/Brief_FarmWorker.pdf |title=Immigration and Farm Labor in the U.S. |publisher=National Agriculture and Rural Development Policy Center |date=May 4, 2013 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> An important aspect of immigration policy is the treatment of [[refugee]]s, more or less helpless or stateless people who throw themselves on the mercy of the state they try to enter, seeking refuge from actual or purported poor treatment in their country of origin. Asylum is sometimes granted to those who face persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.

====Special areas in Europe====
[[Immigration]] policies in special areas in Europe can range from severely limiting migration, as in Greece's [[Mount Athos]], to allowing most types of migration, such as the [[free migration]]{{efn|Uniquely, the archipelago is an [[Visa policy of Svalbard|entirely visa-free zone]] under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty,<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/07/200841012024779644.html Immigrants warmly welcomed], [[Al Jazeera]], 4 July 2006.</ref> which recognises the sovereignty of Norway over the Arctic archipelago of [[Svalbard]] but subjects it to certain stipulations and consequently not all Norwegian law applies, including border controls. The treaty regulates the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarisation]] of the archipelago. The signatories were given equal rights to engage in commercial activities (mainly [[coal mining]]) on the islands. {{asof|2012}}, Norway and Russia are making use of this right.}} policy in force in [[Svalbard]]. Similar policies are in force for Iran's [[Kish Island|Kish]] and [[Qeshm Island|Qeshm]], {{IPA-fa|ɢeʃm}}) islands, and for Iraqi Kurdistan.

====Diaspora communities====
[[File:OCI JK.jpg|thumb|140px|An OCI booklet exempting its bearer from usual immigration controls in India.]] [[File:Karta Polaka wzór.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''Karta Polaka'' – specimen document]]

Certain countries adopt immigration policies designed to be favourable towards members of diaspora communities with a connection to the country. For example, the Indian government confers Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status on foreign citizens of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian origin]] to live and work indefinitely in India. OCI status was introduced in response to demands for [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] by the Indian diaspora, particularly in countries with large populations of Indian origin. It was introduced by ''The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2005'' in August 2005.<ref>[http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI); Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926231018/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=553 |date=2009-09-26 }}, [http://www.moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 Diaspora Services: Overseas Citizenship of India Scheme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504131659/http://moia.gov.in/services.aspx?id1=35&id=m3&idp=35&mainid=23 |date=2012-05-04 }}</ref> In the [[ASEAN]] region, a large portion of the Singaporean, Malaysian, and Bruneian population hold OCI status. Large OCI communities also exist in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as in many African nations (particularly South Africa, Madagascar, and members of the [[East African Community]]). OCI status exempts holders from immigration controls generally imposed upon others of the same nationality.

Similarly, Poland issues the [[Karta Polaka]] to citizens of certain northeast European countries with Polish ancestry.

A British Ancestry visa is a document issued by the United Kingdom to [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with a grandparent born in the United Kingdom, [[Channel Islands]] or [[Isle of Man]] who wish to work in the United Kingdom. Similar to OCI status, it exempts members of the country’s diaspora from usual immigration controls. It is used mainly by young Australians, New Zealanders, Canadians and South Africans of [[British diaspora|British descent]] coming to UK to work and as a base to explore Europe.<ref name=tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/21/nvisa121.xml |title=Britain may abolish ancestry visa |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Philip |last=Johnston |date=21 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326202004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2008%2F02%2F21%2Fnvisa121.xml |archive-date=March 26, 2008 }}</ref>

Some nations recognise a [[right of return]] for people with ancestry in that country. A notable example of this is the right of [[Sephardi Jews]] to acquire Spanish nationality by virtue of their community’s Spanish origins. Similar exemptions to immigration controls exist for people of Armenian origin seeking to acquire Armenian citizenship. Ghana, similarly, grants an indefinite right to stay in Ghana to members of the [[African diaspora]] regardless of citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-a-place-for-african-americans-to-resettle.html |title=Ghana, a place for African Americans to resettle |last=Dovi |first=Efam |date=11 May 2015 |website=The Africa Report|access-date=15 August 2018 }}</ref>

===International zones===
An international zone is a type of [[extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] area not fully subject to any country’s border control policies. The term most commonly refers to the areas of [[international airports]] after border exit controls or before border entry controls. These areas often contain duty-free shopping, but they are not fully extraterritorial. It is usually possible to transfer between flights without needing either the passport check or visa otherwise needed to enter the country. In areas of conflict there may be international zones called green zones that form protective enclaves to keep diplomats safe. Countries in conflict may also have international zones separating each other. Some of the international zones are subject to [[international law]].

====Airport transit areas====
The international zone in an [[international airport]] is the area where arriving international passengers have not formally entered the country by clearing arrival customs and immigration controls, and departing passengers have formally exited the country by clearing exit immigration control. Transit passengers can take connecting international flights in the international zone without clearing customs and immigration controls, and in most cases do not require a [[travel visa|visa]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Former Colleague Aided U.S. In Trapping Ex-C.I.A. Agent |quote=After his arrival in the early evening, he met with Mr. Keiser, a lawyer from Geneva and several other associates, never leaving the international zone of the Zurich airport.

''We were told to stay in the international zone and not to go through customs in Zurich,'' Mr. Thompson said. |work=The New York Times |date=June 27, 1982 }}</ref> Some countries, however, require transit passengers of certain nationalities to hold a direct airside transit visa<ref>{{cite web|title=Visa to pass through the UK in transit|url=https://www.gov.uk/transit-visa/direct-airside-transit-visa|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=2016-12-30}}</ref> even when they would not need to pass through border controls.

A major exception is the United States and Canada, where airports have no international transit zones. All passengers arriving on international flights are subject to customs and immigration inspections. Hence, transiting at a U.S. or Canada airport require at least a [[C-1 visa|C-1 transit visa]]/[[Visa policy of Canada#Transit|Canadian Transit Visa]], or a [[Electronic System for Travel Authorization|ESTA]]/[[Visa policy of Canada#Electronic_Travel_Authorization|eTA]] for eligible travellers.

A common feature of the international zone is [[duty-free]] shopping for departing and transit passengers, and in some cases arriving passengers subject to duty-free allowances.

International zones in airports are fully under the jurisdiction of the country where they are located and local laws apply. Persons caught committing an unlawful act (e.g. possession of contraband such as illegal drugs) in the international zone are liable for prosecution.

* The [[Tomb of Suleyman Shah]] is, according to Ottoman tradition, the grave (tomb, mausoleum) housing the relics of [[Suleyman Shah]] (c. 1178–1236), grandfather of [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), the founder of the [[Ottoman Empire]], ''{{transl|ota|Devlet-i ʿAlīye-i ʿOsmānīye}}''). This legendary tomb has since 1236 had three locations, all in present-day Syria. From 1236 until 1973, its first location was near castle [[Qal'at Ja'bar]]  in present-day [[Raqqa Governorate]], Syria. Under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), breaking up the Ottoman Empire into Turkey, Syria and other states, the tomb site at castle [[Qal'at Ja'bar]] remained the property of Turkey. Article 9 of the [[Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Ankara]], signed by France and Turkey in 1921, states that the tomb of Suleyman Shah (at its first location) "shall remain, with its appurtenances, the property of Turkey, who may appoint guardians for it and may hoist the Turkish flag there".<ref>{{cite web |title=Franco-Turkish agreement of Ankara |url=http://www.hri.org/docs/FT1921/Franco-Turkish_Pact_1921.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2014 |language=fr, en}}</ref>

* During the late [[Qing dynasty|Qing years]], significant portions of Chinese territory, primarily along the coast, were surrendered as [[Concessions in China|Concessions]] to occupying powers including many European powers as well as Japan. Each concession had its own police force, and different legal jurisdictions with their own separate laws. Thus, an activity might be legal in one concession but illegal in another. Many of the concessions also maintained their own military garrison and standing army. Military and police forces of the Chinese government were sometimes present. Some police forces allowed Chinese, others did not. In these concessions, the citizens of each foreign power were given the right to freely inhabit, trade, [[missionary|spread religious propaganda]], and travel. They developed their own sub-cultures, isolated and distinct from the intrinsic [[Chinese culture]], and colonial administrations attempted to give their concessions "homeland" qualities. Churches, [[public house]]s, and various other western commercial institutions sprang up in the concessions. In the case of Japan, its own traditions and language naturally flourished. Some of these concessions eventually had more advanced architecture of each originating culture than most cities back in the countries of the foreign powers origin. Chinese were originally forbidden from most of the concessions, but to improve commercial activity and services, by the 1860s most concessions permitted Chinese, but treated them like second-class citizens as they were not citizens of the foreign state administering the concession.  They eventually became the majority of the residents inside the concessions. Non-Chinese in the concessions were generally subject to [[Consul (representative)|consular]] law, and some of these laws applied to the Chinese residents. Notable Concessions include the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] administered by the United Kingdom and America, the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession in Shanghai]], the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]], and the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]].
* Iraq has an international zone around the Republican Palace in central [[Baghdad]] in a crook of the Tigris River. This area was and still is the heavily fortified headquarters for the coalition and Iraqi Reconstruction Ministries.

[[File:Allied occupation sectors in Vienna (1945-1955).png|thumb|The four sectors of occupation in Vienna between 1945–1955.]]
* French, British, American and Soviet troops divided [[Vienna]] into [[Allied-occupied Austria|four zones]], and a small international zone of the [[Innere Stadt|historical centre of Vienna]] was governed in rotation by troops of those countries.
* During the [[Cold War]] and division of [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin Friedrichstraße station|Friedrichstraße station]], despite being located entirely in [[East Berlin]], [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] and [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] trains from [[West Berlin]] continued to serve the station. West Berliners were able to transfer between the S-Bahn and U-Bahn, or to long distance trains to the West without passing through [[East Germany|East German]] border controls. The West Berlin section of the station featured an East German government-run [[Intershop]], which sold duty-free and high-quality items at lower prices compared to the West. The station was also the site of a major border crossing between West and East Berlin, where West Berliners and other travellers with appropriate papers may enter East Germany.
* No country has sovereignty over [[International waters]]. All states have the freedom of fishing, navigation, overflight, laying cables and pipelines, as well as research. Oceans, seas, and waters outside national jurisdiction are also referred to as the high seas or, in [[Latin]], ''mare liberum'' (meaning ''free sea''). The [[Convention on the High Seas]], signed in 1958, which has 63 signatories, defined "high seas" to mean "all parts of the sea that are not included in the [[territorial sea]] or in the [[internal waters]] of a State" and where "no State may validly purport to subject any part of them to its sovereignty."<ref>Text of [http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/entri/texts/high.seas.1958.html Convention on the High Seas] (U.N.T.S.

[[File:UN Palestine Partition Versions 1947.jpg|thumb|United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, showing the city of Jerusalem as an international zone]]
* Under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], the city of [[Jerusalem]] was supposed to become an [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|International Zone]]. This was never implemented; the city was the scene of fierce fighting in 1948 which culminated in its partition between Israel and Jordan. Nineteen years later in 1967 the Jordanian-occupied part was captured and unilaterally annexed by Israel. However, the idea of an international zone in Jerusalem, encompassing at least the highly sensitive [[Old City of Jerusalem]], continues to be floated by various would-be mediators. Whilst it is often asserted that the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist community]] favoured this plan, scholars such as [[Simha Flapan]] have determined that it is a myth that Zionists accepted the partition as a compromise by which the Jewish community abandoned ambitions for the whole of Palestine and recognised the rights of the Arab Palestinians to their own state. Rather, Flapan argued, acceptance was only a tactical move that aimed to thwart the creation of an Arab Palestinian state and, concomitantly, expand the territory that had been assigned by the UN to the Jewish state.<ref>Simha Flapan (1988).

* [[Dejima]] was a port near the Japanese city of Nagasaki that was ceded to Dutch administration between 1641 and 1854. During the [[Edo period]], it was Japan’s only point of interaction with the outside world. The 25 local Japanese families who owned the land received an annual rent from the Dutch. Dejima was a small island, 120 metres by 75 metres,<ref>Ken Vos – The article "Dejima als venster en doorgeefluik" in the catalogue (Brussels, 5 October 1989 – 16 December 1989) of the exhibition Europalia 1989 : "Oranda : De Nederlanden in Japan (1600–1868)</ref> linked to the mainland by a small bridge, guarded on both sides, and with a gate on the Dutch side. It contained houses for about twenty Dutchmen, warehouses, and accommodation for Japanese officials. The Dutch were watched by a number of Japanese officials, gatekeepers, night watchmen, and a supervisor with about fifty subordinates. Numerous merchants supplied goods and catering, and about 150 interpreters served. They all had to be paid by the Dutch East India Company. For two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.  The Japanese were likewise banned from entering Dejima, except interpreters, cooks, carpenters, clerks and 'Women of Pleasure' from the Maruyama teahouses. These ''[[Prostitution in Japan|yūjo]]'' were handpicked from 1642 by the Japanese, often against their will. From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following the policy of promoting European practical sciences implemented by [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]. A limited number of Japanese were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post. Once a year the Europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the Suwa-Shrine under escort. Sometimes physicians such as [[Engelbert Kaempfer]], [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], and [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] were called to high-ranking Japanese patients with the permission of the authorities.<ref>''In the context of Commodore Perry's "opening" of Japan in 1853, American naval expedition planners incorporated reference material written by men whose published accounts of Japan were based on first-hand experience.

* The United Kingdom and France established "international zones" or "control zones" at both ends of the [[Channel Tunnel]], which crosses underneath the [[English Channel]]. British authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the French side, and French authorities exercise authority within the control zone on the UK side. Violations in the control zone are treated as if they occurred within the territory of the adjoining state within that zone, and extradition is not required to remove a violator to the operating state for prosecution.

[[File:Free Territory of Trieste Map.svg|thumb|Map of Trieste, showing its two administrative zones, one of which was later absorbed by each of its two neighbours (Slovenia and Croatia were both part of Yugoslavia at the time).]]
* The [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was an international zone bordering Italy and [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], facing the north part of the [[Adriatic Sea]], under [[List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1 to 100|direct responsibility]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in the aftermath of [[World War II]], as a result of competing Italian and Yugoslav claims that arose from the conflict. Italy fought with the [[Axis powers]] during the war, and when the Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 and Italy capitulated, the territory was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht|forces]] who created the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]], the capital of which was Trieste. The [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav 4th Army]] and the Slovenian 9th Corps entered Trieste on 1 May 1945, after a battle in the town of [[Opicina]]. The [[2nd Division (New Zealand)]] arrived on the next day and forced the surrender of the 2,000 [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to partisan troops, fearing they would be executed by them. An uneasy truce developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops occupying the area until British Gen. [[William Duthie Morgan|Sir William Morgan]] proposed a partition of the territory and the removal of Yugoslav troops from the area occupied by the Allies. Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] agreed in principle on 23 May, as the British XIII Corps was moving forward to the proposed demarcation line. An agreement was signed in [[Duino]] on 10 June, creating the [[Morgan Line]]. The Yugoslav troops withdrew by 12 June 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=587|title=Stanford University|website=stanford.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721202106/http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/wais/cgi-bin/index.php?p=587|archive-date=21 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashburtonguardian.co.nz/index.asp?articleid=5112|title=Ashburton Guardian|website=ashburtonguardian.co.nz|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627095427/http://www.ashburtonguardian.co.nz/index.asp?articleid=5112|archive-date=27 June 2006}}</ref> Consequently, the area was designated an international zone as part of a bid to maintain this truce after the end of the war.

It bordered the new [[Italy|Italian Republic]] to the north, and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] to the south and to the east. The Free Territory was established on 10 February 1947 by a protocol of the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] in order to accommodate an ethnically and culturally mixed population in a neutral environment free from the rule of either country.

* The [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line]] separating [[Cyprus|Southern Cyprus]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] is considered an International Zone because the [[United Nations]] operate and patrol within the buffer zone. The buffer zone was established in 1974 due to ethnic tensions between [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]]. The green line is a demilitarised zone and thus acts in the same way as the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|38th parallel]] separating the Republic of Korea and North Korea.

==Specific requirements==

The degree of strictness of border controls varies across countries and borders. In some countries, controls may be targeted at the traveller's religion, ethnicity, nationality, or other countries that have been visited. Others may need to be certain the traveller has paid the appropriate fees for their [[visa (document)|visas]] and has future travel planned out of the country. Yet others may concentrate on the contents of the traveler's baggage, and imported goods to ensure nothing is being carried that might bring a [[biosecurity]] risk into the country.

===Border vistas===

[[File:Border vista.jpg|thumb|upright|The vista along the [[Canada–United States border]], as seen from a [[Rest area|wayside]] on the [[Alaska Highway]].]]
A border vista or boundary vista is a defined cleared space between two areas of foliage located at an international border intended to provide a clear demarcation line between the two areas. Border vistas are most commonly found along undefended international boundary lines, where border security is not as much of a necessity and a built barrier is undesired, and are a treaty requirement for certain borders.

An example of a border vista is a six-metre cleared space around unguarded portions of the [[Canada–United States border]].<ref>[[Stacy Schiff|Schiff, Stacy]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/opinion/22schiff.html "Politics Starts at the Border"], ''The New York Times''. 22 July 2007. Accessed 3 August 2018.</ref>

Similar clearings along the border line are provided for by many international treaties. For example, the 2006 border management treaty [[China–Russia border|between Russia and China]] provides for a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} cleared strip along the two nations' border.<ref>[http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the management of the Russia-China international border] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062825/http://www.rosgranitsa.ru/ru/node/3140 |date=2015-07-09 }}, rosgranitsa.ru</ref>

===Travel documents===
{{see also|Travel document|Passport}}

Different countries impose varying travel document regulations and requirements as part of their border control policies and these may vary based on the traveller's mode of transport. For instance, whilst America does not subject passengers departing by land or most boats to any border control, it does require that passengers departing by air hold a valid passport (or certain specific passport-replacing documents). Even though travellers might not be required to have a passport to enter a certain country, they ''will'' be required to have a valid passport booklet ([[US passport|booklet]] only, [[U.S. Passport Card]] not accepted) to depart the United States in order to satisfy U.S. immigration authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iata.org/publications/timatic/Documents/using_timatic_v3.pdf|title=Page 7 of IATA document accessed 5 December 2015 at|access-date=2 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051323/https://www.iata.org/publications/timatic/Documents/using_timatic_v3.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:FRTD.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Facilitated Rail Transit Document issued in Saint Petersburg for travel to Kaliningrad]]

Other countries, including most countries in Western Europe and China, permit (or in China's case [[Home Return Permit|require]]) citizens to utilise [[national identity cards]] to clear immigration when travelling between adjacent jurisdictions. As a consequence of awkward border situations created by the fall of the Soviet Union, certain former members of the USSR and their neighbours require few or no travel documents for travellers transiting across international boundaries between two points in a single country. For instance, [[Russia]] permits vehicles to transit across the [[Saatse Boot]] between the Estonian villages of [[Lutepää]] and [[Sesniki]] without any border control provided that they do not stop. Similar provisions are made for the issuance of Facilitated Rail Transit Documents by Schengen Area members for travel between [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and the Russian mainland.

====Indian Identity Certificate====
The Indian government issues Identity Certificates to members of the large Tibetan exile community. Identity Certificates are generally issued upon request of the Dalai Lama’s Tibetan government in exile based in Dharamsala in northern India. This document is accepted as per most countries border control policies in lieu of a passport, although it is not a machine readable document. When issued to a Tibetan residing in India, it is invariably endorsed as being valid for return to India and therefore exempts the holder from requiring a visa to clear Indian border controls upon re-entry.

====Non-citizen residents====
[[File:United States Travel Document Cover Page.jpg|thumb|120px|The US re-entry permit is a travel document for permanent residents issued on request.]] [[File:2017-us-green-card-specimen.png|thumb|120px|U.S. Green Card issued to all permanent residents.]] [[File:Japan Re-entry Permit 2012.png|thumb|left|120px|Japan re-entry permit issued to Japanese North Koreans and other stateless permanent residents of Japan]]

Some countries issue travel documents to permanent residents (i.e. foreign citizens permitted to reside there indefinitely) or other non-citizens, usually for re-entry but also occasionally valid for international travel.

The [[U.S. Re-entry Permit]] is an example of such a document. Valid for international travel, it is issued to lawful permanent residents temporarily expatriating overseas. Unlike the [[Permanent residence (United States)|”Green Card”]] issued to all permanent residents, this document is not mandatory. The U.S. “Green Card”, on its own or in conjunction with a passport, is valid for international travel albeit not to the same extent as the re-entry permit. Both documents can be utilised to clear U.S. border controls regardless of the bearers nationality, thus resulting in America not requiring permanent residents to hold a passport from their home country in order to remain lawfully present or to lawfully enter.

Singapore issues [[National Registration Identity Card|national identity cards]] to permanent residents in the same manner as it does to citizens, but additionally requires any permanent resident travelling abroad to hold a valid electronic re-entry permit and a passport or other travel document from their home country. Singapore permanent residents who are stateless are issued booklet-form [[Singapore Certificate of Identity|Certificates of Identity]] in lieu of a passport.

Indonesia issues the [[Paspor Orang Asing]] to its stateless permanent residents.

Non-citizens [[Non-citizen (Latvia)|in Latvia]] and [[Estonian nationality law|in Estonia]] are individuals, primarily of Russian or Ukrainian ethnicity, who are not citizens of Latvia or Estonia but whose families have resided in the area since the Soviet era, and thus have the right to a non-citizen passport issued by the Latvian government as well as other specific rights. Approximately two thirds of them are [[Russians in Latvia|ethnic Russians]], followed by ethnic Belarussians, ethnic Ukrainians, ethnic Poles and ethnic Lithuanians.<ref name="pmlp.gov.lv">[http://www.pmlp.gov.lv/lv/assets/documents/statistika/01.01.2015/ISVN_Latvija_pec_TTB_VPD.pdf Population of Latvia by ethnicity and nationality; Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs] 2015{{in lang|lv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Likumi/On_the_Status_of_those_Former_U.S.S.R._Citizens.doc|title=Section 1 and Section 8, Law "On the Status of those Former U.S.S.R.

Hong Kong and Macau issue permanent resident cards to all permanent residents including those without Chinese citizenship. They also issue the [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]] and [[Macao Special Administrative Region Travel Permit|Macau Travel Permit]], respectively, to stateless permanent residents and to Chinese citizens temporarily residing in the region holding neither permanent residence of Hong Kong or Macau nor residence status in the mainland.

Similarly, [[Chōsen-seki|Japanese North Koreans]] are issued a Japan Re-entry Permit for international travel.

====National identity cards and birth certificates====

| footer = Argentinian [[Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina)|National ID card]] valid for travel to other [[Mercosur]] countries in lieu of a passport
}}

Certain jurisdictions permit the use of national identity cards to clear border controls. For instance, when travelling between India and Nepal or Bhutan, Indian citizens may utilise national voter ID cards, ration cards, or [[Aadhar|national identity cards]]. Indian citizens may also obtain identity slips at the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing if they intend to proceed beyond city limits as Phuentsholing, the financial capital of Bhutan, is de facto within India’s visa and customs area. When travelling to India, citizens of Nepal and Bhutan can utilise similar documents. Children may use birth certificates as proof of identity.

In North America, U.S. citizens may travel using [[United States Passport Card|passport cards]], a form of voluntary identity card issued to U.S. citizens. Children holding Canadian or U.S. citizenship may travel to and from Canada using birth certificates under certain circumstances. In South America, many [[Mercosur]] countries reciprocally permit travel using identity cards.

In western Europe, travel using identity cards is relatively common for citizens of the European Economic Area and adjacent territories. This includes travel to and from Turkey for certain citizens of other countries in western Europe. Within the Schengen Area, there are limited border controls in place and national identity cards may be used to clear them.

====Chinese Travel Document====
[[File:TD PRC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Chinese Travel Document]]
The Chinese Government requires certain people to enter the mainland using a [[Chinese Travel Document]]. Some cases include:
* When it is "inconvenient", "unnecessary", or not permitted to issue a [[People's Republic of China passport]] to Chinese nationals.<ref>[http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-06/01/content_3133.htm What's the difference between a Travel Document and a Passport?] {{in lang|zh}} Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.</ref>
* Chinese nationals residing in [[Mainland China]] who lost their passport while travelling abroad may apply for this document as an emergency passport for returning to China.
* Chinese nationals who are permanent residents of Hong Kong and [[Macau]] intending to enter Mainland China directly from other countries without a [[Home Return Permit]].
* Residents of the Taiwan area{{efn|name=ROC}} intending to enter Mainland China or Hong Kong directly from other countries, who are Chinese nationals according to Chinese law. Travelling to Hong Kong, however, requires a separate application for a visa-like entry permit.
* Chinese nationals born abroad who acquired Chinese nationality at birth in accordance with the [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China]] through ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. The Chinese Travel Document is issued as a Chinese identification and travel document.
* Chinese nationals born in China who do not have a Hukou in China and who have exited China using an exit permit. This could include a person who holds a non-Chinese passport.

====Enhanced Driving Licence====
An [[Enhanced Drivers License|Enhanced Driving Licence]] is a document issued by provincial and state authorities in Canada and America that enables its bearer to clear land border controls along the border between the two countries. It is not valid for air travel and does not permit its holder to clear border controls at airports. It also serves as a valid driving licence. Certain provinces and states may issue similar enhanced versions of regional identity cards issued to individuals who do not drive.

====Quilantan entry====
A ‘Quilantan’ or ‘Wave Through’ Entry is a phenomenon in U.S. border control law authorising a form of non-standard but legal entry without any inspection of travel documents. It occurs when the border security personnel present at a border crossing choose to summarily admit some number of persons without performing a standard interview or document examination.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Matter of Graciela QUILANTAN, Respondent |reporter=A095 426 631 |court=Board of Immigration Appeals |date=2010-07-28 |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2014/07/25/3688.pdf }}</ref>

Typically this can occur when an official border crossing is busy and an immigration officer waves a car through without first checking all passengers for their travel documents. If an individual can prove that they were waved into the United States in this manner, then they are considered to have entered with inspection despite not having answered any questions or received a passport [[Passport stamp|entry stamp]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=Because she wasn't trying to sneak across and hadn't been questioned by the immigration officer who waved them into Texas, the court found she had been "inspected and admitted" legally. }}</ref>

This definition of legal entry does not apply to situations where foreigners entered the United States but have not crossed at a legal, manned border station. Thus it does not provide a path to legal residency for those who have entered into the United States by crossing accidental gaps in the borders around geological formations.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matter of Quilantan helps immigrant |journal=Lexis/Nexis |date=2012-01-17 |last=Kowalski |first=Daniel M. |url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/immigration/b/insidenews/archive/2012/01/17/matter-of-quilantan-helps-immigrant.aspx?Redirected=true |accessdate=2017-12-07 |quote=The case doesn't apply to millions of undocumented immigrants who crossed rivers, mountains and deserts, evading U.S. immigration officials. }}</ref>

====Border areas====
[[File:Border Crossing Card.jpg|thumb|right|The front of the updated version of the U.S. Border Crossing Card issued to Mexican nationals]]
In certain cases, countries adopt border control policies imposing reduced border controls for frequent travellers intending to remain within a [[border area]]. For example, the relaxed border controls maintained by Bhutan for those not proceeding past Phuentsholing and certain other border cities enable travellers to enter without going through any document check whatsoever. The U.S. [[Border Crossing Card]] issued to Mexican nationals enables Mexicans to enter border areas without a passport.{{efn|As a standalone document, the BCC allows Mexican citizens to visit border areas in America when entering by land or sea directly from Mexico for less than 72 hours.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mx.usembassy.gov/visas/domestic-employees/frequently-asked-questions/?_ga=1.54366443.213467364.1464033918 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |access-date=2018-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807002124/https://mx.usembassy.gov/visas/domestic-employees/frequently-asked-questions/?_ga=1.54366443.213467364.1464033918 |archive-date=2018-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The document also functions as a full B1/B2 visa when presented with a valid Mexican passport.<ref name="BCC1">{{Cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1670?language=en_US|title=CBP Customer Service|website=help.cbp.gov}}</ref>}} Both America and Bhutan maintain [[#Internal borders|interior checkposts]] to enforce compliance.

Similarly, Schengen states which share an external land border with a non-EU member state are authorised by virtue of the EU Regulation 1931/2006 to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring third countries for the purpose of implementing a [[local border traffic]] regime.<ref>Corrigendum to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1931R%2801%29:EN:NOT OJ L 29, 3 February 2007, p. 3]).</ref> Such agreements define a [[border area]] on either side of the border, and provide for the issuance of local border traffic permits to residents of the border area. Permits may be used to cross the EU external border within the border area, are not stamped on crossing the border and must display the holder's name and photograph, as well as a statement that its holder is not authorised to move outside the border area and that any abuse shall be subject to penalties.

===Agricultural restrictions===

In certain countries, border control focuses extensively on curtailing and regulating the import of foreign agricultural products. For example, Australian border controls restrict most (if not all) food products, certain wooden products and other similar items.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/travelling/arriving-in-australia |title = Department of Agriculture Fact sheet - Travelling or returning to Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://newzealand.embassy.gov.au/wltn/customsfaq.html |title = Australian High Commission in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907224853/https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/busi/cargo-support-trade-and-goods/importing-goods/prohibited-and-restricted |archive-date=2018-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Similar restrictions exist in Canada, America and New Zealand.

===Drugs===
[[File:SingaporeEmbarkationCard.png|thumb|160px|Singapore arrival card warning visitors about the [[Capital punishment for drug trafficking|death penalty for drug trafficking]].]]
Border controls in many countries in the Greater India region prioritise mitigating trade in narcotics. For instance, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia impose mandatory death sentences on individuals caught smuggling restricted substances across their borders. For example, Muhammad Ridzuan Ali was executed in Singapore on 19 May 2017 for drug trafficking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Singaporean drug trafficker executed at Changi Prison for heroin offence|url=http://str.sg/4u3w|accessdate=21 August 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=19 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> India and Malaysia are focusing resources on eliminating drug smuggling from Myanmar and Thailand respectively. The issue stems largely from the high output of dangerous and illegal drugs in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] as well as in regions further west such as Afghanistan.

A similar problem exists east of the Pacific, and has resulted in countries such as Mexico and America tightening border control in response to the northward flow of illegal substances from regions such as Colombia. The [[Mexican Drug War]] and similar cartel activity in neighbouring areas has exacerbated the problem.

===Visas===
[[File:Indian Tourist Visa 2016 stamped.jpg|150px|thumb|Example of a tourist visa placed directly inside the travel document of a stateless individual.]] [[File:Singapore visa issued to stateless person.jpg|thumb|135px|left|Multiple entry visa issued to a [[statelessness|stateless]] person, whose lack of nationality is indicated with the code XXA]] [[File:Malaysia ENTRI.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Sample of printed out eNTRI slip for Indian and mainland Chinese citizens to clear Malaysian border controls without a visa.]]
[[File:Thai Visa on Arrival.jpg|105px|thumb|left|Visa issued on arrival in Thailand]]

Most countries impose visa requirements on foreign nationals, and depending on the country's border control strategy these can be liberal or restrictive.

Many countries in the Greater India region have liberalised their visa controls in recent years to encourage transnational business and tourism. For example, [[Visa policy of India|India]], [[Visa policy of Myanmar|Myanmar]], and [[Visa policy of Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] have introduced electronic visas to make border control less of a bureaucratic hurdle for business travellers and tourists. [[Visa policy of Malaysia|Malaysia]] has introduced similar eVisa facilities, and has also introduced the eNTRI programme to expedite clearance for Indian citizens and Chinese citizens from the mainland. [[Visa policy of Thailand|Thailand regularly issues]] visas on arrival to many non-exempt visitors at major ports of entry in order to encourage tourism. Indonesia, in recent years, has progressively liberalised [[Visa policy of Indonesia|its visa regime]], no longer requiring visas or on-arrival visas from most nationals, while [[Visa policy of Singapore|Singapore]] has signed visa waiver agreements with many countries in recent years and has introduced electronic visa facilities for Indians, Eastern Europeans, and mainland Chinese. This trend towards visa liberalisation in the Greater India region is part of the broader phenomenon of [[globalisation]] and has been linked to heightened economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/south-east-asia-can-benefit-greatly-from-globalisation-if-countries-work-together-ong|title=Asia can benefit greatly from globalisation if countries work together: Ong Ye Kung|date=4 June 2017|accessdate=20 August 2018}}</ref>

Certain countries, predominantly but not exclusively in western Europe and the Americas, issue [[working holiday visa]]s for younger visitors to supplement their travel funds by working minor jobs. These are especially common in members of the European Union such as Austria, and elsewhere in western Europe such as Switzerland and Ukraine.

Saudi Arabia issues a [[Visa policy of Saudi Arabia#Hajj visas|special category visa]] for people on religious pilgrimage. Similar policies are in force in other countries with significant religious sites.

Certain jurisdictions impose special visa requirements on [[journalism|journalists]] in order to curtail the freedom of foreign reporters and news organisations to report on controversial topics. Countries that impose such visas include Cuba, [[Visa policy of China|China]], North Korea, Saudi Arabia, [[Visa policy of the United States#I visa|America]] and Zimbabwe.

In the Philippines, in addition to U.S. visas, nationals of India and China can use several alternative visas to clear border controls. Nationals of China from the Mainland travelling as tourists and holding a valid visa issued by Australia, Canada, Japan, United States, or a Schengen Area state may enter and stay without a visa for up to 7 days. Nationals of India holding a valid tourist, business or resident visa issued by Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, or a Schengen Area state may enter and stay without a visa for up to 14 days. They may enter from any port of entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/travel-tourism/now-indians-can-travel-visa-free-to-the-philippines/71394/|title=Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines|author=The Financial Express|website=www.financialexpress.com|accessdate=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008203806/http://www.financialexpress.com/article/lifestyle/travel-tourism/now-indians-can-travel-visa-free-to-the-philippines/71394/|archive-date=8 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] lets passengers in transit enter for up to thirty days utilising an Australian, Canadian, U.S., or Schengen visa.

Bermuda, a British territory, has ceased to issue its own visas and instead requires that travellers either clear immigration visa-free in one of the three countries (Canada, the United States, and United Kingdom) to/from which it has direct flights, or hold a visa for one of them.

===Electronic Travel Authorisations===
An Electronic Travel Authorisation or Electronic Travel Authority is a kind of pre-arrival registration, which is not officially classified as a [[Travel visa|visa]], required for foreign travellers to a country who normally do not require a visa under some circumstances. Different from a proper visa which the traveller normally has no recourse if rejected, if an ETA is rejected the traveller can choose to apply for a visa instead. Many countries require individuals who do not require a visa to enter to hold an Electronic Travel Authorisation instead.

==== Sri Lanka ====
{{main|Electronic Travel Authorization (Sri Lanka)}}
Travellers to Sri Lanka must get an Electronic Travel Authorisation prior to getting a visa on arrival at the entry port, except for a few countries where the ETA is exempted, and for a few countries where a visa must be got in advance. Citizens of India, Pakistan, and other countries in the northwestern part of Asia receive discounted ETAs.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/fees.jsp#profee |title = Online Visa Application}}</ref>

{{main|Electronic Travel Authority (Australia)}}

Development of the Electronic Travel Authority system commenced in January 1996. It was first implemented in Singapore on a trial basis on 11 September 1996, for holders of Singapore and US passports travelling on Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Implementation of online applications began in June 2001.<ref name=factsheet>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet 53 – Australia's Entry System for Visitors|url=http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/53entry-system|publisher=Department of Immigration and Border Protection|accessdate=30 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817235342/http://www.border.gov.au/about/corporate/information/fact-sheets/53entry-system|archive-date=2015-08-17|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Policy study on an EU Electronic System for travel Authorization (EU ESTA) – Annexes: Introduction of the ETA, eVisitor and eVisa systems|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/e-library/docs/pdf/esta_annexes_en.pdf|publisher=PricewaterhouseCoopers|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> The current ETA came into effect on 23 March 2013 replacing older ETAs (subclass 976, 977 and 956) while offering a single authorization for both tourist and business purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for Electronic Travel Authority (subclass 601)|url=http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/seol/FAQ_601.html#Q1|publisher=Australian Embassy, Republic of Korea|accessdate=25 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927084216/http://www.southkorea.embassy.gov.au/seol/FAQ_601.html#Q1|archive-date=27 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The ETA allows the holder to visit Australia for unlimited times, up to 3 months per visit, in a 12-month period for tourism or business purposes. There is no visa application charge but a service charge of AU$20 applies for applications lodged online. At the time of travel to, and entry into, Australia, all holders of an ETA must be free from tuberculosis and must not have any criminal convictions for which the sentence or sentences (whether served or not) total 12 months or more.<ref name=ETA>{{cite web|title=Electronic Travel Authority (Subclass 601)|url=https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/601-|publisher=Department of Immigration and Border Protection|accessdate=30 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212173727/http://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/601-|archive-date=12 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Hong Kong ====
Indian nationals and [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese nationals]] from [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the Republic of China{{efn|name=ROC}} do not require a visa to enter [[Hong Kong]], but must apply for a pre-arrival registration (PAR) prior to arrival. If not successful, Indian travellers may apply for a visa instead. Taiwanese people are eligible only if they were born in Taiwan or entered Hong Kong as an ROC nationals before, otherwise they should instead apply for an entry permit (a de facto visa) to enter Hong Kong using their [[Republic of China passport]]. They may alternatively enter Hong Kong using a [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] issued by Mainland Chinese authorities without any additional permit.

====North America====
{{main|Electronic System for Travel Authorization|Electronic Travel Authorization (Canada)}}
East of the Pacific, both America and Canada have introduced electronic travel authorisations. Travellers from visa-free countries entering Canada by air, except [[United States nationality law|U.S. nationals]] (including those with and without full citizenship), must obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation prior to arrival but not if arriving by land or sea. Travellers under the U.S. [[Visa Waiver Program]]me are required to obtain permission through the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation if arriving America by air or cruise but not if entering by land or by ferry, using a passport issued by the Government of Bermuda to a [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]], or if entering as a Canadian citizen.

Travellers from [[Brazil]] normally require a visa to enter Canada, but are eligible to apply for an ETA if they have held a Canadian visa within the 10 years prior to applying, or if they currently hold a valid non-immigrant U.S. visa. Such travellers still may not enter Canada by land or sea without a valid Canadian visa.

===Exit controls===

Whilst most countries implement border controls both at entry and at exit, some jurisdictions do not. For instance, USA and Canada do not implement exit controls at land borders and collect exit data on foreign nationals through airlines and through information sharing with neighbouring countries’ entry border controls. These countries consequently don't issue exit stamps even to travellers who require stamps on entry. Similarly, Australia, Singapore and South Korea have eliminated exit stamps even though they continue to implement brief border control checks upon exit for most foreign nationals.

====Exit visas====
Some countries in Europe maintain controversial exit visa systems in addition to regular border controls. For instance, Uzbekistan requires its own citizens to obtain exit visas prior to leaving for countries other than [[Commonwealth of Independent States|fellow CIS]] nations in eastern Europe. Several [[Gulf Cooperation Council|countries in the Arabian peninsula]] require exit visas for foreign workers under the [[Kafala System]] meaning "sponsorship system"). Russia occasionally requires foreigners who overstay to obtain [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|exit visas]] since one cannot exit Russia without a valid visa. Czechia has a similar policy.<ref>[http://www.sagit.cz/_texty/sb99326.htm Act on the status of aliens in Czech Republic], §20</ref>  Similarly, a foreign citizen granted a temporary residence permit in Russia needs an exit visa to take a trip abroad (valid for both exit and return). Not all foreign citizens are subject to that requirement. Citizens of Germany, for example, do not require this exit visa.

Certain Asian countries have policies that similarly require certain categories of citizens to seek official authorisation prior to travelling or emigrating. This is usually either as a way to enforce [[conscription|national service]] obligations or to protect migrant workers from travelling to places where they may be abused by employers. Singapore, for instance, operates an Exit Permit scheme in order to enforce the [[National service in Singapore|national service]] obligations of its male citizens and permanent residents.<ref>{{cite act |title= Enlistment Act|type= |number= 25|language= |date= 1970|article= 32|articletype= s.|page= |url= http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;orderBy=date-rev, loadTime;page=0;query=DocId%3A%227c7b1aab-8403-4443-b322-0cba08be5d45%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0%20ValidTime%3A20161111000000%20TransactionTime%3A20161111000000;rec=0}}</ref> These restrictions vary according to age and status.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|title= National Service: Exit permit requirements|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website= ecitizen.gov.sg|access-date= 2018-08-08|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108045359/http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg/Topics/Pages/National-Service-Exit-permit-requirements.aspx|archive-date= 2017-01-08|url-status= dead}}</ref> [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ris.gov.tw/departure/app/|title=內政部役政署役男線上申請短期出境|website=www.ris.gov.tw}}</ref> have similar policies. [[India]], on the other hand, requires citizens who have not met certain educational requirements (and thus may be targeted by human traffickers or be coerced into [[modern slavery]]) to apply for approval prior to leaving the country and endorses their passports with [[Emigration Act, 1983|”Emigration Check Required”]]. [[Nepal]] similarly requires citizens emigrating to [[the United States]] on an [[H-1B visa]] to present an exit permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. This document is called a work permit and needs to be presented to immigration to leave the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dol.gov.np/|title=Department of Labour – Government Of Nepal}}</ref> In a bid to increase protection for the large amount of Indian, Bangladeshi, Chinese, and Nepali citizens smuggled through Indian airports to the [[Middle East]] as underpaid labourers, many Indian airline companies require travellers to obtain an ‘OK to Board’ confirmation sent directly from visa authorities in certain GCC countries directly to the airline and will bar anyone who has not obtained this endorsement from clearing exit immigration.

===Nationality and travel history===
[[File:Visa requirements for Taiwanese citizens (6).png|thumb|upright=3|center|Map illustrating extra border controls placed on [[National without household registration|Taiwan passport holders without household registration in Taiwan]].]]
Many nations implement border controls restricting the entry of people of certain nationalities or who have visited certain countries. For instance Georgia refuses entry to holders of passports issued by the Republic of China.<ref name=timatic>{{cite web|url=http://cms.olympicair.com/timatic/webdocsI/countryinfo.html|title=Country information (passport section)|work=[[Timatic]]|publisher=[[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) through [[Olympic Air]]}}</ref> Similarly, since April 2017 nationals of Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran have been banned from entering the parts of eastern Libya under the control of the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|Tobruk government]].<ref name=timatic/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2017/4/11/khalifa-haftar-introduces-a-muslim-ban-in-east-libya|title=Khalifa Haftar introduces a 'Muslim ban' in east Libya|first=Robert|last=Cusack|website=Alaraby.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libyanexpress.com/haftar-issues-travel-ban-on-six-muslim-countries-in-eastern-libya/|title=Haftar issues travel ban on six Muslim countries in eastern Libya |publisher= Libyan Express – Libya News, Opinion, Analysis and Latest Updates from Libya|date=11 April 2017|website=Libyanexpress.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> America does not currently issue new visas to nationals of Iran, North Korea, Libya, Somalia, Syria, or Yemen pursuant to [[Executive Order 13780#Presidential Proclamation 9645|restrictions]] imposed by the [[Trump administration]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/24/us/politics/new-order-bars-almost-all-travel-from-seven-countries.html | title=New Order Indefinitely Bars Almost All Travel from Seven Countries| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2017-09-24| last1=Shear| first1=Michael D.}}</ref> In the case of the U.S. policy, restrictions are conditional and can be lifted if the countries affected meet the required security standards specified by the Trump administration, and [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizens]] of these countries can still enter if they present a passport from a non-designated country.

[[File:ROC National Without Registration Passport Datapage.jpg|thumb|Sample ROC passport of nationals with no national ID number.]]
In some cases, border control policies target stateless individuals, or individuals holding nationality statuses without [[right of abode]], including [[National without household registration|individuals with Republic of China (ROC) passports]] without a national ID, and [[British Subject]]s or [[British Overseas Citizen]]s without [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the United Kingdom. ROC nationals without ID numbers do not, for instance, have access to the U.S. [[Visa Waiver Program]], or to visa free access to the Schengen Area or Japan. Other countries, such as India which allows all Chinese nationals to apply for [[Visa policy of India|eVisas]], don't make such a distinction. Singapore imposes [[Visa policy of Singapore#Assessment Level II Countries|strict controls]] on stateless individuals and refugees, and reduces length of stay for British nationals without right of abode in the United Kingdom, but does not distinguish between ROC passports with and without national ID numbers.

As a result of tension over the [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]] dispute, Azerbaijan currently forbids entry to Armenian citizens as well as to individuals with proof of travel to Artsakh.

==Free travel areas==
Certain neighbouring countries may agree to fully or partially abolish border controls between them.

===Central America-4 Border Control Agreement===
{{main|Central America-4 Border Control Agreement}}
The Central America-4 Border Control Agreement abolishes border controls for land travel between El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. However, this does not apply to air travel.

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
{{main|Commonwealth of Independent States}}

The Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, is an organisation composed of former members of the Soviet Union, whose members eliminate many trade and visa related border controls.

====Union State of Russia and Belarus====
{{main|Union State of Russia and Belarus}}

The Union State of Russia and Belarus is a supranational union of Russia and Belarus (two CIS members), which eliminates all border controls between the two nations. However, each country continues to maintain its own visa policies, thus resulting in non-citizens of the two countries generally being barred from travelling directly between the two.

===Western Europe===

{{main|Schengen Area|Common Travel Area}}
The two most significant free travel areas in Western Europe are the Schengen area, in which very little if any border control is generally visible, and the Common Travel Area (CTA), which partially eliminates such controls for nationals of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Between countries in the [[Schengen Area]], and to an extent within the CTA on the British Isles, internal border control is often virtually unnoticeable, and often only performed by means of random car or train searches in the [[hinterland]], while controls at borders with non-member states may be rather strict.

===Greater India===
[[File:Visa policy of Bhutan.png|400px|thumb|Visa policy of Bhutan, showing free movement arrangement between India and Bhutan]]
{{main|1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship|Visa policy of Bhutan}}

India and Nepal maintain a similar arrangement to the CTA and the Union State of Russia and Belarus. Indians and Nepalis aren't subject to any migration controls in each other’s countries and there are few controls on land travel by citizens across the border.

India and Bhutan also have a similar system. The border between Jaigaon, in the Indian state of West Bengal, and the city of Phuentsholing is essentially open, and although there are internal checkpoints, Indians are allowed to proceed throughout Bhutan with a voter’s ID or an identity slip from the Indian consulate in Phuentsholing. Similarly, Bhutanese passport holders enjoy free movement in India.

Whilst not as liberal as the policies concerning the Indo-Nepalese and Indo-Bhutanese borders, Thailand and Cambodia have begun issuing combined visas to certain categories of tourists applying at specific Thai or Cambodian embassies and consulates in order to enable freer border crossings between the two countries.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Single-entry-visa-for-Thailand-Cambodia-30196863.html]</ref> The policy is currently in force for nationals of America and several European (primarily EU and GCC) and Oceanian countries as well as for Indian and Chinese nationals residing in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thaiembassy.sg/announcements/acmecs-single-visa-application-now-opens-for-citizen-of-35-countries-wishing-to-enter-0 |title = ACMECS Single Visa application now opens for citizen of 35 countries wishing to enter Thailand and Cambodia for tourism purposes &#124; Royal Thai Embassy}}</ref>

===Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement===
[[File:New Zealand Resident Visa Stamp on Australian Travel Document.jpg|130px|thumbnail|A New Zealand visa stamp issued under Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement on an Australian travel document.]]
The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] is not a free travel area. However, citizens and Australian permanent residents receive free indefinite visas with work rights at immigration control points in airports and sea ports.

The arrangement came into effect in 1973, and allows citizens of each country to reside and work in the other country, with some restrictions. Other details of the arrangement have varied over time. From 1 July 1981, all people entering Australia (including New Zealand citizens) have been required to carry a passport. Since 1 September 1994 Australia has had a universal visa requirement, and to specifically cater for the continued free movement of New Zealanders to Australia the [[Special Category Visa]] was introduced for New Zealanders.

===Gulf Cooperation Council===
Members of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], or GCC, allow each other's citizens freedom of movement in an arrangement similar to the CTA and to that between India and Nepal. Such benefits are partially suspended for Qataris as a result of the Saudi-led blockade of the country.

== Expedited border controls ==
Certain countries and trade blocs establish programmes for high-frequency and/or low risk travellers to expedite border controls, subjecting them to lighter or automated checks, or priority border control facilities. In some countries, citizens or residents have access to automated facilities not available to foreigners.

[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 ePassport gates.jpg|right|thumb|ePassport gates in [[Heathrow Airport]] (Terminal 5)]]
[[ePassport gates]] are operated by the [[UK Border Force]] and are located at immigration checkpoints in the arrival halls of some airports across the United Kingdom, offering an alternative to using desks staffed by immigration officers. The gates use [[facial recognition technology]] to verify the user's identity by comparing the user's facial features to those recorded in the photograph stored in the chip in their [[biometric passport]].

[[British nationality law|British]] citizens, [[European Economic Area]] citizens and citizens of [[Australian nationality law|Australia]], [[Canadian nationality law|Canada]], [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]], [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore]], [[South Korean nationality law|South Korea]], [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwan]] and [[United States nationality law|the United States]] as well as [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese]] citizens of [[Hong Kong]] who are enrolled in the Registered Traveller Service,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/registered-traveller |title = Registered Traveller: Faster entry through the UK border}}</ref> can use ePassport gates, provided that they are aged either 18 and over or 12 and over travelling with an adult and holding valid [[biometric passports]].

ePassport gates are available at the following locations:
* [[Birmingham Airport]]
* [[Bristol Airport]]
* [[Cardiff Airport]]
* [[East Midlands Airport]]

They are currently available to citizens of Switzerland and the [[European Economic Area]] with electronic passports aged 18 or over. There are proposals to extend the service to non-European citizens. Irish Passport Cards can not be used.

===East Asia===
====Hong Kong & Macau====
[[File:Hkairport echannel.JPG|160px|thumb|e-Channel machines at Hong Kong International Airport]]

{{main|e-Channel}}

The e-Channel is an automated border control facility available at airports in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and at land borders between the mainland and the Special Administrative Regions. It is open to [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese citizens]] with permanent residence in the appropriate regions, and to selected foreign nationals. A similar automated entry system, eGate, exists in [[Taiwan]] providing expedited border control for [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese nationals]] {{efn|name=ROC}} as well as certain classes of residents and frequent visitors. Users simply scan their travel documents at the gate and are passed through for facial recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=e-Gate|url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/egate/|website=immigration.gov.tw}}</ref>

[[File:NEXUSCard.png|125px|thumb|left|Sample NEXUS card]]
[[File:NexusLane.JPG|thumb|right|A NEXUS lane at the U.S. side of the [[Ambassador Bridge]].]]
NEXUS is a joint Canadian-U.S. expedited border control programme for low risk travellers holding Canadian or U.S. citizenship or permanent residence. Membership requires approval by Canadian and U.S. authorities and entitles members to dedicated RFID-enabled lanes when crossing the land border. A NEXUS card can also be utilised as a travel document between the two countries and entitles passengers to priority border control facilities in Canada and Global Entry facilities in America.

Free and Secure Trade or FAST is a similar programme for commercial drivers and approved importers, reducing the amount of customs checks conducted at the border and expediting the border control process.

Canadian citizens and Permanent Residents who are approved by Canadian authorities but not by the Americans can join CANPASS, which provides similar border control benefits but solely in Canada.

====Global Entry and SENTRI====
{{main|Global Entry|SENTRI}}

[[File:Global Entry participants.svg|thumb|Countries participating in Global Entry]]

Global Entry is an  programme for frequent travellers that enables them to utilise automated border control facilities and priority security screening. In addition to U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents, the programme is open to Indian,<ref>{{cite web|title=Expedited entry into U.S. for Indian travellers from now on |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/expedited-entry-into-us-for-indian-travellers-from-now-on/articleshow/59336272.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=June 28, 2017}}</ref> Singaporean,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/faster-immigration/2908082.html|title=Faster immigration clearance for eligible Singaporeans travelling to US|website=www.channelnewsasia.com|access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref> and South Korean citizens amongst others.

SENTRI is a similar programme for U.S. and Mexican citizens that additionally allows members to register their cars for expedited land border controls. When entering the U.S. across the Canadian border, it can be used as a NEXUS card, but not the other way around.

Global Entry members (as well as NEXUS and SENTRI card holders with a Known Traveller Number) are eligible to use automated Global Entry facilities at certain airports to clear border control more efficiently. Enrolled users must present their [[Machine-readable medium|machine-readable]] passport or [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency card]], and submit their fingerprints to establish identity. Users then complete an electronic [[customs declaration]], and are issued a receipt instructing them to either proceed to [[baggage claim]], or to a normal inspection booth for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/global_entry/global_entry_discription.xml |website=CBP |title=How to Use the Kiosk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625090904/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/trusted_traveler/global_entry/global_entry_discription.xml |archive-date=June 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The system can currently only be used by travellers 12 years of age or older, however a trial is under way that may potentially lower the age of eligibility to use eGate for people with an eligible ePassport from 12 years of age to 10 years of age. New Zealand eGates utilise biometric technology, comparing the picture of your face in your ePassport with the picture it takes of you at the gate in order to confirm your identity. To make sure eGate can do this, travellers must make sure they look as similar to their ePassport photos as possible and remove glasses, scarves and hats that they were not wearing when their passport picture was taken. eGate can handle minor changes in your face, for example if the travellers' weight or hair has changed. Customs, Biosecurity and Immigration officials utilise information provided at eGates, including photos, to clear travellers and their items across New Zealand's border. Biometric information is kept for three months before destruction but other information, including about movements across New Zealand's border is kept indefinitely and handled in accordance with the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand#Privacy Act 1993|Privacy Act 1993]], or as the law authorises. This might include information being used by or shared with other law enforcement or border control authorities.

===APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC)===
[[File:APEC Business Travel Card Member States.svg|thumb|260px|right|{{legend|green|Full members of the scheme}}{{legend|lime|Transitional members (United States, Canada)}}]]

{{main|APEC Business Travel Card}}

The APEC Business Travel Card, or ABTC, is an expedited border control programme for business travellers from [[APEC]] economies (excluding Canada and U.S.A.). It provides visa exemptions and access to expedited border control facilities. ABTC holders are eligible for expedited border control at Canadian airports but not for any visa exemptions.

ABTCs are generally issued only to citizens of APEC member countries, however Hong Kong issues them to Permanent Residents who are not Chinese citizens, a category primarily consisting of British, Indian, and Pakistani citizens.

The use of ABTCs in China is restricted as a result of the [[One Country, Two Systems]] and [[One China Policy|One China]] policies. [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese nationals]], and [[Chinese nationality law|Chinese citizens]] from [[Hong Kong residents|Hong Kong]], and [[Macau Resident Identity Card|Macau]] are required to use special internal travel documents to enter [[China|the mainland]]. Similar restrictions exist on the use of ABTC for Chinese citizens of other regions entering [[Taiwan]]. (see: [[#Internal border controls|Internal border controls]]).

==Internal border controls==

===Asia===

Some countries maintain border controls between their own and claimed territories. These are not uncommon in some parts of Asia. For example, minority regions in India and China often require special permits (i.e. [[Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958 (India)|Restricted Area Permits, Protected Area Permits]], [[Visa policy of China#Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Travel Permits, or Alien Travel Permits]]) for foreign nationals to enter in addition to visas where required. In some cases, these restrictions are not limited to foreigners. For instance, certain minority areas of India additionally require Indian citizens to possess an [[Inner Line Permit]] to enter. Similarly, the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོངས།) in China exempts Chinese citizens from the Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau to obtain TTPs and ATPs. {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} However, [[Taiwanese nationality law|Taiwanese people]] are required to obtain those permits even though, in the PRC, nationals of the ROC are commonly known as "Taiwanese compatriots" in news articles and for legislation purposes, '''"Chinese citizens residing in Taiwan"'''.<ref>Article 2 of the {{cite web|title=Measures for the Administration of Chinese Citizens Travelling to or from Taiwan Region|url =http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=250073&lib=law |publisher=Peking University Center for Legal Information }}</ref>

Internal air and rail travel within non-autonomous portions of India and mainland China also generally requires travel documents to be checked by government officials as a form of interior border checkpoint. For such travel within India, Indian citizens may utilise their [[Voter ID (India)|Voter ID]], [[Aadhaar|National Identity Card]], passport, or other proof of Indian citizenship whilst Nepali nationals may present any similar proof of Napali citizenship. Meanwhile, for such travel within mainland China, Chinese nationals from the mainland are required to use their national identity cards.

Within China, extensive border controls are maintained for those travelling between the [[Mainland China|mainland]], [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled by the Republic of China]].{{efn|name=ROC|The area under the definition consists of the island groups of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]] (the Pescadores), [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy), [[Matsu Islands]] and [[List of islands of Taiwan|other islands]].}} Foreign nationals need to present their passports or other required types of travel documents when travelling between these areas. For Chinese nationals (including those with [[British National (Overseas)]] status), there are special [[travel document|documents]]{{efn|For example, [[Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card]] or [[Macau Identity Card]] and [[Home Return Permit]] are required for Hong Kong or Macau Permanent Residents who are Chinese citizens to cross the border, whilst mainlanders require a two-way permit.}} for travel between these territories. Similar arrangements, in the form of the [[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]] issued by mainland authority and [[Exit & Entry Permit|similar permits]] issued by Taiwan authorities exist for travel between Taiwan and territories controlled by the [[People’s Republic of China]]. Internal border controls in the Chinese Special Administrative Regions have also meant that immigrants from the mainland require a [[People's Republic of China Permit for Proceeding to Hong Kong and Macao|One Way Travel Permit]], the issuance of which is controlled by the mainland government, thus giving that region of China greater control over emigration rather than by Hong Kong or Macau as would be expected of border controls aimed at curtailing immigration.

Another example is the [[Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], which have maintained their own border controls<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/borneo/visas |title = Visas and customs in Borneo}}</ref> since joining Malaysia in 1963. The internal border control is asymmetrical; while Sabah and Sarawak impose immigration control on Malaysian citizens from other states, there is no corresponding border control in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and Malaysians from Sabah and Sarawak have unrestricted right to live and work in the Peninsular. For social and business visits less than three months, Malaysian citizens may travel between the Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak using the [[Malaysian identity card]] (MyKad) or [[Malaysian passport]], while for longer stays in Sabah and Sarawak they are required to have an Internal Travel Document or a passport with the appropriate residential permit.

Meanwhile, in Bhutan, a microstate accessible by road only through India, there are interior border checkposts (primarily on the [[Lateral Road]]) and, additionally, certain areas require [[Visa policy of Bhutan#Restricted areas permit|special permits]] to enter, whilst visitors not proceeding beyond the border city of [[Phuentsholing]] do not need permits to enter for the day (although such visitors are [[de facto]] subject to Indian visa policy since they must proceed through [[Jaigaon]]). Individuals who are not citizens of India, Bangladesh, or the Maldives are not allowed to proceed past Phuentsholing by land and are instead required to arrive by air at the country's [[Paro Airport|sole international airport]] in [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]], which has flights from India and other countries in the Greater India region such as Thailand, Singapore, and Nepal.

The most restrictive internal border controls are in [[North Korea]]. Citizens are not allowed to travel outside their areas of residence without explicit authorisation, and access to the capital city of Pyongyang is heavily restricted.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-10-18 |title = UNHCR &#124; Refworld &#124; Freedom in the World 2008 - North Korea}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA24/002/2009/en/ | title=Document}}</ref> Similar restrictions are imposed on tourists, who are only allowed to leave Pyongyang on government-authorised tours to approved tourist sites.

===Europe===

An example from Europe is the implementation of border controls on travel between [[Svalbard]], which maintains a policy of [[free migration]] as a result of the [[Svalbard Treaty]] and the Schengen Area, which includes the rest of Norway. Other examples of effective internal border controls in Europe include the [[closed cities]] of certain [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] members, [[Visa policy of Turkmenistan#Special permits|areas of Turkmenistan]] that require special permits to enter, [[Visa policy of Tajikistan#Gorno-Badakhshan|restrictions]] on travel to the [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region]] in Tajikistan, and (depending on whether Northern and Southern Cyprus are considered separate countries) the Cypriot border. Similarly, Iraq's [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan region]] maintains a separate and more liberal visa and customs area from the rest of the country, even allowing [[Visa policy of Iraq|visa free entry]] for Israelis whilst the rest of the country bans them from entering. [[Denmark]] also maintains a complex system of subnational countries with autonomous customs policies, since they aren't within the European Union like the Danish mainland. These are [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. These areas do not maintain strict immigration controls with the Schengen Area, but border controls are sporadically enforced for customs purposes.

In addition to the numerous closed cities of Russia,<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Federation Country Specific Information – Entry/Exit Requirements for U.S. Citizens|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|publisher=Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003453/http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1006.html#entry_requirements|archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> parts of 19 subjects{{efn|

[[Israeli checkpoint]]s (''mahsom'', ''hajez'') also constitute a significant example of internal border controls. Spread throughout the [[Israel|State of Israel]] and the areas of the [[State of Palestine]] under ''[[de facto]]'' Israeli control, internal checkpoints are a key feature of Israeli and Palestinian life, and Israel’s internal border controls are amongst the most restrictive in the world.

An unusual example of internal border controls pertains to customs enforcement within the Schengen area. Even though borders are generally invisible, the existence of areas within the Schengen area but outside the [[European Union Value Added Tax Area]], as well as jurisdictions such as Andorra which are not officially a part of the Schengen area but can not be accessed without passing through it, has resulted in the existence of sporadic [[Schengen Area#Internal controls|internal border controls]] for customs purposes. Additionally, as per Schengen area rules,<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;jsessionid=TJcLTTkLTbF0zDNTTm0Z2GGMzHlM1QGpWP9mdKGRx6WlrfTlb2GQ!1620842458?uri=CELEX:32006R0562 Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)] See Title III Article 21</ref> hotels and other types of commercial accommodation must register all foreign citizens, including citizens of other Schengen states, by requiring the completion of a registration form by their own hand. This does not apply to accompanying spouses and minor children or members of travel groups. In addition, a valid identification document has to be produced to the hotel manager or staff.<ref>Article 45 of the Schengen Convention.</ref> The Schengen rules do not require any other procedures; thus, the Schengen states are free to regulate further details on the content of the registration forms, and identity documents which are to be produced, and may also require the persons exempted from registration by Schengen laws to be registered. A Schengen state is also permitted to reinstate border controls with another Schengen country for a short period where there is a serious threat to that state's "public policy or internal security" or when the "control of an external border is no longer ensured due to exceptional circumstances".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120608-european-union-schengen-border-control-migrants-refugees |title=EU agrees short-term border closures to block migrants |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> When such risks arise out of foreseeable events, the state in question must notify the European Commission in advance and consult with other Schengen states.<ref>Chapter II of the Schengen Borders Code ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R0562:EN:NOT OJ L 105, 13 April 2006, p. 1]).</ref> In April 2010 Malta introduced temporary checks due to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s visit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20100405/local/border-checks-are-back |title=Border checks are back |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2010}}</ref> It reimposed checks in 2015 in the weeks surrounding the [[CHOGM 2015|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]]. In response to the [[European migrant crisis]], several countries set up internal controls.

In 2019, [[Denmark]], worried about the [[bombings in Sweden]], introduced passport controls to Swedish citizens for the first time since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/europe/denmark-border-sweden.html|title=Denmark, Worried About Bombings by Swedish Gangs, Begins Border Checks|author=Martin Selsoe Sorensen|location=Denmark|date=13 November 2019|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Another complex border control situation in Europe pertains to the United Kingdom. Whilst the [[crown dependencies]] are within the [[Common Travel Area]], neither [[Gibraltar]] nor the sovereign British military exclaves of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] are. The former maintains its own [[Visa policies of British Overseas Territories#Gibraltar|border control policies]], thus requiring physical border security at its border with the Schengen Area as well as the implementation of border controls for travellers proceeding directly between Gibraltar and the British mainland. The latter maintains a relatively open border with Southern Cyprus, though not with Northern Cyprus. Consequently, it is a de facto member of the Schengen Area and travel to or from the British mainland requires border controls.

The [[Peace lines|Peace Lines]] in [[Northern Ireland]] are a ''de facto'' internal border security measure to separate Catholic and Republican communities and Protestant andUnionist communities from each other. They have been in place in some form or another since the end of [[The Troubles]] in 1998, with the [[Good Friday Agreement]]

===U.S. territories===
[[File:American Samoa Entry Stamp.tif|160px|right|thumbnail|American Samoa entry stamp]]
[[File:Hyder AK.jpg|left|160px|thumb|Hyder, Alaska has no border controls for travellers entering from Canada, and travellers flying between Hyder and other Alaskan cities by seaplane undergo internal border control]]
Multiple types of internal border controls exist in America. While the U.S. territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] follow the [[visa policy of the United States]], together, they also maintain their own visa waiver program for certain nationalities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/guam-cnmi-visa-waiver-program|title=Guam-CNMI Visa Waiver Program}}</ref> Since the two territories are outside the [[customs territory of the United States]], there are customs inspections when traveling between them, and the rest of the United States. [[American Samoa]] has its own customs and immigration regulations, thus travelling between it and other U.S. jurisdictions involves both customs and immigration inspections.

The [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] are a special case, falling within the U.S. immigration zone and solely following the U.S. visa policy, but being a customs free territory. As a result, there are no immigration checks between the two, but travellers arriving in Puerto Rico or the U.S. mainland directly from the Virgin Islands are subject to border control for customs inspection. The U.S. also maintains [[United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints|interior checkpoints]], similar to those maintained by Bhutan, along its borders with Mexico and Canada, subjecting people to border controls even after they have entered the country. The city of [[Hyder, Alaska]] has also been subject to internal border controls since the U.S. chose to stop regulating arrivals in Hyder from British Columbia. Since travelers exiting Hyder into British Columbia are subject to Canadian border controls, it is theoretically possible for someone to accidentally enter Hyder from Canada without their travel documents and then to face difficulties since both the United States and Canada would subject them to border controls that require travel documents. See also [[Hyder–Stewart Border Crossing]].

[[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], and the [[Cook Islands]] ([[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani'')<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse & Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200</ref> maintain independent and less restrictive border controls from New Zealand. The [[Cook Islands]] further maintain a separate nationality law. Additionally, border controls for Tokelau are complicated by the fact that the territory is, for the most part, only accessible via [[Samoa]].

==Prescreening border controls==
===Hong Kong===
[[File:Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Entrance 201703.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance of Shenzhen Bay Passenger Terminal Building (Hong Kong side)]]

====West Kowloon railway station====
{{Main|West Kowloon railway station#Mainland Port Area}}
A component of the [[Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link]], West Kowloon Station will contain a “Mainland Port Area”, essentially enabling passengers and goods to clear mainland Chinese immigration on Hong Kong soil.

====Shenzhen Bay Control Point====
{{main|Shenzhen Bay Control Point}}

The Shenzhen Bay Control Point is a Hong Kong immigration facility co-located with mainland Chinese facilities at [[Shenzhen Bay Port]]. It is located in the Chinese mainland on land leased from the city of [[Shenzhen]] in [[Guangdong]] province. It essentially enables travellers to clear both mainland and Hong Kong border controls in one place, thus eliminating any need for border control on the Hong Kong side of the [[Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor|Shenzhen Bay Bridge]].

===Singapore and Malaysia===

====Woodlands Train Checkpoint====
For cross-border rail passengers, Singaporean exit and Malaysian entry preclearance border controls are co-located at the [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in Singapore, whilst Malaysian exit controls are located separately at [[Johor Bahru Sentral railway station]] in Malaysia.

[[File:MRT map SGJB.svg|200px|thumb|Map of the upcoming Rapid Transit system.]]
{{main|Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System}}

The upcoming Rapid Transit System (RTS) connecting Singapore and Johor Bahru will feature border control preclearance both on the Singaporean side and on the Malaysian side. This will enable passengers arriving in Singapore from Malaysia or vice versa to proceed straight to their connecting transport, since the RTS will link to both the Singapore MRT system ([[Thomson-East Coast MRT Line]]) and [[Johor Bahru Sentral railway station|Johor Bahru Sentral]]. Unlike the preclearance systems adopted by the United States and Hong Kong, but similar to the United Kingdom’s juxtaposed controls, this system will mitigate arrival border controls on both sides of the border.<ref name="iskandar">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskandar.asia/insight/iskandar-malaysia-in-the-news/2-uncategorised/145-final-plan-for-singapore-johor-bahru-rapid-transit-system-rts-link-by-end-of-2014.html|title=Final plan for Singapore-Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System (RTS) link by end of 2014|website=www.iskandar.asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c%3D2%26id%3D0pt1z213cvn5f2h2t1ti39b4tjkckorbk76uh7r32nykq33d1n |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903033605/http://app.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=0pt1z213cvn5f2h2t1ti39b4tjkckorbk76uh7r32nykq33d1n |archive-date=2014-09-03 }}</ref>

===Malaysia and Thailand===
The [[Padang Besar railway station]] in [[Padang Besar, Malaysia]] has co-located border control facilities for both Malaysia and Thailand, although the station is wholly located inside Malaysian territory (albeit just 200 metres south of the [[Malaysia-Thailand border]]). The facilities for each country operate from separate counters inside the railway station building at the platform level.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.malaysiatrains.com/padang-besar-railway-station-train-times-tickets/ | title=Padang Besar Railway Station – Train times & tickets| publisher=Malaysia Trains|language=en|accessdate=11 June 2019}}</ref> Passengers entering Thailand clear Malaysian and Thai border formalities here in Malaysian territory before boarding their [[State Railway of Thailand]] trains which then cross the actual borderline several minutes after departing the station. Passengers from Thailand entering Malaysia are also processed here, using the same counters as there are no separate counters for processing entries and exits for either country.

===United Kingdom===

====Ferry====
French entry border control for ferries between Dover and Calais or Dunkerque take place at the [[Port of Dover]], whilst French exit and British entry border control takes place at Calais and Dunkerque.

====Rail====
Border control for rail travel between the United Kingdom and the Schengen Area features significant prescreening. This includes customs and immigration prescreening on both sides of the [[Eurotunnel]], and immigration-only prescreening for the [[Eurostar]] between the United Kingdom and stations located in Belgium and France. Eurostar and Eurotunnel passengers departing from the Schengen area go through both French or Belgian exit border control and British entry border controls before departures, while passengers departing from the United Kingdom undergo French border controls on British soil.

The following juxtaposed rail border controls are currently in operation:

===United States===
{{main|United States border preclearance}}

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] operates border preclearance facilities at a number of ports and airports in foreign territory.  They are staffed and operated by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers. Travelers pass through U.S. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs]], [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] inspections before boarding their aircraft, ship, or train.  This process is intended to streamline border procedures, reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and U.S. airports unequipped to handle international travellers.

These facilities are present at the majority of major Canadian airports, as well as selected airports in Bermuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Abu Dhabi<ref>{{cite news |url = http://ph.news.yahoo.com/us-customs-pre-clearance-facility-opens-uae-162934663--sector.html |title = US Customs pre-clearance facility opens in UAE |work = Yahoo!

Citizens of the Bahamas who enter America through either of the two preclearance facilities in that country enjoy an exemption from the general requirement to hold a visa as long as they can sufficiently prove that they do not have a significant criminal record in either the Bahamas or America. All Bahamians applying for admission at a port-of-entry other than the pre-clearance facilities located in [[Nassau International Airport|Nassau]] or [[Freeport International Airport|Freeport International]]  airports are required to be in possession of a valid visa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1250?language=en_US |title=Bahamian citizen document requirements |accessdate=2020-06-13}}</ref>

Preclearance facilities are also operated at [[Pacific Central Station]], the Port of Vancouver, and the Port of Victoria in [[British Columbia]], and there are plans to open one at [[Montreal Central Station]] in Quebec.

=== Informal prescreening ===
In some cases countries can introduce controls that functions as border controls but aren't border controls legally and don't need to be performed by government agencies. Normally they are performed and organised by private companies, based on a law that they have to check that passengers don't travel into a specific country if they aren't allowed to. Such controls can take effect in one country based on the law of another country without any formalised border control prescreening agreement in force. Even if they aren't border controls they function as such. The most prominent example is airlines which check passports and visa before passengers are allowed to board the aircraft. Also for some passenger boats such check are performed before boarding.

==Border control organisations==
{{further|Border guard}}
Border controls are usually the responsibility of specialised government organisations. Such agencies may oversee various aspects of border control, such as [[Customs (tax)|customs]], immigration policy, border security, [[quarantine]], and other such aspects. Official designations, jurisdictions and command structures of these agencies vary considerably, and some countries split border control functions across multiple agencies.

BSF was created as a Central government-controlled security force to guard all of India's borders, thus bringing greater cohesion in border security. BSF is charged with guarding India's land border during peacetime and preventing transnational crime.

====Assam Rifles====
The Assam Rifles, one of India's oldest continuously existent paramilitary units, has been responsible for physical controls on the border between India and Myanmar since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/one-border-one-force/221456|title=One Border One Force?|publisher=outlookindia.com}}</ref> The border area between India, Myanmar, and China is largely made up of minority groups, many of which are transboundary communities. Consequently, enforcing border controls is a challenge for all three countries, and porous sections of the border between India and Myanmar have historically been common since Myanmar was formerly a part of the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]].

====Transport Security Administration====
{{main|Transport Security Administration}}

The Transport Security Administration, or TSA, is a division of the DHS responsible for conducting security checks at U.S. airports and other transport hubs, including [[#Presreening border controls|overseas preclearance facilities]] (with the notable exception of those in Canada, where CATSA conducts security checks prior to CBP immigration screening). For passengers departing by air from America, TSA screening is the only physical check conducted upon departure.

====Immigration and Customs Enforcement====
{{main|U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement}}

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is the organisation responsible for enforcing immigration laws within U.S. territory, focusing largely on removing individuals who entered the country unlawfully. [[Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g)]] allows ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, permitting designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions, pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), provided that the local law enforcement officers receive appropriate training and function under the supervision of sworn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Under 287(g), ICE provides state and local law enforcement with the training and subsequent authorisation to identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.<ref>{{cite web |last=Budzinski |first=Joe |url=http://www.novatownhall.com/blog/2006/09/287g_training_from_ice_sought.php |title=287g training from ICE sought by many U.S. jurisdictions – novatownhall blog |publisher=Novatownhall.com |date=30 September 2006 |access-date=2018-08-07 }}{{dead link|date=January 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The 287(g) program is extremely controversial; it has been widely criticised for increasing [[racism|racist profiling]] by police and undermining community safety because unlawful immigrant communities are no longer willing to report crimes or talk to law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchengine.com/centerformediajustice/advocates-condemn-obama-administrations-expansion-of-dhss-failed-287g-program/18629/ |title=Advocates Condemn Obama Administration's Expansion of DHS's Failed 287(g) Program – Center for Media Justice |publisher=pitchengine.com |date=17 July 2009 |access-date=2018-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121030706/http://www.pitchengine.com/centerformediajustice/advocates-condemn-obama-administrations-expansion-of-dhss-failed-287g-program/18629/ |archive-date=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====United States Citizenship and Immigration Services====

[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] is responsible for various aspects of border control relating to immigration, including reviewing visa petitions and applications as well as processing asylum claims.

===Pakistan===
Physical controls on the internationally recognised portions of Pakistan's international borders are managed by dedicated paramilitary units (the Pakistan Rangers on the border with India, and the Frontier Corps elsewhere). The Pakistan-administered side of the [[Line of Control]] between the Indian and the Pakistan controlled parts of Kashmir is patrolled by the [[Pakistan Army]].

====Pakistan Rangers====
[[File:Punjab Rangers.jpg|thumb|150px|Pakistan Rangers – Punjab marching]]
The [[Pakistan Rangers]] are a paramilitary law enforcement organisation in Pakistan and have a primary mission of securing important sites such as Pakistan's [[Wagah border|International Border with India]] as well as employed in internal security operations, and providing assistance to the police in maintaining law and order. Rangers is an [[umbrella term]] for the Pakistan Rangers – Punjab, headquartered in [[Lahore]], responsible for guarding Punjab Province's 1,300&nbsp;km long IB with India, and the Pakistan Rangers – Sindh, headquartered in [[Karachi]], defending Sindh Province's ~912&nbsp;km long IB with India. The forces operate under their own separate chains of command and wear distinct uniforms. Most famously each evening, the Pakistan Rangers – Punjab together with their Indian counterparts in the BSF, participate in an elaborate flag lowering ceremony at [[Wagah]] border crossing near Lahore.

====Frontier Corps====
The [[Frontier Corps]], is an [[umbrella term]] for the two western [[Provinces of Pakistan|provincial]] [[Auxiliaries|auxiliary]] forces part of the [[paramilitary forces of Pakistan]] along the western provinces of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and are the direct counterparts to the [[Pakistan Rangers|Rangers]] of the eastern provinces ([[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]). The Frontier Corps comprises two separate organisations: FC NWFP stationed in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province (formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province), and includes the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], and FC Balochistan stationed in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] province. Each subdivision is headed by a [[wikt:secondment|seconded]] [[inspector general]], who is a [[Pakistan Army]] officer of at least major-general rank, although the force itself is under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry.<ref name=jamestown>{{cite journal|author=Hassan Abbas|date=2007-03-30|title=Transforming Pakistan's Frontier Corps|journal=Terrorism Monitor|volume=5|issue=6|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|location=Washington|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1056&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=182&no_cache=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804160742/http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370292|archive-date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref> With a total manpower of approximately 80,000,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=18&rnd=157#Para-Military-Forces| title=Journey from Scratch to Nuclear Power| publisher=Pakistan Army| accessdate=2010-09-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815094629/http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/AWPReview/TextContent.aspx?pId=18&rnd=157#Para-Military-Forces| archive-date=2011-08-15| url-status=dead}}</ref> the task of the Frontier Corps is to help local law enforcement in the maintenance of law and order, and to carry out border patrol and anti-smuggling operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-uspakistan5nov05,0,6337979,print.story?coll=la-home-center|title=Miller, Greg, "U.S. military aid to Pakistan misses its Al Qaeda target"|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> Some of the FC's constituent units such as the Chitral Scouts, the Khyber Rifles, Swat Levies, the Kurram Militia, the Tochi Scouts, the South Waziristan Scouts, and the Zhob Militia have regimental histories dating back to British colonial times and many, e.g. the Khyber Rifles, have distinguished combat records before and after 1947.

====Direction centrale de la police aux frontières====
{{main|Direction centrale de la police aux frontières}}

The Direction centrale de la police aux frontières (DCPF) is a directorate of the [[National Police (France)|French National Police]] that is responsible for border control at certain border crossing points and border surveillance in some areas in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/List%20of%20national%20services%20responsible%20for%20border%20control.pdf|title=List of national services responsible for border control}}</ref> They work alongside their British counterparts at Calais, and along the Channel Tunnel Rail Link with the [[British Transport Police]]. The DCPF is consequently largely responsible for Schengen Area border controls with the United Kingdom.

====Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects====
Direction générale des douanes et droits indirects (DGDDI), commonly known as ''les douanes'', is a French law enforcement agency responsible for levying indirect taxes, preventing smuggling, surveilling borders and investigating counterfeit money. The agency acts as a [[coast guard]], [[border guard]], sea [[rescue]] organisation and a [[customs]] service.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=141 |title=Missions of the DGDDI |access-date=2018-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326032320/http://www.douane.gouv.fr/page.asp?id=141 |archive-date=2014-03-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, since 1995, the agency has replaced the [[Direction centrale de la police aux frontières|Border Police]] in carrying out [[immigration]] control at smaller [[border checkpoint]]s, in particular at maritime borders and regional airports.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |title=Center for the Study of Democracy: Study to identify best practices on the cooperation between border guards and customs administrations working at the external borders of the EU |access-date=2018-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110123/http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/doc_centre/borders/docs/customs_bgs_final.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Finnish Border Guard====
The [[Finnish Border Guard]], including the [[coast guard]], is the agency responsible for border control related to persons, including passport control and border patrol. The Border Guard is a paramilitary organization, subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior in administrative issues and to the President of the Republic in issues pertaining to the president's authority as Commander-in-Chief (e.g. officer promotions). The [[Finland-Russia border]] is a controlled external border of the Schengen Area, routinely patrolled and protected by a [[#Border zones|border zone]] enforced by the Border Guard. Finland's borders with Norway and Sweden are internal Schengen borders with no routine border controls, but the Border Guard maintains personnel in the area owing to its search and rescue (SAR) duties. There are two coast guard districts for patrolling maritime borders. In peacetime, the Border Guard trains [[special forces]] and [[light infantry]] and can be incorporated fully or in part into the [[Finnish Defence Forces]] when required by defence readiness. The Border Guard has police and investigative powers in immigration matters and can independently investigate immigration violations. The Border Guard has search and rescue (SAR) duties, both maritime and inland. The Guard operates SAR helicopters that are often used in inland SAR, in assistance of a local fire and rescue department or other authorities. The Border Guard shares border control duties with [[Finnish Customs]], which inspects arriving goods, and the [[Finnish Police]], which enforces immigration decisions such as removal.

====Swedish border police====
The border control is handled by a special group in the police force. Sweden has natural land borders only to Norway and Finland, where there are no border controls, so border surveillance is not done there apart from customs control. Therefore, border control is focused on some fixed control points, during the border control-less Schengen period until 2015 mainly airports. The [[Schengen Area#Temporary border controls|introduction of full border control]] from Denmark and the continent in 2015 put a heavy load on the border police who had to check 8000 cars and 50 trains per day coming over the [[Öresund Bridge]], and 3000 cars in [[Helsingborg]] and more in other ferry ports. The police quickly educated several hundred semi-authorised border control guards who had to ask the real officers to take over any doubtful case. The customs office and the coast guard can not do formal border controls, but can stop people in doubtful cases and ask police to take over.

===China===
====Hong Kong====
{{main|Immigration Department (Hong Kong)}}

The Immigration Department of Hong Kong is responsible for border controls of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions, including [[#Internal border controls|internal controls]] with the rest of China. After the People's Republic of China resumed sovereignty of the territory in July 1997, Hong Kong's immigration system remained largely unchanged from its British predecessor model. In addition, [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|visa-free entry]] acceptance regulations into Hong Kong for passport holders of some 170 countries remain unchanged before and after 1997.

====Macau====
The Immigration Department of Macau, under the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau|Public Security Police Force]], is the government agency responsible for immigration matters, whilst the Public Security Police Force itself is responsible for enforcing immigration laws in Macau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsm.gov.mo/psp/por/psp_top9_map_sm.html|title=Corpo de Polícia de Segurança Pública|website=www.fsm.gov.mo}}</ref>

====Mainland China====
Border security in [[Mainland China]] are the responsibility of National Immigration Administration of the People's Republic of China, formerly the Exit & Entry Administration<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moj.gov.cn/news/content/2018-04/02/zfyw_17882.html|title=National Immigration Administration Listing Ceremony Held|website=Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China}}</ref>), a unit of [[Ministry of Public Security (China)|the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China]]. Customs related border controls are largely within the purview of [[General Administration of Customs|the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China]].

===Taiwan===

{{main|National Immigration Agency}}

In [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas]] controlled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]],{{efn|name=ROC}} the National Immigration Agency, a subsidiary organisation of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of the Interior]] is responsible for border control. The agency is headed by the [[Director General]]. The current Director-General is Hsieh Li-kung.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/maina.asp | title=移民署中文網}}</ref>

The agency was established in early 2007 and its job includes the care and guidance of new immigrants, exit and entry control, the inspection on [[illegal immigrant]]s, the forcible [[deportation]] of unlawful entrants, and the prevention of [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immig_eng/aspcode/main10.asp |title = 移民署中文網}}</ref> The agency also deals with persons from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau who do not hold household registration in the areas controlled by the ROC.

==Immigration law==
{{legal status}}
Immigration law refers to the national [[statute]]s, [[Primary and secondary legislation|regulations]], and [[Precedent|legal precedents]] governing [[immigration]] into and [[deportation]] from a country. Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalisation]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in commerce or government.

National laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates<ref>art 12(4)</ref> that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.

==Controversies==
Certain border control policies of various countries have been the subject of controversy and public debate.

===Immigrant investor programmes===
{{Main|Immigrant investor programs}}
{{See also|Golden visa}}
Immigrant investor programmes, pejoratively referred to as golden visas, are border control policies designed to attract [[foreign capital]] and business people by providing the right of residence and citizenship in return. These are also known as citizenship-by-investment programmes. While several countries currently offer investors citizenship or residence in return for an economic investment, the concept is relatively new and was only brought to the focus{{clarify|date=August 2018}} around 2006.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen|last=Abrahamian|first=Atossa Araxia|publisher=Columbia Global Reports|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9909763-6-3|pages=70–93}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=The Passport King|last=Clenfield|first=Jason|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2015/03/12/the-man-who-helps-countries-turn-investments-into-passports-for-the-rich/|title=The Man Who Helps Countries Turn Investments Into Passports for the Rich|date=2015-03-12|website=Skift|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> The roots of such programmes have been traced back to the 1980s when [[tax haven]]s in the Pacific and Caribbean began "cash-for-passport" programmes that facilitated visa-free travel and provided tax advantages.<ref>The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, [[Ayelet Shachar]], Chapter 35, Citizenship For Sale?, p. 794, Oxford University Press, 2017</ref> For example, in 1984, [[St Kitts and Nevis]] began its programme which offered not only permanent residency but citizenship to foreign nations.<ref>Citizenship is for sale to the wealthy, Malta is among states to offer second passports, easing access to the wider EU, FT.com, Vanessa Houlder June 29, 2016,  https://www.ft.com/content/155936ec-2728-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89</ref> The issuing of golden visas has expanded dramatically during the 21st century, with around 25% of all countries issuing such visas as of 2015.<ref>IMF Working Paper, WP/15/93, Too Much of a Good Thing?: Prudent Management of Inflows under Economic Citizenship Programs, by Xin Xu, Ahmed El-Ashram and Judith Gold https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp1593.pdf</ref> Statistics on the issuing of golden visas ares scarce, but the IMF estimated in 2015 that the vast majority of golden visas are issued to Chinese nationals.

Immigrant investor programmes usually have multiple criteria that must be fulfilled for the investment to qualify, often pertaining to job creation, purchasing of real estate, non-refundable contributions or specific targeted industries.<ref name=":zxz">{{Cite book|title=Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook|last=Kalin|first=Christian H.|publisher=Ideos Publications|year=2015|isbn=978-0-9927818-5-9}}</ref> Most of these programmes are structured to ensure that the investment contributes to the welfare, advancement and economic development of the country in which the applicant wishes to reside or belong to.

There is an annual cap of 10,000 applications under the EB-5 arrangement.

The current investment threshold is 250,000 EUR for the purchase or long-term lease of property.

The Malta Individual Investor Programme,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://iip.gov.mt/|title=Individual Investor Programme – Malta|website=iip.gov.mt|access-date=2016-07-20}}</ref> which [[Henley & Partners]] was contracted in 2014 by the [[Government of Malta]] to design and implement, is similarly capped at 1,800 applicants. Applicants are subject to a thorough due diligence process which guarantees that only reputable applicants acquire Maltese citizenship. Moreover, applications from countries where international sanctions apply may not be accepted. Applications from a particular country can also be excluded on the basis of a Government policy decision.<ref name=":1" /> The minimum investment for this programme is $870,000 with a non-refundable contribution of $700,000.<ref name=":zxz" /> [[Portugal Golden Visa|Portugal's golden visa]] was introduced during the [[Great Recession]] in order to help attract investment in the country's housing market.

The issuing of so-called golden visas has sparked controversy in several countries. A lack of demonstrable economic benefits, and security concerns, have been among the most common criticisms of golden visas. In 2014 the Canadian government suspended their golden visa programme (although, as of 2017, Quebec maintains their own golden visa programme).<ref>[https://money.cnn.com/2014/02/12/news/canada-chinese-immigration/index.html "Canada kills investor visa popular with Chinese"], by Sophia Yan, March 25, 2014, CNN,</ref> The golden visas has been criticised by members of the European Parliament for disfavouring{{clarify|date=August 2018}} the concept of citizenship<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2014/11/20/buying-their-way-in|title=Buying their way in|via=The Economist}}</ref> and in 2014 the [[European Parliament]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that an EU passport should not have a "price tag".<ref>Malta's golden passport scheme draws fresh criticism, Concerns centre on selection of Jersey consultancy to run operation targeted at the wealthy, FT.com, https://www.ft.com/content/6f98892e-fbf3-11e5-b3f6-11d5706b613b</ref>

===Discriminatory practices===
Discriminatory border control practices by numerous jurisdictions have attracted controversy.

====United States====
Since the implementation of added security measures in the aftermath of the [[9/11|2001 World Trade Centre attacks]], reports of discrimination against people perceived to be Muslim by U.S. border security officers have been prevalent in the media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/26/how-discrimination-against-muslims-at-airports-actually-hurts-the-fight-against-terrorism/|title=Analysis &#124; How discrimination against Muslims at airports actually hurts the fight against terrorism|first=Stefano|last=Bonino|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> The [[Trump travel ban|travel restrictions]] implemented during the Trump presidency primarily against Muslim majority countries have provoked controversy over whether such measures are a legitimate [[#Border security|Border security]] measure or unethically discriminatory.

====Bhutan====
{{main|Lhotshampa|Bhutanese refugees}}

Starting primarily in the 1990s, the Bhutanese government implemented strict restrictions on Nepali residents and implemented internal border control policies to restrict immigration or return of ethnic Nepalis. This policy shift effectively ended previously liberal immigration policies with regards to Nepalis and counts amongst the most racialised border control policies in Asia.

====Israel====
Border control, both on entry and on exit, at Israeli airports rate passengers' potential threat to security using factors including nationality, ethnicity, and race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent|title=What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?|publisher=Access Control & Security Systems|accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2001/09/12/israelisecurity.htm | title=Israeli-style security might have averted hijackings | accessdate=2007-05-07 | newspaper=USA Today| date=2001-09-13}}</ref> Instances of discrimination against [[Arabs]], people perceived to be Muslim, and Russian Jews amongst others have been reported in the media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-my-friends-were-pro-israel-then-they-met-israeli-airport-security-1.5474044|title=What happened to my pro-Israel friends proves there's something rotten in Israeli airport security|website=Haaretz.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/abu-ghosh-restaurateur-airport-security-humiliated-my-wife/|title=Abu Ghosh restaurateur: Airport security humiliated my wife|first=T.

===Australian offshore detention centres===
{{main|Pacific Solution|Nauru Regional Processing Centre|Manus Regional Processing Centre}}

Beginning in 2001, Australia implemented border control policies featuring the detention of asylum seekers and economic migrants who arrived unlawfully by boat in nearby islands in the Pacific. These policies are controversial and in 2017 the [[Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea]] declared the detention centre at Manus Island to be unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pg/cases/PGSC/2016/13.html|title=Namah v Pato [2016] PGSC 13; SC1497 (26 April 2016)|website=www.paclii.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tlozek|first1=Eric|last2=Anderson|first2=Stephanie (political reporter)|title=PNG finds detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island illegal|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-26/png-court-rules-asylum-seeker-detention-manus-island-illegal/7360078|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> The adherence of these policies to international human rights law is a matter of controversy.

===North Korean refugees in China===
{{main|North Korean defectors#China}}

China does not currently recognise North Korean defectors as refugees and subjects them to immediate deportation if caught. The China-DPRK border is fortified and both sides aim to deter refugees from crossing. This aspect of Chinese border control policy has been criticised by human rights organisations.<ref>{{cite web | title= 2013 Update "THE LIST" of North Korean Refugees & Humanitarian Workers Seized by Chinese Authorities | work= North Korea Freedom Coalition | date= December 13, 2013 | url= http://www.nkfreedom.org/UploadedDocuments/2013.12.10_THE_LIST_ENGLISH.pdf | accessdate= December 13, 2013 | url-status= live | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213141020/http://www.nkfreedom.org/UploadedDocuments/2013.12.10_THE_LIST_ENGLISH.pdf | archive-date= 13 December 2013 | df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= Sign the Petition Calling on China to Stop the Forced Repatriation of North Korean Refugees| work= North Korea Freedom Coalition| date= December 13, 2013| url= http://www.nkfreedom.org/News/Sign-the-Petition-Calling-on-China-to-Stop-Repatriation-of-North-Koreans.aspx| accessdate= December 13, 2013| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213141309/http://www.nkfreedom.org/News/Sign-the-Petition-Calling-on-China-to-Stop-Repatriation-of-North-Koreans.aspx| archive-date= 13 December 2013| df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Restrictions on Northern Cypriot airspace===
As a result of [[Northern Cyprus]]'s sovereignty dispute with [[Republic of Cyprus|Southern Cyprus]], the South (a member of the [[European Union]]) has imposed restrictions on the North's airports, and pressure from the European Union has resulted in all countries other than Turkey recognising the South's ability to impose a border shutdown on the North, thus negating the right to [[self determination]] of the predominantly Turkish Northern Cypriot population and subjecting their airports to border controls imposed by the predominantly Greek South.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffmeister|title=Legal Aspects of the Cyprus Problem: Annan Plan And EU Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZXbg3ZwvGoC&pg=PA218|year=2006|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-04-15223-7|page=218}}</ref> As a result, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic support and is unable to develop a functioning economy.<ref name=indepuni>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/universities-little-accord-on-the-island-399360.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Universities: Little accord on the island | date=8 November 2007 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>
