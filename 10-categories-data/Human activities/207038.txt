'''Acrobatics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀκροβατέω, ''akrobateo'', "walk on tiptoe, strut"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29krobate%2Fw ἀκροβατέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) is the performance of extraordinary human feats of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[agility]], and [[motor coordination]]. It can be found in many of the [[performing arts]], [[sports|sporting]] events, and [[martial arts]]. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as [[acro dance]], [[circus]], and [[gymnastics]], but many other athletic activities—such as [[ballet]], [[slacklining]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]]—may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as [[aerobatics]].

==History==

[[File:Hydria acrobat BM VaseF232.jpg|thumb|170px|A female acrobat depicted on an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[hydria]], c. 340–330 BC.]]

Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago. For example, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of [[bull-leaping|acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls]]. [[Ancient Greeks]] practiced acrobatics,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Iversen |first1=Rune |title=Bronze Age acrobats: Denmark, Egypt, Crete |journal=World Archaeology |date=June 2014 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=242–255 |doi=10.1080/00438243.2014.886526}}</ref> and the [[noble court]] displays of the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]] would often include acrobatic performances that included [[juggling]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

In [[China]], acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (203 BC). Acrobatics were part of village harvest [[festival]]s.<ref>[http://www.redpanda2000.com/history.htm redpanda2000]</ref> During the [[Tang Dynasty]], acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.<ref>[http://www.pasadena.edu/chinese/cultural/acrobatics.html Pasadena.edu]</ref> Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern [[Chinese variety art]].

Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} in the 19th century, a form of performance art including [[circus]] acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.

Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as ''Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)'' by [[Impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1905 ''[[Acrobat and Young Harlequin]]'', and ''[[:File:Vasnetsov Acrobats.jpg|Acrobats in a Paris suburb]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].
