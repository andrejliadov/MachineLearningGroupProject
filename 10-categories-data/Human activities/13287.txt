[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate V. My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Tristram Shandy]], the term "hobby-horse" was used to refer to whimsical obsessions, which led to the current use of the word "hobby" ]]

A '''hobby''' is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's [[leisure time]], not professionally and not for pay. Hobbies include [[collecting]] themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A [[list of hobbies]] changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example [[stamp collecting]] was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while [[video games]] are more popular nowadays following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more availability in leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time. 

Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: ''casual leisure'' which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, ''serious leisure'' which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally ''project-based leisure'' which is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Serious Leisure: A Perspective for Our Time|last=Stebbins|first=Robert|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2015|location=New Brunswick}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[File:Wikipedian at otium.jpg|thumb|Writing and editing articles for [[Wikipedia]] is a hobby for some people.|243x243px]]
In the 16th century, the term "hobyn" had the meaning of "small horse and pony". The term "[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]" was documented in a 1557 payment confirmation for a "Hobbyhorse" from Reading, England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hobby-horse|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hobby-horse.html|work=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|access-date=5 May 2012|author=The Phrase Finder|year=1996–2012}}</ref> The item, originally called a "Tourney Horse", was made of a wooden or basketwork frame with an artificial tail and head. It was designed for a child to mimic riding a real [[Horses in the Middle Ages#Hobbies|horse]]. By 1816 the [[wikt:derivative|derivative]], "hobby", was introduced into the [[vocabulary]] of a number of English people.<ref>{{cite web|title=hobby|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hobby|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|access-date=5 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|author-link=Douglas Harper|year=2001–2012}}</ref> Over the course of subsequent centuries, the term came to be associated with [[recreation]] and [[leisure]]. In the 17th century, the term was used in a [[pejorative]] sense by suggesting that a hobby was a childish pursuit, however, in the 18th century with more industrial society and more leisure time, hobbies took on greater respectability.<ref>Gelber S M. '’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 11.</ref> A hobby is also called a '''pastime''', derived from the use of hobbies to pass the time. A hobby became an activity that is practised regularly and usually with some worthwhile purpose.<ref name="Gelber S M 1999, p. 12">Gelber S M. ‘’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 12.</ref> Hobbies are usually, but not always, practised primarily for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward.

==History==
Hobbies were originally described as pursuits that others thought somewhat childish or trivial. However, as early as 1676 Sir Matthew Hale, in ''Contemplations Moral and Divine'', wrote "Almost every person hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself."<ref name="Hale1676">{{cite book|author=Sir Matthew Hale|title=Contemplations moral and divine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP5|year=1676|publisher=Printed by William Godbid, for William Shrowbury at the Bible in Duke-Lane, and John Leigh at the Blew Bell Fleet Street near Chancery-lane|pages=201}}</ref> He was acknowledging that a "hobby horse" produces a legitimate sense of pride. By the mid 18th century there was a flourishing of hobbies as working people had more regular hours of work and greater leisure time. They spent more time to pursue interests that brought them satisfaction.<ref>Gelber S M. '’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 3.</ref> However, there was concern that these working people might not use their leisure time in worthwhile pursuits. "The hope of weaning people away from bad habits by the provision of counter-attractions came to the fore in the 1830s, and has rarely waned since. Initially the bad habits were perceived to be of a sensual and physical nature, and the counter attractions, or perhaps more accurately alternatives, deliberately cultivated rationality and the intellect."<ref>Thomson F M L. ‘’The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950 Vol 2’’. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 327</ref> The flourishing book and magazine trade of the day encouraged worthwhile hobbies and pursuits. The burgeoning manufacturing trade made materials used in hobbies cheap and was responsive to the changing interests of hobbyists.

The English have been identified as enthusiastic hobbyists, as George Orwell observed. "[A]nother English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it … is the addiction to hobbies and spare-time occupations, the privateness of English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not official—the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the 'nice cup of tea'."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|date=28 February 1941|title=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius.|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye|journal=England Your England}}</ref>

Deciding what to include in a [[list of hobbies]] provokes debate because it is difficult to decide which pleasurable pass-times can also be described as hobbies. During the 20th century the term hobby suggested activities, such as stamp collecting, embroidery, knitting, painting, woodwork, and photography. Typically the description did not include activities like listening to music, watching television, or reading. These latter activities bring pleasure, but lack the sense of achievement usually associated with a hobby. They are usually not structured, organised pursuits, as most hobbies are. The pleasure of a hobby is usually associated with making something of value or achieving something of value. "Such leisure is socially valorised precisely because it produces feelings of satisfaction with something that looks very much like work but that is done of its own sake."<ref name="Gelber S M 1999, p. 12"/> "Hobbies are a contradiction: they take work and turn it into leisure, and take leisure and turn it into work."<ref>Gelber S M. ‘’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 23.</ref>

Hobbies change with time. In the 21st century, the video game industry is a very large hobby involving millions of kids and adults in various forms of 'play'. [[Stamp collecting]] declined along with the importance of the postal system. [[Woodwork]] and [[knitting]] declined as hobbies, because manufactured goods provide cheap alternatives for handmade goods. Through the internet, an [[online community]] has become a hobby for many people; sharing advice, information and support, and in some cases, allowing a traditional hobby, such as [[collecting]], to flourish and support trading in a new environment.

== Hobbyists ==
Hobbyists are a part of a wider group of people engaged in [[leisure#Types of leisure|leisure]] pursuits where the boundaries of each group overlap to some extent. The ''Serious Leisure Perspective''<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|url = http://www.seriousleisure.net/|website = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref> groups hobbyists with amateurs and volunteers and identifies three broad groups of leisure activity with hobbies being found mainly in the Serious leisure category. ''Casual leisure'' is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation. ''Serious leisure'' is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment. Finally, ''project-based leisure'' is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.<ref name=":1" />

The terms amateur and hobbyist are often used interchangeably. Stebbins<ref name=":0" /> has a framework which distinguishes the terms in a useful categorisation of leisure in which ''casual leisure'' is separated from ''serious Leisure''. He describes serious leisure as undertaken by ''amateurs'', ''hobbyists'' and ''volunteers''. ''Amateurs'' engage in pursuits that have a professional counterpart, such as playing an instrument or astronomy. Hobbyists engage in five broad types of activity: ''collecting'', ''making and tinkering'' (like embroidery and car restoration), ''activity participation'' (like fishing and singing), ''sports and games'', and ''liberal-arts'' hobbies (like languages, cuisine, literature). Volunteers commit to organisations where they work as guides, counsellors, gardeners and so on. The separation of the amateur from the hobbyist is because the amateur has the ethos of the professional practitioner as a guide to practice. An amateur clarinetist is conscious of the role and procedures of a professional clarinetist.

A large proportion of hobbies are mainly solitary in nature.<ref>Gelber S M. ‘’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 28.</ref> However, individual pursuit of a hobby often includes club memberships, organised sharing of products and regular communication between participants. For many hobbies there is an important role in being in touch with fellow hobbyists. Some hobbies are of communal nature, like choral singing and volunteering.

People who engage in hobbies have an interest in and time to pursue them. Children have been an important group of hobbyists because they are enthusiastic for collecting, making and exploring, in addition to this they have the leisure time that allows them to pursue those hobbies. The growth in hobbies occurred during industrialisation which gave workers set time for leisure. During the Depression there was an increase in the participation in hobbies because the unemployed had the time and a desire to be purposefully occupied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gelber|first1=Steven|title=A Job You Can't Lose: Work and Hobbies in the Great Depression|journal=Journal of Social History|year=1991|volume=24|issue=4|pages=741–766|jstor=3788855|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1353/jsh/24.4.741}}</ref> Hobbies are often pursued with an increased interest by retired people because they have the time and seek the intellectual and physical stimulation a hobby provides.

== Types of hobbies==
{{Mainlist|List of hobbies }}Hobbies are a diverse set of activities and it is difficult to categorize them in a logical manner. The following categorization of hobbies was developed by Stebbins.<ref name=":1" /> {{Collecting Hobby}}

=== Collecting ===
{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2019}}
{{Main article|Collecting}}
Collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying and storing.<ref>Gelber S M. '’Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America’’ Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 11.</ref> Collecting is appealing to many people due to their interest in a particular subject and a desire to categorise and make order out of complexity. Some collectors are generalists, accumulating items from countries of the world. Others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest, perhaps 19th century postage stamps, [[milk bottle]] labels from Sussex, or Mongolian harnesses and tack, Firearms (both modern and vintage).
[[File:Stamp album sleeve.jpg|right|thumb|alt=text|A [[stamp album]] used in [[stamp collecting]].]]

Collecting is an ancient hobby, with the [[list of coin collectors]] showing [[Caesar Augustus]] as one. Sometimes collectors have turned their hobby into a business, becoming commercial dealers that trade in the items being collected.

An alternative to collecting physical objects is collecting records of events of a particular kind. Examples include [[train spotting]], [[bird-watching]], [[aircraft spotting]], [[railfan]]s, and any other form of systematic recording a particular phenomenon. The recording form can be written, photographic, online, etc.

=== Making and tinkering ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
''Making'' and ''tinkering'' includes working on self-motivated projects for fulfillment. These projects may be progressive, irregular tasks performed over a long period of time.<ref name=":1" /> Making and Tinkering hobbies include higher-end projects, such as building or restoring a car or building a computer from individual parts, like CPUs and SSDs. For computer savvy do-it-yourself hobbyists, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining may also popular. A CNC machine can be assembled and programmed to make different parts from wood or metal. 

Tinkering is 'dabbling' with the making process, often applied to the hobby of tinkering with car repairs, and various kinds of restoration: of furniture, [[antique car]]s, etc. It also applies to household tinkering: repairing a wall, laying a pathway, etc. Examples of Making and Tinkering hobbies include [[Scale model|Scale modeling]], [[model engineering]], [[3D printing]], [[Dressmaker|dressmaking]], and [[cooking]]. 

'''[[Scale model]]ing''' is making a replica of a real-life object in a smaller scale and dates back to prehistoric times with small clay "dolls" and other children's toys that have been found near known populated areas. The [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took the form to a greater depth during their years of domination of the Western World, using scale replicas of enemy [[fortification]]s, coastal defense lines, and other geographic fixtures to plan battles. {{Citation needed|reason=the information is not common knowledge|date=March 2019}}

At the turn of the Industrial Age and through the 1920s, some families could afford things such as [[Rail transport modelling|electric trains]], wind-up toys (typically boats or cars) and the increasingly valuable tin toy soldiers. Scale modeling as we know it today became popular shortly after [[World War II]]. Before 1946, children as well as adults were content in carving and shaping wooden replicas from block wood kits, often depicting enemy aircraft to help with identification in case of an invasion.{{Citation needed|reason=not common knowledge|date=October 2019}} 

With the advent of modern plastics, the amount of skill required to get the basic shape accurately shown for any given subject was lessened, making it easier for people of all ages to begin assembling replicas in varying scales. Superheroes, aeroplanes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers became quite popular subjects to build, paint and display. Although almost any subject can be found in almost any scale, there are common scales for such miniatures which remain constant today.

'''[[Model engineering]]''' refers to building functioning machinery in metal, such as [[internal combustion]] motors and [[live steam]] models or locomotives. This is a demanding hobby that requires a multitude of large and expensive tools, such as [[lathe]]s and [[Milling machine|mill]]s. This hobby originated in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century, later spreading and flourishing in the mid-20th century. Due to the expense and space required, it is becoming rare.

[[File:Z scale miniature railroad.jpg|thumb|400px|A coffee-table sized [[Rail transport modelling|model railroad]]]]

[[3D printing|'''3D Printing''']] is a relatively new technology and already a major hobby as the cost of printers has fallen sharply. It is a good example of how hobbyists quickly engage with new technologies, communicate with one another and become producers related to their former hobby. [[3D modeling]] is the process of making mathematical representations of three dimensional items and is an aspect of 3D printing.

'''[[Dressmaker|Dressmaking]]''' has been a major hobby up until the late 20th century, in order to make cheap clothes, but also as a creative design and craft challenge. It has been reduced by the low cost of manufactured clothes.

'''[[Cooking]]''' is for some people an interest, a hobby, a challenge and a source of significant satisfaction. For many other people it is a job, a chore, a duty, like cleaning. In the early 21st century the importance of cooking as a hobby was demonstrated by the high popularity of competitive television cooking programs.

=== Activity participation ===
{{one source|date=October 2019}}
Activity participation includes partaking in "non-competitive, rule-based pursuits."<ref name=":1" />

[[Outdoor pursuits]] are the group of activities which occur outdoors. These hobbies include gardening, [[hill walking]], [[hiking]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], cycling, [[canoeing]], [[climbing]], [[caving]], fishing, [[hunting]], target shooting (informal or formal), [[wildlife viewing]] (as [[birdwatching]]) and engaging in [[Water sport (recreation)|watersport]]s and [[Winter sport|snowsport]]s.

[[File:gardening.jpg|thumb|right|Gardening]]
One large subset of outdoor pursuits is gardening. [[Residential garden]]ing most often takes place in or about one's own residence, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located on a [[roof garden|roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], or on a [[patio garden|patio]] or [[vivarium]].

Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoological garden]]s), [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[theme park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels|hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of [[gardener]]s or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.[[File:Indoor garden.jpg|thumb|A variety of flowers and vegetables in an indoor garden.]]

Indoor gardening is concerned with growing [[houseplant]]s within a [[House|residence]] or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. [[Indoor garden]]s are sometimes incorporated into [[air conditioning]] or heating systems.

Water gardening is concerned with growing plants that have adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog]] gardens are also considered a type of water garden. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plants.

Container gardening is concerned with growing plants in containers that are placed above the ground.

=== Liberal arts pursuits ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
{{Main article|Liberal arts education}}
{{Main article|The arts}}
[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|An amateur magician performing.]]
Many hobbies involve performances by the hobbyist, such as singing, acting, [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], dancing, playing a [[musical instrument]], [[martial arts]], and other [[performing arts]].

Some hobbies may result in an end product. Examples of this would be woodworking, photography, [[moviemaking]], [[jewellery making|jewelry making]], software projects such as [[Photoshopping]] and home music or [[video production]], making [[friendship bracelets|bracelets]], [[art|artistic projects]] such as drawing, painting, Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper – called [[papercraft]]. Many of these fall under the category [[visual arts]].

Writing hobby is often taken up by aspiring writers and usually appears in the form of personal [[blog]], guest posting or fan fiction (literary art resulting in creation of written content based on already existing, licensed creative property under specified terms<ref>{{Cite web|title=Terms of Service {{!}} FanFiction|url=https://www.fanfiction.net/tos/|access-date=2020-08-28|website=www.fanfiction.net}}</ref>). 

[[Reading (process)|Reading]], books, [[ebook]]s, magazines, comics, or newspapers, along with browsing the internet is a common hobby, and one that can trace its origins back hundreds of years. A love of literature, later in life, may be sparked by an interest in reading children's literature as a child. Many of these fall under the category [[literary arts]].

===Sports and games===
{{Main article|Sport}}{{Main article|Game}}Stebbins<ref name=":1" /> distinguishes an amateur sports person and a hobbyist by suggesting a hobbyist plays in less formal sports, or games that are rule bound and have no professional equivalent. While an amateur sports individual plays a sport with a professional equivalent, such as football or tennis. Amateur sport may range from informal play to highly competitive practice, such as [[deck tennis]] or long distance trekking.

The Department for Culture, Media, and Support in England suggests that playing sports benefits physical and mental health. A positive relationship appeared between engaging in sports and improving overall health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Analysis of health and educational benefits of sport and culture|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysis-of-health-and-educational-benefits-of-sport-and-culture|website=gov.uk|access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref>

== Psychological role == 
During the 20th century there was extensive research into the important role that [[play (activity)|play]] has in human development. While most evident in childhood, play continues throughout life for many adults in the form of games, hobbies, and sport.<ref>Carlisle R P Ed, '’Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society Vol 1'’, SAGE Publications, 2009 page x</ref> Moreover, studies of [[ageing and society#Successful ageing|ageing and society]] support the value of hobbies in healthy ageing.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/debunking-myths-the-mind/201706/how-hobbies-impact-your-head-and-your-heart|title=How Hobbies Impact Your Head and Your Heart|last=Pillay|first=Srini|date=June 20, 2017|publisher=Psychology Today|language=en}}</ref>

== Significant achievements ==
There have been many instances where hobbyists and amateurs have achieved significant discoveries and developments. These are a small sample. 
* Amateur astronomers have explored the skies for centuries and there is a long list of [[Amateur astronomy#Notable amateur astronomers|Notable amateur astronomers]] who have made major discoveries. 
* A substantial amount of early scientific research came from the amateur activities of the wealthy, such as [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s contributions to the science of [[chemistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/antoine-laurent-lavoisier|title=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier |publisher=Science History Institute |access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref> At that time there were few professional scientists and little formal study in the area. Another example is the [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|experimentation in electricity]] that [[Benjamin Franklin]] undertook that resulted in his invention of the [[lightning rod]].{{sfn|Turner|2014|p=233{{incomplete short citation|date=March 2019}}}}
* [[Open-source model|Open source]] is a development model using the internet to cooperate on projects. It is most notable in the development of software and [[Open-source software#Widely used open-source software|widely used software]], which has been developed and maintained by large numbers of people, including many home-based amateurs with high level expertise.
* While the general public was not aware of nature observation which was formally conducted as [[field research]], during the 1930s, practitioners of the hobby went on to become the [[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]] of the [[conservation movement]] that flourished in the UK from 1965 onwards.
