'''Cooking''' or '''cookery''' is the [[art]], [[science]] and [[craft]] of using heat to [[Outline of food preparation|prepare food]] for consumption. Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the [[Earth|world]], from grilling food over an open fire to using [[electric stove]]s, to [[baking]] in various types of [[oven]]s, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.

Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in [[ceviche]], a traditional [[South America]]n dish where [[fish]] is cooked with the acids in [[lemon]] or lime juice or orange juice.

Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2015/09/02/a-brief-history-of-cooking-with-fire/|title=A Brief History of Cooking With Fire|last=Rupp|first=Rebecca|date=2015-09-02|website=National Geographic|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>

The expansion of [[agriculture]], commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of [[pottery]] for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A New Spin on Cooking |journal=Scientific American |volume=304 |issue=3 |pages=23 |author1=W.

Communication between the Old World and the New World in the [[Columbian Exchange]] influenced the history of cooking. The movement of foods across the Atlantic from the New World, such as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[maize]], [[bean]]s, [[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], [[vanilla]], [[pumpkin]], [[cassava]], [[avocado]], [[peanut]], [[pecan]], [[cashew]], [[pineapple]], [[blueberry]], [[Helianthus|sunflower]], [[chocolate]], [[gourd]]s, and [[cucurbita|squash]], had a profound effect on Old World cooking. The movement of foods across the Atlantic from the Old World, such as [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[pig]]s, [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, [[barley]], [[rice]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s, [[green bean]]s, [[mustard plant|mustard]], and [[carrot]]s, similarly changed New World cooking.<ref name = "history">{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163–188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}</ref>

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, food was a classic marker of identity in Europe. In the nineteenth-century "Age of [[Nationalism]]" cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought mass-production, mass-marketing, and standardization of food. Factories processed, preserved, canned, and packaged a wide variety of foods, and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the American breakfast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordion.com/documents/the-history-of-food-irradiation.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116012256/http://www.nordion.com/documents/The-History-of-Food-Irradiation.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2013 }}</ref> In the 1920s, [[frozen food|freezing methods]], [[cafeteria]]s, and [[fast food restaurant]]s emerged.

==Ingredients==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Most ingredients in cooking are derived from [[organism|living organisms]]. Vegetables, fruits, grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants, while meat, eggs, and dairy products come from animals. Mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of [[Fungus|fungi]]. Cooks also use [[water]] and [[mineral]]s such as [[salt]]. Cooks can also use [[wine]] or [[Distilled beverage|spirits]].

Naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called ''[[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]]'', ''[[carbohydrate]]s'' and ''[[fat]]s''. They also contain water and minerals. Cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules.

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main|Carbohydrate}}
Carbohydrates include the common sugar, [[sucrose]] (table sugar), a [[disaccharide]], and such simple sugars as [[glucose]] (made by enzymatic splitting of sucrose) and [[fructose]] (from fruit), and [[starch]]es from sources such as cereal flour, rice, [[arrowroot]] and potato.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002469.htm|title=Carbohydrates: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>

The interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex. [[Polysaccharide|Long-chain sugars]] such as [[starch]] tend to break down into [[Monosaccharide|simpler sugars]] when cooked, while simple sugars can form [[syrup]]s. If sugars are heated so that all water of [[crystallisation]] is driven off, then [[caramelization]] starts, with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of [[carbon]], and other breakdown products producing [[caramel]]. Similarly, the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the [[Maillard reaction]], a basic flavor-enhancing technique.

An [[emulsion]] of starch with fat or water can, when gently heated, provide thickening to the dish being cooked. In [[European cuisine|European]] cooking, a mixture of butter and flour called a [[roux]] is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guide.michelin.com/sg/dining-in/what-is-roux-sg/news|title=What is...roux?|website=MICHELIN Guide|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref> In Asian cooking, a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or [[corn starch]] and water. These techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous [[saccharide]]s during cooking, which causes the familiar thickening of [[sauce]]s. This thickening will break down, however, under additional heat.

===Fats===
{{Main|Fat}}
[[File:Frying doughnuts.jpg|thumb|[[Doughnut]]s frying in oil]]
Types of fat include [[vegetable oil]]s, animal products such as butter and [[lard]], as well as fats from grains, including [[maize]] and [[flax]] oils. Fats are used in a number of ways in cooking and baking. To prepare [[stir fry|stir fries]], [[grilled cheese]] or [[pancake]]s, the pan or griddle is often coated with fat or oil. Fats are also used as an ingredient in baked goods such as cookies, cakes and pies. Fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water, and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients, such as in frying, deep frying or sautéing. Fats are used to add flavor to food (e.g., butter or bacon fat), prevent food from sticking to pans and create a desirable texture.

===Proteins===
{{Main|Protein (nutrient)|Protein denaturation}}
Edible animal material, including [[muscle]], [[offal]], milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[egg white]]s, contains substantial amounts of protein. Almost all vegetable matter (in particular [[legume]]s and [[seed]]s) also includes proteins, although generally in smaller amounts. Mushrooms have high protein content. Any of these may be sources of [[essential amino acid]]s. When [[protein]]s are heated they become [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (unfolded) and change texture. In many cases, this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more [[friable]] – meat becomes ''cooked'' and is more friable and less flexible. In some cases, proteins can form more rigid structures, such as the coagulation of [[albumen]] in egg whites. The formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes, and also underpins many desserts based on [[meringue]].

[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water is often used to cook foods such as [[noodle]]s.]]

===Water===
{{Main|Water}}
Cooking often involves water and water-based liquids. These can be added in order to immerse the substances being cooked (this is typically done with water, [[stock (food)|stock]] or wine). Alternatively, the foods themselves can release water. A favorite method of adding flavor to dishes is to save the liquid for use in other recipes.  Liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food, as in [[steaming]], [[simmering]], [[boiling]], [[braising]] and [[blanching (cooking)|blanching]]. Heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased [[evaporation]], which [[concentrate]]s the remaining [[flavor]] and ingredients – this is a critical component of both [[stewing]] and sauce making.

===Vitamins and minerals===
[[File:November 15, 2012, The Right Cut (8223639251).jpg|thumb|Vegetables contain important vitamins and minerals]]
{{Main|Vitamin|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Vitamins and minerals are required for normal [[metabolism]] but which the body cannot manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources. Vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables ([[Vitamin C]]), carrots, [[liver (food)|liver]] ([[Vitamin A]]), cereal bran, bread, liver (B vitamins), fish liver oil ([[Vitamin D]]) and fresh green vegetables ([[Vitamin K]]). Many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron, [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium chloride]] and [[sulfur]]; and in very small quantities copper, [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. The micronutrients, minerals, and vitamins<ref>[http://www.brighthub.com/health/diet-nutrition/articles/44825.aspx Loss of nutrients when vegetables are cooked] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909071119/http://www.brighthub.com/health/diet-nutrition/articles/44825.aspx |date=9 September 2009 }}</ref> in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking.

==Methods==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{see also|List of cooking techniques}}
There are very many methods of cooking, most of which have been known since antiquity. These include baking, roasting, frying, grilling, barbecuing, smoking, boiling, steaming and braising. A more recent innovation is microwaving. Various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time. The method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others. Some major hot cooking techniques include:

;Steaming
:[[Steaming]] works by boiling water continuously, causing it to vaporise into steam; the steam then carries heat to the nearby food, thus cooking the food.  By many it is considered a healthy form of cooking, holding nutrients within the vegetable or meat being cooked.
: [[En papillote]] – The food is put into a pouch and then baked, allowing its own moisture to steam the food.
;Smoking
:[[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood.

==Health and safety==

===Food safety===
{{Main|Food safety}}
Cooking can prevent many [[foodborne illness]]es that would otherwise occur if the food is eaten raw. When heat is used in the preparation of food, it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as various parasites such as [[tapeworm]]s and ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''. [[Food poisoning]] and other illness from uncooked or poorly prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|pathogenic strains]] of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter]]'', viruses such as [[norovirus]]es, and [[protozoa]] such as ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Bacteria, viruses and parasites may be introduced through salad, meat that is uncooked or done [[Doneness|rare]], and unboiled water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/foodborne-illnesses|title= Foodborne Illnesses |work=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases }}</ref>

The [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] effect of cooking depends on temperature, cooking time, and technique used. Some [[food spoilage]] bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' or ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' can form spores that survive boiling, which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled. This makes it unsafe to reheat cooked food more than once.<ref>[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/complete_safefood.pdf Safe Food Australia – A Guide to the Food Safety Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922234817/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/_srcfiles/complete_safefood.pdf |date=22 September 2010 }}</ref>

Cooking increases the digestibility of many foods which are inedible or poisonous when raw. For example, raw cereal grains are hard to digest, while [[kidney bean]]s are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due to the presence of [[phytohaemagglutinin]], which is inactivated by cooking for at least ten minutes at {{convert|100|C}}.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Noah ND, Bender AE, Reaidi GB, Gilbert RJ |title=News, Notes, And Epidemiology |journal=Br Med J |volume=281 |issue=6234 |pages=236–237 |date=July 1980 |pmid=7407532 |doi=10.1136/bmj.281.6234.235 |pmc=1713670}}</ref>

Food safety depends on the safe preparation, handling, and storage of food. Food spoilage bacteria proliferate in the "[[Danger zone (food safety)|Danger zone]]" temperature range from {{convert|40|to|140|F|C}}, food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range. [[Hand washing|Washing of hands]] and surfaces, especially when handling different meats, and keeping raw food separate from cooked food to avoid cross-contamination,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/d468f3d9-fb6c-4109-88d7-2931f7132098/Barbecue_Food_Safety.pdf?MOD=AJPERES|title=Grilling and Food Safety|publisher =USDA|access-date=30 January 2019|date=June 2017}}</ref> are good practices in food preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |title=Basics for Handling Food Safely |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=1 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928210429/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Basics_for_Handling_Food_Safely/index.asp |archivedate=28 September 2004 }}</ref> Foods prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html|title=Cutting Boards (Plastic Versus Wood)|publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture & Life Sciences, the University of Arizona|work=Food Safety, Preparation and Storage Tips|year=1998|access-date=21 June 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613074257/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/health/foodsafety/az1076.html |archivedate=13 June 2006}}</ref><ref name="ReluctantGourmet">{{cite web|url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|title=Cutting Boards – wood or plastic?|work=ReluctantGourmet.com|access-date=21 June 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702142255/http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/cutting_board.htm|archivedate=2 July 2006}}</ref> Washing and [[Disinfection|disinfecting]] cutting boards, especially after use with raw meat, poultry, or seafood, reduces the risk of contamination.<ref name="ReluctantGourmet"/>

{{See also|Raw foodism}}
[[File:Rawtomatopasta1.jpg|thumb|A raw [[tomato sauce]] with [[olive]]s, [[celery]], [[spinach]] and [[walnut]]s on [[zucchini]] noodles.]]
Proponents of [[raw foodism]] argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health. They point out that during cooking of vegetables and fruit containing [[vitamin C]], the vitamin elutes into the cooking water and becomes degraded through oxidation. Peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin C content, especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin C is in the skin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potato2008.org/en/potato/factsheets.html|title=Potato, nutrition and diet - International Year of the Potato 2008|access-date=14 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105095547/http://www.potato2008.org/en/potato/factsheets.html|archive-date=5 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, research has shown that in the specific case of [[carotenoid]]s a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/>

Several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking meat at high temperature creates [[heterocyclic amine]]s (HCAs), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers at the [[National Cancer Institute]] found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done.<ref name=amines>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines |title=Heterocyclic Amines in Cooked Meats |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |year=2018 }}</ref> While avoiding meat or eating meat raw may be the only ways to avoid HCAs in meat fully, the National Cancer Institute states that cooking meat below {{convert|212|F}} creates "negligible amounts" of HCAs. Also, [[microwaving]] meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90% by reducing the time needed for the meat to be cooked at high heat.<ref name=amines/> [[Nitrosamine]]s are found in some food, and may be produced by some cooking processes from proteins or from nitrites used as food preservatives; cured meat such as bacon has been found to be carcinogenic, with links to colon cancer.

Research has shown that grilling, barbecuing and smoking meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAH). In Europe, grilled meat and smoked fish generally only contribute a small proportion of dietary PAH intake since they are a minor component of diet – most intake comes from cereals, oils and fats.<ref name="PAH in diet">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |title=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons – Occurrence in foods, dietary exposure and health effects |author=Scientific Committee on Food |date=4 December 2002 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |access-date=21 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519225348/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out154_en.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2011 }}</ref> However, in the US, grilled/barbecued meat is the second highest contributor of the mean daily intake of a known PAH carcinogen [[benzo(a)pyrene|benzo[a]pyrene]] at 21% after 'bread, cereal and grain' at 29%.<ref name="PAH in diet"/>

Baking, grilling or broiling food, especially starchy foods, until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of [[acrylamide]], a known [[carcinogen]] from animal studies; its potential to cause cancer in humans at normal exposures is uncertain.<ref name=cruk>{{cite web |publisher=Cancer Research UK| title=Food Controversies—Acrylamide |url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer/food-controversies#food_controversies0 |date=2016 |access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref> Public health authorities recommend reducing the risk by avoiding overly browning starchy foods or meats when frying, baking, toasting or roasting them.<ref name=cruk/>

===Other health issues===
Cooking dairy products may reduce a protective effect against colon cancer. Researchers at the [[University of Toronto]] suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized [[dairy product]]s (see also [[Raw milk]]) may reduce the risk of [[colorectal cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01635589509514381 |vauthors=Corpet DE, Yin Y, Zhang XM |title=Colonic protein fermentation and promotion of colon carcinogenesis by thermolyzed casein |journal=Nutr Cancer |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=271–81 |year=1995 |pmid=7603887 |pmc=2518970 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose, casein, and beef tallow had one-third to one-fifth the incidence of [[adenoma|microadenomas]] as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Corpet DE, Stamp D, Medline A, Minkin S, Archer MC, Bruce WR |title=Promotion of colonic microadenoma growth in mice and rats fed cooked sugar or cooked casein and fat |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=50 |issue=21 |pages=6955–8 |date=November 1990 |pmid=2208161 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=2208161}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jnci/84.13.1026 |vauthors=Zhang XM, Stamp D, Minkin S |title=Promotion of aberrant crypt foci and cancer in rat colon by thermolyzed protein |journal=J.

According to the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration of the United States]], health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist. "The small quantities of antibodies in milk are not absorbed in the human intestinal tract," says Barbara Ingham, PhD, associate professor and extension food scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "There is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an anti-arthritis factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases."<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2004/504_milk.html "Got Milk?"] by Linda Bren.

Deep fried food in restaurants may contain high level of [[trans fat]], which is known to increase levels of [[low-density lipoprotein]] that in turn may increase risk of [[Coronary disease|heart diseases]] and other conditions. However, many fast food chains have now switched to trans-fat-free alternatives for deep-frying.<ref name="McDs">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16873869 |title=McDonald's finally picks trans-fat-free oil |publisher=[[NBC News]] |date=30 January 2007 |access-date=13 September 2007}}</ref>

==Scientific aspects==
{{main|molecular gastronomy}}
The application of [[scientific knowledge]] to cooking and [[gastronomy]] has become known as [[molecular gastronomy]]. This is a subdiscipline of [[food science]]. Important contributions have been made by scientists, chefs and authors such as [[Herve This]] (chemist), [[Nicholas Kurti]] (physicist), [[Peter Barham]] (physicist), [[Harold McGee]] (author), [[Shirley Corriher]] (biochemist, author), [[Heston Blumenthal]] (chef), [[Ferran Adria]] (chef), [[Robert Wolke]] (chemist, author) and [[Pierre Gagnaire]] (chef).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guler|first=Ozan|title=The Harmony of Science and Food:Molecular Gastronomy.|publisher=Strategic Researchers Academy Publishing|date=October 2019|isbn=978-605-69709-1-7}}</ref>

Chemical processes central to cooking include the [[Maillard reaction]] – a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid, a reducing sugar and heat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/colour/maillard.htm|title=Food-Info.net : Maillard reactions|website=www.food-info.net|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>

==Home-cooking and commercial cooking==
[[File:Küche.JPG|thumb|A restaurant kitchen in [[Munich]], Germany (Haxnbauer restaurant)]]
Home cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally in a home or around a [[Communal oven|communal fire]], and can be enjoyed by all members of the family, although in many cultures women bear primary responsibility.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Cecile|title=Men at Work: Labour, Maculinities, Development|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=225}}</ref> Cooking is also often carried out outside of personal quarters, for example at restaurants, or schools. [[Bakery|Bakeries]] were one of the earliest forms of cooking outside the home, and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of pots of food provided by their customers as an additional service. In the present day, factory food preparation has become common, with many "ready-to-eat" foods being prepared and cooked in factories and home cooks using a mixture of [[wikt:from scratch|scratch made]], and factory made foods together to make a [[meal]]. The nutritional value of including more commercially prepared foods has been found to be inferior to home-made foods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nutritional Quality of Food Prepared at Home and Away From Home, 1977-2008|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib105.aspx|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=2015-11-21|last1=Lin|first1=Biing-Hwan|last2=Guthrie|first2=Joanne|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122104524/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib105.aspx|archivedate=22 November 2015}}</ref> Home-cooked meals tend to be healthier with fewer calories, and less [[saturated fat]], [[Cholesterol embolism|cholesterol]] and [[sodium]] on a per calorie basis while providing more [[Dietary fiber|fiber]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Impact of cooking and home food preparation interventions among adults: outcomes and implications for future programs |journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior |date=2014-08-01 |issn=1878-2620|pmc=4063875 |pmid=24703245 |pages=259–276 |volume=46|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2014.02.001|first1=Marla|last1=Reicks|first2=Amanda C. |last2=Trofholz |first3=Jamie S.|last3=Stang|first4=Melissa N.|last4=Laska}}</ref> The ingredients are also directly sourced, so there is control over authenticity, taste, and nutritional value.

"Home-cooking" may be associated with [[comfort food]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VMmDwAAQBAJ&q=Home-cooking+may+be+associated+with+comfort+food&pg=PT106|title=Comfort Food: Meaning and Memories|last1=Jones|first1=Michael Owen|last2=Long|first2=Lucy M.|date=2017-04-14|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-4968-1086-1|language=en}}</ref> and some commercially produced foods and restaurant meals are presented through advertising or [[packaging]] as having been "home-cooked", regardless of their actual origin. This trend began in the 1920s and is attributed to people in urban areas of the U.S. wanting homestyle food even though their schedules and smaller kitchens made cooking harder.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Just Like Home: "Home Cooking" and the Domestication of the American Restaurant |journal=Gastronomica |date=Fall 2002 |pages=43–52 |volume=2 |issue=4 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2002.2.4.43 |first=Samantha |last=Barbas |jstor=10.1525/gfc.2002.2.4.43 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.buffalo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=articles }}</ref>
