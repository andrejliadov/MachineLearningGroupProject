'''Deliberative planning''' refers to a planning process that focuses on making decisions through [[dialogue]], making seasoned arguments and in depth deliberations to take the correct course of action. Deliberative Planning focuses on actions, and the effect that they have on the course of a project. 

This planning method is a form of [[participatory planning]], an [[urban planning]] theory that focuses on involving the community in the planning and management process. [[Participatory planning]] works to include all points of view in the decision making process, and gather them all into one vision. Being deliberative involves being motivated by an intended outcome and choosing a vision that is based on sound evidence and reason.

Deliberation can take many forms in understanding planning, whether it be more formal and technical, or more organic and exploratory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.participatorymethods.org/resource/deliberative-practitioner-encouraging-participatory-planning-processes|title=The deliberative practitioner: encouraging participatory planning processes {{!}} Participatory Methods|last=Macbeth|first=Sarah|website=www.participatorymethods.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> According to [[Diane Hoskins|Diane Hopkins]], deliberative planning has three main parts: "the motives behind involving citizens in [[decision-making]] (Philosophy); the design and dynamics of the decision-making ([[Process philosophy|Process]]); and the intended and actual outcomes of deliberative planning (Outcome)."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/31644918?selectedversion=NBD44110425|title=Communicate, participate, or deliberate?

Deliberative planning does not have to be solely based in the planning field, but also has applications in [[Computer programming|computational programming]] and [[Artificial intelligence|AI]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.laas.fr/planning/ijcai-2016-tutorial/Introduction.pdf|title=Introduction to Automative Planning and Acting|last=Ghallab|first=Malik|date=May 4, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In computational programming, the idea of being deliberative focuses on understanding planning, intent, and motivation to achieve the desired result.
