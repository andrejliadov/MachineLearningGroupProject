A '''delaying tactic''' or '''delay tactic''' is a strategic device sometimes used during business, diplomatic or interpersonal negotiations, in which one party to the negotiation seeks to gain an advantage by postponing a decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/delaying+tactic|title=Definition of DELAYING TACTIC|website=Merriam-webster.com|access-date=22 January 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=DELAYING TACTICS - meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/delaying-tactics|access-date=22 January 2019|website=Dictionary.cambridge.org}}</ref> Someone uses a delaying tactic when they expect to have a stronger negotiating position at a later time. They may also use a delaying tactic when they prefer the status quo to any of the potential resolutions, or to impose costs on the other party to compel them to accept a settlement or compromise.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Frecon|first=Alain|date=2004|title=Delaying Tactics in Arbitration|journal=Dispute Resolution Journal|volume=59|pages=40-52|via=ebscohost}}</ref> Delay tactics are also sometimes used as a form of indirect refusal wherein one party postpones a decision indefinitely rather than refusing a negotiation outright.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsuiki Moaveni|first=Hiroko|date=July 2014|title=A Study of Refusal Strategies by American and International Students at an American University|url=https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1354&context=etds|journal=Cornerstone}}</ref> To use a delaying tactic, the delaying party must have some form of control over the decision-making process.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-09-29|title=Delay Tactics: When to Stall and How to Recognize When Someone Is Giving You the Run-Around|url=https://keldjensen.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/delay-tactics-when-to-stall-and-how-to-recognize-when-someone-is-giving-you-the-run-around/|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Keld Jensen|language=en}}</ref>

== Delaying tactics in psychology ==
Delaying tactics can be employed, either intentionally or subconsciously, as a coping mechanism to avoid making difficult decisions or performing unpleasant tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 Ways to Cope With Life's Unpleasant Tasks|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201706/10-ways-cope-lifes-unpleasant-tasks|access-date=2020-07-03|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref>The reasons that an individual may use delay tactics may vary, but motivations often include maintaining control and avoiding change; especially when this change is unwanted. By delaying a decision, the individual avoids committing to a course of action that could lead to limited autonomy or feelings of loss of control.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss|date=2012-09-25|title=Ten Reasons People Resist Change|work=Harvard Business Review|url=https://hbr.org/2012/09/ten-reasons-people-resist-chang|access-date=2020-07-03|issn=0017-8012}}</ref> This kind of delay tactic is often seen as a fear of commitment, when an individual would rather remain undecided than to commit to any specific option available to them. A closely related phenomenon is [[opportunity cost]], wherein an individual is unwilling to forgo other available options to commit to one.<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp</ref><ref>https://www.intercom.com/blog/action-vs-indecision/#:~:text=At%20best%2C%20it's%20an%20opportunity,the%20costs%20are%20greater%20still.</ref> 

Delay tactics can also be the result of [[denial]] if an individual is unwilling to accept any of the available options, especially when choosing between multiple negative outcomes.<ref>https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/denial/art-20047926</ref>  An individual may delay making a decision in the hope that a better option will become available or that the decision will be made for them by others or by changing circumstances. Delay tactics and indecision can be a symptom of mild to severe mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Depression and Indecision: Trouble Making Decisions {{!}} HealthyPlace|url=https://www.healthyplace.com/depression/symptoms/depression-and-indecision-trouble-making-decisions|access-date=2020-07-03|website=www.healthyplace.com}}</ref> 

Delaying and indecision can also be the result of fear of making a poor choice. This can stem from an obsessive desire to identify the optimal solution by gathering more information. This can result in the decision being postponed indefinitely, especially in situations where some degree of uncertainty is unavoidable.<ref>https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&context=faculty_scholarship</ref> This can be further exacerbated if the individual has [[Traumatic memories|trauma]] associated with the consequences of their past decisions.<ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/counseling-keys/201707/uncovering-hidden-causes-indecision</ref>  

=== Delaying tactics survival value ===
Delaying tactics are a part of the body's natural response to perceived threats. Freezing is a primary instinctive survival response along with fight and flight <ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-21|title=Fight, Flight, or Freeze: How We Respond to Threats|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Healthline|language=en}}</ref> Freezing is an automatic, involuntary response to fear. This tactic delays other responses, allowing for more time to process the situation and gather information before taking any action.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Freezing with Fear|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/denying-the-grave/201801/freezing-fear|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref> Freezing may also occur when neither fight or flight is an available option.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why do we freeze when we're scared?|url=https://www.popsci.com/why-do-we-freeze-when-frightened/|access-date=2020-07-03|website=Popular Science|language=en}}</ref> If there is no decision to make, freezing is not a delaying tactic.

# A common type of delay tactic in politics is the [[filibuster]], wherein a party attempts to prevent a vote on a proposed piece of legislation by prolonging the debate of that legislation indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Senate: Glossary Term {{!}} Filibuster|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/filibuster.htm|access-date=2020-07-19|website=www.senate.gov}}</ref>
# In Newcastle, England delay tactics are built into the criminal justice system. Police and prosecutors delayed charging suspects for crimes for up to four years waiting for sufficient evidence to release or convict them. The delay of prosecution could potentially lead to dangerous criminals being able to reenter the public while under investigation, making this a controversial use of delaying tactic.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Delay tactics failing victims and denying justice to all; barrister calls for an end to release practice|date=February 2020|work=Evening Chronicle}}</ref>

# Delay tactics are used by banks to make it difficult to change providers or move their money to a better, cheaper, alternative. This is done by making customers pass through a series of tedious legal hurdles and/or by drawing our the response time it takes to switch providers.
