The '''chain-linked model''' or '''Kline model''' of innovation was introduced by mechanical engineer Stephen J. Kline in 1985,<ref>Kline (1985). Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1, March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.</ref> and further described by Kline and economist [[Nathan Rosenberg]] in 1986.<ref>Kline, S.J. & N. Rosenberg (1986). “An overview of innovation.” In R. Landau & N. Rosenberg (eds.), The Positive Sum Strategy: Harnessing Technology for Economic Growth. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, pp. 275–305.</ref> The chain-linked model is an attempt to describe complexities in the  [[innovation]] process. The model is regarded as Kline's most significant contribution.<ref>[https://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/971028kline.html Salisbury, David F., "Memorial for Stephen Kline; engineer, interdisciplinary thinker," news release, Stanford University, October 27, 1997.]</ref>

==Description==
In the chain-linked model, new knowledge is not necessarily the driver for innovation.  Instead, the process begins with the identification of an unfilled market need.  This drives research and design, then redesign and production, and finally marketing, with complex [[feedback]] loops between all the stages.  There are also important feedback loops with the organization's and the world's stored base of knowledge, with new basic research conducted or commissioned as necessary, to fill in gaps. 

It is often contrasted with the so-called [[linear model of innovation]],<ref>Caraça, João,  Bengt-Åke Lundvall, and Sandro Mendonça (2009).  “The changing role of science in the innovation process: From Queen to Cinderella?” Technological Forecasting & Social Change 76, 861–867.</ref> in which basic research leads to applied development, then engineering, then manufacturing, and finally marketing and distribution.

==Applications==
The Kline model was conceived primarily with commercial industrial settings in mind, but has found broad applicability in other settings, for example in military technology development.<ref>Marius Vassiliou, Stan Davis, and Jonathan Agre (2011).  Innovation Patterns in Some Successful C2 Technologies." Proc. 16th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, Quebec, Canada.</ref>  Variations and extensions of the model have been described by a number of investigators.<ref>Kameoka, A., D.
