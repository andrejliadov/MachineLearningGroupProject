The '''Sith''' are the main antagonists of many works in the fictional universe of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith|title=Sith|work=StarWars.com}}</ref> The '''Sith Order''' are depicted as an ancient [[monastic]] and [[Kraterocracy|kraterocratic]] [[cult]]ist organization of supernaturally gifted [[The Force|Force-wielders]] driven by a [[Niccolo Machiavelli#Beliefs|machiavellian]]-[[Imperialism|imperialist]] agenda of galactic domination and revenge against their arch-rivals, the [[Jedi|Jedi Order]].

Sith are ruthless and [[totalitarian]] by design, in which a supreme [[autocratic]] authority is concentrated in a single individual granted the honorific '''Dark Lord of the Sith'''. Sith culture is of perpetual self-destruction and reinvention; transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned assassinations: when a '''Sith Lord''' grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their property and authority are transferred to the apprentice who killed them. Robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the culprit is not caught. Sith teach their apprentices to revere the dark side of the Force and to believe that the galaxy was theirs to [[Mandate of Heaven|rule by cosmic right]]. This kraterocratic system ensures that Sith society nurtures some of the most vicious and competitive individuals in the galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Etymology==
The word ''Sith'' was first used in the 1974 rough draft of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/the-star-wars-rough-draft/|title=Roughdraft|work=StarWarz.com}}</ref> with the first published use being the 1976 [[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|novelization of ''Star Wars'']] as a title for the key villain [[Darth Vader]], the "Dark Lord of the Sith". Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some [[Star Wars expanded to other media|''Star Wars'' Legends]] works prior to the release of ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', and in archived footage for the original ''Star Wars''.<ref>Dark Horse Comics, ''[[Dark Empire]]''</ref>  The term "Dark Jedi" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as Sith, or had goals and practices similar to the Sith. In his novel series ''[[The Thrawn Trilogy]]'', author [[Timothy Zahn]] labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor [[Palpatine]] as "Dark Jedi", and the term "Sith" was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels. "Dark Jedi" is also the name given in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] to [[antihero]] fictional characters attuned to [[the Force]] and adept in its dark side. However, the concept of "Dark Jedi" is not referenced anywhere in any of the theatrical ''Star Wars'' films, and they exist by that name only in non-canonical ''Star Wars'' Legends media, including video games such as ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)|Star Wars: Jedi Knight]]'' series. The Sith were not mentioned by name in canonical movies until the prequel trilogy used the word on film starting with 1999's ''[[The Phantom Menace]]''.

===Influences===
{{Main|Star Wars sources and analogues|Star Wars#Themes}}

[[George Lucas]] acknowledged that the [[Jedi]], Sith, and other [[the Force|Force]] concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: [[knighthood]], [[chivalry]], [[paladin]]ism, [[samurai]] [[bushido]], [[Shaolin Monastery]], [[Feudalism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Qigong]], [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Greek mythology|mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]] and [[Roman mythology|mythology]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], and numerous cinematic precursors. The works of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of ''Star Wars''.<ref name="swmyth">{{cite web | url=http://www.films.com/id/11017/The_Mythology_of_Star_Wars_with_George_Lucas_and_Bill_Moyers.htm | title=The Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas and Bill Moyers | publisher=Films Media Group | work=films.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |title=Star Wars @ NASM, Unit 1, Introduction Page |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |date=1999-01-31 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408195115/http://nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/StarWars/sw-unit1.htm |archive-date= 8 April 2010 }}</ref>  In particular, the contrasting narrative relationship between the dark side-using Sith and light side-using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes.

Most prominently, the conflict between the Sith and Jedi employs the classic trope of [[Black-and-white dualism|black and white moral dualism]]—an elemental contrast between evil (the "darkness") and good (the "light") first postulated and elaborated in [[Zoroastrianism]], from which the core mythos of Star Wars is much influenced.<ref>Featurette "The Chosen One", Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith DVD</ref>  The ongoing struggle of the humanistic "light side"-affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic "dark side"-affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values, but as a deep metaphysical conflict: The dark side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi, and generally represented within ''Star Wars'' media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://andphilosophy.com/2017/03/13/the-paradox-of-the-force-the-quest-for-balance-in-star-wars/|title=The Paradox of The Force in Star Wars|website=AndPhilosophy.com}}</ref>  Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals, but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil, embodied in the power-hungry Sith and the dark side of the Force.

The dualistic relationship between the Sith' and the Jedi' concepts of "purity" mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of "[[Apollonian and Dionysian]]": the Jedi are portrayed as embracing [[Purity in Buddhism|purity]], reason, temperance, altruism and other [[Humanism|humanistic virtues]]; the Sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered self-interest and other [[Hedonism|hedonistic vices]]. However, whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed, ''Star Wars'' frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle, with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-who-is-the-chosen-one/|title=Star Wars: Who Is The Chosen One?|website=SlashFilm.com|date=23 March 2017}}</ref>  Although a path to temporary power, the Sith way inevitably leads to ruin.

Within the ''Star Wars'' narrative, the Jedi and Sith naturally have different self-understandings. In Sith rhetoric, the relationship between the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith closely mirrors Nietzsche's concept of [[master–slave morality]]. Sith value "master" virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the Jedi value altruistic virtues like kindness and empathy. The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness: the ability to shape and destroy the world according to one's will alone. The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness: freedom from inner, and outer, turmoil and suffering. However, the Sith consider the Jedi's aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic. To the Sith, greater power is the only authentic goal.

==Development==
Originally, George Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] in the same way that the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' had served [[Adolf Hitler]]. In developing the history for ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Lucas condensed this into one character in the form of Darth Vader.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaminski|first=Michael|title=The Secret History of Star Wars|edition=3.0|year=2008|orig-year=2007|publisher=Legacy Books Press|isbn=978-0-9784652-3-0|page=184}}</ref>
===Fictional backstory===
====Sith Ideology====
Sith philosophy lionized conflict as a [[catalyst]] for growth and as a tool for [[purge|purging]] the weak, disloyal, undisciplined and unworthy. Sith academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an underlying "kill or be killed" mentality amongst the apprentices. Sith emphasize "[[survival of the fittest]]" and view [[Self-control|restraint]] as a weakness. Members adhere to [[master morality]], are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage. The Sith cultivate a connection to the dark side of [[the Force]], which provides them with easy access to superhuman power and arcane knowledge; however, the trade-off is the severe cost of adopting a [[dark triad]] personality that corrodes their basic capacity for empathy, kindness, and love.

Throughout ''Star Wars'' media and in popular culture, the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the [[Jedi]], an affiliation of [[altruistic]] warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the "light side" of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy. The Sith have a philosophical framework that "justifies" their ruthless and self-serving actions, but their agenda are considered appalling by society in general, and the Jedi who actively oppose them. To counteract the Jedi's benevolent influence, the Sith were responsible for secretly instigating many small regional conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy. Hiding in the shadows, their fingerprints are everywhere, in every conflict in the galaxy, and their subversive influence reaches far and wide.

Over their long storied history, the Sith have established great empires, come close to realizing their ambitions of galactic conquest, and nearly eradicated the Jedi. Ultimately, however, they are self-defeating, their grand plans undone time and again by internal strife, rebellion inspired by their vicious tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their dark arts and philosophy.

====The ''Dark Side'' of the Force====
The Sith are dedicated to the "Sith Code" and to mastering the dark side of the Force.<ref name="sw-en">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|title=Sith, Star Wars Encyclopedia|work=StarWars.com|publisher=Lucasfilm|accessdate=2013-03-20}}</ref> The Sith Code identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality, and holds that the search for lasting peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided. Rather, Sith embrace strife and [[Passions (philosophy)|dark passion]] as salutary and emancipatory forces, as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory. Although Sith seek dominion, Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus "betrayal" among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm. Accordingly, the Sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's perceptions and power. In connection with their philosophy, the Sith draw on the dark side of the Force through severe negative emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their archenemies, the Jedi, who rely on the Force's "light side," i.e., the Force as experienced through disciplined states of quietude and compassion. Notably, both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love, as the Jedi fear such love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the dark side of the Force. 
Although the Sith are intimately linked to the dark side, not every user of the dark side is a Sith, nor is every user of the light side a Jedi.
  
{{quote|text=Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did [[Darth Vader|Obi-Wan’s apprentice]].|title=''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''|character=[[Yoda]]}}

The dark side of the Force is stigmatized as seductive, corruptive, and addictive by the Jedi, who view it as evil,<ref>{{cite book|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOzY95F6as0C|first1=Kevin S. |last1=Decker |first2=Jason T. |last2=Eberl|isbn=0-8126-9583-6|publisher=Open Court|date=2005}}</ref> whereas the Sith consider the dark side of the Force to be its most powerful manifestation, and regard the abstemious Jedi as blinded by false virtue. As portrayed in all ''Star Wars''-related media, the dark side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side-using Jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage. By deciding to learn the ways of the dark side of the Force, the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the ''Star Wars'' universe to be unnatural.<ref>Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith</ref> A notable example is a form of directed dielectric breakdown called "Force lightning," infamously used by the Sith Lord [[Darth Sidious]] to torture Jedi-initiate and rebel Luke Skywalker. Darth Sidious claimed that his own master, Darth Plagueis, could even use the Force to avert the natural deaths of those whose lives he wished to save. Being uninhibited in their use of the Force, Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi, such as telekinesis, to new and terrifying effect: [[Darth Vader]] was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation, or "Force choke," as a means of execution or intimidation.

{{quote|text=Beneath anger is always fear. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you. Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.|title=''[[The Phantom Menace]]''|character=[[Yoda]]}}

Extended indulgence in the dark side reshapes the user's psychology, resulting in a loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the ability to love, leaving every Sith, to varying degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent. Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether, some who turn to the dark side take on a different name, as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed. Sith Lords, in particular, adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order, prefixing it with the title '''Darth''' (e.g., "Darth Vader"). Severe saturation in the dark side may even lead to physical degradation. Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable: Some Sith, most famously [[Darth Vader]] in the final moments of his life, have renounced the Order and the dark side of the Force.

{{quote|text=The dark side is generous... It is patient and it always wins – but in the heart of its strength lies its weakness: one lone candle is enough to hold it back.|title=''[[Revenge of the Sith]]'' novelization|character=[[Yoda]]}}

Martial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition, and Sith featured in the ''Star Wars'' film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force. Like the Jedi, the Sith's signature armament is an extremely lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a [[lightsaber]], which (generally) only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively. Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force-derived powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman combat prowess. A fully trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well-trained Jedi Knight, and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers armed with projectile weapons. In matters of dress, Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise; they commonly favor black robes, armor and gis when presenting themselves authentically.

===Fictional backstory (''Legends'')===

In the ''Legends'' continuity, the Sith Order began around 6,900 BBY, during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness. A series of conflicts began between the rebellious dark Jedi, a faction of the Jedi Order, and the rest of the Order. The dark Jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the unknown regions. These Exiles came across the planet Korriban, and its native species, the Sith. The strongest among the Exiles, Ajunta Pall, became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith. His contemporaries, such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords. The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species, who also had an affinity for the Dark Side. They would become the original Sith Empire.

One of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord. He expanded the Sith territories and conquered the Dromund System, home to Dromuund Kaas, later the capital of the Sith Empire. He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos, the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith. Upon the passing of Ragnos, two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, dueled at his funeral. Eventually, after a series of conflicts, Sadow was victorious, and Kressh apparently killed.

Sadow began the Great Hyperspace War, invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets. Sadow's efforts were initially met with success, his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord's concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him. With his illusions dispersed, Sadow's forces were forced to retreat. Upon returning to Sith space, they found that Kressh had not been killed, and engaged him in a space battle. Sadow was victorious again, but they were soon attacked by Republic forces. Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova.

The Sith Empire would eventually rise again, with the rise of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma. The spirit of the deceased Dark Lord, Marka Ragnos, declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith, and made Qel-Droma his apprentice. Allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians, Kun and Qel-Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic. During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus, Qel-Droma dueled and killed his brother, but was captured. Qel-Droma was redeemed and was instrumental in Kun's downfall, when the latter retreated to Yavin 4.

At some point following the Mandalorian Wars, the individuals known as Revan and Alek declared themselves Sith Lords, and became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively. Their brutal campaign against the Republic was hugely successful. Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak, allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him. Malak continued his conquest without Revan's tactical leadership until a redeemed Revan defeated him, and the Star Forge, the source of the Sith Fleet was destroyed.

Remnants of Revan's Sith Empire, led by the Sith Triumvirate, consisting of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, began a shadow war against the Jedi. This First Jedi Purge, brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction. Their downfall came about when Meetra Surik, a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars, returned to known space. She defeated the three Sith, and without the Sith leadership, and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V, the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity.

Around 300 years later, the original Sith Empire, now under the leadership of Emperor Vitiate, emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic. This war, dubbed the Great Galactic War, was halted when Vitiate, on the cusp of victory, was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan. After a period of non-fighting, called the Galactic Cold War, tensions boiled over, and the Galactic War began. The Sith empire eventually fell to infighting and mostly disappeared. Occasionally, a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin, would rise and fall, but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around 2,500 years later.

At this point, the Brotherhood of Darkness arose, led by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan. They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith. This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic. Ironically, one of their own, a Sith Lord by the name of Bane turned on them, because he disapproved of their methods. He manipulated the Brotherhood into extinction, and they were defeated. Bane started the Rule of Two, which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films.

===Fictional history===
{{Main|Star Wars#Premise}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga began with the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', which was released in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Movie Database|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759|accessdate=2011-11-14}}</ref> Since then, [[Star Wars films|films]], [[List of Star Wars books|books]], [[Star Wars games|computer games]] and [[Star Wars comics|comics]] have been released, all set in the [[Star Wars universe|fictional universe of ''Star Wars'']], which has expanded the history of the Sith within their stories.

The schemes of the Sith are key to the overarching plot of the ''Star Wars'' films and much other fictional material in the franchise. Their background has varied among depictions, but the Sith have always been insidious archenemies of the [[Jedi]] leveraging dark arts in pursuit of power and revenge. The Sith were first mentioned in ''A New Hope'' in a scene ultimately cut from the film. They were expanded upon heavily in the following years in books, comics, games and other multimedia. The Sith were formally introduced on-screen with the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' in 1999 as a shadowy martial order manipulating the movie's political factions into a galaxy-spanning civil war.

''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' first aired on [[Cartoon Network]] in 2008. This series took place between ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. During this time, [[Anakin Skywalker]] is a full-fledged Jedi Knight and the series shows how he progresses into his fall to the Dark Side of the Force.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars|url=http://www.tv-links.eu|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> [[Count Dooku]] is the active Sith Lord and leader of the Separatist Alliance. The series also explores Dooku's attempts at training secret apprentices like [[Asajj Ventress]] and [[Savage Opress]] in order to eventually defeat Darth Sidious and become the ruling Sith Lord.

====Emergence of the Sith Order====
The origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to [[the Force]]. With proper training, the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of "sensing" or "touching" it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental suggestion. Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force; discipline is required. However, both quietude and focused, intense passion alike can be effective. The Sith originated in a species of Force-sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least 5,000 years prior to the events of the first ''Star Wars'' film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luceno|first=James|title=Star Wars: Tarkin|year=2014|publisher=Del Rey Books|isbn=978-0-345-51152-2}}</ref> Fully embracing this approach, they became defined and corrupted by it.

The warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of an older martial order of Force-sensitive sapient beings in the ''Star Wars'' universe: The Jedi. The Jedi served as a space-faring [[Military order (monastic society)|knightly order]] within the [[Galactic Republic]], a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds. The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy, in keeping with their ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the common welfare. The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force, and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the proper means of accessing its power. When members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative, controversy emerged. The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi, opening members to the seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty. Eventually, this controversy led to a sectarian conflict in which the heterodox Jedi were defeated and exiled.<ref>Marvel Comics, Star Wars 9 – "Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II"</ref>

In exile, the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force. They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: Passion, not quietude, was the most potent means of accessing the Force, and conflict, not peace, was the natural and healthy state of the universe. Rejecting the self-abnegation of their forebears, the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it. In their training, the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate, a practice anathematized by the Jedi as taking recourse to the Force's "Dark Side." Guided by their [[Might makes right|kratocratic]] and egoistic philosophy and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques, the former Jedi exiles would reemerge to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order, aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi.

A succession of Sith-led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars – "Escape from Kadavo"</ref> However, internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith's designs. The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with corporate action would become a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith. Ultimately, this paradox would be “resolved” through a drastic reorganization effected by a leader named Darth Bane, who recast the Sith in an esoteric lineal master-apprentice tradition known as “The Rule of Two.”<ref>Star Wars: The Clone Wars – "Sacrifice"</ref> Thereafter (at least, as a matter of orthodoxy) there would be only two Sith at a time: One to embody power, and another to crave it. While concealing their identity as Sith, a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to inveigle or force themselves into positions of power and undermine responsible government, preparing the Galactic Republic for eventual usurpation. The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his or her master, and take an apprentice in turn. In this way, Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years; he believed that the kratocratic essence of Sith philosophy could be reconciled with a sustained project of galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi. The first six ''Star Wars'' films chronicle the consummation, and eventual undoing, of this ancient scheme.

====Ascent to power of the Sith====
Darth Bane's plan would come to fruition through [[Palpatine|Sheev Palpatine]], a [[Naboo]] Senator, later Supreme Chancellor, of the [[Galactic Republic]], and secretly a Dark Lord of the Sith (“Darth Sidious”). By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic, Palpatine orchestrated civil war. This conflict, known within the ''Star Wars'' universe as the "[[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]", provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic's chief executive and assembling a large army of hastily cloned soldiers—surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine. Although the Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine's identity as a Sith and attempted to arrest him, this action was anticipated by Palpatine, who framed their actions as an attempted coup, providing in turn a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating “Order 66,” one of the clone soldiers’ embedded protocols. In the course of effecting his designs, Palpatine also manipulated the Jedi's most powerful initiate, Anakin Skywalker, into his service, by promising to teach Skywalker dark side techniques that could save the life of [[Padmé Amidala]], a Galactic Senator to whom Skywalker was secretly married in violation of Jedi rules, and whose death in childbirth Skywalker had preternaturally foreseen. In a tragic irony, Amidala's sheer horror at discovering Skywalker's collaboration with Sidious in destroying the Jedi would itself be the cause of her death during childbirth, though Sidious would trick Skywalker into believing that an episode of Skywalker's physical abuse of Amidala had been the actual cause of her death. Skywalker's subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the dark side of the Force and assume the persona of [[Darth Vader]], Lord of the Sith. With Darth Vader at his side, the Emperor would rule the newly styled Galactic Empire for approximately 20 years as its Emperor. Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious, two children were delivered by Padme before her death.

====Sith temples====
The ''Rebels'' episode "Twilight of the Apprentice" features a forbidden planet called Malachor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor|title=Malachor|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> home of an ancient '''Sith temple'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/malachor-sith-temple|title=Malachor Sith temple|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> The temple contains a superweapon, and can only be activated by placing a special Sith Holocron<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith-holocron|title=Sith holocron|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> in an [[obelisk]] at the summit of the pyramid inside the temple. Thousands of years prior, a battle was waged on Malachor that resulted in the deaths of its inhabitants. Somewhere between the events of his last appearance in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and this ''Rebels'' episode, [[Darth Maul]] had become stranded on the planet. When [[Ahsoka Tano]], [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]] arrive, Ezra is separated from them. He is discovered by Maul, and together, they use the Force cooperatively to solve a series of tests, and retrieve a Sith Holocron. With the help of Kanan and Ahsoka, they fought three Inquisitors, all of whom are killed by Maul. Maul then betrays his allies, blinding Kanan, and proceeds to activate the superweapon.

Maul is defeated by a sightless Kanan, and Darth Vader arrives with the intention of retrieving the holocron, but is challenged by Ahsoka, his former Padawan. While the superweapon is preparing to fire, Kanan and Ezra retrieve the holocron and escape, preventing the weapon of mass destruction from being used. Even though the temple is destabilized, Ahsoka and Vader keep fighting to the death within the rapidly crumbling building, until it eventually explodes, wounding Vader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/star-wars-rebels-twilight-of-the-apprentice-review|title=Star Wars Rebels: "Twilight of the Apprentice" Review|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=30 March 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref>

====End of the Sith====
Anakin's children, [[Princess Leia|Leia]], and [[Luke Skywalker]] would become key members of the [[Rebel Alliance]] to restore the Galactic Republic. Luke would be secretly tutored in the ways of the Force by Vader's own former Jedi master, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and a powerful elder Jedi, [[Yoda]], who also survived Palpatine's purge. Ironically, during a final confrontation between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and the Emperor aboard a mobile battle station known as the [[Death Star]], the Sith lineage would end as Darth Bane prescribed that it proceed. Darth Sidious offered Skywalker an ultimatum to enter his service or die, and proceeded to use his Force-derived powers to torture and kill Skywalker when the latter refused to embrace the Dark Side of the Force. Experiencing a crisis of conscience at the imminent death of Skywalker, whom Vader now knew to be his son, Darth Vader chose to intervene and kill his former master, Sidious fulfilling the prophecy of the Chosen One. Vader would die of his own injuries shortly thereafter, thus apparently bringing an end to the Sith and their ancient vendetta.

The 2019 film ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'' depicts the climax of the conflict between the Sith and the Jedi,<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |title=Everything New Revealed in Vanity Fair's The Rise of Skywalker Cover Story |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/everything-new-revealed-in-vanity-fairs-the-rise-of-skywalker-cover-story |website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=May 22, 2019 |date=May 22, 2019}}</ref> and features the group known as the [[#Sith Eternal|Sith Eternal]], led by a resurrected Darth Sidious. When Sidious meets his final demise at the hands of his granddaughter, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], the moment also marks the definitive end of the Sith.

===== Darth Sidious =====
{{main|Palpatine}}
Darth Sidious (Sheev Palpatine) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith who appeared in each trilogy of the ''[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker Saga]]''. Originally the eldest son of an aristocratic family from the planet [[Naboo]], he rose to power within the Galactic Republic's government system starting from Senator of his homeworld, then to Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and finally to self-proclaimed Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. This was done by cultivating a public image as a humble and competent politician while secretly mastering dark Sith arts studying under Plagueis, and planning the destruction of the Jedi Order and Republic. Eventually, by manipulating disaffected political groups and using double agents to sow discord, Palpatine fomented a civil war that provided an opportunity for him to seize absolute power. He had three known Sith apprentices: Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and Darth Vader. He was eventually betrayed and killed<!--Do NOT use "seemingly killed" or related phrases; the source states Palpatine was indeed killed, and this is further confirmed in the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker--> by his last, Vader, at the end of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious|url=https://www.starwars.com/databank/emperor-palpatine-darth-sidious|accessdate=January 26, 2020|website=[[Star Wars Databank]]}}</ref> He returned more than 30 years later in ''[[The Rise of Skywalker]]'', having managed to cheat death through powerful mastery of the dark side of the Force.<ref name="Vanity Fair">{{cite magazine|last1=Robinson|first1=Joanna|last2=Breznican|first2=Anthony|author-link2=Anthony Breznican|date=December 20, 2019|title=A Guide to All the Old Star Wars References in The Rise of Skywalker|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/12/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-easter-eggs-callbacks-references|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|accessdate=January 11, 2020}}</ref> He was finally killed by his granddaughter, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], who deflected his Force lightning back at him using the [[Skywalker family|Skywalker]] lightsabers. Darth Sidious' death marked what appears to be the definitive end of the Sith.

In ''Legends'' continuity, Darth Sidious would return using clones and ancient Sith powers, returning in several clone bodies over the course of several novels and comics. During this time he would briefly turn [[Luke Skywalker]] to the dark side of the Force through sheer power as much as by guile, though Luke would later be redeemed by his sister Leia and restored to the light side of the Force and defeated Palpatine once and for all. Shortly before his first death, Palpatine had sent a psychic command through the Force to [[Mara Jade]], planting in her the need to kill Luke. She eventually fulfilled this command by slaying a clone of Luke called Luke Skywalker, whom Palpatine had made in an attempt to use him against the original, though this plot ultimately would fail due to Mara's fatal attack on the clone.

===== Darth Maul =====
{{main|Darth Maul}}
Darth Maul (Maul) was a male [[Dathomirian]] [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] Sith Lord who served as the first apprentice of Darth Sidious. He first appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'', where he was ordered by his master to capture [[Queen Amidala]] of Naboo in order for her to sign a treaty that would legalize the Trade Federation's invasion of the planet. After tracking the Queen's personal starship to Tatooine, he briefly attacked [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the Jedi sent to escort Amidala to Coruscant, but he escaped. Later, Maul travelled to Naboo to aid the Federation's invasion and again fought Jinn, along with his Padawan [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in the plasma refinery complex beneath Theed Palace. Though he managed to kill Jinn, he was then defeated by Kenobi, who sliced him in half, leading to everyone, including Sidious, to believe he had died. In reality, however, Maul survived his injuries and ended up on the junk planet [[Lotho Minor]], where he would become a cyborg and be driven to insanity. He was eventually rescued by his brother [[Savage Opress]] twelve years later, during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. After being provided with a pair of new robotic legs by the Nightsisters, led by Maul's mother, [[Mother Talzin|Talzin]], he sought revenge against Kenobi. In the process, he recruited several crime syndicates to his cause, forming the Shadow Collective. He took over [[Mandalorian|Mandalore]], only to be defeated and captured by Sidious. Maul later escaped and managed to rebuild his criminal empire. Near the end of the war, he engineered a conflict on Mandalore to lure out and kill Anakin Skywalker. [[Ahsoka Tano]] was sent to deal with him instead, and he was captured, only to be freed by Tano when Sidious executed [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]], causing the [[Clone trooper|clone troopers]] to turn on their [[Jedi]] generals. During the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] era, Maul, having abandoned his Sith persona, led the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate, until being stranded on the Sith world of [[Malachor]] for years. He escaped after meeting Jedi Padawan [[Ezra Bridger]], whom he attempts to turn to the dark side, and later forced to assist in locating Kenobi. Upon tracking him down to [[Tatooine]], he confronted Kenobi and fought him one final time. Maul was fatally injured and died in Kenobi's arms, realizing that the latter was looking after [[Luke Skywalker|the boy]] he believed to be the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]] and would one day avenge those who had suffered because of Sidious and the Sith, including Maul.

===== Darth Tyranus =====
{{main|Count Dooku}}
Darth Tyranus (Count Dooku of Serenno) was a male human Sith Lord and the second apprentice of Darth Sidious, first appearing in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]''. Dooku was a former [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] who was trained by Grandmaster [[Yoda]] and took on [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] as his apprentice, but later became disillusioned with the [[Galactic Republic]]'s Senate, realizing that immediate change was needed in order to maintain peace, and turned to the dark side of the Force. He played an important role in Sidious' plans to take over the galaxy, engineering the Clone Wars by recruiting the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]] as the template for a [[Clone trooper|clone army]] that would be used by the Republic, and forming the Confederacy of Independent Systems, consisting of numerous planets and systems who wanted to become independent from the Republic. Dooku served as the [[figurehead]] of the Separatist Alliance throughout the Clone Wars until meeting his demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]'', who decapitated him at Chancellor Palpatine's (secretly Darth Sidious) urgings, thus revealing that Sidious never cared about Dooku and merely used him to aid his plans. Dooku was succeeded by Anakin himself, who fell to the dark side of the Force shortly after and became Sidious' third apprentice, Darth Vader, accomplishing what Dooku couldn't: helping Sidious wipe out the Jedi Order and form the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Tyranus/Count Dooku|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/dooku/|accessdate=22 November 2011|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm}}</ref>

===== Darth Vader =====
{{main|Darth Vader}}
Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) was a male human-cyborg Dark Lord of the Sith and the third and final apprentice of Darth Sidious, who first appeared in the [[Star Wars#original trilogy|''Star Wars'' original trilogy]], and later in [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|the prequel trilogy]]. As the Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker, he fought alongside his master Obi-Wan Kenobi during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, but was slowly seduced to the dark side by Darth Sidious. After helping Sidious kill Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]], he swore allegiance to the Sith and was given the name Darth Vader before setting out to destroy all Jedi left on Coruscant. After being sent by Sidious to assassinate the Separatist council members on Mustafar, Vader was badly injured in a duel with Kenobi, resulting in the loss of his remaining organic arm, both legs, and severe burn injuries. He was saved by Sidious, and encased in a black suit of armor with extensive cybernetics which kept him alive. As the Galactic Empire was established and continued to grow, Vader became the Emperor's immensely feared second-in-command and was given the task of finding surviving Jedi and the [[Rebel Alliance]]'s base. After the destruction of the [[Death Star|first Death Star]], Vader was charged with tracking down the Rebel Alliance and destroying their headquarters. However, the actions of his son, [[Luke Skywalker]], eventually turned Vader against his master, resulting in both Sidious' and Vader's deaths, as well as the fulfilment of the Chosen One prophecy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Vader|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/darthvader/|accessdate=22 November 2011|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm}}</ref>

Forced to flee from [[Korriban]], Andeddu created the world of Prakith, where he would rule as a deity for several centuries until meeting his demise and entombing himself to prevent his followers from stealing his secrets even in death. Prior to his death, he would also create a Sith holocron to store all his knowledge, including the ability to cheat death by transferring one's essence into another vessel, and his cult, called "the Malevolence", would create a temple in the reverence of the Dark Lord, believing that one day he would return. The legend of Andeddu and his incredible power remained at large long after his death, despite the Jedi Order's attempt to erase all knowledge and reference about the Sith.

In the ''Star Wars'' canon, Andeddu is only mentioned in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Andeddu thousands of years after his death and had the 5th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.

He owned two crossguard lightsabers, which were found and given away by the smuggler Sana Starros after the [[Battle of Yavin]]. The anger possessed by Atrius when wielding both these crossguard lightsabers at the same time, carried over to the weapons themselves, and can transfer over to their new owners.

He lived at an unknown point in time before ''Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace'', and was best known for coming back to life after being killed by the Jedi Order, in order to fight them once again. The legend of Darth Wrend would come to [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s mind during his time as a Padawan, who opened the holocron of prophecy, which contained numerous prophecies of which several dated ten thousand years prior. One of the prophecies said that evil would disappear yet appear again once the righteous had lost its light, which many believed that was referring to the return of the Sith. At that time, Qui-Gon believed that the prophecy talked about Darth Wrend's return from the dead and that it had already been fulfilled, although it would later be revealed that the prophecy referred to the Jedi learning about Darth Sidious' existence and that the Sith had lived in secret for almost a millennium.

In the ''Legends'' continuity, Darth Revan was both a male Dark Lord of the Sith and Jedi Knight, who served as the main protagonist of the video game ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]'', and a major character in the ''Knights of the Old Republic'' series overall. He lived approximately 4,000 years before the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope]]''. Once Jedi heroes who led the Republic to victory in the Mandalorian Wars, Revan and his comrade, Alek, turned to the dark side after stumbling upon the Sith Empire, hidden in the Unknown Reaches of space, and being tortured by the Sith Emperor. Upon escaping, the pair formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Alek, now Darth Malak, as his Sith Apprentice. As a Sith, Revan prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded his flagship, but Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and [[Bastila Shan]], betrayed his master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Revan was critically injured and taken by Bastila Shan to the Jedi Council Enclave. The Council chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint him with a false identity. Revan later awoke on a starship under attack and encountered Malak, who eventually revealed the truth of his identity. Following this, Revan defeated Malak in a final battle, claiming victory for the Republic. Revan later married Bastila Shan with the approval of the Jedi Council and eventually departed into the Unknown Regions to confront the Sith Emperor, but was imprisoned for 300 years until his descendant Satele Shan rescued him. However, due to being imprisoned for centuries, his lighter half had perished and became a Force spirit, leaving only his darker half, which sought to destroy the Sith Emperor once and for all. Since the Emperor's physical body had already been destroyed, leaving only his spirit, Revan planned to resurrect him so that he could then kill him for good. However, he was ultimately defeated by the combined forces of the Republic and his lighter half. The two halves of Revan then merged in peace and died for the final time, although, unbeknownst to everyone, the Sith Emperor had been resurrected and escaped into the galaxy. Following his death, Revan would be remembered by the galaxy for thousand of years, both as a legendary Jedi hero and one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived.

In the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Revan is only mentioned in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Revan thousands of years after his death and had the 3rd Legion of Sith Troopers named after him. Revan was also originally set to appear in the episode "Ghosts of Mortis" of ''The Clone Wars'' TV show alongside Darth Bane, but they were both ultimately cut.

===== Darth Momin =====
Darth Momin (Momin) was a male Dark Lord of Sith who appeared in the novel series ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'' and the 4th issue of the ''Lando'' comic book. Once a sculptor, he was imprisoned at a young age for his creations, which scared most people who saw them. Momin was eventually rescued by a woman named Shaa, who trained him in the dark side of the Force and whom he eventually killed after believing that he had become more powerful than his master. Momin then built a superweapon to destroy an entire city and perished when the Jedi intervened to stop him, losing control over the energy he wielded and causing his physical body to be destroyed, leaving only his mask with his consciousness inside. Years later, the mask would be retrieved from the Jedi Archive vault by Darth Sidious, who gave it to his apprentice Darth Vader as a gift for his journey to [[Mustafar]], which Vader sought to make his personal stronghold. After Momin's spirit killed some of his personnel, Vader examined the mask and learned of Momin's past, before letting him possess the body of a Mustafarian and build a fortress for him. Shortly after Momin finished building of the fortress, Vader was distracted by an invasion of Mustafarians, which Momin took advantage of to open the door to the Dark Side and resurrect himself. However, after challenging Vader to a duel, Momin met a quick demise by being crushed with a giant rock. Despite Momin's death, his dark essence would remain in the mask for years to come. At one point, Momin's mask was located aboard the Imperial yacht ''Imperialis'', when a group of thieves led by [[Lando Calrissian]] attempt to rob the ship. After Momin's spirit possessed the bodies of two thieves, the others abandoned them and destroyed the ship, seemingly ending Momin's legacy. [[Luke Skywalker]] later learned about Momin and his history during his travels across the galaxy, and described the Sith Lord's role in building Vader's fortress in his book, titled ''The Secrets of the Jedi''.

===== Darth Bane =====
{{main|Darth Bane}}
Darth Bane (Dessel) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and the sole survivor of Sith Order in the aftermath of the ancient war between the Jedi and the Sith. He is best known for establishing the Rule of Two, which was considered the beginning of the modern Sith within the ''Star Wars'' canon. This rule stated that there must be only two Sith Lords at a time: a master to embody power, and an apprentice to crave it and eventually overthrow his/her master and adopt an apprentice of his/her own.<ref>{{cite web|title=Darth Bane|url=http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/groups/sith/|work=StarWars.com|publisher=LucasFilm|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> He is the main character of the non-canonical ''Darth Bane'' Trilogy by Drew Karpyshyn.

In the ''Star Wars'' canon, Darth Bane's backstory as the only Sith surivor of the Jedi-Sith war and the creator of the Rule of Two is mostly unchanged, though not much else is known about him. His only appearance was in the episode "Sacrifice" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', where his spirit was encountered by Yoda on the Sith homeworld of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Moraband|Moraband]]. Bane was also originally set to appear in the episode "Ghosts of Mortis" alongside Darth Revan, but they were both ultimately cut.

===== Darth Tenebrous =====
{{main|Darth Tenebrous}}
In the ''Legends'' continuity, Darth Tenebrous (Rugess Nome) was a male [[Bith (Star Wars)|Bith]] Dark Lord of the Sith with the power of foreseeing the future, including his own death, and the master of both Darth Plagueis and Darth Venamis, the latter of whom he kept secret as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. His public persona was Rugess Tome, a legendary artisanal starship designer with a galaxy-spanning reputation, and he was known for being a scientific genius and master planner, as well as for his breathing apparatus. Tenebrous' secret plan was to possess the Chosen One once he would appear, but he was eventually killed by Plagueis during a mission on the planet Ban'demnic. However, Tenebrous wasn't too surprised at Plagueis's betrayal and instead congratulated him with his dying breath, because his conscience would soon be able to enter his apprentice's body. Despite managing to cheat death, Tenebrous' plan failed, because, during his time in Plagueis' body, he foresaw him being killed by his own apprentice before the appearance of the Chosen One, meaning that Tenebrous would never be able to possess him. Tenebrous then tried to escape from Plagueis' body, but only saw the mummified remains of his original body, as decades had passed since his death. As such, Tenebrous was cursed to remain a vague spirit for the rest of eternity, unable to gain a physical body ever again.

In the ''Star Wars'' canon continuity, Darth Tenebrous is only mentioned in ''The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary'', where, even though his backstory is never explained, it is revealed that Darth Sidious' Sith Eternal cult still had knowledge of Tenebrous many years after his death and had the 26th Legion of Sith Troopers named after him.

===== Darth Plagueis =====
{{main|Darth Plagueis}}
Darth Plagueis was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and Darth Sidious' master, first referenced in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]''. In the film, Sidious (as Palpatine) uses Plagueis' story to seduce Anakin Skywalker to the dark side, claiming that Plagueis' abilities in the Force grew to such an extent that he could create life by influencing microscopic force-sensitive entities called "midi-chlorians," and even save people from dying. According to the Rule of Two, Plagueis was eventually killed by Sidious in his sleep, who subsequently became the new Sith Master and would later take on an apprentice of his own.

In the ''Legends'' continuity, Plagueis was a [[Muun]] and maintained a public influence as the benevolent Hego Damsk II, a member of the Intergalactic Banking Clan. He is the main character of the non-canonica novel, ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis]]''.

==== Shadow Hands of the Sith ====
Although not official Sith, several other dark side users in the service of the Sith were present during the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] and the initial years of the Galactic Empire.

===== Asajj Ventress =====
[[Asajj Ventress]] was a female Dathomirian Sith Shadow Hand trained under Darth Tyranus and an antagonist of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. She first appeared in the now non-canonical 2003 series ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', in which Darth Sidious assigned her to kill the then-Padawan Anakin Skywalker. After tracking the young war hero to the planet Muunilinst, Ventress engaged Anakin's Republic fighter forces fighting above the Separatist-occupied world and baited him in a chase to [[Yavin IV|Yavin 4]], where a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple took place. Though she initially gained the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin called upon his immense connection to the Force to brutally overpower her, causing the Dathomirian to fall over the edge of a cliff. She luckily survived the landing and continued to serve her master throughout the Clone Wars on several occasions.

In ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'', Ventress was a recurring antagonist during the first seasons, as she assisted Dooku with several schemes, most of which were thwarted by the Jedi. After being replaced with Savage Opress for her failures, Ventress returned to the Nightsisters until General Grievous led a massacre against them, which only she and Mother Talzin survived. From there, she helped [[Boba Fett]]'s team of bounty hunters on a dangerous mission, which thus marked the start of her own bounty hunting career. Ventres later appeared in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Dark Disciple]]'', which was intended for a story arc in the TV series. In the novel, she teamed up with Jedi [[Quinlan Vos]] to assassinate Count Dooku, and, along the way, the two fell in love. However, their attempt to kill Dooku failed, and Dooku captured Vos, turning him to the dark side. Ventress managed to turn Vos back, but died saving him from an angered Dooku and was later buried on Dathomir, amongst her fallen sisters.

===== Savage Opress =====
[[Savage Opress]] was a male Dathomirian [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] Sith Shadow Hand first trained under Darth Tyrannus and later under his own brother, Darth Maul, as well as a major antagonist in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. Originally a Nightbrother under Mother Talzin on Dathomir, he was handpicked by Asajj Ventress as part of her scheme to kill Darth Tyrannus for the attempt on her life. His mind was eventually altered by the Nightsisters, making him more of a [[berserker]] on Ventress' call to the point of killing his brother Feral without remorse. Opress managed to become Tyrannus' new Shadow Hand and learned only a little about the ways of the Sith before Ventress had him help her fight their master due to his actions under him getting unwanted attention from the Jedi. However, in the heat of the moment and provoked by both of them, Opress tried to kill both Tyrannus and Ventress before escaping back to Dathomir. There, he was instructed by Mother Talzin to find Maul so that he could complete his training to defend himself against the numerous enemies he had made. After finding his long-lost brother as a shell of his former self on a junk planet, Opress managed to stir up Maul's grudge with Obi-Wan Kenobi to aid him in his revenge against the Jedi. From there, the Zabrak duo were able to set up a Confederacy against the Republic separate from the Separatists, and soon took over [[Mandalore]]. However, they received an unexpected visit by Darth Sidious, who considered Maul's sudden rise to power a threat to his rule, and dueled both him and Opress. The latter met a quick demise after being stabbed with Sidious' two lightsabers, and died in Maul's arms.

===== Inquisitorius =====
The Inquisitors were an organization of Force-sensitive warriors in the service of the Galactic Empire prior to the events of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', where it is implied that they all became defunct, as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time. Most of them were former Jedi, who had lost their faith in the Jedi Order and succumbed to the dark side, during or shortly after the Clone Wars. They were all recruited into the Empire and trained by Darth Vader, who tasked them with hunting down other survivors of the Great Jedi Purge, as well as other Force-sensitive individuals, mostly children, to prevent them from becoming future Jedi. Among the known Inquisitors were: 
*'''The Grand Inquisitor''' - the individual who would become known as the Grand Inquisitor was a former [[Pau'an]] Jedi Temple Guard. He was one of the several guards who escorted the fallen Jedi [[Barriss Offee|Barris Offee]] for her trial after the bombing of the Jedi Temple in the episode "The Wrong Jedi" of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. He later lost his faith in the Jedi Order and turned to the dark side, before coming into service of the Empire. Over the years, the Inquisitor worked his way up the Empire's ranks and eventually became the highest-ranking Inquisitor, being tasked (along with his subordinates) with hunting down Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and preventing them from becoming Jedi. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared as the main antagonist of the first season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was assigned to hunt down [[Kanan Jarrus]] and [[Ezra Bridger]]. He was eventually defeated by Kanan in combat and chose to commit suicide rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his failure. A vision of the Grand Inquisitor in his old Jedi Temple Guard attire later appeared to Kanan in the Jedi Temple on [[Lothal (Star Wars)|Lothal]] and dueled him as part of his final trial to become a Jedi Knight.
*'''The Second Sister''' - Trilla Suduri was the Padawan of Jedi Knight Cere Junda and one of the few survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. After Cere was captured and interrogated by the Empire, she betrayed Trilla's location, leading to her being captured and tortured by the Empire as well, until giving into the dark side and becoming the Second Sister Inquisitor. She initially made a [[cameo appearance]] in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', and later served as the main antagonist of the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she was tasked with hunting Jedi Padawan [[Cal Kestis]], as well as a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children. Although she succeeded in securing the holocron, she was eventually defeated by Kestis and Cere at the Inquisitor headquarters on the planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons|Nur]]. Cere then attempted to make amends with her former Padawan, but Darth Vader appeared and killed Trilla for failing her mission.
*'''The Fifth Brother''' - the [[Fifth Brother (Star Wars)|Fifth Brother]] was a former green-skinned humanoid male member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was shown to be working closely with the Seventh Sister, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Fifth Brother was eventually defeated after dueling Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Ahsoka Tano and Maul on [[Malachor]], being disarmed by Ahsoka and subsequently killed by Maul.
*'''The Sixth Brother''' - Bil Valen was a former humanoid Jedi Knight who eventually lost his faith in the Jedi Order and became the Sixth Brother Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was described as tall with unnatural-looking grey skin, piercing ice-blue eyes, broad shoulders, and distinctive scar/tattoo-like marking, and was also shown to have lost an arm to Darth Vader during one of his training sessions. The Sixth Brother only appeared in novels, most prominently in ''Ahsoka'', where he was tasked with hunting Ahsoka Tano, but was ultimately defeated by her after she caused his lightsaber to overload and explode, killing him. His lightsaber would later be rebuilt by Ahsoka into two white ones, which she would use for years to come.
*'''The Seventh Sister''' - the [[Seventh Sister (Star Wars)|Seventh Sister]] was a former female [[Mirialan]] member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost her faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. She was introduced in the second season of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where she was shown to be using small droids to help her track down her targets, and was also working closely with the Fifth Brother, as they were both tasked with hunting the ''Ghost'' crew after the Grand Inquisitor's death, during which they also competed against each other to become the next Grand Inquisitor. The Seventh Sister was eventually defeated by Maul on Malachor and subsequently killed by him, after Ezra Bridger refused to do so.
*'''The Eighth Brother''' - the [[Eighth Brother]] was a former male Terrelian Jango Jumper member of the Jedi Order who eventually lost his faith in the Order and became an Inquisitor sometime after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. He was introduced in the second-season finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels|Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he was tasked with hunting the former Sith Darth Maul, eventually tracking him down to Malachor. He dueled Maul, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, and Ahsoka Tano alongside his fellow Inquisitors, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, but they were both ultimately killed by Maul. Cornered, the Eighth Brother then attempted to escape, but his lightsaber had been damaged in battle and exploded in his hands when trying to use it to fly away, causing him to fall to his death.
*'''The Ninth Sister''' - Masana Tide was a former female [[Dowutin]] Jedi Knight who eventually succumbed to the dark side and became the Ninth Sister Inquisitor after intense torture at the hands of the Empire. She first appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Tenth Brother in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet [[Mon Cala]]. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Ninth Sister was betrayed by the Sixth Brother, who severed her right foot and left her behind to die so that he could escape, although she managed to survive the ordeal as well. She later appeared as an antagonist in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'', where she joined the Second Sister in the hunt for Cal Kestis. The Ninth Sister was ultimately defeated by the young Padawan on [[Kashyyyk]], who severed her right hand as well. However, she survived the ordeal once again.
*'''The Tenth Brother''' - Prosset Dibs was a former blind human Jedi Master during the Clone Wars who eventually became disillusioned by the Jedi's role as protectors of the galaxy. He first appeared in the novel ''Jedi of the Republic - Mace Windu'', where he tried to kill [[Mace Windu]] during a mission on the planet Hissrich. He was subsequently put on trial and expelled from the Jedi Order for his actions. Dibs later became the Tenth Brother Inquisitor in the service of the Empire and appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother and the Ninth Sister in hunting the Jedi Ferren Barr on the planet Mon Cala. After Barr used the Force to turn the Imperial stormtroopers present against them, the Tenth Brother was killed in the ensuing fight.
*'''Unnamed red-skinned Inquisitor''' - An unnamed red-skinned female Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where she assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another black-skinned [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master [[Eeth Koth]]. While Vader dueled and killed Koth, the female Inquisitor found his wife and baby daughter, but refused to kill them, instead taking the latter and bringing her to Vader, who then left her in the care of some nursemaids. Later, the Fifth Brother informed Vader of her actions and, believing it to be an act of treason, he tried to kill her in front of the other Inquisitors. She managed to escape with the help of her fellow Twi'lek Inquisitor, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.
*'''Unnamed Twi'lek Inquisitor''' - A black-skinned male [[Twi'lek]] Inquisitor appeared in the novel ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith]]'', where he assisted Darth Vader, the Fifth Brother and another red-skinned female Inquisitor in hunting Jedi Master Eeth Koth. Later, when Vader tried to kill the female Inquisitor for treason, he helped her escape, but they were both eventually caught following a long chase through Coruscant and chose to commit suicide rather than be killed by Vader.

==== New Republic-era dark side wielders ====
Although not official Sith, several dark side users were present in the years following the fall of the Galactic Empire and during the conflict between the [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] and the [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]].

===== Snoke =====
{{main|Supreme Leader Snoke}}

[[Supreme Leader Snoke|Snoke]] was an artificial being created by Darth Sidious and his [[Sith Eternal]] cult on [[Exegol]], and a major antagonist in the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy]]. After Palpatine's death and the fall of the Empire, Snoke became the Supreme Leader of the First Order and seduced [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]] to the dark side, training him to become his apprentice, Kylo Ren. He was also behind the destruction of [[Luke Skywalker]]'s Jedi Temple and the deaths of most of his students, in an attempt to wipe out the Jedi Order once and for all. He was ultimately killed by Ren, after failing to foresee his betrayal. Following Snoke's death, Ren took over as Supreme Leader of the First Order.

===== Kylo Ren =====
{{main|Kylo Ren}}

Kylo Ren ([[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]]) was a former Jedi and powerful dark side wielder, and one of the main antagonists of the ''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy. He was born as the son of [[Leia Organa]] and [[Han Solo]], and trained under his uncle, [[Luke Skywalker]], to become a Jedi, but was seduced to the dark side by Snoke. Adopting the alias Kylo Ren, he helped eliminate his uncle's new generation of Jedi and became the leader of the Knights of Ren and a high-ranking member of the First Order. He trained under Snoke to become a powerful dark side wielder, and later proved his loyalty by killing his father when he tried to help him get redeemed. However, Ren eventually betrayed and killed his master after siding with the Jedi Padwan [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], with whom he shared a unique connection called a "dyad in the Force". However, instead of turning back to the light side, he took over as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, and invited Rey to join him, but she refused. Later, Ren had a confrontation with Luke, only to discover that he was a Force projection, meant to distract him and allow the Resistance to escape; nontheless, Luke died as a result of the effort to create the projection, leaving Rey the only living Jedi. Eventually, Ren discovered that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious was still alive and plotted to kill this potential rival, but instead sided to him after he revealed the Final Order, a massive fleet of ''Xyston''-class Star Destroyers equipped with axial superlasers capable of decimating entire planets, which he promised to give Ren control of in exchange for killing Rey, revealed to be his grandaughter. Secretly, however, Ren planned to have Rey help him kill Sidious, and engaged her in a duel when she refused, which Ren lost after his mother gave her life to reach out to him through the Force. After a conversation with a memory of his late father, Ben Solo was redeemed and came to Rey's aid in defeating Sidious. After Rey died to kill the Sith Lord, Ben revived her using the Force, and shared a kiss with her, but then died as a result of using all his life energy to save her, becoming one with the Force.

===== Knights of Ren =====
The Knights of Ren were an organization of masked Force-wielding warriors, who served as antagonists in the ''Star Wars'' sequel trilogy. The Knights were neither Sith or Jedi, but a new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the supposed demise of the last Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. They had a code, to which they were flexible in the following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the dark side sent them. Their name came from a lightsaber called "Ren", which was at the base of their code and could only be wielded by their leader. The Knights consisted of seven individuals named '''Ren''' (their leader), '''Vicrul''', '''Ap'lek''', '''Cardo''', '''Kuruk''', '''Trudgen''', and '''Ushar'''. After his fall to the dark side, Ben Solo joined the Knights and eventually killed Ren, becoming their new leader, under the alias Kylo Ren, [[knighting]] his former fellow Padawan '''Voe''' as a knight through her shoulders, before reforging her lightsaber into one for himself. After Kylo became the Supreme Leader of the First Order, the Knights became his personal guards, though they ultimately sided with the resurrected Darth Sidious after Ben Solo returned to the light side, which led to their demise at the hands of the redeemed Ben.

Following the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], Lucasfilm rebranded most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels, comics, and other fictional media published since the [[Star Wars (film)|original 1977 film]] (previously identified as the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe) as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared them [[Star Wars canon|non-canonical to the franchise]] in April 2014.<ref name="SW Adult">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name="THR Legends">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name="SW Legends">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>

The Sith feature heavily in many stories of the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe (EU), appearing in a variety of media created prior to the advent of the 2015 feature film ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''.<ref>Ars Technica Op-ed: Disney takes a chainsaw to the Star Wars expanded universe, 1/10/2014</ref> Future authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the events depicted in this material, but the Expanded Universe has remained a source of creative inspiration. The EU thoroughly details the schism between the dissident “Dark Jedi” and the Jedi establishment that led to the creation of the Sith Order, as well a series of conflicts between the Sith, Jedi and the Galactic Republic spanning the millennia prior to the events of the ''Star Wars'' motion picture series, and certain events thereafter.

In the EU, the Sith trace their origins to the followers of a dissident Jedi named Ajunta Pall, who endorsed the use of the Dark Side of the Force, contrary to Jedi orthodoxy.<ref>Book of Sith: Secrets from the Dark Side</ref> After Pall and his “Dark Jedi” followers were exiled for their practices, they eventually settled on a planet named Korriban, which was occupied by the "Sith," a red-skinned humanoid race with a high prevalence of Force-sensitives. Over the course of centuries of intermingling between the ethnic Sith and Dark Jedi, the name "Sith" would come to apply to the martial philosophy and political affiliation created by the former Jedi exiles on Korriban, rather than a specific race. This Sith regime would strike out at the Galactic Republic and Jedi on numerous occasions. Notable conflicts between the Sith and the Galactic Republic include the "Great Hyperspace War," in which the Sith would launch a massive invasion of the Republic but succumb to infighting, and the “Sith Holocaust,” in which the Galactic Republic failed in its attempt to exterminate the Sith from known space, leading the Sith survivors to take a vow of eternal vengeance on the Galactic Republic. The EU also describes the exploits of Sith characters following the collapse of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire and the restoration of the Republic, such as the attempt by “Darth Krayt” to establish a New Sith Order on Korriban.

The first Expanded Universe novel was ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', written by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and published in 1978. The setting for the novel takes place between ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''.

===== Darth Caedus =====
[[Jacen Solo|Darth Caedus]] (Jacen Solo) was a Dark Lord of the Sith born as the oldest son of [[Han Solo]] and [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa Solo]]. A Jedi hero of the Yuuzhan Vong War, he eventually fell to the Dark Side years later and masterminded the Second Galactic Civil War. He was eventually killed by his twin sister Jaina for his actions.

===== Marka Ragnos =====
[[Marka Ragnos]] was an ancient Sith-human hybrid Sith Lord, who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, and seized the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, serving as the ruler of the Empire. After his death, two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought to occupy his throne, only for Ragnos' spirit to appear before them and claim that only the most worthy should succeed him. Ragnos lived on as a Force spirit following his death, trapped within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years after the Dark Lord's death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave through the use of talismans. Ragnos crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, with Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Several thousands of years after that, in the video game ''[[Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy]]'' (set during the New Republic era), a cult dedicated to Ragnos, led by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis, raised as a new threat to the galaxy, with the intent of resurrecting the Sith Lord using an old artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. After absorbing Force energy from numerous locations across the galaxy using the scepter, Tavion and her cult traveled to Korriban and almost succeeded in resurrecting Ragnos, but were stopped by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Inside Ragnos' tomb, the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr defeated Tavion, before Ragnos' spirit emerged and possessed her body, attempting to kill the Jedi. However, Jaden was able to defeat Ragnos, whose spirit left Tavion's body and returned to the depths of the Force, swearing revenge against the Jedi.

===== Darth Venamis =====
Darth Venamis was a Bith Dark Lord of the Sith who served as Darth Tenebrous' secret apprentice, as it was a violation of the Rule of Two. After Tenebrous was killed by his other apprentice, Darth Plagueis, he eventually found and defeated Venamis, before capturing him and using him as a test subject for his midi-chlorians experiments over the following years. After decades of torture and being killed and then brought back to life over and over again, Plaugeis finally allowed Venamis to die, having served his purpose. However, he later revived again in the presence of his new apprentice, Darth Sidious, until Venamis' organs finally ceased to function, and he died for the final time.

===== ''Knights of the Old Republic'' series =====

===== Darth Malak =====
[[Darth Malak]] (Alek) is the main antagonist of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. Once a Jedi Knight and Revan's best friend, the two of them fought together in the Mandalorian Wars. At some point, Alek was injured in battle and had his entire lower jaw cut off, forcing him to don a prosthetic jaw instead. Later, Alek and Revan unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions and were captured by the Sith Emperor, who, using Sith sorcery, turned them to the dark side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Alek, now Darth Malak, as his Sith Apprentice. When Revan prepared to battle the Jedi who boarded his flagship, Malak betrayed him, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge, so that he could take over the Sith Empire for himself. However, Revan survived the ordeal and was taken to the Jedi Council Enclave, where he had his memory wiped, so that he would become a Jedi once again. Eventually, Revan faced off against Malak, who revealed the truth of his identity, but was ultimately killed in battle by his former friend and Sith Master, which also led to the downfall of his Empire.

===== Darth Traya =====
[[Darth Traya]] (Kreia) is a mentor to the "Jedi Exile" and the hidden main antagonist of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords]]''.<ref name="Meet Your Team">{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/569/569765p1.html |title=KOTOR 2: Meet Your Team |author=Hilary Goldstein |date=30 November 2004 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref><ref name="gsinterview2">{{cite video |date=8 May 2004 |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Developer Interview 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/920194/6096604/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-developer-interview-2 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> She is revealed to have been a Sith Master at the end of the game, and is ultimately killed in battle.

===== Darth Sion =====
[[Darth Sion]], also known as the Lord of Pain, is an antagonist in ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords''. Alongside Darth Nihilus, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Sion managed to achieve immortality by calling on his pain, anger and hatred every time he was facing certain death, at the expense of all-consuming agony, which also led to his extremely disfigured appearance. The player's character eventually defeated Sion, and was then given the option to turn him back to the light side. Regardless, upon being shown the price he paid for immortality, Sion finally let go of his hate and allowed himself to die permanently.

===== Darth Nihilus =====
[[Darth Nihilus]], also known as the Lord of Hunger, is an antagonist in ''Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II – The Sith Lords''. Alongside Darth Sion, he served as one of Traya's apprentices, until ultimately betraying her and driving her into exile. Nihilus imbued his dark soul into his mask and robes and had the power to drain the life force out of any living thing. Following the betrayal of his master, Nihilus used the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets, but to contain them so that he could "feed" off the Force energy of each planet's lifeforms, wiping planets of life. However, Nihilus was later drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos, believing it to contain the last Jedi. The Exile confronted Nihilus on his ship, and Nihilus was killed either after his former slave Visas sacrificed herself due to their shared link in the Force, or after his attempt to feast on the Exile's connection to the Force backfired and weakened him. Despite his death, Nihilus' soul would continue to live in his mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside his own Sith holocron.

===== Lord Vitiate =====
Known for much of his 1300-year life as "the Sith Emperor", Lord Vitiate was a sociopathic young lord in one of the earliest iterations of the Sith Empire. When that empire fell, he led an exodus of survivors to the other side of the galaxy to establish a continuation of it, with himself as Emperor. It was Vitiate who corrupted Revan and Malak, but Revan's redemption and Malak's defeat seemingly derailed his plans. Three hundred years after Revan's disappearance, the Emperor launched a surprise attack on the Republic, setting the stage for the video game ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]''.

===== Darth Malgus =====
[[Darth Malgus]] (Veradun) is a major antagonist in ''Star Wars: The Old Republic''. A male human Dark Lord of the Sith who trained under Vindican, Malgus served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. Following the recapture of Korriban from the Jedi, Malgus killed his master and later led a surprise assault on Alderaan, only to be defeated by his nemesis and former opponent from Korriban, Satele Shan. Malgus was severely injured in the fight against Shan, forcing him to wear a respiratory apparatus for the rest of his life. Sometime later, Malgus was tasked by his superior, Darth Angral, with leading an assault team on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which Malgus and his forces destroyed, disgracing the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic. Although Malgus believed that the Battle of Coruscant was the first step of destroying the Republic, it only served as leverage in the peace negotiations that took place on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who wanted to avenge her master Ven Zallow, killed by Malgus during the attack on the Jedi Temple. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to kill his lover Eleena Daru, seeing their relationship as a weakness that prevented him from preserving his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire. Towards the end of the war, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and his service on the Dark Council, Malgus formed his own Empire, free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, the Republic and the Sith Empire forces soon teamed up to fight against Malgus' Empire and managed to track him down to his secret base, where they defeated him. Despite his apparent death, Malgus later resurfaced during the Invasion of Ossus at the start of the Third Galactic War, once again serving as a commander within the Sith Empire. However, following the Battle of Corellia, Malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all physical and mental restraints used to keep him under control. Thousands of years after his death, Malgus was still remembered as one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived. At one point, Darth Sidious acquired some surviving excerpts of Malgus's journals, which he bounded into his ''Book of Sith'', an anthology of Sith historical writings.
