'''The Consciousness Industry''' is a term coined by author and theorist [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], which identifies the mechanisms through which the human mind is reproduced as a social product. Foremost among these mechanisms are the institutions of [[mass media]] and [[education]]. According to Enzensberger, the mind industry does not produce anything specific; rather, its main business is to perpetuate the existing order of man's domination over man.

[[Hans Haacke]] elaborates on the consciousness industry as it applies to the arts in a wider system of production, distribution, and consumption.<ref>Haacke, p. 273</ref> Haacke specifically implicates museums as manufacturers of aesthetic perception that fail to acknowledge their intellectual, political, and [[moral authority]]: "rather than sponsoring intelligent, critical awareness, museums thus tend to foster appeasement."<ref>Haacke, p.280</ref>
