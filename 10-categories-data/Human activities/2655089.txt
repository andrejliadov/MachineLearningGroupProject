'''''SpongeBob SquarePants''''' is an American [[Animated series|animated]] [[Television comedy|comedy]] [[Television show|television series]] created by [[marine science]] educator and [[animator]] [[Stephen Hillenburg]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|the title character]] and his aquatic friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The [[List of longest-running United States television series|fifth-longest-running American animated series]], its popularity has made it a [[media franchise]]. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon and [[ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks]]' most distributed property.<!--It has never been produced by Nelvana, or Teletoon outside of the United States. Any removal of that will be considered vandalizing.--> The media franchise has generated more than $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-02-12|title=Nickelodeon Marks 20 Years of SpongeBob SquarePants with the "Best Year Ever"|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190211005682/en/Nickelodeon-Marks-20-Years-of-SpongeBob-SquarePants-with-the-%E2%80%9CBest-Year-Ever%E2%80%9D|access-date=2020-12-07|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en}}</ref>{{needs update|date=September 2020}}

Many of the series' ideas originated in ''The Intertidal Zone'', an unpublished educational book that Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/walker-v-viacom-international|title=Casetext|website=casetext.com |access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref> He began developing ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' into a television series in 1996 following the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. He turned to [[Tom Kenny]], who had worked with him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series called ''SpongeBoy Ahoy!''; both of these were changed as the name was already trademarked.

Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999, after it aired the [[1999 Kids' Choice Awards]]. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its premiere and had gained enormous popularity by its second season. A feature film, ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]'', was released in theaters on November 19, 2004. A second film adaptation, ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'', followed on February 6, 2015. A third film and prequel to the television series, ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'', was released in Canadian theaters on August 14, 2020 followed by a premiere on video-on-demand and [[CBS All Access]] in 2021. In 2018, the series began airing its [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 12)|twelfth season]]; it was renewed for a [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 13)|thirteenth]] season on July 17, 2019, which began airing in October 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/spongebob-squarepants-renewed-season-13-nickelodeon-anniversary-special-ratings-1202647458/|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'' Renewed for Season 13 by Nickelodeon on Heels of Strong Ratings for Anniversary Special|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|author=Nellie Andreeva|date=July 17, 2019|access-date=July 17, 2019}}</ref> As of July 30, 2020, all prior seasons of the show are available on CBS All Access.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/cbs-all-access-70-viacomcbs-shows-2021-rebranding-1234720611/|title=CBS All Access Adds 70 Shows From ViacomCBS's Networks Ahead of 2021 Rebranding|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Todd Spangler|date=July 29, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020}}</ref>

When the ''SpongeBob'' crew began production of the series' [[pilot episode]], they were tasked with designing stock locations, to be used repeatedly, where most scenes would take place like the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's pineapple house.<ref name=PittengerHA>{{cite news|author=Pittenger, Kenny|title = The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The idea was "to keep everything nautical", so the crew used plenty of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets to create the show's setting. Transitions between scenes are marked by bubbles filling the screen, accompanied by the sound of rushing water.<ref name=PittengerHA/>

The series features "sky flowers" as a main setting material.<ref name=PittengerHA/> When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds.

The series revolves around the title character and an [[ensemble cast]] of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic [[sponge|sea sponge]] who lives in a submerged [[pineapple]] with his pet [[sea snail|snail]] [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Gary the Snail|Gary]], who meows like a cat. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a [[fry cook]] at a [[fast food restaurant]] called the Krusty Krab. His greatest goal in life is to obtain a license to drive a boatmobile. His favorite pastimes include "jellyfishing", which involves catching [[jellyfish]] with a net in a manner similar to [[butterfly catching]], and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes.

Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dim-witted yet friendly pink [[starfish]] who resides under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick sees himself as intelligent.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Squidtastic Voyage|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=4|number=75a|network=[[Nickelodeon]]|airdate=October 6, 2006|credits=Writers: [[Luke Brookshier]], Tom King, Dani Michaeli}}</ref> Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab, is an arrogant, ill-tempered [[octopus]] who lives in an Easter Island [[moai]]. He enjoys playing the [[clarinet]] and painting self-portraits but hates his job as a [[cashier]]. He also dislikes living between SpongeBob and Patrick because of their childish nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly red [[crab]] named [[Mr. Krabs]] who talks like a sailor and runs his restaurant as if it were a [[pirate ship]]. He is a single parent with one teenage daughter, a [[sperm whale]] named [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]], to whom he wants to bequeath his riches. Pearl does not want to continue the family business and would rather spend her time listening to [[pop music]] or working at the local [[shopping mall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Spongebob_squarepants/pearl.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040812015604/http://www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Spongebob_squarepants/pearl.html|archive-date=August 12, 2004|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'' at NickSplat|work=[[Nickelodeon (Asia)|Nickelodeon Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]}}</ref> Another of SpongeBob's friends is Sandy Cheeks, a thrill-seeking and athletic [[squirrel]] from [[Texas]], who wears an air-filled [[diving suit]] to breathe underwater.<ref name="meet-the-gang">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/spongebob-squarepants-show|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'': Meet the Gang!|work=[[Nickelodeon (Australia and New Zealand)|Nickelodeon Australia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310224329/http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/spongebob-squarepants-show|archive-date=March 10, 2008}}</ref> She lives in an [[oak tree]] entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal and is an expert in [[karate]], as well as a [[scientist]].

==Production==
===Development===
====Early inspirations====
[[File:Ocean Institute, aerial shot, cropped.png|thumb|left|alt=Aerial photograph of the Ocean Institute at Dana Point, California | Before creating ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', Stephen Hillenburg taught marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] (located in [[Dana Point, California]]).<ref name="Ocean Institute" />]]
Series' creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] first became fascinated with the ocean as a child and began developing his artistic abilities at a young age. Although these interests would not overlap for some time—the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, receiving a major in [[marine biology]] and a minor in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the [[Ocean Institute]], an organization in [[Dana Point, California]], dedicated to educating the public about [[marine science]] and [[maritime history]].<ref name="Ocean Institute">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocean-institute.org/|title=Welcome to the Ocean Institute|work=ocean-institute.org|access-date=December 24, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Big Pop Fun">{{cite interview|people=[[Thomas F.

While Hillenburg was there, his love of the ocean began to influence his artistry. He created a precursor to ''SpongeBob SquarePants'': a comic book titled ''The Intertidal Zone'' used by the institute to teach visiting students about the [[Tide pool#Life in the tide pool|animal life of tide pools]].<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> The comic starred various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' characters.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=9}} Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies he sent it to were interested.<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/>

A large inspiration to Hillenburg was [[Ween]]'s 1997 album ''[[The Mollusk]]'', which had a nautical and underwater theme. Hillenburg contacted the band shortly after the album's release, explaining the baseline ideas for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', and also requested a song from the band, which they sent on Christmas Eve. This song was "Loop de Loop", which was used in the episode "Your Shoe's Untied".<ref>{{cite web|title=Did You Know: Ween's 'The Mollusk' Helped Inspire The Creation Of SpongeBob Squarepants|url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/news/ween-spongebob-squarepants-mollusk/|date=March 7, 2019|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ween - Tribute to Stephen Hillenburg|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj2d3ZpumBM|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A Deep Dive Into Ween, the Band that Birthed Bikini Bottom|url=http://kcpr.org/2019/03/07/a-deep-dive-into-ween-the-band-that-birthed-bikini-bottom/|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

====Conception====
While working as a staff artist at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg entertained plans to return eventually to college for a master's degree in art. Before this could materialize, he attended an animation festival, which inspired him to make a slight change in course. Instead of continuing his education with a traditional art program, Hillenburg chose to study experimental animation at the [[California Institute of the Arts]].<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /> His thesis film, ''Wormholes'', is about the [[theory of relativity]].<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''">{{cite AV media|last1=Hillenburg|first1=Stephen|last2=Murray|first2=Joe|last3=Drymon|first3=Derek|last4=Coleman|first4=Eric|last5=Hecht|first5=Albie |date=2003|title=The Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.

[[Martin Olson]], one of the writers for ''Rocko's Modern Life'', read ''The Intertidal Zone'' and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach.<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /><ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" />{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=10}} He began to develop some of the characters from ''The Intertidal Zone'', including the comic's "announcer", Bob the Sponge.<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /> He wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were exemplified by [[Buddy comedy|buddy comedies]] like ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]''. As a result, Hillenburg decided to focus on a single main character: the "weirdest" sea creature he could think of. This led him to the sponge.<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /> ''The Intertidal Zone{{'}}''s Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at first, Hillenburg continued to use this design.<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /><ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /><ref name="Makin' Toons" />{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}} In determining the new character's behavior, Hillenburg drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Pee-wee Herman]].<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /><ref name="Makin' Toons" />{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}}<ref name=DrymonHA>{{cite news|author=Drymon, Derek|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="KennyHA">{{cite news|author=Kenny, Tom|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge and realized this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly.<ref name="Big Pop Fun" /><ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''" /><ref name="Makin' Toons" /> Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the next characters Hillenburg created for the show.<ref name="BoytoBob">{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}</ref>

To voice the series' central character, Hillenburg turned to [[Tom Kenny]], whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed to develop the character further.<ref name="Radio">{{cite video|people=Farhat, Basima (Interviewer)|date=December 5, 2006|title=Tom Kenny: Voice of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' – Interview|url=http://www.thepeoplespeakradio.net/archives/mp3/tps-2006-12-05-kenny.mp3|format=mp3|medium=Radio production|publisher=The People Speak Radio|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724101824/http://www.thepeoplespeakradio.net/archives/mp3/tps-2006-12-05-kenny.mp3|archive-date=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Initially, Hillenburg wanted to use the name SpongeBoy—the character had no last name—and the series was to have been called ''SpongeBoy Ahoy!''{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}}<ref name="Radio" /> However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered—after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode—that the name "SpongeBoy" was already in use for a mop product.<ref name="Radio" /> A character of the same name was already trademarked by ''[[Flaming Carrot Comics]]'' creator [[Bob Burden]].<ref name=OralHistory /> In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt he still had to use the word "Sponge", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man". He settled on the name "SpongeBob". "SquarePants" was chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place."{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}} When he heard Kenny say it Hillenburg loved the phrase and felt it would reinforce the character's nerdiness.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=30}}{{sfn|Neuwirth|2003|page=51}}

====Assembling the crew====
[[Derek Drymon]], who served as creative director for the first three seasons, has said that Hillenburg wanted to surround himself with a "team of young and hungry people".<ref name="DrymonHA"/> Many of the major contributors to ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had worked before with Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'': this included: Drymon, [[art director]] [[Nick Jennings (artist)|Nick Jennings]], [[supervising director]] [[Alan Smart]], writer / voice actor [[Mr. Lawrence|Doug Lawrence]] (often credited as Mr. Lawrence), and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]], who helped develop the [[series bible]].<ref name="DrymonHA"/><ref name="KennyHA"/>

Although Drymon would go on to have a significant influence on ''SpongeBob SquarePants'', he was not offered a role on the series initially. As a late recruit to ''Rocko's Modern Life'', he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, [[Mark O'Hare]]—but he had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, ''[[Citizen Dog (comic)|Citizen Dog]]''.<ref name="DrymonHA"/> While he would later join ''SpongeBob'' as a writer,<ref name="O'HareHA">{{cite news|author=O'Hare, Mark|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> he lacked the time to get involved with both projects from the outset.<ref name="DrymonHA"/> Drymon has said, "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it&nbsp;... I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate&nbsp;... so I ran into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance."<ref name="DrymonHA"/> Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house several times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of ''Rocko's Modern Life''.<ref name="DrymonHA"/>

Jennings was also instrumental in ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s genesis.<ref name="ColemanHA">{{cite news|author=Coleman, Eric|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' | work = [[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Kenny has called him "one of SpongeBob's early graphics mentors".<ref name="KennyHA"/> On weekends, Kenny joined Hillenburg, Jennings, and Drymon for creative sessions where they recorded ideas on a tape recorder.<ref name="KennyHA"/> Kenny performed audio tests as SpongeBob during these sessions, while Hillenburg voice acted the other characters.{{sfn|Banks|2004|page=31}}<ref name="KennyHA"/>

====Pitching====

|quote=The execs from Nickelodeon flew out to [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], and we [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] it to them from the [[storyboard|storyboards]].

While pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an "underwater [[Vivarium|terrarium]] with models of the characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nickelodeon executive [[Eric Coleman (producer)|Eric Coleman]] as "pretty amazing".<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/> They were given money and two weeks to write the pilot episode "[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]".<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/> Drymon, Hillenburg, and Jennings returned with what was described by Nickelodeon official [[Albie Hecht]] as, "a performance [he] wished [he] had on tape".<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/> Although executive producer Derek Drymon described the pitch as stressful, he said it went "very well".<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/> [[Kevin Kay]] and Hecht had to step outside because they were "exhausted from laughing", which worried the cartoonists.<ref name="Origin of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''"/>

In an interview, [[Cyma Zarghami]], then-president of Nickelodeon, said, "their [Nickelodeon executives'] immediate reaction was to see it again, both because they liked it and it was unlike anything they'd ever seen before".<ref name="Huffington"/> Zarghami was one of four executives in the room when ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' was screened for the first time.<ref name="Huffington"/>

Before commissioning the full series, Nickelodeon executives insisted that it would not be popular unless SpongeBob was a child who went to school, with his teacher as a main character.<ref name="tbivision">{{cite web|last=White|first=Peter|title=SpongeBob SquarePants' creator Steve Hillenburg|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2009/10/spongebob-squarepants-creator-steve-hillenburg/7414/|work=TBI Vision|publisher=[[Informa|Informa Telecoms & Media]]|access-date=October 31, 2013|date=October 27, 2009}}</ref> Hillenburg recalled in 2012 that Nickelodeon told him, "Our winning formula is animation about kids in school... We want you to put SpongeBob in school."<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> Hillenburg was ready to "walk out" on Nickelodeon and abandon the series, since he wanted SpongeBob to be an adult character.<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/> He eventually compromised by adding a new character to the main cast, Mrs. Puff, who is a boat-driving teacher. Hillenburg was happy with the compromise and said, "A positive thing for me that came out of it was [how it brought] in a new character, Mrs. Puff, who I love."<ref name="Big Pop Fun"/>

Until his death in 2018, Hillenburg had served as the executive producer over the course of the series' entire history and functioned as its [[showrunner]] from its debut in 1999 until 2004.

According to writer and storyboard artist [[Luke Brookshier]], "''SpongeBob'' is written differently to many television shows".<ref name=Producing>{{cite web|title=Interview with Luke Brookshier, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' Storyboard Director|url=http://www.4mations.tv/2009/09/interview-with-luke-brookshier-spongebob-squarepants-storyboard-director/|publisher=[[4mations|4Mations]]|access-date=May 23, 2013|date=September 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323112314/http://www.4mations.tv/2009/09/interview-with-luke-brookshier-spongebob-squarepants-storyboard-director/|archive-date=March 23, 2012}}</ref> Unlike most of its contemporaries, ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' does not use [[Screenplay|written scripts]].<ref name="Producing"/><ref name=StevenB>{{cite web|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|title=Bikini Bottom Confessions|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/bikini-bottom-confessions/|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|access-date=May 28, 2013|date=July 24, 2009}}</ref> Instead, storylines are developed by a team of five outline and premise writers. A two-page outline is then assigned to a team of [[storyboard]] directors, who produce a complete rough draft of the storyboard.

Most of the dialogue and jokes are added during this stage.<ref name="OralHistory"/><ref name=Producing/> Brookshier has likened this process to how cartoons were made "in the [[Golden age of American animation|early days of animation]]."<ref name="Producing"/>

The decision to eschew scripts for storyboards is one that Hillenburg made early in the series' development.<ref name="OralHistory"/> ''Rocko's Modern Life'' had also used storyboarding derived from short outlines, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for ''SpongeBob SquarePants''—even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show a greater preference for script-driven cartoons.<ref name="DrymonHA"/><ref name=WieseHA>{{cite news|author=Wiese, Erik|title=The Oral History of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''|work=[[Hogan's Alley (magazine)|Hogan's Alley]] #17|year=2010|url=http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|publisher=Bull Moose Publishing Corporation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831044034/http://cartoonician.com/the-oral-history-of-spongebob-squarepants/|archive-date=August 31, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another series' writer, [[Merriwether Williams]], explained in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4:00&nbsp;pm.<ref name="WilliamsHA"/>

''SpongeBob SquarePants'' features the voices of: Tom Kenny, [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], Mr. Lawrence, [[Jill Talley]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], [[Mary Jo Catlett]], and [[Lori Alan]]. Most one-off and background characters are voiced by: [[Dee Bradley Baker]], [[Sirena Irwin]], [[Bob Joles]], [[Mark Fite]] and [[Thomas F. Wilson]].

Kenny voices ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' and a number of other characters, including SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life''.

===Animation===
Approximately 50 people work together to animate and produce an episode of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''.<ref name=Producing/> Throughout its run, the series' production has been handled domestically at [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] in [[Burbank, California]]. The finished animation has been created overseas at [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[South Korea]].<ref name=Childhood/><ref>{{cite web|last=Richmond|first=Ray|title=Special Report: Animation|url=http://www.roughdraftstudios.com/press/press_20040115.html|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 15, 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310222309/http://www.roughdraftstudios.com/press/press_20040115.html|archive-date=March 10, 2008}}</ref> The California crew storyboard each episode. These are then used as templates by the crew in Korea,<ref name=Childhood/> who animate each scene by hand, color each [[cel]] on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added.<ref name=Producing/>

During the first season, the series used [[cel animation]].<ref name="Tibbitt" /> A shift was made the following year to [[digital ink and paint]] animation.<ref name="Tibbitt"/> In 2009, executive producer Paul Tibbitt said: "The first season of ''SpongeBob'' was done the old-fashioned way on cells ''[sic]'', and every cell ''[[sic]]'' had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colors. It's still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital way of doing things means it doesn't take long to correct".<ref name="Tibbitt"/>

In 2008, the crew began using [[Cintiq|Wacom Cintiqs]] for the drawings instead of pencils. The [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 5)|fifth season]] episode "[[Pest of the West]]", one of the half-hour specials, was the first episode where the crew applied this method. Series' background designer Kenny Pittenger said, "The only real difference between the way we draw now and the way we drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season".<ref name="PittengerHA"/> The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on computer screens and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said, "Many neo-Luddites—er&nbsp;... I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun".<ref name="PittengerHA"/>

I try to push the envelope on this show without getting in the way of the story, and I try to push it up and way over the top when I can get away with it, all the time keeping it as funny and ridiculous as possible.

Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith composed the ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' theme song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/spongebob-squarepants-theme-mt0033331163|title=SpongeBob SquarePants Theme|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 30, 2014}}</ref> Its lyrics were written by Stephen Hillenburg and the series' original creative director Derek Drymon. The melody was inspired by the sea shanty "[[Blow the Man Down]]".<ref name="Makin' Toons" /> An old [[oil painting]] of a pirate is used in the opening sequence. Dubbed "Painty the Pirate", according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift shop "years ago".<ref name="Radio" /> [[Patrick Pinney]] voices Painty the Pirate, singing the theme song as the character.<ref name="Makin' Toons" /> Hillenburg's lips were imposed onto the painting and move along with the lyrics.<ref name="Radio" /> Kenny joked this is "about as close of a glimpse as most ''SpongeBob'' fans are ever going to get of Steve Hillenburg", because of his private nature.<ref name="Makin' Toons" />

Steve Belfer, one of Hillenburg's friends from CalArts, wrote and performed the music heard over the end credits.<ref name="DrymonHA" /> This theme includes [[ukulele]] music at Hillenburg's request.<ref name="DrymonHA" /> Drymon said, "It's so long ago, it's hard to be sure, but I remember Hillenburg having the Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot".<ref name="DrymonHA" />

The series' [[Music editor (filmmaking)|music editor]] and main composer is Nicolas Carr.<ref name=CarrHA /> After working with Hillenburg on ''Rocko's Modern Life'', he struggled to find a new job in his field. He had considered a career change before Hillenburg offered him the job. The first season's score primarily featured selections from the [[APM Music|Associated Production Music Library]], which Carr has said includes "lots of great old corny Hawaiian music and big, full, dramatic orchestral scores."<ref name=CarrHA /> ''Rocko's Modern Life'' also used music from this library. It was Hillenburg's decision to adopt this approach. Carr has described the selections for ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' as being "more over-the-top" than those for ''Rocko's Modern Life''.<ref name=CarrHA />

Hillenburg felt it was important for the series to develop its own music library, consisting of scores that could be reused and re-edited throughout the years. He wanted these scores to be composed by unknowns, and a group of twelve was assembled. They formed "The Sponge Divers Orchestra", which includes Carr and Belfer. The group went on to provide most of the music for later seasons, although Carr still draws from the Associated Production Music Library, as well as another library that he founded himself—Animation Music Inc.<ref name=CarrHA />

===Critical reception===
''SpongeBob SquarePants'' has received universal critical acclaim, being praised for its appeal to different age groups, and the show has earned numerous awards and accolades throughout its run. [[James Poniewozik]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] described the title character as "the anti-[[Bart Simpson]], temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to match—conscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him."<ref>{{cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Soaking Up Attention|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187600,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=December 9, 2011}}</ref> According to Laura Fries of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]], the series is "a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and resilient sea sponge&nbsp;... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today's animated TV shows, this is purely kid's stuff.&nbsp;... However, that's not to say that ''SpongeBob'' is simplistic or even juvenile. It's charming and whimsical, but clever enough to appeal to teens and college-aged kids, as well."<ref>{{cite news|last=Fries|first=Laura|title=Review: 'SpongeBob SquarePants'|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/reviews/spongebob-squarepants-1200458428/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=July 14, 1999}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} critic [[Joyce Millman]] said ''SpongeBob'' "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest. And it's also good, clean fun, which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge." Millman wrote, "His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren't so darned lovable and his world so excellently strange.&nbsp;... Like ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet."<ref>{{cite news|last=Millman|first=Joyce|title=Television/Radio; The Gentle World Of a Joyful Sponge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/08/arts/television-radio-the-gentle-world-of-a-joyful-sponge.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=July 8, 2001}}</ref>

[[Robert Thompson (media scholar)|Robert Thompson]], a professor of communications and director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at [[Syracuse University]], told ''The New York Times''<blockquote>There is something kind of unique about [''SpongeBob'']. It seems to be a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture—including kids' shows like the ''Rugrats''. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive—deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it.<ref>{{cite news|title=How to Succeed Without Attitude|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/20020722snapmonday.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 27, 2013|date=July 21, 2002|author=Zeller, Tom Jr.|author-link=Tom Zeller Jr.}}</ref></blockquote> In another interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', he commentated on the show's adult audience: "[On one hand] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [pajamas].
