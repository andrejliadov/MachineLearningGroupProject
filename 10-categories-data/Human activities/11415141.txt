Masturbation is frequent in both sexes and at any age. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular.

Masturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times, and is both mentioned and discussed in very early writings. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it as "heinous", "deplorable", and "hideous", but during the 20th century, these [[taboo]]s generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. Today, religions vary in their [[Religious views on masturbation|views]] of masturbation; some view it as a spiritually detrimental practice, some see it as not spiritually detrimental, and others take a [[Situational ethics|situational]] view. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hallikeri |first1=Vinay R. |last2=Gouda |first2=Hareesh S. |last3=Aramani |first3=Sunil C. |last4=Vijaykumar |first4=A.G. |last5=Ajaykumar |first5=T.S. |date=July–December 2010 |title=MASTURBATION—AN OVERVIEW |url=http://www.jfmtonline.org/current/masterbation_an_overview.php |journal=Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=46–49 |issn=0971-1929 |quote=Today, masturbatory act is considered as a healthy practice when done in private and an offence if done in the public in most of the countries. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821082841/http://www.jfmtonline.org/current/masterbation_an_overview.php |archive-date=21 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Animal masturbation]] has been observed in many species, both in the wild and in captivity.<ref name="Poiani2010">{{cite book|first=Aldo|last=Poiani|title=Animal Homosexuality: A Biosocial Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EftT_1bsPOAC&q=%28masturbation+OR+masturbate%29|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49038-2|pages=232–235, 394}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petplace.com/horses/breeding-soundness-examination-of-the-stallion/page2.aspx |title=Breeding Soundness Examination of the Stallion |publisher=Petplace.com |access-date=29 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905032903/http://www.petplace.com/horses/breeding-soundness-examination-of-the-stallion/page2.aspx |archive-date=5 September 2011 |date=2014-12-10 }}</ref><ref name="Bagemihl,1999">{{cite book |last=Bagemihl|first=Bruce |url=https://archive.org/details/biologicalexuber00bage|url-access=registration|quote=(masturbate OR masturbation).|title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity|publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-312-19239-6 |access-date=21 October 2015 }}</ref>

== Etymology ==

The English word ''masturbation'' was introduced in the 18th century, based on the Latin verb ''masturbari'', alongside the slightly earlier ''onanism''.
The [[Latin]] verb ''masturbari'' is of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Masturbation|uncertain origin]]. Suggested derivations include an unattested word for [[human penis|penis]], ''*mazdo'', cognate with [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''mézea'' ''μέζεα'', "genitals", or alternatively a corruption of an unattested ''*manusturpare'' ("to defile with the hand"), by association with ''turbare'' "to disturb".<ref>{{cite book |last=Dally |first=Peter |title=The Fantasy Factor |year=1975 |page=135 |publisher=George Weidenfeld and Nicolson Limited |isbn=978-0-297-76945-3}}</ref><ref>''OED'', s.v. ''[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114847 masturbation]{{subscription required}}''</ref>

== Terminology ==

While ''masturbation'' is the formal word for this practice, many other expressions are in common use.

== Techniques ==
===General===
[[File:Vibratoren bunt DSCF7424.jpg|thumb|right|Two vibrators in a [[sex shop]]]]

Masturbation involves touching, pressing, rubbing, or massaging a person's [[genital]] area, either with the fingers or against an object such as a [[pillow]]; inserting fingers or an object into the [[vagina]] or [[anus]] (see [[anal masturbation]]); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the [[nipple]]s or other [[erogenous zones]] while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply [[personal lubricant|lubricants]] to reduce friction.

Reading or viewing [[pornography]], [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]], or other erotic stimuli may lead to a desire for sexual release such as by masturbation.

Some people get [[sexual pleasure]] by inserting objects, such as [[Urethral sounding|urethral sounds]], into the [[urethra]] (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows),<ref name="Alice05">{{cite web | title=Go Ask Alice!: "Cock-stuffing" | website=goaskalice.columbia.edu | date=18 February 2005 | url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3516.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219153312/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3516.html | archive-date=19 February 2005 | url-status=dead | access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> a practice known as [[urethral play]] or "sounding".<ref name="BME06">{{cite web |last = Various authors |title = Urethral Sound |publisher = Body Modification Ezine |date = 21 April 2006 |url = http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Urethral_Sound |access-date = 29 July 2006}}</ref> Other objects such as ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury or infection.<ref name="JAAPA06">{{cite journal |last1=McPartlin |first1=Daniel |last2=Klausner |first2=Adam P. |last3=Berry |first3=Tristan T. |last4=Mulcahy |first4=Maurice |title=Case report: A foreign body in the urethra |journal=International Journal of Surgery Case Reports |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1052–4 |date=9 September 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.07.017 |pmid=24055017 |pmc=3825963}}</ref> Some people masturbate by using [[Fucking machine|machines]] that simulate intercourse.

Men and women may masturbate until they are close to orgasm, stop for a while to reduce excitement, and then resume masturbating. They may repeat this cycle multiple times.

=== Male ===<!-- "Autopederasty" redirects here -->

Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing.

The most common masturbation technique among males is to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft. This type of stimulation is typically all that is required to achieve [[orgasm]] and [[ejaculation]]. The speed of the hand motion varies throughout the masturbation session.

Male masturbation techniques may differ between males who have been [[circumcision|circumcised]] and those who have not. Some techniques which may work for one individual can be difficult or uncomfortable for another. For males who have not been circumcised, stimulation of the penis typically comes from the "pumping" of the [[foreskin]], whereby the foreskin is held and slid up and down over the [[glans penis|glans]], which, depending on foreskin length, is completely or partially covered and then uncovered in a rapid motion. The outer foreskin glides smoothly over the inner foreskin. The glans itself may widen and lengthen as the stimulation continues, becoming slightly darker in colour, while the [[Foreskin#Functions|gliding action]] of the foreskin reduces friction. This technique may also be used by some circumcised men who have sufficient excess skin remaining from their circumcision.

Satirical caricature, 1868]]

For circumcised males, on whom the glans is mostly or completely uncovered, this technique creates more direct contact between the hand and the glans. To avoid friction, irritation and soreness from this resulting friction, some may prefer to use a personal lubricant, [[masturbation cream]], or [[saliva]].

The shaft skin can also be slid back and forth with just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A variation on this is to place the fingers and thumb on the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a [[simulacrum]], or [[artificial vagina]].

[[Prostate massage]] is one other technique used for sexual stimulation, often in order to reach [[orgasm]]. The prostate is sometimes referred to as the "male [[G-spot]]" or P-spot.<ref name="Psychology Today 2014">{{cite web | first=Naveed | last=Saleh | title=Hitting the P-Spot | website=Psychology Today | date=16 October 2014 | url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-red-light-district/201410/hitting-the-p-spot | access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> Some men can achieve orgasm through stimulation of the prostate gland, by stimulating it using a well-lubricated finger or dildo inserted through the anus into the [[rectum]], and men who report the sensation of prostate stimulation often give descriptions similar to females' accounts of G-spot stimulation.<ref name="Rosenthal">{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|access-date = May 18, 2014| isbn = 978-0618755714|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT153}}</ref><ref name=Ladas>{{cite book |last=Ladas |first=AK |author2=Whipple, B |author3=Perry, JD |title=The G spot and other discoveries about human sexuality |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |location=New York |year=1982 |isbn=978-0440130406 |url=https://archive.org/details/gspototherrecent00lada }}</ref> Prostate stimulation can produce more intense orgasms than penile stimulation.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> Stimulating the prostate from outside, via pressure on the [[perineum]], can be pleasurable as well.

[[Anal masturbation]] without any prostate stimulation, with fingers or otherwise, is also one other technique which some men enjoy. Since the muscles of the anus contract during orgasm, the presence of an object holding the [[sphincter]] open can strengthen the sensation of the contractions and intensify orgasm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sinclair Intimacy Institute|url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |title=Discovery: Health |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613200634/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/analsex.html |archive-date=2002-06-13 }}</ref> The practice may be pleasurable because of the large number of [[nerve endings]] in the [[Human anus|anal area]], and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the [[sphincter ani externus muscle|anal sphincter muscles]] while inserting the finger. A good quality [[personal lubricant]] is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers.

There are many other variations on male masturbation techniques. Men may also rub or massage the glans, the rim of the glans, and the [[frenular delta]]. Some men place both hands directly on their penis during masturbation, while others may use their free hand to [[fondle]] their [[testicles]], [[nipples]], or other parts of their body. The nipples are erogenous zones, and vigorous stimulation of them during masturbation usually causes the penis to become erect more quickly than it would otherwise. Some may keep their hand stationary while pumping into it with pelvic thrusts in order to simulate the motions of [[sexual intercourse]]. Some may lay in the [[prone position]] and rub their genitals against the bed sheet or other surface, a technique called ''prone masturbation''.<ref name="Prone Masturbation">{{cite web|author=Kinsey Confidential|title=Prone masturbation a threat?|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/10/prone-masturbation-a-threat-probably-not|website=Indiana Daily Student|access-date=30 March 2017}}</ref> In a bath or shower, a male may direct water via a handheld [[shower]]head at his frenulum, testicles, or perineum. Others may also use vibrators and other sexual devices more commonly associated with female masturbation.

A somewhat controversial ejaculation control technique is to put pressure on the perineum, about halfway between the [[scrotum]] and the anus, just before ejaculating.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This can, however, redirect semen into the bladder (referred to as [[retrograde ejaculation]]).

=== Female ===

{{See also|Fingering (sexual act)}}

Female masturbation involves the stroking or rubbing of a woman's [[vulva]], especially her [[clitoris]], with an [[index finger|index]] or [[middle finger]]s, or both. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to stroke its frontal wall where the [[G-spot]] may be located.<ref name="Keesling99">{{cite magazine |last = Keesling |first = Barbara |title = Beyond Orgasmatron |magazine = Psychology Today |date = November 1999|url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199911/beyond-orgasmatron |access-date = 29 July 2006}}</ref> Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, [[dildo]], or [[Ben Wa balls]] can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when [[Sexual penetration|penetration]] is involved, but this is not universal and many women find their [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] sufficient.

Like males, common positions for female masturbation include lying on back or face down, sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[kneeling]], or standing. In a bath or shower, a female may direct water via a handheld showerhead at her clitoris, vulva, or perineum. Lying face down one may use the hands, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and "[[dry hump|hump]]" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, a chair, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing. Some masturbate only using pressure applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against [[underwear]] or other clothing. In the 1920s, [[Havelock Ellis]] reported that turn-of-the-century seamstresses using treadle-operated sewing machines could achieve orgasm by sitting near the edge of their chairs.<ref>Ellis, Havelock (1927), Studies in the Psychology of Sex (3rd edition), Volume I,; Auto-Eroticism: A Study of the Spontaneous Manifestations of the Sexual Impulse; section I; "The Sewing-machine and the Bicycle:" quotes one Pouillet as saying "it is a well-recognized fact that to work a sewing-machine with the body in a certain position produces sexual excitement leading to the orgasm. The occurrence of the orgasm is indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds with uncontrollable rapidity. This sound is said to be frequently heard in large French workrooms, and it is part of the duty of the superintendents of the rooms to make the girls sit properly." {{Gutenberg|no=13610|name=Studies in the Psychology of Sex, v. I, by Havelock Ellis}}</ref>

Women can stimulate themselves sexually by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, creating pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Thoughts, fantasies, and memories of previous instances of arousal and orgasm can produce sexual excitation. Some women can orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, although this may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.<ref name="Koedt70">{{cite web |last = Koedt |first = Anne |title = The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |publisher = Chicago Women's Liberation Union |year = 1970 |url = https://www.cwluherstory.org/classic-feminist-writings-articles/myth-of-the-vaginal-orgasm |access-date = 18 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=kins>{{cite web | title=The Kinsey Institute - Kinsey Study Data &#91;Research Program&#93; | website=kinseyinstitute.org | date=6 March 2011 | url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306155751/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-data.html | archive-date=6 March 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>

Sex therapists will sometimes recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, for example, to help improve sexual health and relationships, to help determine what is erotically pleasing to them, and because mutual masturbation can lead to more satisfying sexual relationships and added intimacy.<ref name="Shuman06"/><ref name="Knowles02"/>

Mutual masturbation involves two or more people who sexually stimulate each other, usually with the hands. It can be practiced by people of any [[sexual orientation]], and can be part of other sexual activity. It may be used as [[foreplay]], or as an alternative to sexual penetration. When used as an alternative to penile-vaginal penetration, the goal may be to preserve [[virgin]]ity or to avoid risk of pregnancy.<ref name="Carpenter">See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=6qNCeI2AcY4C&pg=PT11&lpg=PT11] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=pXXZn_qSoDoC&pg=PA48 pages 47–49] for views on what constitutes virginity loss and therefore sexual intercourse or other sexual activity; source discusses how gay and lesbian individuals define virginity loss, and how the majority of researchers and heterosexuals define virginity loss/"technical virginity" by whether or not a person has engaged in penile-vaginal sex. {{Cite book|author=Laura M.

Mutual masturbation can be practiced in pairs or groups with or without actually touching another person for example:

*Non-contact mutual masturbation - Two people masturbating in the presence of each other but not touching.
*Contact mutual masturbation - One person touching another person to masturbate. The other person may do the same during or after.
*Non-contact group - More than two people masturbating in the presence of each other in a group but not touching each other.
*Contact group - More than two people physically touching each other to masturbate as a group.
*Mutual masturbation foreplay - The manual stimulation of each other's genitals where the session eventually leads to sexual intercourse.<ref name="MUTUAL">{{cite web | title = Mutual Masturbation | date = 12 June 2006 | access-date = 7 August 2010 | url = http://advancedmasturbation.com/mutual | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160522234752/http://advancedmasturbation.com/mutual/ | archive-date = 22 May 2016 | df = dmy-all }} — A biographical collection of data for a sociological repository on the topic of mutual masturbating to study changes on the activity over time.</ref>

Popular belief asserts that individuals of either sex who are not in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship. Contrary to this belief, several studies actually reveal a positive correlation between the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of intercourse. A study has reported a significantly higher rate of masturbation in gay men and women who were in a relationship.<ref name=gerr /><ref name="Heilborn Cabral 2006 pp. 1471–1481">{{cite journal | last1=Heilborn | first1=Maria Luiza | last2=Cabral | first2=Cristiane S. | title=Sexual practices in youth: analysis of lifetime sexual trajectory and last sexual intercourse | journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública | volume=22 | issue=7 | year=2006 | issn=0102-311X | doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2006000700011 | pmid=16791346 | pages=1471–1481| doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Menon Williams Watson pp. 125–127">{{cite journal | last1=Menon | first1=Anuradha | last2= McAllister-Williams | first2=R.

Female masturbation alters conditions in the vagina, cervix and uterus, in ways that can alter the chances of conception from intercourse, depending on the timing of the masturbation. A woman's orgasm between one minute before and 45 minutes after insemination favors the chances of that sperm reaching her egg. If, for example, she has had intercourse with more than one male, such an orgasm can increase the likelihood of a pregnancy by one of them.<ref>{{cite book |last = Baker |first = Robin |title = Sperm Wars: The Science of Sex |publisher = Diane Books Publishing Company |date=June 1996 |isbn = 978-0-7881-6004-2}}</ref><ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females>{{cite journal |last = Baker |first = Robin R. |author2=Bellis, Mark A. |date=November 1993 |title = Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm |journal = Animal Behaviour |volume = 46 |issue = 5 |pages = 87, 23p |doi = 10.1006/anbe.1993.1272|s2cid = 53165064 |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/45220397afd001a52998dbcc71605fd98b32a2e9 }}</ref> Female masturbation can also provide protection against cervical infections by increasing the acidity of the cervical mucus and by moving debris out of the cervix.<ref name=Ejaculate_manipulation_by_females />

In males, masturbation flushes out old sperm with low [[motility]] from the male's genital tract. The next ejaculation then contains more fresh sperm, which have higher chances of achieving conception during intercourse.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. "Self-abuse," as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as "bad" or "wrong." In an age when people are urged to practice "[[safer sex]]," masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name="Sigel2004">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1065–1066|issn=0022-4529|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

As such, the promotion and de-stigmatization of the practice continue to be important strategies within sexology for the achievement of healthy sexual development and well-being.<br /><br />The collection concludes with two surveys among US college students. The first of these was based on limited quantitative questions relating to masturbation. The findings suggest that masturbation is not a substitute for sexual intercourse, as has often been posited, but is associated with increased sexual interest and greater number of partners. The second of these surveys asks whether masturbation could be useful in treating low sexual desire, by examining the relationship between masturbation, libido and sexual fantasy.}}</ref> According to the [[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy|''Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy'']], "It is considered abnormal only when it inhibits partner-oriented behavior, is done in public, or is sufficiently compulsive to cause distress."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric-disorders/sexuality,-gender-dysphoria,-and-paraphilias/overview-of-sexual-behavior|title=Overview of Sexuality|author=George R.

Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals in much the same way as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection. The child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or understimulated and bored.

====18th century====
''Onanism'' is a hybrid term which combines the proper noun, ''[[Onan]]'', with the suffix, ''-ism''.<ref>"Onanism." ''The Online Etymology Dictionary''. Retrieved 16 July. 2017. <http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Onanism></ref> Notions of self-pollution, impurity and uncleanness were increasingly associated with various other sexual vices and crimes of the body (such as fornication, sodomy, adultery, incest and obscene language); in reaction to the 17th-century libertine culture, middle-class moralists increasingly campaigned for a reformation of manners and a stricter regulation of the body. Paradoxically, a crime that was secret and private became a popular and fashionable topic. Moreover, writers tended to focus more on the perceived links with mental and physical illnesses that were deemed to be associated with the sense of moral outrage. Attention increasingly shifted to the prevention and cure of this illness which perilously sapped men of their virility.<ref>See ''Traité contre l’impureté'' (1707) and ''The Nature of Uncleanness'' (1708); Ian McCormick ed. ''Sexual Outcasts: Onanism''. Vol. 4. (London and New York: Routledge, 2000). pp. 1-10.</ref>

The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716, titled "[[Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution]], And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." The Online Etymology Dictionary, however, claims the earliest known use of ''onanism'' occurred in 1727. In 1743–45, the British physician [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]] published ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences".<ref>Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. ''Masturbation: the history of a great terror''. New York: Palgrave, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56 pp. 56–57]. {{ISBN|0-312-22443-5}}.</ref> One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in ''Onania'' was the notable Swiss physician [[Samuel-Auguste Tissot]]. In 1760, he published ''L'Onanisme'', his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered [[hypothesis|conjectural]] at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent.

Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797), he made the ''[[a posteriori]]'' argument that "such an unnatural use of one's sexual attribute" strikes "everyone upon his thinking of it" as "a violation of one's duty to himself", and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that "it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use", but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that "a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Emmanuel|title=The Metaphysics of Morals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56673-5|page=179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcrTG6tJsAC&pg=PA179|editor-first=Mary J.|editor-last=Gregor|access-date=28 December 2013|date=18 April 1996}}</ref>

====19th century====
By 1838, [[Jean Esquirol]] had declared in his ''Des Maladies Mentales'' that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity."<ref>E.H. Hare (1962) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/108/452/1.full.pdf Masturbatory Insanity: The History of an Idea], [[Journal of Mental Science]] 108:4 (issue #452)</ref><ref>[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], pages 65,6</ref> [[John Harvey Kellogg]] and [[Sylvester Graham]] were among those who proposed that [[circumcision]] and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation.<ref>{{cite book|author-link1=John Harvey Kellogg |last1=Kellogg |first1=John Harvey |title=Plain Facts for Old And Young|page=325|year=1910|hdl=2027/ucw.ark:/13960/t53f53t5w |publisher=Battle Creek, Mich. }}</ref> The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, [[infibulation]], restraining devices like [[chastity belt]]s and [[straitjacket]]s, [[cauterization]] or – as a last resort – wholesale [[Castration|surgical excision]] of the genitals.

Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change towards the end of the 19th century when [[H. Havelock Ellis]], in his seminal 1897 work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', questioned Tissot's premises.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Jean |last1=Stengers |first2=Anne |last2=van Neck|title=Masturbation: the history of a great terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&pg=PA133|isbn=978-0-312-22443-1 | year=2001 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref>

====20th century====
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] addressed masturbation in his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' and associated it with addictive substances. He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty. At the same time, the supposed medical condition of [[female hysteria|hysteria]]&mdash;from the Greek ''hystera'' or uterus&mdash;was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women. In 1910, the meetings of the [[Vienna psychoanalytic circle]] discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation,<ref name="Bennett 1999 pp. 269–294">{{cite journal | last=Bennett | first=David | title=Burghers, Burglars, and Masturbators: The Sovereign Spender in the Age of Consumerism | journal=New Literary History | volume=30 | issue=2 | year=1999 | issn=1080-661X | doi=10.1353/nlh.1999.0018 | pages=269–294| s2cid=144501464 }}</ref> but its publication on the matter was suppressed. "[[Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation]]" is a 1922 [[essay]] by another [[Austrians|Austrian]], the [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Wilhelm Reich]]. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of [[unconscious fantasy]] and the subsequent emerging [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.

By 1930, [[F. W. W. Griffin]], editor of ''The Scouter,'' had written in a book for [[Rover Scouts]] stating that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing [[H. Havelock Ellis|Ellis]]' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error." The work of sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the [[Kinsey Reports]], insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females. In the US, masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] II (1968).<ref name="Ley2014">{{cite book|first=David J.|last=Ley|title=The Myth of Sex Addiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBQ8G56X7YC&pg=PA12|date=10 July 2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-1305-0|page=12}}</ref>

In the 1980s, [[Michel Foucault]] was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children". However, in 1994, when the [[Surgeon General of the United States|surgeon general of the United States]], [[Joycelyn Elders]], mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school [[curriculum|curricula]] that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign,<ref name="Elders">{{cite web|first1=Jeff|last1=Jelq|url=http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/elders.html |title=JackinLibrary: Joycelyn Elders |publisher=Jackinworld.com |access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref> with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of ''how'' to masturbate.

====21st century====
Both practices and cultural views of masturbation have continued to evolve in the 21st century, partly because the contemporary [[lifeworld]] is increasingly technical.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} For example, digital photographs or live video may be used to share masturbatory experiences either in a broadcast format (possibly in exchange of money, as with performances by "[[camgirl]]s" and "[[camboy]]s"), or between members of a [[long-distance relationship]]. [[Teledildonics]] is a growing field. Masturbation has been depicted as a not-uncomplicated part of "Love in the 21st Century" in the BBC drama by the same name.<ref name="channel4.com 2009">{{cite web | title=Love in the 21st Century - Episode Guide - Channel 4 | website=channel4.com | date=2009-06-16 | url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616081408/https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/ | archive-date=2009-06-16 | url-status=dead | access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref>

== In modern culture ==
=== Stigma ===
Even though many [[medical]] professionals and [[scientist]]s have found large amounts of evidence that masturbating is healthy<ref name="Merck" /><ref name="Szasz" /><ref name="Shpancer2010" /><ref name="Coon2014" /><ref name="Sigel2004" /><ref name="Wood2005" /><ref name="Strassberg2015" /><ref name="Ley2014" /> and commonly practiced by males and females, stigma on the topic still persists today. In November 2013, Matthew Burdette, after being filmed masturbating, committed [[suicide]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Scowen|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/we-need-to-talk-about-masturbation-the-last-great-sexual-taboo/article19678627/|title=We need to talk about masturbation, the last great sexual taboo|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/americas/boy-scout-14-took-own-life-after-being-mercilessly-bullied-over-viral-sex-act-video-30436799.html|title=Matthew Burdette: Boy Scout, 14, took his own life after being 'bullied' over 'viral video'|work=Irish Independent|access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Scowen|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/relationships/bullying-shame-suicide-why-is-masturbation-still-stigmatized/article19730945/|title=Bullying, shame, suicide – why is masturbation still stigmatized?|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref>

In an article published by the nonprofit organization [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]], it was reported that:<ref name="Knowles02"/>
{{quote|Proving that these ancient stigmas against masturbation are still alive and felt by women and men, researchers in 1994 found that half of the adult women and men who masturbate feel guilty about it (Laumann, et al., 1994. p.85). Another study in 2000 found that adolescent young men are still frequently afraid to admit that they masturbate (Halpern, et al., 2000, 327).}}

=== Sperm donation ===
Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as [[artificial insemination]] and [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]] which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |title=Donor insemination – how does it work? |publisher=Hfea.gov.uk |date=14 April 2009 |access-date=27 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008094517/http://www.hfea.gov.uk/fertility-treatment-options-donor-insemination.html |archive-date=8 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sperm-donation/basics/definition/prc-20009520 |title=Sperm donation Definition – Tests and Procedures |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=20 July 2012 |access-date=27 August 2014}}</ref>

At a [[sperm bank]] or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as artificial insemination. Most semen used for [[sperm donation]], and all semen donated through a sperm bank by sperm donors, is produced in this way. The facility at a sperm bank used for this purpose is known as a masturbatorium (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available.<ref>{{cite web|author=OHasan |url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/siw198q/websites/reprotech/New%20Ways%20of%20Making%20Babies/spermint.htm |title=What Does Sperm Donation Involve? |publisher=Web.stanford.edu |access-date=27 August 2014}}</ref>

=== Encouragement ===
In the UK in 2009, a leaflet was issued by the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in [[Sheffield]] carrying the slogan, "an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away". It also says: "Health promotion experts advocate five portions of fruit and veg a day and 30 minutes' physical activity three times a week. What about sex or masturbation twice a week?" This leaflet has been circulated to parents, teachers and youth workers and is meant to update sex education by telling older school students about the benefits of enjoyable sex. Its authors have said that for too long, experts have concentrated on the need for "safe sex" and committed relationships while ignoring the principal reason that many people have sex. The leaflet is entitled ''Pleasure''. Instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience, said one of its authors.<ref name="Nikkhah 2009">{{cite news | last=Nikkhah | first=Roya | title=NHS tells school children of their 'right' to 'an orgasm a day' | website=Telegraph.co.uk | date=12 July 2009 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/5806691/NHS-tells-school-children-of-their-right-to-an-orgasm-a-day.html | access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="The Sunday Times Grimston 2009">{{cite news | journal=The Sunday Times | last=Grimston | first=Jack | title=Pupils told: Sex every day keeps the GP away - Times Online | date=12 July 2009 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article6689953.ece | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716180443/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article6689953.ece | archive-date=16 July 2009 | url-status=unfit | access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref>

The Spanish region of [[Extremadura]] launched a programme in 2009 to encourage "sexual self-exploration and the discovery of self-pleasure" in people aged from 14 to 17. The €14,000 campaign includes leaflets, flyers, a "fanzine", and workshops for the young in which they receive instruction on masturbation techniques along with advice on contraception and self-respect. The initiative, whose slogan is, "Pleasure is in your own hands" has angered local right-wing politicians and challenged traditional Roman Catholic views. Officials from the neighbouring region of [[Andalucia]] have expressed an interest in copying the programme.<ref>{{cite news

The text book ''Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life'' states, "Terminally ill people are likely no different from the general population regarding their masturbation habits. Palliative care practitioners should routinely ask their patients if anything interferes in their ability to masturbate and then work with the patient to correct the problem if it is identified."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matzo|first1=Marianne |title=Palliative care nursing: quality care to the end of life|year=2006|publisher=Springer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8261-5791-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTexGiX5bqoC&pg=PA70|first2=Deborah|last2=Witt Sherman|access-date=26 May 2010|page=70}}</ref>

=== Law ===
The prosecution of masturbation has varied at different times, from complete illegality to virtually unlimited acceptance. In a 17th-century law code for the [[Puritan]] colony of [[New Haven Colony|New Haven, Connecticut]], "[[blasphemy|blasphemers]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and masturbators" were eligible for the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref>{{cite book

Often, masturbation in the sight of others is prosecuted under a general law such as [[public indecency]], though some laws make specific mention of masturbation. In the UK, masturbating in public is illegal under Section 28 of the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]]. The penalty may be up to 14 days in prison, depending on a range of circumstantial factors.<ref name="Guardian-2013-09-19">{{Cite newspaper|title=Masturbation laws around the world: the penal code|journal=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/blog/2013/sep/19/masturbation-laws-world-penal-code|access-date=19 September 2013|date=2013-09-19}}</ref> In the US, laws vary from state to state.

In many jurisdictions, masturbation by one person of another is considered [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] which may be illegal in some cases, such as when the other person is a minor.

There is debate whether masturbation should be promoted in correctional institutions. Restrictions on pornography, used to accompany masturbation, are common in [[Incarceration in the United States|American correctional facilities]]. [[Connecticut Department of Correction]]s officials say that these restrictions are intended to avoid a [[hostile work environment]] for [[correctional officer]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Connecticut Prisoners Express Anger Over Porn Ban|author=Eaton-Robb, Pat|date=8 October 2011|url=https://www.theday.com/article/20111008/NWS12/111009702|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Other researchers argue allowing masturbation could help prisoners restrict their sexual urges to their imaginations rather than engaging in [[prison rape]] or other non-masturbatory sexual activity that could pose sexually transmitted disease or other health risks.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Free Willy|author=Johns, David Merritt|date=10 January 2012|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/01/should_prison_inmates_have_the_right_to_masturbate_.single.html|magazine=Slate}}</ref>

=== Rites of passage ===
The [[Sambia people|Sambia]] tribe of [[New Guinea]] has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which lasts several years and involves ejaculation through [[fellatio]] often several times a day. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Moffatt|url=http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |title=The Sambia |publisher=Faculty.mdc.edu |date=4 October 1999 |access-date=26 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050114/http://faculty.mdc.edu/jmcnair/Joepages/The%20Sambia.htm |archive-date=7 September 2011}}</ref>{{better source|date=June 2013}}

Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age.<ref>{{cite book |author=Hewlett, B.S. |chapter=Diverse contexts of human infancy |editor=Ember, C. |editor2=Ember, M. |title=Cross-Cultural Research for Social Science |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs NJ |year=1996 }}</ref> Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a "wise elder" or "witch doctor" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size.

=== Music ===
In popular music, there are various songs that deal with masturbation. Some of the earliest examples are "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]" by [[Chuck Berry]] and "Mary Ann with the Shaky Hand" and "[[Pictures of Lily]]" by [[The Who]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Pete|last=Townshend |author-link=Pete Townshend |title=Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy |version=Printed article |publisher=Rolling Stone or one of the similar magazines (Melody Maker, NME, etc.) |year=1971 |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~dmcguire/meatybeaty.html |access-date=9 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123083202/http://home.roadrunner.com/~dmcguire/meatybeaty.html |archive-date=23 January 2009 |df=dmy }} "Merely a ditty about masturbation and the importance of it to a young man.

=== Literature ===

The 1858 schoolboys' novel ''[[Eric, or, Little by Little]]'' was a tract against masturbation, but did not mention the subject except extremely obliquely as "[[Kibroth-Hattaavah]]" a place mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] where those that lusted after meat were buried.

In October 1972, an important censorship case was held in Australia, leading to the banning of [[Philip Roth|Philip Roth's]] novel ''[[Portnoy's Complaint]]'' in that country due to its masturbation references. The censorship led to public outcry at the time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Don Chipp: larrikin, censor, and party founder |date=August 2006 |magazine=Crikey |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2006/08/29/don-chipp-larrikin-censor-and-party-founder/}}</ref>

Further portrayals and references to masturbation have occurred throughout literature, and the practice itself has even contributed to the production of literature among certain writers, such as [[Thomas Wolfe|Wolfe]], [[Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]] and [[John Cheever]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2013/daily_rituals/balzac_and_sex_how_the_french_novelist_used_masturbation_to_fuel_his_writing.html |title = Daily Rituals |last = Currey |first = Mason |date = 30 April 2013 |journal = Slate |access-date= 10 May 2013 }}</ref>
Perhaps the most famous fictional depiction of masturbation occurs in the "Nausicaa" episode of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by James Joyce. Here the novel's protagonist Bloom brings himself to covert climax during a public fireworks display after being aroused by a young woman's coy exhibitionism.

=== Television ===

In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Contest]]",<ref>{{cite news |title='Seinfeld,' Four: It's Real and It's Spectacular |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/16/AR2005051600756.html |work=The Washington Post |date=17 May 2005 |first=Jen |last=Chaney}}</ref> the show's main characters enter into a contest to see who can go the longest without masturbating. Because ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s network, [[NBC]], did not think masturbation was a suitable topic for prime-time television, the word is never used. Instead, the subject is described using a series of euphemisms. "Master of my domain" became a part of the American lexicon from this episode.

Another NBC show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', had a character known as the Masturbating Bear, a costume of a bear with a diaper covering its genitals. The Masturbating Bear would touch his diaper to simulate masturbation. Prior to leaving ''Late Night'' to become host of ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'', [[Conan O'Brien]] originally retired the character due to concerns about its appropriateness in an earlier time slot.<ref name="warmingglow">{{cite web |url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2009/05/the-masturbating-bear-is-coming-back/ |title=The masturbating bear is coming back!!! |publisher=warmingglow.uproxx.com |access-date=8 November 2013 |date=2009-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201173918/http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2009/05/the-masturbating-bear-is-coming-back/ |archive-date=1 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Masturbating Bear however made his ''Tonight Show'' debut during the final days of Conan O'Brien's tenure as host of the ''Tonight Show''. It was clear by then that Conan O'Brien was being removed from the show and he spent his last shows pushing the envelope with skits that typically would not be appropriate for the ''Tonight Show'', one of which was the Masturbating Bear.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stableford |first=Dylan |url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/conan-finally-unleashes-masturbating-bear-video-13333 |title='Conan Finally Unleashes 'Masturbating Bear'' |publisher=Thewrap.com |date=21 January 2010 |access-date=29 May 2011}}</ref> After much debate on whether or not he would be able to be used on Conan O'Brien's new [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] show, ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', the Masturbating Bear made an appearance on the first episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/video/masturbating-bear-gets-new-job |title=Conan: Masturbating Bear Gets a New Job |publisher=Tbs.com |access-date=29 May 2011}}</ref>

In March 2007 the UK broadcaster [[Channel 4]] was to air a season of [[television]] programmes about masturbation, called [[Wank Week]]. (''Wank'' is a [[British English|Briticism]] for ''masturbate''.) The series came under public attack from senior television figures, and was pulled amid claims of declining editorial standards and controversy over the channel's [[public broadcasting|public service broadcasting]] credentials. However, its constituent films may yet be shown by the channel at a later date.<ref>{{cite news|date=2 February 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/02/broadcasting.channel4|access-date=2 November 2007| title='Wank week' postponed|first=Jason|last=Deans|work= [[Media Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=August 2017}}

In [[Monty Python]]’s ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), the song “[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]” is a [[satire]] of [[Humanae Vitae|Catholic teachings on reproduction]] that forbid masturbation (and contraception) by artificial means. In ''Talking Cock'' by comedian [[Richard Herring]], the sketch is used to ridicule those who condemn masturbation (and [[sexual intercourse|sex]]) for any purpose other than [[procreation]].<ref>{{cite book  | last = Herring  | first = Richard  | title = Talking Cock: A Celebration of Man and His Manhood  | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press | date = 2004  | page = 109  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pImpYNhh4J0C| isbn = 978-1-56025-608-3}}</ref>

=== Pornography ===

Depictions of male and female masturbation are common in pornography, including [[gay pornography]].
