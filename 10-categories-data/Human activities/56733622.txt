==Approach==
Coping planning aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help with distress, including suicidal ideation.<ref name="stallman 2017"/> By addressing ''why'' someone asks for help, the focus stays on what the person needs rather than on what the helper wants to do. It provides an alternative to the widely used, but non-evidence-based risk-assessment approach to [[suicide prevention]].<ref>Franklin, J. C., Ribeiro, J. D., Fox, K. R., Bentley, K. H., Kleiman, E. M., Huang, X., et al. (2017). Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors: A meta-analysis of 50 years of research. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 143(2), 187–232 {{doi|10.1037/bul0000084}}</ref> [[Needs assessment]] and support focuses on the individual needs of each person. They are rated as low (coping independently), moderate (may need additional low-intensity professional support), or high (needs immediate high-intensity professional support).<ref name="stallman 2017" />

==Applications==
In addition to suicide prevention training for health professionals, coping planning has been used to train journalists, and to help a range of people cope better, including carers, university students, and with children to improve [[emotional regulation]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===In suicide prevention===
Coping planning is designed to contribute to [[suicide prevention]] in a number of ways. Firstly, it provides a framework to support people whenever they [[Help-seeking|seek help]], rather than waiting until they are considered high-risk for death by suicide.<ref>Stallman, H. M. (2017). Meeting the needs of patients who have suicidal thoughts presenting to Emergency Departments. ''Emergency Medicine Australasia'', 29(6), 749. {{doi|10.1111/1742-6723.12867}}</ref> Secondly, it aims to focus on helping people to cope, rather than to stay safe from suicide, which, according to [[ironic process theory]],<ref>Wegner, Daniel M. (1989). ''White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control''. Viking. {{ISBN|978-0670825226}}.</ref> makes it more likely that people will think about suicide. Healthy coping strategies improve overall wellbeing<ref>Stallman, H. M., Ohan, J. L., & Chiera, B. (2018). The role of social support, being present, and self-kindness in university student wellbeing. ''British Journal of Guidance and Counselling'', 46(4), 365–374. {{doi|10.1080/03069885.2017.1343458}}</ref> and reduce distress.<ref>Stallman, H. M., Ohan, J. L., & Chiera, B. (2018). The role of social support, being present, and self-kindness in university student psychological distress. ''Australian Psychologist'', 53(1), 52–59. {{doi|10.1111/ap.12271}}</ref> The approach is designed for use in both low (e.g., [[psychological first aid]]ers or [[Telephone counseling|telephone helplines]]) and high intensity services (e.g., [[emergency department]]s or [[inpatient care]] units).
