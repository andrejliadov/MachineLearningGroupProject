'''Health politics''' or '''politics of health''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of study concerned with the analysis of [[Power (social and political)|political power]] over the [[health]] status of individuals.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Bambra|first=Clare|last2=Fox|first2=Debbie|last3=Scott-Samuel|first3=Alex|date=2005-06-01|title=Towards a politics of health|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/20/2/187/827479|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=187–193|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah608|issn=0957-4824}}</ref>   

It critiques [[public health]] for professionalizing health and [[Health system|healthcare systems]] to an extent that it removes it from public engagement, depoliticizing it in the process. This then transfers power away from the public body and into the medical profession and industry such that they can 'determine what health is and therefore, how political it is (or, more usually, is not)'.<ref name=":0" /> Combining [[political science]] to the study of public health, health politics aims to understand the unique interplay of politics within this policy domain to locate the politics of health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Daniel|date=2012-06-15|title=Is Health Politics Different?|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-polisci-050409-113009|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=287–311|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-050409-113009|issn=1094-2939}}</ref>  

"Among professionals in public health, the [[political system]] is commonly viewed as a subway's third rail: avoid touching it, lest you get burned. Yet it is this third rail that provides power to the train, and achieving public health goals depends on a sustained, constructive engagement between public health and political systems".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Edward L.|date=2016|title=Politics and Public Health—Engaging the Third Rail|url=https://journals.lww.com/jphmp/Fulltext/2016/09000/Politics_and_Public_Health_Engaging_the_Third_Rail.2.aspx|journal=Journal of Public Health Management and Practice|volume=22|pages=436-441}}</ref> Here, [[public health]]'s problems and issues are explicitly political as the world's health bodies and organizations are supported by national governments - making their solutions equally as political as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gore|first=Radhika|last2=Parker|first2=Richard|date=2019|title=Analysing power and politics in health policies and systems|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30773135/|journal=Global Public Health|volume=14|issue=4|pages=481–488|doi=10.1080/17441692.2019.1575446|issn=1744-1706|pmid=30773135}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bambra|first=Clare|last2=Smith|first2=Katherine E.|last3=Pearce|first3=Jamie|date=2019|title=Scaling up: The politics of health and place|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31054402/|journal=Social Science & Medicine (1982)|volume=232|pages=36–42|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.04.036|issn=1873-5347|pmid=31054402}}</ref> "If public health is the field that diagnoses and strives to cure social ills, then understanding [[Politics|political]] causes and cures for health problems should be an intrinsic part of the field".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greer|first=Scott L.|last2=Bekker|first2=Marleen|last3=de Leeuw|first3=Evelyne|last4=Wismar|first4=Matthias|last5=Helderman|first5=Jan-Kees|last6=Ribeiro|first6=Sofia|last7=Stuckler|first7=David|date=2017-10-01|title=Policy, politics and public health|url=http://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/27/suppl_4/40/4430509/Policy-politics-and-public-health|journal=European Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=27|issue=suppl_4|pages=40–43|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckx152|issn=1101-1262}}</ref>

Health politics is a joint discipline between [[public health]] and [[Political science|politics]] although, like many other interdisciplinary fields such as [[sociology]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[public policy]], often incorporates approaches and [[Methodology|methodologies]] of other related fields of study such as [[intersectionality]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gkiouleka|first=Anna|last2=Huijts|first2=Tim|last3=Beckfield|first3=Jason|last4=Bambra|first4=Clare|date=2018|title=Understanding the micro and macro politics of health: Inequalities, intersectionality & institutions - A research agenda|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29421476/|journal=Social Science & Medicine (1982)|volume=200|pages=92–98|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.01.025|issn=1873-5347|pmid=29421476}}</ref> It sits to realize the political nature of [[health]], [[Health care|healthcare]], and the wider public health and medical contexts that sit within it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghilardi|first=Giampaolo|last2=Campanozzi|first2=Laura Leondina|last3=Ciccozzi|first3=Massimo|last4=Ricci|first4=Giovanna|last5=Tambone|first5=Vittoradolfo|date=2020-04-25|title=The political nature of medicine|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30168-9/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=395|issue=10233|pages=1340–1341|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30168-9|issn=0140-6736|pmid=32334696}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Thomas R.|date=2006|title=THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123126|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=195–233|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123126|issn=0163-7525}}</ref>
