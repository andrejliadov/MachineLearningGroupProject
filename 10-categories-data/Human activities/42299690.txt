== Definition ==
Two types of CoG definition exist: by structure or by function.<ref name=IADB-Role>

In the first type, the defining criterion is the position in the structure of the Executive branch. It only includes institutions and units that directly and exclusively support the head of the government. For example, it refers to Ministries or General-Secretariats of the Presidency, Offices of the President or Prime Minister, and Cabinet Offices.

In the functional definitions, the defining criterion is that the institution performs whole-of-government functions, especially in terms of planning, coordination, monitoring, political management, and communications. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned institutions (such as Ministries of the Presidency), other institutions performing these tasks are also included, even if they are not part of the structure of the Presidency. For example, Ministries or Offices of Planning, [[:en:Prime Minister's Delivery Unit|Delivery Units]], Inter-Ministerial Committees, and even Budget Offices are considered part of the CoG.

A number of authors favor functional definitions, for considering them more applicable to countries with different forms of government and institutional frameworks.<ref name="Core Executive Studies in Britain"/><ref name=IADB-Strength>

Moreover, new institutional developments have generated increased interest in the CoG. The [[:en:Prime Minister's Delivery Unit|Prime Minister's Delivery Unit]] in the United Kingdom was established to ensure that the government's priorities were being implemented, through an intensive monitoring by the CoG.
