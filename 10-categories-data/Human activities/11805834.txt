==Plot==
After the house was seized, the couple and their daughter refuse to move out and Kehler is arrested on December 3, 1991, by US Marshals and IRS agents.<ref name="aocvideo"/> Community supporters move in, helping them to occupy the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|pages=43–44}}</ref> On February 12, 1992, the still-occupied house—but not the land, which belongs to the Valley Community Land Trust—is sold at auction to Danny Franklin and Terry Charnesky for $5400; the IRS had failed to receive any monetary bids at an earlier auction.<ref name="aocvideo"/> The sale results in suits and countersuits between the Franklin-Charnesky family and the Land Trust.<ref name="aocvideo"/> Despite the sale of the house, the Kehler-Corner occupiers refuse to leave.<ref name="aocvideo"/>

However, on April 15, 1992, while Kehler, Corner, and their supporters are away, Franklin, Charnesky, and their supporters move-in and occupy the house.<ref name="aocvideo"/> Kehler, Corner, and their supporters begin a lively protest and round-the-clock vigil just outside the house, eventually even building a small wooden structure to shelter the protesters.<ref name="aocvideo"/> On May 28, 1993, the Franklin County Superior court issues an injunction against the Kehler-Corner protests and, subsequently, several protesters are arrested and jailed after violating the injunction.<ref name="aocvideo"/> Still, the protest continues until September, when they are finally discontinued.<ref name="aocvideo"/> The battle over the house is ended on December 31, 1993, when an out-of-court settlement is reached between the Land Trust and the Franklin-Charnesky family, who agree to leave the house and deed it and the land-lease to the land trust in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money.<ref name="kehlerart">{{cite web |url=http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&issue=soj9404&article=940441d |title=Conscience, Community, and Compromise
