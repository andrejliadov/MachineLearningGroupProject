Adherents of the '''9/11 Truth movement''' are [[conspiracy theorists]] who dispute the general consensus of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.  The group disputes the consensus that [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists hijacked four airliners, crashed them into [[the Pentagon]] and the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|original World Trade Center Twin Towers]], where the crashes led to their [[collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]]. The primary focus is on missed information that they allege is not adequately explained in the official [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] report, such as the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center]]. They suggest a [[cover-up]] and, at the least, complicity by [[September 11 attacks advance-knowledge conspiracy theories|insiders]].<ref name="Feuer">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/us/05conspiracy.html|first=Alan|last=Feuer|title=500 Conspiracy Buffs Meet to Seek the Truth of 9/11|quote=the movement known as "9/11 Truth", a society of skeptics and scientists  who believe the government was complicit in the terrorist attacks.|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=May 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512222259/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/us/05conspiracy.html |archive-date=May 12, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Rudin">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/magazine/7488159.stm|first=Mike|last=Rudin|title=The evolution of a conspiracy theory|publisher=BBC|date=July 4, 2008|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Barber">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html |first=Peter|last=Barber|title=The truth is out there|quote=an army of sceptics, collectively described as the 9/11 Truth movement|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 7, 2008|accessdate=May 23, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603164130/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8d66e778-3128-11dd-ab22-000077b07658.html |archive-date=June 3, 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Powell">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/07/AR2006090701669_pf.html|first=Michael|last=Powell|title=The Disbelievers|quote=The loose agglomeration known as the '9/11 Truth Movement'|newspaper=Washington Post|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Barry">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/10/nation/na-conspiracy10|first=Ellen|last=Barry|title=9/11 Conspiracy Theorists Gather in N.Y.|quote= a group known as the 9/11 Truth Movement|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 10, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617183636/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/10/nation/na-conspiracy10|archive-date=June 17, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Hunt">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3483477/The-30-greatest-conspiracy-theories-part-1.html|first=H.E.|last=Hunt|title=The 30 greatest conspiracy theories – part 1|quote=A large group of people – collectively called the 9/11 Truth Movement|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=November 19, 2008|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Kay">{{cite news|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=f54cf9ee-4637-44de-8819-19d918b3241b&k=21893|first=Jonathan|last=Kay|title=Richard Gage: 9/11 truther extraordinaire|quote=The '9/11 Truth Movement,' as it is now commonly called|periodical=Financial Post|date=April 25, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701172048/http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=f54cf9ee-4637-44de-8819-19d918b3241b&k=21893|archive-date=July 1, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/skeptics+speak+UQAM/2976659/story.html |first=Jan |last=Ravensbergen |title=9/11 skeptics to speak at UQAM |quote=two leading voices of what's known as the 9/11 truth movement |newspaper=Montreal Gazette |date=May 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504062139/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/skeptics%2Bspeak%2BUQAM/2976659/story.html |archive-date=May 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>

In a 2011 article in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', [[Jamie Bartlett (journalist)|Jamie Bartlett]] and Carl Miller gave an overview and analyzed the members of the 9/11 Truth movement community. The authors found that people involved in this movement, which seemingly is a disparate group with very diversified backgrounds, could be classified into three groups. They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles, and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge) and have a conspiratorial stance.  Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience, and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement.<ref name=Bartlett>{{cite journal|last1=Bartlett|first1=Jamie|last2=Miller|first2=Carl|title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|volume=35.4|issue=July/August|pages=43–46|year=2011|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line|accessdate=September 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001051753/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line|archive-date=October 1, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In October 2004, the organization 9/11 Truth released a statement, signed by nearly 200 people, including many relatives of people who perished on September 11, 2001, that calls for an investigation into the attacks. It also asserted that unanswered questions would suggest that people within the administration of President George W. Bush may have deliberately allowed the attacks to happen. Actor [[Edward Asner]], former presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]], former congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]], former assistant secretary of housing [[Catherine Austin Fitts]], author [[Richard Heinberg]], [[Enver Masud]], founder of The Wisdom Fund, professors [[Richard A.

Following the initial government investigation, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) Report (May 2002) NIST Report, numerous responses were written by members of the 9/11 Truth movement. Many of these responses claimed that it ignored key evidence suggesting an explosive demolition, "distorted reality" by using deceptive language and diagrams, and attacked [[straw man]] arguments, such as the 2005 article by [[Jim Hoffman]] entitled ''Building a better mirage: NIST's 3-year $20,000,000 Cover Up of the Crime of the Century''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/17162|title=KPFA 94.1, Guns and Butter|publisher=Kpfa.org|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=May 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614070353/http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/17162|archive-date=June 14, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In late 2005, Steven E. Jones, then a professor at [[Brigham Young University]], announced a paper criticizing the NIST Report and describing his hypothesis that the WTC towers had been intentionally demolished by explosives. This paper garnered some mainstream media attention, including an appearance by Jones on [[MSNBC]]. This was the first such programming on a major cable news station. Jones was criticized by his university for making his claims public before vetting them through the approved peer review process.

The organization co-sponsored opinion polls conducted by the U.S. market research and opinion polling firm [[Zogby International]] that have shown [[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories|substantial numbers of people believing]] the government did not tell the full truth about the September 11 attacks.

===Scholars for 9/11 Truth===
The original Scholars for 9/11 Truth was founded by [[James H. Fetzer]], a former philosophy professor, and physicist Steven E. Jones, in December 2005. It was a group of people of differing backgrounds and expertise who rejected the mainstream media and government account of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="Barber"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/06/AR2006080600393.html|first=Justin|last=Pope|title=9/11 Conspiracy Theories Persist, Thrive|newspaper=Washington Post|date=August 6, 2006|accessdate=September 17, 2009 |quote=[...] Barrett will teach a class on Islam at the University of Wisconsin this fall, over the protests of more than 60 state legislators. Jones is a tenured physicist at Brigham Young University [...] co-founder James Fetzer, a retired philosophy professor at the University of Minnesota Duluth [...]}}</ref> Initially the group invited many ideas and hypotheses to be considered. However, leading members soon came to feel that the inclusion of some theories advocated by Fetzer—such as the use of directed energy weapons or miniature nuclear bombs to destroy the Twin Towers—were insufficiently supported by evidence and were exposing the group to ridicule. By December 2006, Jones and others set up a new scholars group, Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice, which described its focus as the use of scientific analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/index.html|title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice|publisher=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice}}</ref> The original members took a vote on which group to join and the majority voted to move to the new group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/faq.html#quest7|title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice}}</ref>

===Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice===
Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice (STJ) formed in January 2007 and is a self-described "group of scholars and supporters endeavoring to address the unanswered questions of the September 11, 2001 attack through scientific research and public education".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/index.html |title=Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice |publisher=Stj911.org |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}</ref> The group is composed of more than 900 members,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stj911.org/members/index.html|title=STH911 Members|publisher=Stj911.org|accessdate=July 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716221732/http://stj911.org/members/index.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> including [[Richard Gage (architect)|Richard Gage]], Steven E.

==Opponents==
[[Matt Taibbi]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assessed that the movement "gives supporters of Bush an excuse to dismiss critics of this administration", and expressed concerns about the number of people who believe in 9/11 conspiracy theories.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taibbi |first=Matt |author-link=Matt Taibbi |year=2006 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11818067/the_low_post_the_hopeless_stupidity_of_911_conspiracies/1 |title=The Low Post: I, Left Gatekeeper |work=Politics |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017051120/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11818067/the_low_post_the_hopeless_stupidity_of_911_conspiracies/1 |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref>

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) engineering professor [[Thomas W. Eagar]] was at first unwilling to acknowledge the concerns of the movement, saying that "if (the argument) gets too mainstream, I'll engage in the debate". In response to Steven E. Jones' publication of a hypothesis that the World Trade Center was destroyed by controlled demolition, Eagar said that adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement would use the reverse scientific method to arrive at their conclusions, as they "determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion".<ref>{{cite web|last=Walch|first=Tad|year=2006|url=https://www.deseret.com/2006/9/11/19973114/controversy-dogs-y-s-jones|title=Controversy dogs Y.'s Jones |work=Utah news |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|accessdate=December 18, 2020}}</ref>

Calling conspiracy theorists "the truthers", [[Bill Moyers]] has quoted journalist Robert Parry by stating that the theorists "...threw out all the evidence of al-Qaeda's involvement, from contemporaneous calls from hijack victims on the planes to confessions from al-Qaeda leaders both in and out of captivity that they had indeed done it. Then, recycling some of the right's sophistry techniques, such as using long lists of supposed evidence to overcome the lack of any real evidence, the 'truthers' cherry-picked a few supposed 'anomalies' to build an 'inside-job' story line".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moyers|first=Bill|url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/15-7|title=Is This a Private Fight or Can Anyone Get In It?|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=May 30, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201056/http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/15-7|archive-date=June 28, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>
