'''Trading companies''' are [[business]]es working with different kinds of [[product (business)|product]]s which are sold for [[consumer]], business, or [[government]] purposes. Trading companies buy a specialized range of products, maintain a stock or a shop, and deliver products to [[customer]]s.

Different kinds of practical conditions make for many kinds of business. Usually two kinds of businesses are defined in trading.

Importers or wholesalers maintain a stock and deliver products to shops or large end customers. They work in a large geographical area, while their customers, the shops, work in smaller areas and often in just a small neighborhood.

Today "trading company" mainly refers to global [[Business-to-business|B2B]] traders, highly specialized in one goods category and with a strong logistic organization. Changes in practical conditions such as faster [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[computing]] and modern [[marketing]] have led to changes in their business models.

The ''[[Winding-up and Restructuring Act]]'', an act of the [[Parliament of Canada]], uses the following definition:
