In 1838, 272 men, women, and children were sold by the [[Maryland]] [[Jesuit]]s; a portion of the proceeds was used to pay the debts of Georgetown College (now [[Georgetown University]]), also run by the Jesuits. The [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] had lived on plantations belonging to the Jesuits in Maryland, and they were sold to [[Henry Johnson (Louisiana politician)|Henry Johnson]] and [[Jesse Batey]]. The sale price was $115,000, {{Inflation|US|115000|1838|fmt=eq}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://features.thehoya.com/beyond-the-272-sold-in-1838-plotting-the-national-diaspora-of-jesuit-owned-slaves |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501233849/http://features.thehoya.com/beyond-the-272-sold-in-1838-plotting-the-national-diaspora-of-jesuit-owned-slaves |archive-date=May 1, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Of the $25,000 down-payment, $17,000 was used to pay down building debt that [[Thomas F.

These terms included that there be no familial separation, that the proceeds not be used to pay debt or the operating expenses of the college, and that the religious practice of the enslaved people be supported. In 1848, the Jesuit James Van de Velde wrote to Mulledy about his concerns over the lack of religious instruction received by the slaves sold to Henry Johnson, and urged Mulledy to contribute funds for the construction of a chapel.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://slaveryarchive.georgetown.edu/items/show/3|title=Letter from James Van de Velde, S.J. to Thomas Mulledy, S.J.|last=Van de Velde|first=James|date=March 28, 1848|website=Georgetown Slavery Archive|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603014846/http://slaveryarchive.georgetown.edu/items/show/3|archive-date=June 3, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=February 3, 2018}}</ref>

=== Building renamings ===
[[File:Isaac_Hawkins_Hall_Georgetown_University.jpg|right|thumb|Isaac Hawkins Hall, formerly Mulledy Hall and Freedom Hall, at Georgetown University]]
After the revelation around the slave sale gained wider publicity, the university decided to rename two buildings that bore the names of two Jesuits at Georgetown who had played significant roles in the 1838 sale, Thomas Mulledy and [[William McSherry]]. In November 2015, Mulledy Hall was renamed Freedom Hall and McSherry Hall was renamed Remembrance Hall as temporary measures while other names were being considered.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/georgetown-university-to-rename-two-buildings-that-reflect-schools-ties-to-slavery/2015/11/15/e36edd32-8bb7-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b_story.html|title=Georgetown University to rename two buildings that reflect school's ties to slavery|last=Shaver|first=Katherine|date=November 15, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 2, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203064355/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/georgetown-university-to-rename-two-buildings-that-reflect-schools-ties-to-slavery/2015/11/15/e36edd32-8bb7-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b_story.html|archive-date=February 3, 2018}}</ref> In 2017, the two buildings were rededicated in the names of Isaac, the first slave listed in the 1838 sale document, and [[Anne Marie Becraft]], a [[Free Negro|free woman of color]] who established a school in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] for black girls.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://wtop.com/dc/2017/04/georgetown-university-confronts-past-of-slavery-rededicates-two-buildings/|title=Georgetown University confronts past of slavery, rededicates 2 buildings|last=Cloherty|first=Megan|date=April 18, 2017|work=WTOP|access-date=February 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705205125/http://wtop.com/dc/2017/04/georgetown-university-confronts-past-of-slavery-rededicates-two-buildings/|archive-date=July 5, 2017|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Isaac Hawkins Hall ====
Isaac was an enslaved man born around 1773 and is believed to have been baptized in 1777. Historical records do not provide a family name, so his descendants' surname Hawkins was assigned to him. Before the sale he lived on the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]' White Marsh [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|plantation]] near present-day [[Bowie, Maryland]], and went on to have at least five children. He was 65 years old at the time of the sale in 1838. Most of his family members were also sold and were sent to Louisiana; his son Patrick arrived on the same ship as Isaac, and his grandson Cornelius was sent to Louisiana as well. His name does not appear on bills of sale from the 1850s that include his descendants, so Isaac is assumed to have died before then.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgetown.edu/news/isaac-hawkins-hall|title=Georgetown to Rename Building for Isaac Hawkins, One of 272 Enslaved in 1838 Sale|website=Georgetown University|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> Isaac has living descendants {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/04/18/georgetown-university-hosts-service-of-repentance-dedicates-building-to-slaves-it-sold-in-1938-to-secure-schools-future/|title=Grappling with its history of slavery, Georgetown gathers descendants for a day of repentance|last=Zauzmer|first=Julie|date=April 18, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 2, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Isaac was chosen to represent the entire group for the building renaming because his name was first on the list of enslaved people sold. Georgetown historian [[Maurice Jackson]] said, "We thought if we take the name of the first person, in which some ways he becomes representative of the other enslaved black people sold".<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":2" /> The building and an adjacent one had been built around 1833 and 1904, and housed Jesuits until 2004. After ten years of vacancy, they were renovated as student housing and opened in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://keasthood.com/projects/former-jesuit-residence-ryan-and-mulledy-halls-georgetown-university/|title=Ryan and Isaac Hawkins Halls|website=Keast & Hood|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://residentialliving.georgetown.edu/communities/upperclass/ryanisaac|title=Ryan Hall & Isaac Hawkins Hall|website=Georgetown University|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>

In the February 5, 2019 episode of [[PBS]]'s ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', actress [[S. Epatha Merkerson]] was revealed to be a descendant of Isaac Hawkins.
