'''Border trade''', in general, refers to the flow of goods and services across the
international borders between jurisdictions. In this sense, it is a part of normal legal trade
that flows through standard export/import frameworks of nations. However border trade specifically refers to the ''increase'' in trade in areas where crossing borders is relatively easy and where products are significantly cheaper in one place than another, often because of significant variations in taxation levels on goods such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[tobacco]].

As well as border trade across land or sea borders, air travel with a [[low-cost carrier]] can be worthwhile for a short international trip to the same purpose, although baggage restrictions can limit worthwhile savings to those for small high-value goods.

Where border trade is done for [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]] it forms part of the [[underground economy]] of both jurisdictions.

==By region==

===Europe===
Typical examples of this are the borders between [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], between [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]]/[[Sweden]]/[[Finland]]/[[Russia]]/[[Estonia]] and between [[Denmark]]/[[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. For instance, the excise tax on alcohol is lower in Estonia than in Finland and much lower than in Sweden, thus it is common to buy large volumes of alcohol when returning from Estonia: there are shops in the Tallinn harbour that cater specifically to tourists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.err.ee/v/economy/0759bc45-5728-41c2-9f0a-b229a4724b2a|title=Third of Estonia's Alcohol Sales Attributed to Finnish Tourists|date= 22 April 2014}}</ref> In Finland, the best-selling [[Alko]] shop in proportion to local population is on the border to Norway, since even if the alcohol tax is high in Finland, it is lower than the one in Norway (and was lowered in order to decrease border trade with Estonia).

Border trading exists between [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]], as buying food is cheaper in Poland than in Lithuania. 

Border trading exists between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]; during the [[Global Financial Crisis]], when the [[Euro]] rose against the [[British pound]], so many from the Republic visited [[Newry]]—with lines of traffic four miles long—that the phenomenon became known as the "Newry effect". One in four households in the Republic in counties as far as [[County Galway|Galway]], four hours away from the border, shopped for groceries in Northern Ireland.<ref name="quinn20081218">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/world/europe/18ireland.html | title=A Northern Ireland Town Is a Shoppers’ Paradise | work=The New York Times | date=2008-12-18 | accessdate=5 May 2015 | author=Quinn, Eamon | pages=A14}}</ref> Petrol is cheaper in the Republic, and groceries, furniture and clothing are cheaper in Northern Ireland.

Between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]/[[Belgium]], the [[booze cruise]] is a trip made specifically, or at least largely, to purchase cheaper alcohol and tobacco, and also goods offering different rates of VAT: [[laundry detergent]], perhaps surprisingly, is a common purchase. Similarly, there is an important number of French purchasers buying tobacco and alcohol in Spanish border towns such as [[Le Perthus]]. In [[Spain]], these products are a third cheaper than in France. During summer, around 70,000 visitors cross the Spanish border daily to buy such products, occasioning severe traffic jams. Nearby [[Andorra]], with a low VAT (4%), is also extremely popular with French customers residing in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/02/cross-border-buying-shopping-bargains-globalisation|title=Shop frontiers: the rise of cross-border buying around the world|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

There is a significant amount of border trade in [[marijuana]] between the [[Netherlands]], [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|where cannabis is essentially legal]], and surrounding countries such as [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], and [[France]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2013/09/24/weed-ghettos-for-tourists-anger-netherlands-neighbors/ | title=Marijuana For Tourists, Discord for the Netherlands | work=Forbes | date=2013-09-13 | accessdate=28 December 2015 | author=Rodriguez, Cecilia}}</ref>

A more legal example of the Netherlands is the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] province, where citizens occasionally take trips to Germany and Belgium to buy commodities like: medicinal products, handcrafted furniture, fresh produce, alcoholic beverages or home appliances for lower prices due to the VAT. This is very easy as there are no border controls due to the [[Schengen Agreement]]. It is fully legal to buy products for your own need over the border in the EU, if [[European Union value added tax|VAT]] is paid when purchasing, except from some low-VAT areas.

Residents of Switzerland and Liechtenstein who are non-EU residents can purchase many items in nearby Germany from anything from two to seven times the price they would pay for the same products in their own countries. Austria is also somewhat cheaper than Switzerland. Residents of Switzerland usually qualify for a tax refund on purchases made in all of the surrounding [[EU]] countries making cross border shopping even more attractive, particularly in Germany where there is no minimum-purchase requirement for claiming the tax back.<ref>https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/einkaufstourismus-ist-im-schweizer-detailhandel-eine-feste-groesse-ld.1345912</ref><ref>https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/einkaufstourismus-ld.1382332</ref><ref>https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/keine-mauer-wider-den-einkaufstourismus-ld.1317360</ref><ref>https://www.foodaktuell.ch/einkaufstourismus-keine-entwarnung/</ref><ref>https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/wirtschaft/grenzgemeinden-erhoehen-druck_aerger-mit-einkaufstouristen--ein-politischer-dauerbrenner/43732754</ref><ref>https://www.tagblatt.ch/ostschweiz/einkaufstourismus-einkaeufe-im-netz-und-ennet-der-grenze-setzen-ostschweizer-gewerbe-weiter-zu-ld.1011904</ref><ref>https://www.unisg.ch/de#!/lightbox/https://www.unisg.ch/de/wissen/newsroom/aktuell/rssnews/forschung-lehre/2017/studie-einkaufstourismus-06dezember2017</ref>

===North America===
Cross-border shopping between three countries in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]] is robust. The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) has reduced barriers and tariffs, facilitating cross-border trade. Each day 2008, $2 billion of cross-border trade was conducted between Canada and the United States alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2008/2008-07-02-eng.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317141123/http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/media/release-communique/2008/2008-07-02-eng.html |archivedate=2010-03-17 }}</ref> Consumers take part in cross-border trading to broaden their product selection, gain access to a larger market place, or take advantage of currency volatility. Online commerce has taken on a more prominent role in recent years and gives consumers a convenient platform for cross-border shopping. However, additional border costs such as [[duties]], [[brokerage]] and shipping are not always disclosed up front or even known to the retailer, leading to a situation where the final cost of an item can greatly exceed expectations. Dedicated cross-border shopping solutions such as Wishabi,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wishabi.ca/cross_border_shopping |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313053850/http://www.wishabi.ca/cross_border_shopping |archive-date=2010-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and Canada Post’s Borderfree exist to mitigate these problems with varied success. In the end, caution is necessary to determine the final cost of goods before purchase.


====Between U.S. States====
Although not crossing a national boundary, residents of one state may often travel across a state line in order to shop for a variety of goods. In some cases, a larger city or metro area in one state may draw a population in from another state. In other cases, residents may take advantage of more friendly legislation regarding restricted products, such as alcohol, tobacco, fireworks, firearms, gambling, etc. For example, a New York City resident may engage in [[illicit cigarette trade]] by purchasing products in a nearby state with lower taxes and re-selling them illegally in New York. Furthermore, states which have legalized recreational marijuana may experience a high-amount of out-of-state customers.

===Asia===
Many [[Singapore]]ans also travel to [[Johor Bahru]] in [[Malaysia]] or [[Batam]] in [[Indonesia]], to take advantage of price differences and differing product availability. The Singaporean government has a law that requires a car leaving Singapore to have the fuel tank filled by at least 75 percent, to prevent it from being filled with fuel from outside Singapore.

[[Shenzhen]], on the border of [[mainland China]] with the special administrative region of [[Hong Kong]], also benefits from border trade.
