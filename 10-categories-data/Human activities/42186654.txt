An '''Assisting Offender''' is a suspected or convicted criminal in the United Kingdom, who has agreed to assist the investigation or prosecution of other criminals in return for some form of sentence reduction on their own criminal history.

In the United Kingdom the use of Assisting Offenders is enabled by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] (SOCPA), the relevant sections of which came into force in 2006. The relevant sections are:

== Immunity ==

== Review of sentence ==

Section 74<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/section/74 |title=Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> of the SOCPA allows a Specified Prosecutor to seek a review of a previously sentenced prisoner who has entered an agreement to assist the prosecution or investigation of other criminals in exchange for a reduced sentence.

== Use of legislation ==

The 2005 legislation placed the use of so-called '[[Supergrass (informer)|supergrasses]]' onto a statutory footing.

Assisting Offenders have been used in some notable cases with mixed results. In 2007 [[Murder of Rhys Jones|Rhys Jones]] was shot dead in Liverpool as part of a gang related incident. One of the suspects was later arrested in possession of a firearm and became an Assisting Offender giving evidence for the prosecution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php/topic/87072-rhys-jones-killers-gang-celebrate-jail-sentence/ |title=Rhys Jones Killer's gang celebrate jail sentence - News - PoliceSpecials.com Forum |publisher=Policespecials.com |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073656/http://www.policespecials.com/forum/index.php/topic/87072-rhys-jones-killers-gang-celebrate-jail-sentence/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref>
In [[Northern Ireland]] the use of Assisting Offenders was heavily criticised when the trial of 13 men for a range of terrorist crimes ended with only one conviction after a trial that had cost £11.5 million<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-19907192 |title=BBC News - Mark Haddock UVF supergrass trial cost taxpayers £11.5m |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref>
