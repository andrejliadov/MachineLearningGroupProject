A '''portfolio career''' comprises a variety of roles rather than one [[job]] at a single organisation. It can be a [[career]] that combines multiple paid and/or voluntary roles.
The philosopher and organisational behaviourist [[Charles Handy]] popularised the "portfolio" concept<ref>

Handy's recognition of the portfolio career-path came about when he realised that individuals would be required to develop portable skillsets to meet the needs of a fast-moving future workplace. <ref>{{cite web | title=How to... become a portfolio worker | website=Personnel Today | date=2003-05-06 | url=https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-to-become-a-portfolio-worker/ | access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref> His prediction foresaw what is now known as the [[gig economy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8d6bad56-d42a-11e9-8367-807ebd53ab77|title=Unknown|website=www.ft.com}}{{subscription required|date=November 2020}}</ref>

== Advantages ==

Advantages of a portfolio career include [[work–life balance]], job security, flexibility, variety, multiple income streams and the ability to pursue individual interest areas.<ref>{{cite web | last=Layton | first=Rachael | title=The pros and cons of a portfolio career | website=Women's Agenda | date=2017-06-05 | url=https://womensagenda.com.au/business/entrepreneurs/pros-cons-portfolio-career/ | access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>

Ben Legg, CEO of UK-based social enterprise The Portfolio Collective, said: "A portfolio career is much more resilient than having one permanent role. In addition to having multiple income sources, your work is always evolving, as old clients roll off and you win new ones."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portfolio-collective.com/portfolio-professional-interview-series-ben-legg/ |title=Interview |website=portfolio-collective.com|access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref> 

== Disadvantages ==

Disadvantages are the lack of stability, traditional career progression, fluctuation of earnings and a lack of identity.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Pros and Cons of a Portfolio Career | website=Eluceo | date=2020-11-01 | url=https://www.eluceoeducation.org/main-blog/2877-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-portfolio-career | access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>

[[Herminia Ibarra]], the Charles Handy Professor of Organisational Behaviour at [[London Business School]], argues that the portfolio careerist is faced with the problem of identity. "There is no easy label, no shorthand. Inevitably, one resorts to explaining oneself with a laundry list, when the culturally appropriate answer is what the psychologist Kenneth Gergen called the progressive narrative: a story of hard work and linear ascent culminating in a recognisably top role."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/182d1bae-a438-11e5-873f-68411a84f346|title=Unknown|website=www.ft.com}}{{subscription required|date=November 2020}}</ref>

== Scale ==
The Centre for Research on Self Employment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crse.co.uk/home|title=Home &#124; CRSE|website=www.crse.co.uk}}</ref>, a London-based think tank, estimates that 250,000 UK workers who define their work as a portfolio career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crse.co.uk/sites/default/files/The%20Freelance%20Project%20and%20Gig%20Economies%20of%20the%2021st%20Century.pdf |title=The Freelance Project and Gig Economies of the 21st Century |website= crse.co.uk|access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref> A study by the [[Henley Business School]] determined that in the United Kingdom 25 per cent of workers had a [[side job]]. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://assets.henley.ac.uk/defaultUploads/PDFs/news/Journalists-Regatta-Henley_Business_School_whitepaper_DIGITAL.pdf|title=The Side Hustle Economy |website=assets.henley.ac.uk |access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref> Ben Legg, CEO of UK-based social enterprise The Portfolio Collective, believes this number is likely to be in the millions by 2030.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://portfolio-collective.com/what-is-a-portfolio-career/ |title= What Is A Portfolio Career? |website=portfolio-collective.com|access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref>  

Some 45 per cent of working Americans report having a [[side job]], making them portfolio careerists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/side-hustles-survey-june-2019/|title=Survey: Nearly 1 In 3 Side Hustlers Needs The Income To Stay Afloat &#124; Bankrate.com|first=Amanda|last=Dixon|website=Bankrate}}</ref> In the United Kingdom 60 per cent of students and graduates said they had a side job and 43 per cent needed the extra income to pay their rent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-in-five-young-brits-rely-on-side-hustle-to-make-ends-meet-131602647.html|title=Two in five young Brits rely on 'side hustle' to make ends meet|website=finance.yahoo.com}}</ref>

Portfolio careers may become more common as the world economy and job market work to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rewire.org/thrive-gig-economy-portfolio-career|title=Creative Ways to Thrive in a Bleak Job Market|date=September 11, 2020|website=Rewire}}</ref>

== Issues ==
Sean Smith, a retired vice-principal, argues that "a new economy that requires aspirational young people to effectively become captains of their own cottage industries will require schools to think very differently". He believes that schools will need to redefine how they view work readiness and change the expectations of young people as they prepare for work. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/news/are-we-preparing-pupils-gig-economy|title=Are we preparing pupils for the gig economy?|website=Tes}}</ref>

Tara Fenwick, Emeritus Professor of Professional Education in the School of Education at the University of Stirling, thinks "workers may need to educate clients about the nature of portfolio work; and employers who contract to portfolio workers must take more responsibility for negotiating fair contracts that are sensitive to overwork and unfair time pressures".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242026251 |title=Contradictions in portfolio careers: Work design and client relations |date=2006 |website= www.researchgate.net|access-date=2020-11-13}}</ref>

== Nomenclature ==
Young portfolio careerists are sometimes known as slashies or solopreneurs. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2019/apr/23/rise-slashie-glamorous-new-work-or-ultimate-grind|title=The rise of the slashie: a glamorous new way to work – or the ultimate grind?|first=Guardian|last=Staff|date=April 23, 2019|website=the Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | website=FT Alphaville | date=2016-05-25 | url=https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/05/25/2163158/its-no-fun-when-amex-throws-your-startup-a-curve-ball/|title=It's no fun | access-date=2020-11-14}}</ref>
