"'''A Pittance of Time'''" is a 2002 Canadian folk song by [[Terry Kelly (singer)|Terry Kelly]] and produced by Jefter Publishing â€“ [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada|SOCAN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/information-for/educators/end-of-an-era/writerscircle |title=Writers' Circle Instructons |publisher=Veterans Affairs Canada |date=2019-02-14 |accessdate=2019-10-24}}</ref> Kelly's intent in writing the song was to remind people to observe the [[two-minute silence]] on [[Remembrance Day]], after he saw a man in a shop failing to do so.

== History ==
On 11 November 1999, Kelly was in a [[drug store]] which announced over the public address system that they would be observing the two-minutes silence at 11&nbsp;a.m. for Remembrance. Kelly observed the silence but noticed a man in the queue in front of him demanding that the clerk run his shopping through during the silence. Kelly also noted that the man's daughter chastised him afterwards by saying: "Daddy, you were supposed to be quiet through that time".<ref name=in>{{cite web|last=Hanley |first=Kieran |url=https://theindependent.ca/2011/11/09/a-pittance-of-time/ |title=A Pittance of Time |work=The Independent |date=2011-11-09 |accessdate=2019-10-24}}</ref> Kelly's anger about the lack of respect led him to write "A Pittance of Time" as a plea for people to observe the two-minute silence on Remembrance Day.<ref name=in />

Kelly recorded the song in 2002 with the lyrics being written to remind people of the sacrifices that the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces made during the war for their freedom.<ref name=in /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://millstonenews.com/2017/11/almonte-district-high-schools-remembrance-day-ceremony.html |title=Almonte District High School's Remembrance Day ceremony |publisher=Millstone News |date=2017-11-21 |accessdate=2019-10-24}}</ref> Kelly also wrote a French language version of the song titled "C'est Si Peu de Temps".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terry-kelly.com/special-projects/cest-si-peu-de-temps/ |title=C'est si peu de temps |publisher=Terry Kelly |date= |accessdate=2019-10-24}}</ref>

The song was also used as the inspiration for a campaign for Canadian shops not to put up Christmas displays until after Remembrance Day.<ref name=cbc>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/terry-kelly-brett-wilson-calgary-st-john-s-christmas-remembrance-day-1.3306187 |title=Terry Kelly tune inspires campaign to delay Christmas displays |publisher=CBC |date=2015-11-06 |accessdate=2019-10-24}}</ref> It was led by the businessman and ''[[Dragons' Den (Canadian TV series)|Dragon's Den]]'' panellist [[W. Brett Wilson]] who was inspired by "A Pittance of Time" and felt that the excessively early Christmas displays were disrespecting the memory of the veterans. He called for shops to wait until after 11 November before putting up Christmas displays.<ref name=cbc />
