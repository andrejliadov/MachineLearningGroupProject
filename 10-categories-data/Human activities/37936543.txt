In Belarus, in the manor of [[Mieračoŭščyna]] - the birthplace of Kościuszko - a monument was opened on May 12th, 2018. This became the first monument to Kościuszko in the country, and it was financed and produced through a crowdfunding campaign organized by a journalist Gleb Labadzenka (Hlieb Labadzienka). The campaign received financing from over 700 private contributors, and a monument design by Henik Lojka won the competition. Installation of the monument was organized by the local authorities of the [[Ivatsevichy|Ivacevičy District]].<ref name="First monument to Tadeusz Kościuszko opened in Belarus"/>

Furthermore, besides the museum in Meračoŭščyna there is another small museum, the "Gosudarstvennoe učreždenie kul'tury Žabinkovskij rajonnyj istoriko-kraevedčeskij musej" in the Tadėvuš-Kascjuška-Street in Malyja Sjachnovičy, a small village between [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Kobryn]] in Belarus.
