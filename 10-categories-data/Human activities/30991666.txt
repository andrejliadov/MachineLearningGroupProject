The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].

== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].<ref>Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf</ref>

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref>É¡</ref>
