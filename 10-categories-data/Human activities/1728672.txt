Some [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]], such as the radical thinker and polemicist [[Pentti Linkola]], see human overpopulation as a threat to the entire [[biosphere]].<ref>Pentti Linkola, "Can Life Prevail?", Arktos Media, 2nd Revised ed. 2011. pp. 120–121. {{ISBN|1907166637}}.</ref> In 2017, over 15,000 scientists around the world issued a second [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity|warning to humanity]] which asserted that rapid human population growth is the "primary driver behind many ecological and even societal threats."<ref name="WorldScientists"/>

== Human overconsumption ==
{{Main|Overconsumption}}
[[File:NASA CO2 Chart.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Chart published by NASA depicting CO2 levels from the past 400,000 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/graphic-the-relentless-rise-of-carbon-dioxide/|title=Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|work=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>]]
Overconsumption is a situation where resource use has outpaced the sustainable capacity of the ecosystem. It can be measured by the [[ecological footprint]], a resource accounting approach which compares human demand on ecosystems with the amount of planet matter ecosystems can renew. Estimates indicate that humanity's current demand is 70%<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=5001&type=BCtot,EFCtot|title=Open Data Platform|website=Data.footprintnetwork.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> higher than the regeneration rate of all of the planet's ecosystems combined. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to environmental degradation and the eventual loss of resource bases.

Humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors, not just the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated that the inhabitants of the developed nations of the world consume resources like oil and metals at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population.<ref name="NYTimes_Diamond">Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02).

The effects of overpopulation are compounded by [[overconsumption]]. According to [[Paul R. Ehrlich]], speaking in 2017:

<blockquote>Rich western countries are now siphoning up the planet’s resources and destroying its ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. We want to build highways across the Serengeti to get more rare earth minerals for our cellphones. We grab all the fish from the sea, wreck the coral reefs and put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We have triggered a major extinction event [...] A world population of around a billion would have an overall pro-life effect. This could be supported for many millennia and sustain many more human lives in the long term compared with our current uncontrolled growth and prospect of sudden collapse [...] If everyone consumed resources at the US level – which is what the world aspires to – you will need another four or five Earths. We are wrecking our planet’s [[Ecosystem services|life support systems]].<ref>McKie, Robin.

==Fishing and farming==
{{main|Environmental impact of agriculture}}
The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.
[[File:Lacanja_burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn]]
There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: "means-based", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and "effect-based", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of [[Nitrogen fertilizers|nitrogen applied]] to the [[soil]].<!-- this first example makes no sense to me. If you agree, I suggest to leave and indication here; or, if you can, rewrite it.--> An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.<ref name="sciencedirect.com">{{cite journal|last1=van der Warf|first1=Hayo|last2=Petit|first2=Jean|title=Evaluation of the environmental impact of agriculture at the farm level: a comparison and analysis of 12 indicator-based methods|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=December 2002|volume=93|issue=1–3|pages=131–145|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00354-1}}</ref>

The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are [[climate change]], [[deforestation]], genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, [[soil degradation]], and [[waste]].

===Fishing===
{{main|Environmental impact of fishing}}
[[File:Fishing down the food web.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Fishing down the foodweb]]]]
The environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught, such as [[overfishing]], [[sustainable fisheries]], and [[fisheries management]]; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment, such as [[by-catch]] and destruction of habitat such as [[coral reef]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=120–123}}</ref>

These conservation issues are part of [[marine conservation]], and are addressed in [[fisheries science]] programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity's desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the [[world population]] grows.

Similar to other [[environmental issues]], there can be conflict between the [[fishermen]] who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be [[sustainability|sustainable]] then some fisheries must reduce or even close.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Myers | first1 = R.

The journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught [[seafood]] in 2048. The scientists stated that the decline was a result of [[overfishing]], [[pollution]] and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings, although the debate continues. Many countries, such as [[Tonga]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.<ref>{{cite journal

===Irrigation===
{{main|Environmental impact of irrigation}}

The environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of [[soil]] and [[water]] as a result of [[irrigation]] and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme.

The impacts stem from the changed [[hydrology|hydrological conditions]] owing to the installation and operation of the scheme.

An irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area. As a hydrological result it is found that:
* the downstream river [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] is reduced
* the [[evaporation]] in the scheme is increased
* the [[groundwater recharge]] in the scheme is increased
* the level of the [[watertable|water table]] rises
* the [[drainage]] flow is increased.
These may be called direct effects.

Effects on soil and [[water quality]] are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural, [[ecology|ecological]] and [[socio-economy|socio-economic]] conditions are intricate.  In some, but not all instances, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinization]] can result.  However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.<ref>http://www.fao.org/tempref/agl/agll/docs/salinity_brochure_eng.pdf</ref><ref>van Hoorn, J. W. and J.G. van Alphen.  2006.  Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications.  Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. pp. 533–600.</ref>

Irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by [[water well|(tube)wells]]. As a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends. The effects may be [[water mining]], land/soil [[Groundwater-related subsidence|subsidence]], and, along the coast, [[saltwater intrusion]].

Agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps, dams, and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers, lakes, and rivers.  As a result of this massive diversion of freshwater, lakes, rivers, and creeks are running dry, severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems, and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species.<ref>Pearce, R.

Considerable water use is associated with meat production, mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed.  There are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production, but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated.  For example, “green water” use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and “green water” has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production's “[[water footprint]]”,<ref>Mekonnen, M. M. and Hoekstra, A. Y. (2010). ''The green, blue and grey water footprint of farm animals and animal products''. Vol. 2: appendices.  Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48.  UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education.</ref> and on rangeland, as much as 99.5% of the water use associated with beef production is “green water”.

Impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern, especially where intensive livestock production is carried out.  In the US, in a comparison of 32 industries, the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act,<ref>US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.</ref> but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur.  Various measures have been suggested by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others, which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/agriculture|title=Agriculture|last=US EPA|first=OECA|date=2015-03-19|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>

Changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production, as illustrated by some beef data.  In the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6% less fossil fuel use, 16% less greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents), 12% less withdrawn water use and 33% less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = J.

=== Habitat Fragmentation ===
{{Main|Habitat fragmentation}}
According to a 2018 study in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 87% of the oceans and 77% of land (excluding Antarctica) have been altered by anthropogenic activity, and 23% of the planet's landmass remains as [[wilderness]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/whats-left-of-the-worlds-wilderness-just-23 |title=Report: Just 23% of Earth's wilderness remains|last= Fleischer|first=Evan|date=November 2, 2019 |website=[[Big Think]] |access-date=March 3, 2019}}</ref>

Habitat fragmentation is the reduction of large tracts of habitat leading to habitat loss. Habitat fragmentation and loss are considered as being the main cause of the loss of biodiversity and degradation of the ecosystem all over the world. Human actions are greatly responsible for habitat fragmentation, and loss as these actions alter the connectivity and quality of habitats. Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation is important for the preservation of biodiversity and enhancing the functioning of the ecosystem.<ref>Wilson, M. C., Chen, X. Y., Corlett, R. T., Didham, R. K., Ding, P., Holt, R. D., ... & Laurance, W. F. (2016). Habitat fragmentation and biodiversity conservation: key findings and future challenges. </ref>

Both agricultural plants and animals depend on pollination for reproduction. Vegetables and fruits are an important diet for human beings and depend on pollination. Whenever there is habitat destruction, pollination is reduced and crop yield as well. Many pants also rely on animals and most especially those that eat fruit for seed dispersal. Therefore, the destruction of habitat for animal severely affects all the plant species that depend on them.<ref>Datta, S. (2018). ''The Effects of Habitat Destruction of the Environment''.

Biodiversity generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth, and is represented by the number of different species there are on the planet. Since its introduction, Homo sapiens (the human species) has been killing off entire species either directly (such as through hunting) or indirectly (such as by [[habitat destruction|destroying habitats]]), causing the [[extinction]] of species at an alarming rate. Humans are the cause of the current [[mass extinction]], called the [[Holocene extinction]], driving extinctions to 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13335683 | work=BBC News | title=Anthropocene: Have humans created a new geological age? | date=2011-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=May, R.M. |year=1988|title=How many species are there on earth?|doi=10.1126/science.241.4872.1441|url=http://www.life.illinois.edu/ib/451/May%20(1988).pdf|journal=Science|volume=241|issue=4872|pages=1441–9|pmid=17790039|bibcode=1988Sci...241.1441M|s2cid=34992724}}</ref> Though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction, some scholars have postulated without humans, the biodiversity of the Earth would grow at an exponential rate rather than decline.<ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/> The Holocene extinction continues, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[Decline in amphibian populations|amphibian crisis]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] decline in biodiversity.

=== Invasive species ===
{{main|Invasive species}}

Introductions of species, particularly plants into new areas, by whatever means and for whatever reasons have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas.  Examples include the introduction of [[Caulerpa taxifolia]] into the Mediterranean, the introduction of oat species into the California grasslands, and the introduction of privet, kudzu, and [[purple loosestrife]] to North America.  Rats, cats, and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands.  Additionally, introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place, as with [[American bison|buffalo]] with domestic cattle, and wolves with domestic dogs.

=== Pollution by wastewater ===
{{see also|Water degradation}}

Domestic, industrial and [[agricultural wastewater]] makes its way to wastewater plants for treatment before being released into aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater at these treatment plants contains a cocktail of different chemical and biological contaminants which may influence surrounding ecosystems. For example, the nutrient rich water supports large populations of pollutant-tolerant [[Chironomidae]], which in-turn attract [[insectivorous bat]]s.<ref name=pubmed>{{cite journal|title=Haematological and genotoxic responses in an urban adapter, the banana bat, foraging at wastewater treatment works|first1=Samantha|last1=Naidoo|first2=Dalene|last2=Vosloo|first3=M.

Biological contaminants such as bacteria, viruses and fungi in wastewater can also be transferred to the surrounding ecosystem. Insects emerging from this wastewater may spread pathogens to nearby water sources. Pathogens, shed from humans, can be passed from this wastewater to organisms foraging at these treatment plants. This may lead to bacterial and viral infections or microbiome dysbiosis.

[[Global warming]] is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests, increased methane, volcanic activity and cement production. Such massive alteration of the global [[carbon cycle]] has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of [[carbon sink]]s such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction of millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=31}}</ref> Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.<ref name=IPCC>{{Cite web |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226155600/http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Acid Deposition  ===
{{Main|Acid Deposition}}
The fossils that are burned by humans for energy usually come back to them in the form of acid rain. Acid rain is a form of precipitation which has high sulfuric and nitric acids which can occur in the form of a fog or snow. Acid rain has numerous ecological impacts on streams, lakes, wetlands and other aquatic environments. It damages forests, robs the soil of its essential nutrients, releases aluminium to the soil, which makes it very hard for trees to absorb water.<ref>National Geographic. Acid Rain, explained. <nowiki>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/acid-rain/</nowiki></ref>

Researchers have discovered that kelp, eelgrass and other vegetation can effectively absorb carbon dioxide and hence reducing ocean acidity. Scientists, therefore, say that growing these plants could help in mitigating the damaging effects of acidification on marine life.<ref>Jones N., (2016).

=== Ozone depletion on Vegetation ===
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}Ozone depletion damages plants all over the world and this includes both the plants in the natural ecosystems and the agricultural crops. It damages vegetation by entering through the leaf’s stomata and burning that plant tissue during the respiration process.<ref>National Park Service, (2019). ''Ozone Effects on Plants.'' Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.nps.gov/subjects/air/nature-ozone.htm</nowiki></ref> Ground-level ozone is known for causing more plant damage than any other all the combination of all other air pollutants.

Reduced ozone levels due to ozone depletion indicate that there is less protection from sun rays and more exposure to UVB radiation at the surface of the Earth. UVB radiation affects the developmental and physiological processes of plants. These effects include changes in plant form, the timing of developmental phases, distribution of nutrients within the plant and secondary metabolism.<ref>EPA (2018).

==Technology impacts==
The applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts, which according to the [[I = PAT]] equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit GDP. Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise “improve” upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.<ref>Commoner, B. (1971). The closing cycle – Nature, man, and technology, [[Alfred A. Knopf]].</ref> Second, the conservation of mass principle and the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or [[entropy]] outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create “order” in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing “disorder” in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.<ref>Faber, M., Niemes, N. and Stephan, G. (2012).

==Mining industry==
[[File:Rio tinto river CarolStoker NASA Ames Research Center.jpg|thumb|right|Acid mine drainage in the Rio Tinto River]]
{{main|Environmental impact of mining}}

The environmental impact of mining includes [[erosion]], formation of [[sinkhole]]s, loss of [[biodiversity]], and contamination of soil, [[groundwater]] and [[surface water]] by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6 Logging of forests and debris dumping]. Ngm.nationalgeographic.com (2002-10-17). Retrieved on 2012-05-11.</ref> 

Even though plants need some heavy metals for their growth, excess of these metals is usually toxic to them. Plants that are polluted with heavy metals usually depict reduced growth, yield and performance. Pollution by heavy metals decreases the soil organic matter composition resulting in a decline in soil nutrients which then leads to a decline in the growth of plants or even death.<ref>Chibuike, G. U., & Obiora, S. C. (2014). Heavy metal polluted soils: effect on plants and bioremediation methods. ''Applied and environmental soil science'', ''2014''. </ref>

Besides creating environmental damage, the contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect the health of the local population.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/12 Poisoning by mines]. Ngm.nationalgeographic.com (2002-10-17). Retrieved on 2012-05-11.</ref> Mining companies in some countries are required to follow environmental and rehabilitation codes, ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state. Some mining methods may have significant environmental and public health effects. Heavy metals usually exhibit toxic effects towards the soil biota, and this is through the affection of the microbial processes and decreases the number as well as activity of soil microorganisms. Low concentration of heavy metals also has high chances of inhibiting the plant's physiological metabolism.<ref>Jiwan, S., & Ajah, K. S. (2011).

A joint life cycle analysis by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95%.  Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with petroleum diesel.  In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent, and emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel.  Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel.<ref>USDA-USDoE.  (1998).

===Coal mining and burning===
{{main|Environmental impact of coal mining and burning}}
[[File:Smog in Beijing CBD.JPG|thumb|[[Pollution in China|Smog in Beijing]], China]]
The environmental impact of [[coal mining]] and -burning is diverse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html|title=coal power: air pollution|website=Ucsusa.org}}</ref> Legislation passed by the US Congress in 1990 required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate [[toxic]] [[air pollution]] from [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal-fired power plants]]. After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.

===Electricity generation===
{{main|Environmental impact of electricity generation}}
The environmental impact of [[electricity generation]] is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power. This power is normally generated at [[power plant]]s that convert some other kind of energy into [[electricity]]. Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.

===Nuclear power===
{{main|Environmental impact of nuclear power}}
[[File:Grüne protests against nuclear energy.jpg|right|thumb|Anti-nuclear protest near [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste disposal centre]] at [[Gorleben]] in northern Germany]]
The environmental impact of [[nuclear power]] results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and [[radioactive]] fuel waste. Released [[radioisotopes]] pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.

Radiation is a [[carcinogen]] and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[Three Mile Island accident]], among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive [[Plutonium-244]] has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.<ref>Smith, G. (2012). ''Nuclear roulette: The truth about the most dangerous energy source on earth'', Chelsea Green Publishing, {{ISBN|160358434X}}.</ref>

===Oil shale industry===
{{main|Environmental impact of the oil shale industry}}
[[Image:Kivioli chemical plant.JPG|thumb|Kiviõli Oil Shale Processing & Chemicals Plant in ida-Virumaa, Estonia]]
The environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as [[land use]], [[waste management]], [[Water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] caused by the [[oil shale industry|extraction and processing]] of [[oil shale]]. [[Surface mining]] of [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] causes the usual environmental impacts of [[open-pit mining]]. In addition, the [[combustion]] and [[Shale oil extraction|thermal processing]] generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.<ref name="BartisBoston">

===Petroleum===
{{main|Environmental impact of petroleum}}
The environmental impact of [[petroleum]] is often negative because it is [[toxic]] to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.

===Reservoirs===
{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
[[Image:Wachusett-dam.jpg|thumb|right|The Wachusett Dam in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]]]
The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.

[[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental—to both the environment and surrounding human populations— has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.

===Wind power===
[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbines in an agricultural setting]]
{{main|Environmental impact of wind power}}

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. [[Wind power]]ed electricity generation consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.<ref name=mar>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |journal=Dissent |volume=13 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=43–48 |author=Diesendorf, Mark |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archive-date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>

===Cleaning agents===
{{main|Environmental impact of cleaning agents}}
The environmental impact of [[cleaning agent]]s is diverse. In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.

===Nanotechnology===
{{main|Environmental impact of nanotechnology}}
[[Nanotechnology]]'s environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of [[nanomaterials]] will affect organisms and ecosystems.

===Paint===
{{main|Environmental impact of paint}}
The environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional [[painting]] materials and processes can have harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including those from the use of [[lead]] and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] ratings are some of the standards that can be applied.

===Paper===
{{main|Environmental impact of paper}}
[[File:PulpAndPaperMill.jpg|thumb|right|A pulp and paper mill in [[New Brunswick]], Canada. Although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy, a portion of it comes from burning wood waste.]]
The environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the [[printing press]] and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption and waste. With the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by [[environmental organization]]s and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards [[sustainability]] in the [[pulp and paper industry]].

===Pharmaceuticals===
{{main|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}

The environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is largely speculative. PPCPs are substances used by individuals for personal health or [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.<ref name="epa">U.S. EPA.

As well as the cost to human life and society, there is a significant environmental impact of war. [[Scorched earth]] methods during, or after war have been in use for much of recorded history but with modern [[technology]] war can cause a far greater devastation on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. [[Unexploded ordnance]] can render land unusable for further use or make access across it dangerous or fatal.<ref>see Gledistch, Nils (1997). Conflict and the Environment.

==Light pollution==
[[File:Earth at Night.jpg|thumb|right|A composite image of artificial light emissions from Earth at night]]
{{main|Ecological light pollution}}

Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere, and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher|last2=Garz|first2=Stefanie|last3=Kuechly|first3=Helga|last4=de Miguel|first4=Alejandro|last5=Zamorano|first5=Jaime|last6=Fischer|first6=Jürgen|last7=Hölker|first7=Franz|title=High-Resolution Imagery of Earth at Night: New Sources, Opportunities and Challenges|journal=Remote Sensing|date=23 December 2014|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.3390/rs70100001|bibcode=2014RemS....7....1K|doi-access=free}}</ref> The main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to light's use as an information source (rather than an energy source). The hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light, changing [[balance of nature|predator prey interactions]]. Artificial light also affects [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]], [[Animal navigation|orientation, migration]], and [[hormone]] levels, resulting in disrupted [[circadian rhythms]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hölker|first1=Franz|last2=Wolter|first2=Christian|last3=Perkin|first3=Elizabeth K.|last4=Tockner|first4=Klement|title=Light pollution as a biodiversity threat|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|date=December 2010|volume=25|issue=12|pages=681–682|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2010.09.007|pmid=21035893}}</ref>
