==== Warfare by stages ====
* [[First-generation warfare]] – refers to battles fought with massed manpower, using line and column tactics with uniformed soldiers governed by the state. It includes the earliest stages of organized, state-controlled armed forces waging war in the modern era.<ref name="4thGeneration">{{cite book|author1=Lind, William S. |author2=Nightingale, Keith |author3=Schmitt, John F. |author4=Sutton, Joseph W. |author5=Wilson, Gary I. | title=The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation| year=1989}}</ref>
* [[Second-generation warfare]] – tactics of warfare used after the invention of the rifled musket and breech-loading weapons and continuing through the development of the machine gun and indirect fire.<ref name="4thGeneration" />
* [[Third-generation warfare]] – focuses on using speed and surprise to bypass the enemy's lines and collapse their forces from the rear. Essentially, this was the end of linear warfare on a tactical level, with units seeking not simply to meet each other face to face but to outmaneuver each other to gain the greatest advantage.<ref name="4thGeneration" />
* [[Fourth-generation warfare]] – conflict characterized by a blurring of the lines between war and politics, soldier and civilian. It includes any war in which one of the major participants is not a state but rather a [[violent non-state actor]]. Fourth-generation warfare is characterized by the nation states' loss of their near-monopoly on combat forces, returning to modes of conflict common in pre-modern times.<ref name="4thGeneration" />

======Types of military operations======
Types of military operations, by scope:
* [[Theater (warfare)|Theater]] – operation over a large, often continental [[area of operation]] and represents a strategic national commitment to the conflict such as [[Operation Barbarossa]], with general goals that encompass areas of consideration outside of the military such as the economic and political impacts.
* [[Military campaign|Campaign]] – subset of the theatre operation, or a more limited geographic and operational strategic commitment such as [[Battle of Britain]], and need not represent total national commitment to a conflict, or have broader goals outside of the military impacts.
* [[Battle]] – subset of a campaign that will have specific military goals and geographic objectives, as well as clearly defined use of forces such as the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], which operationally was a [[combined arms]] operation originally known as the "Dardanelles landings" as part of the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]], where about 480,000 [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] troops took part.
* [[Engagement (military)|Engagement]] – tactical combat event of contest for specific area or objective by actions of distinct units. For example, the [[Battle of Kursk]], also known from its German designation as Operation Citadel, included many separate engagements, several of which were combined into the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]]. The "Battle of Kursk" in addition to describing the initial German offensive operation (or simply an offensive), also included two Soviet counter-offensive operations [[Operation Kutuzov]] and [[Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev]].
* [[Military strike|Strike]] – single [[Offensive (military)|attack]], upon a specified [[Targeting (warfare)|target]]. This often forms part of a broader engagement. Strikes have an explicit goal, such as, rendering facilities inoperable (e.g. [[airport]]s), to [[Assassination|assassinating]] enemy leaders, or to limit [[Military logistics|supply]] to enemy troops.

== Politics of war ==
* ''[[Casus belli]]'' – Latin expression meaning the justification for acts of war. In theory, present international law allows only three situations as legal cause to go to war: out of self-defense, defense of an ally under a mutual defense pact, or sanctioned by the UN.
* [[Declaration of war]]
* [[War effort]]
* [[War economy]]
* [[Surrender (military)|Surrender]]
** [[Capitulation (surrender)|Capitulation]] an agreement in time of war for the surrender to a hostile armed force of a particular body of troops, a town or a territory.
** Strategic surrender – surrender to avoid a last, chaotic round of fighting that would have the characteristics of a rout, allowing the victor to obtain his objective without paying the costs of a last battle.
** [[Unconditional surrender]] – surrender without conditions, except for those provided by international law.
* [[Victory]]
** [[Debellatio]] – when a war ends because of the complete destruction of a [[belligerent]] state.
** [[No quarter]] – when a victor shows no clemency or mercy and refuses to spare the life of the vanquished when they surrender at discretion. Under the laws of war "... it is especially forbidden ... to declare that no quarter will be given".
** [[Pyrrhic victory]] – victory with such a devastating cost that it carries the implication that another such victory will ultimately lead to defeat.

=== Philosophy of war ===
{{See also|Political philosophy}}

[[Philosophy of war]] – examines war beyond the typical questions of weaponry and strategy, inquiring into such things as the meaning and [[etiology]] of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the ethics of war.
* [[Militarism]] – belief that war is not inherently bad but can be a beneficial aspect of society.
* [[Realism in international relations|Realism]] – its core proposition is a skepticism as to whether moral concepts such as justice can be applied to the conduct of international affairs. Proponents of realism believe that moral concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a state's behaviour. Instead, a state should place an emphasis on state security and self-interest. One form of realism – descriptive realism – proposes that states cannot act morally, while another form – prescriptive realism – argues that the motivating factor for a state is self-interest. Just wars that violate Just Wars principles effectively constitute a branch of realism.
* [[Revolution]] and [[civil war|Civil War]] – Just War Theory states that a just war must have just authority. To the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government, this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war, in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of Just War Theory. This is less of a problem if the "just authority" is widely interpreted as "the will of the people" or similar. Article 3 of the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]] side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a High Contracting Party (in practice, the state recognised by the international community,) both Parties to the conflict are bound "as a minimum, the following [humanitarian] provisions." Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an "allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power."
* [[Moral absolutism|Absolutism]] – holds that there are various ethical rules that are absolute. Breaking such moral rules is never legitimate and therefore is always unjustifiable.
* [[Pacifism]] – belief that war of any kind is morally unacceptable or pragmatically not worth the cost. Pacifists extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to combatants, especially conscripts. For example, [[Ben Salmon]] believed all war to be unjust. He was sentenced to death during World War I (later commuted to 25 years hard labor) for desertion and spreading propaganda.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| url = http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}</ref>
* [[Right of self-defence]] – maintains (based on [[rational self-interest]]) that the use of retaliatory force is justified against repressive nations that break the [[zero aggression principle]]. In addition, if a free country is itself subject to foreign aggression, it is morally imperative for that nation to defend itself and its citizens by whatever means necessary. Thus, any means to achieve a swift and complete victory over the enemy is imperative. This view is prominently held by [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]].<ref>[http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2006-spring/just-war-theory.asp "'Just War Theory'" vs. American Self-Defence] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121209103857/http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2006-spring/just-war-theory.asp |date=2012-12-09 }}, by [[Yaron Brook]] and Alex Epstein</ref>
* [[Consequentialism]] – moral theory most frequently summarized in the words "the end justifies the means," which tends to support the just war theory (unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary, which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences).
