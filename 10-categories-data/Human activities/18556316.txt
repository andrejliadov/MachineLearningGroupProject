Additionally, paper money in other parts of the world show a similar drug contamination, and studies indicate that they might even serve as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of disease, though researchers disagree over how easily diseases are transmitted this way.

Several theories have been suggested to explain this contamination beyond the predictable contamination due to handling during drug deals and the use of rolled up notes for [[Insufflation (medicine)|snorting]] drugs. After the initial contamination, the substance is "infected to" other notes in close contact, often stacked together, in enclosed environments common in [[financial institution]]s.

==In the United States==

In a study reported in ''[[Forensic Science International]]'', A.J. Jenkins, at the Office of the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] Coroner ([[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland, OH]]), the author reports the analysis of ten randomly collected [[United States one-dollar bill|one-dollar bills]] from five cities, and tested for [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], [[6-Monoacetylmorphine|6-acetylmorphine]] (also called "6-AM"), [[morphine]], [[codeine]], [[methamphetamine]], [[amphetamine]] and [[Phencyclidine|phencyclidine (PCP)]]. Bills were then immersed in [[acetonitrile]] for two hours prior to extraction and subjected to [[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS) analysis. Results demonstrated that "92% of the bills were positive for cocaine with a mean amount of 28.75 ± 139.07 micrograms per bill, a [[median]] of 1.37 μg per bill, and a range of 0.01-922.72 μg per bill. Heroin was detected in seven bills in amounts ranging from 0.03 to 168.5 μg per bill: 6-AM and morphine were detected in three bills; methamphetamine and amphetamine in three and one bills, respectively, and PCP was detected in two bills in amounts of 0.78 and 1.87 μg per bill. Codeine was not detected in any of the one-dollar bills analyzed". The study confirmed that although paper currency was most often contaminated with cocaine, other drugs of abuse may also be detected in bills.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://cocaine.org/cokemoney/index.html |title=Drug contamination of US paper currency |accessdate=2008-07-26 |author=Jenkins AJ |date=1 October 2001 |work=Forensic Science Int. |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |doi=10.1016/s0379-0738(01)00401-7 |pmid=11566423 }}</ref><ref name="Jenk">{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Amanda J|title=Drug contamination of US paper currency|issue=3|pages=189–193|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=121|doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00401-7|date=October 2001|pmid=11566423}}</ref>

Another study, conducted at [[Argonne National Laboratory]], found that four out of five dollar bills in Chicago suburbs contain traces of cocaine. Previous studies have found similar contamination rates in other cities. But the Argonne study is the first to demonstrate that if you handle contaminated bills, you won't wind up with drugs on your hands. "It's virtually impossible for cocaine to rub off", Argonne chemist Jack Demirgian said.<ref>{{cite news |first= Jim|last=Ritter |title=4 out of 5 dollar bills show traces of cocaine |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=(4%20out%20of%205%20Dollar%20BilwerkdgrnkldgnkgrnljrsnjblHABLAHLBHLABLDNJLSNJls%20Show%20Traces%20of%20Cocaine)%20AND%20AND%20date(1/1/1997%20to%2010/1/1997)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=1/1/1997%20to%2010/1/1997)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(4%20out%20of%205%20Dollar%20Bills%20Show%20Traces%20of%20Cocaine)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=_rank_:D&xcal_ranksort=4&xcal_useweights=yes |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=26 March 1997 |accessdate=2008-07-23 }}</ref> This estimate of contamination could be as high as 94%, according to Bill and Rich Sones of the [[Chicago Sun-Times]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Bill|last= Sones|author2=Rich Sones |title=Most U.S. bills contaminated with traces of cocaine |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=(Most%20US%20Bills%20Contaminated%20with%20traces%20of%20Cocaine)%20AND%20date(10/1/1997%20to%2010/31/1998)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=10/1/1997%20to%2010/31/1998)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Most%20US%20Bills%20Contaminated%20with%20traces%20of%20Cocaine)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=_rank_:D&xcal_ranksort=4&xcal_useweights=yes |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=19 October 1997 |accessdate=2008-07-23 }}</ref>

This was confirmed by [[Ronald K. Siegel]] in his book, ''Intoxication: Life in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Siegal |first=Ronald |author-link=Ronald K.

Another study by the ''[[Journal of Analytical Toxicology]]'' is more conservative, noting a still substantial contamination of 80% of US currency by cocaine.<ref name="Oyl">{{Cite journal|last1=Oyler|display-authors=etal|first1=Jonathan|title=Cocaine Contamination of United States Paper Currency|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=213–216|doi=10.1093/jat/20.4.213|pmid=8835657|year=1996|doi-access=free}}</ref>

It was uncovered in the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]'' that while the initial source of the [[contamination]] comes from money used in the [[Illegal drug trade]] in [[List of circulating currencies|circulation]], the U.S. [[Federal Reserve]] unwittingly spreads the substance to clean currency by mixing the notes together.<ref>{{cite news |first= Michael|last=Wagner |title=Why There's Cocaine on Your Money |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SB&p_theme=sb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=(cocaine%20on%20your%20money)%20AND%20date(1994)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=1994&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(cocaine%20on%20your%20money)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=_rank_:D&xcal''_ranksort=4&xcal_useweights=yes |publisher=Sacramento Bee |date=16 November 1994 |accessdate=2008-07-23 }}</ref> The ''Journal of Analytical Toxicology'' confirms this assessment, noting that counting machines (in addition to simple proximity) are the agents of transfer.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Cocaine Contamination of United States Paper Currency |author=Jonathan Oyler |author2=William D.

The discovery that cocaine is so prevalent in U.S. banknotes has a legal application that reactions by [[Detection dog|drug-sniffing dogs]] is not immediately cause for arrest of persons or confiscation of banknotes. (The drug content is too low for prosecution but not too low to trigger response to drug-sniffing dogs.),<ref name="Egelko">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/01/25/MNGIMAVRML1.DTL|title=Supreme Court expands police search powers: Drug-sniffing dogs now have access to any car stopped |last=Egelko |first=Bob |date=25 January 2005 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle (online: SFGate) }}</ref> though this has been contested legally in a number of [[U.S. state]]s<ref name="Egelko"/> as a standard of what constitutes 'unusual' levels of contamination remains to be achieved (''see below'').

In addition to traces of illicit drugs, a recent study of currency within [[New York City]] have shown that various contagious microbes from skin and oral commensals are also transferred onto paper bank notes, including [[Cutibacterium acnes]], [[Staphylococcus epidermidis]] and [[Micrococcus luteus]].<ref name="Plos">{{cite journal|last1=Maritz|display-authors=etal|first1=Julia M.|title=Filthy lucre: A metagenomic pilot study of microbes found on circulating currency in New York City|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=12|issue=4|pages=e0175527|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0175527|pmid=28384336|pmc=5383295|year=2017}}</ref> Other microbes detected not associated with humans included [[Lactococcus lactis]] and [[Streptococcus thermophilus]], microbes typically associated with dairy production and fermentation. The study went on to prove that viable microbes could be isolated and cultured from paper currency. An earlier study conducted in western Ohio, in which "One-dollar bills were collected from the general community in western Ohio to survey for bacterial contamination. Pathogenic or potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated from 94% of the bills. These results suggest a high rate of bacterial contamination of one-dollar bills."<ref name="Pope">{{cite journal|last1=Pope|display-authors=etal|first1=TW|title=Bacterial contamination of paper currency.|journal=Southern Medical Journal|pmid=12597308|volume=95|issue=12|date=December 2002|pages=1408–10|doi=10.1097/00007611-200295120-00011|s2cid=8477487}}</ref>

==In the United Kingdom==
Forensic scientists have said that around 80% of all [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|British banknotes]] contain traces of drugs.<ref name="15m">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/10/drugsandalcohol.ukcrime |title=£15m of notes tainted by drugs are destroyed |accessdate=2008-07-27 |author=Tony Thompson |date=10 November 2002 |work=[[The Observer]] }}</ref> A 1999 study found even higher levels of contamination in the [[London]] area; of 500 notes tested, only four had no traces of cocaine.<ref name="Banknote">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/464200.stm|title=UK Banknotes tainted with cocaine |accessdate=2008-07-26 |date=4 October 1999 |work=BBC News }}</ref> Most of the banknotes showed only low levels of contamination, suggesting they had merely been in contact with contaminated notes, but 4% of the notes in the study showed higher levels, which the researchers suggested was the result of either being handled by people under the influence of cocaine (which is [[Excretion|excreted]] in skin oils), or by being used directly to snort the drug.<ref name="Banknote"/>

There are drug levels above which banknotes need to be taken out of circulation, and over £15 million worth of notes are destroyed annually for this reason. The destruction is more often done as a precaution than because the money poses a serious [[Health hazard#Public health|health hazard]].<ref name="15m"/>

Cocaine is the drug most commonly found on banknotes. Heroin and ecstasy are found less often, though the frequency of ecstasy contamination rose in the years leading up to 2002.<ref name="15m"/> Joe Reevy of Mass Spec Analytical, a company which analyses confiscated banknotes for the police, pointed out that heroin and ecstasy degrade more rapidly than cocaine, and that a single note which had been used to snort cocaine could subsequently contaminate many others when placed in a sorting machine, to explain the frequency of cocaine contamination.<ref name="15m"/>

Money recovered from police raids on the drugs trade are often heavily contaminated. In one raid in 2002, £465,000 was found which had been stored in a room where heroin was being prepared, and was so heavily contaminated that officers were advised not to touch it without protective equipment.<ref name="15m"/>

Prior studies<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Rapid screening of banknotes for the presence of controlled substances by thermal desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation tandem mass spectrometry |author1=Richard Sleeman |author2=I.

Subsequent tests have confirmed this determination, and serve as the basis for court cases against drug dealers, since the basic level of drug contamination remains fairly constant throughout the UK, despite factors that might immediately be thought to affect levels, like rural or urban environments, rich or poor or areas with high or low crime rates.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6993853.stm |title=Drug taint links cash to crime |accessdate=2008-07-26 |author=Rebecca Morelle |date=13 September 2007 |work=BBC News }}</ref>

===Hepatitis-C contamination===
The contamination of paper money is not limited to simply that of cocaine and other illicit drugs. Health officials in the UK warn that a silent [[Hepatitis-C]] epidemic could be brewing. Drug users with hepatitis who share with others the rolled paper note (or straw) used to snort cocaine can facilitate the transfer of the disease to thousands. As drug users are frequently impaired, they can easily fail to notice small traces of blood on these rolled banknotes.<ref name="LV">{{cite web |url=http://cocaine.org/cokemoney/banknotes.html |title='Shared banknote' health warning to cocaine users |accessdate=2008-07-26 |author=Laureen Veevers |date=1 October 2006 |work=The Observer }}</ref> This is considered to be of particular concern, as eight out of ten [[Asymptomatic carrier|carriers are unaware of their status]] (as hepatitis can lie dormant for decades), and have little in the way of access to regular healthcare <!--meaning unclear-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/971122496.html |title=Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Cocaine Users: A Silent Epidemic |accessdate=2008-07-26 |date=9 October 2001 |work=Healthlink MCW |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625035125/http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/971122496.html |archive-date=25 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This higher risk for contracting hepatitis-C has also been noted by the American [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consensus.nih.gov/1997/1997HepatitisC105html.htm

The British [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] estimates that there are over 200,000 people infected with hepatitis C in Britain, but the number might be much higher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1196942171852 |title='Hepatitis C in England: The Health Protection Agency Annual Report 2006 |accessdate=2008-07-26 |author=Andrea Mann |editor=Helen Harris |editor2=Mary Ramsay |date=December 2006 |work=Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102032129/http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1196942171852 |archive-date=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Charles Gore, the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, said: "Estimates show that around 5,000 new cases of hepatitis C are diagnosed every year - but they are mainly through chance. Because so many are undiagnosed we can't tell what kind of problem we are looking at. When 5,000 banknotes were tested in London in 2000, 99% of them had traces of cocaine on them. That tells us that there is potentially a massive problem in diagnosis and people's awareness of how easily hepatitis C can be contracted."<ref name="LV"/>

Professor Graham Foster, of [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], said: "Sharing banknotes or straws is a significant risk factor that people need to be more aware of. Although the risk of contracting hepatitis C through snorting is lower than through sharing a needle, it is still there."<ref name="LV"/>

==Elsewhere in the world==
The longevity of most modern currency has also given rise to various fallacies regarding the transmission of [[Biological agent|bacteriological agents]] with paper banknotes. In early 2003, [[China]] placed banknotes under quarantine amid fears that [[SARS]] could be spread by the notes. Notes were held for 24 hours—the presumed lifespan of the virus. No evidence indicates that banknotes were an infection vector in the 2002–2004 [[2002–2004 SARS outbreak|SARS outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/352750236X_c01.pdf |title= Money Magic |date= 2006-03-29 |accessdate= 2015-02-05 |publisher= [[Wiley-VCH]]}}</ref>

Contamination of bills is one factor that influenced [[Australia]] to introduce [[Polymer banknote|polymer banknotes]] for general circulation in 1992. Australia now also prints polymer currency for almost two dozen other countries, including [[Israel]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Romania]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}
