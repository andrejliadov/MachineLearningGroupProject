A strong relationship between '''the arts and politics''', particularly between various kinds of art and power, occurs across historical [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s and [[Archaeological culture|culture]]s.  As they respond to contemporaneous [[News|events]] and [[politics]], [[the arts]] take on political as well as social dimensions, becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as [[social change]].

A widespread observation is that a great [[skilled worker|talent]] has a free spirit. For instance [[Pushkin]], who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,<ref name="Nab81Censors">[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4</ref> attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he "instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."<ref name="Nab81Censors"/>

==History of art==
According to Groys, "[[Art]] has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics."<ref name="Groys">{{cite web |last=Groys |first=Boris |date=2009-03-16 |title=Art Power |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11408 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316070043/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11408 |archive-date=2009-03-16 |access-date=2009-07-16 |publisher=The MIT Press}}</ref><!--deadlink<ref name=Silver>[[Cf.]] Silver 11, as qtd. in [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0425/is_n2_v55/ai_18533947/pg_3 book rev.] by Graham: "Power attracts artists and in turn promotes the artists who succeed within that power structure."  Silver's "specific goal [is] … to present works of art with a greater depth of treatment and a more historical and contextual view of their audiences and cultures than most survey volumes", and Graham focuses particularly on the way that Silver "chose and organized his topics [in this textbook] to investigate relations between art and power."</ref>-->

=== Social and political change ===
Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the [[List of conflicts in the Middle East#Modern conflicts|Modern conflicts]] in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that "art is useless as a tool for political change."<ref name=Slackman> {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/19/world/middleeast/19lahhman.html?_r=1 |last=Slackman |first=Michael |title=An Arab Artist Says All the World Really Isn't a Stage |work=New York Times |date=19 August 2008 |access-date=2009-07-17 }}</ref> There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.

== Role of poetry ==

==Examples==
===Situationist International===
The [[Situationist International]] (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in [[Marxism]], [[Lettrism]] and the early 20th-century European artistic and political [[avant-garde]]s formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the [[Second Situationist International]], the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an [[anti-capitalist]] and [[surrealist]] perspective on [[aesthetics]] and politics, according to Italian art historian [[Francesco Poli]].{{sfn|Poli|2006|p=63}}

In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in [[revolutionary]] terms.{{sfn|Bandini|1999|p=408}}

Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals.{{or?|date=July 2020}} That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural [[dichotomies]] as the "separation of art from politics". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the [[official culture]] and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of [[The Society of the Spectacle|the society of the spectacle]].{{sfn|McDonough|2004|p=29}}

===Poster art===
"Not content with claiming [[Left-wing politics|leftwing]] music", posters for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the UK recycled iconic art styles of "[[Socialism|socialist]] revolution" to communicate its political message in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/01/politicsandthearts.conservatives |last=Harris |first=John |title=Tory posters are now ripping off the iconography of socialist revolution |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=1 October 2008 |access-date=2009-07-17}}</ref>

===''Entropa''===
Czech [[sculptor]] [[David Černý]]'s ''[[Entropa]]'', a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the [[European Council|European Union Council]] during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7827738.stm |title=Czech EU art stokes controversy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC

This "Europe-wide [[hoax]] … reveals deeper truths" not only about the countries but "about art itself" (Gavrilova).

===Russian aesthetics===
According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the [[University of Edinburgh]], in her book ''Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich'', in "the traditional Russian perception of the arts", an "interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion" (ix; [[cf.]] Blois).

===Classical music===
[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] did not use the original title "Ode to Freedom" of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s [[lyric poem|lyric]], known in English as "[[Ode to Joy]]" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (1824), which "[[Napoleon]]ic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'."<ref name=VanGelder>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/26/books/footlights.html |title=Footlights: Indoor Activity

===Folk and protest music===

In February 1952, the [[United States Customs Service]] seized the passport of [[Paul Robeson]], preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]], in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada; but, after "The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone", the union organized "a concert on the US-Canada border".<ref name="Robeson">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630074624/http://www.cpsr.cs.uchicago.edu/robeson/peacearch.html

He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you—all of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' … [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of [[Ol' Man River|Old Man River]], written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others."<ref name="Robeson"/>

In the 1960s the songs of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and others protested further [[racism]], war, and the [[military-industrial complex]], continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial era]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/american_renaissance/Protest%20Music2.htm |title=Protest Music |publisher=Sam Houston State University |access-date=2009-07-17 |last= Frank Hoffmann, modified for the web by Robert Birkline }}</ref>

===Restrictions on live-music venues===
====In the United States====
In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a [[Draco (lawgiver)#"Draconian"|Draconian]] "anti-music law", the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in [[Seattle]], Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in [[United States Federal Courts|U.S. Federal Court]] in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated.<ref>

====In the United Kingdom====
{{See|Licensing Act 2003#Impact on live music}}
Following the implementation of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], the [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] cited "the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism" as reasons for expecting promoters of [[live music]] events to complete the [[Metropolitan Police]]'s [[Form 696]].<ref>

However all musical performances – from one man playing a guitar on up – are subject to the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the venue'. ... UK Music chief [[Feargal Sharkey]] ... speaking to the [[Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee|Department of Culture Media and Sport]]'s hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of [[terrorism]]'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Met]]'s clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such [[Risk Assessment]]s would be processed this year.
