{{Short description|School punishment}}
A '''demerit''' is a point given to a student as a penalty for bad behavior.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rosen|first=Louis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FBOAwAAQBAJ&q=Demerit+(school+discipline)&pg=PA38|title=School Discipline: Best Practices for Administrators|date=2005-02-01|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=978-1-4833-6139-0|language=en}}</ref> Under this once common practice, a student is given a number of merits during the beginning of the [[school term]] and a certain number of merits are deducted for every [[infraction]] committed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=School Discipline: Best Practices for Administrators, Second Edition|last=Rosen|first=Louis|date=2005|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=1412913489|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=38}}</ref>

Schools use the demerit record within a point-based system to punish [[misbehavior]]. After a certain number of demerits are accumulated, the student is given [[School detention|detention]], loss of privileges (e.g. being denied field trips and participation in school events), or some other punishment<ref>https://discover.randolphschool.net/blog/k12/2015/08/28/the-demise-of-the-demerit</ref><ref>https://www.riverdale.k12.wi.us/middle/demerit-system.cfm</ref> based on the seriousness and frequency of the infraction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave International Handbook of School Discipline, Surveillance, and Social Control|last1=Deakin|first1=Jo|last2=Taylor|first2=Emmeline|last3=Kupchik|first3=Aaron|date=2018|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9783319715582|location=|pages=179}}</ref> Some schools allow demerits to be offset with merits for good behavior.<ref>https://d2y1pz2y630308.cloudfront.net/1412/documents/2017/6/MS_Policies%20and%20Procedures.pdf</ref>

One criticism of demerit systems is that they create [[bookkeeping]] problems and can result in students receiving severe punishments for minor infractions.<ref>https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1997-02-12-3133262-story.html</ref> Another criticism is that older [[Adolescence|adolescents]] learn how to manipulate a demerit system.<ref>{{cite book|title=School Discipline: Best Practices for Administrators|author=Louis Rosen}}</ref> There are also critics who cite that demerits wear parents down with constant parental meetings and leave students behind due to missed instructional time as a consequence of punishments such as detention and suspension.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Choosing Charters: Better Schools or More Segregation?|last1=Rotberg|first1=Iris C.|last2=Glazer|first2=Joshua L.|date=2018|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807759004|location=New York|pages=74}}</ref>
