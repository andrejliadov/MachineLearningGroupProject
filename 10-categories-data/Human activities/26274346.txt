'''Aggressionism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] that the only real [[philosophy of war|cause of war]] is human aggression, which refers to the "general tendency to attack members of one's species."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |author=Alexander Moseley |title=A Philosophy of War |publisher=Algora Publishing |page=78 |date=2002 |isbn=978-1-892941-94-7}}</ref>  It is argued that aggression is a natural response to defend vital interests such as territory, family, or identity if threatened.<ref name=":0" /> This theory has dominated much [[History of evolutionary thought|evolutionary thought]] about [[human nature]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Signe Howell |authorlink=Signe Howell |author2=Roy G.

Many [[evolutionary biologist]]s discount aggressionism as it promotes [[human extinction]] through [[war]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Human Prehistory in Fiction|last=de Paolo|first=Charles|publisher=McFarland & company, Inc., Publishers|year=2002|isbn=9780786414178|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=87}}</ref> The idea is that if homicide was the norm, the human species would have wiped itself out  millions of years ago.<ref name=":1" /> There is also the claim that aggression is not a universal instinct in the animal kingdom. However, some sources note that aggression serves the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] well since it brings the balanced distribution of animals of the same species over the available environment and that it can be viewed as a universal, externally directed drive that is possibly connected to a [[Self-preservation|survival instinct]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Talking to the Shaman Within|last=de Vries|first=Manfred|publisher=iUniverse|year=2014|isbn=9781491730355|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=101}}</ref>

== Concept ==
The concept of aggressionism is based on the [[root word]] "[[aggression]]." In this particular [[concept]], [[aggression]] occurs in all [[species]] as a form of [[Parental care|protection of their own]] or of their [[Territory (animal)|territory]] in order to keep their young safe. However, though most species protect against their predators, some also protect from their own. For example, lions are very territorial and fight other grown, male lions to keep their status as the alpha. Similar to humans, if an invader attacks, human [[instinct]] leads them to defend oneself and fend them off. When necessary, for the sake of [[Survival of the fittest|survival]], most species become aggressive to get food to survive. Yet, aggressionism isn't the same as aggression. Aggressionism is the concept of aggression particularly made for humans, as it is more complex than simply wanting to survive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Georgiev|first=Alexander V.|last2=Klimczuk|first2=Amanda C.

Aggressionism specifies [[human nature]] in its [[Hostility|hostile]] form when [[Ideology|ideologies]] of multiple humans do not coincide with each other. However, the form of hostility that humans convey isn't direct in terms of [[Street fighting|street fights]]. This form of aggression directs humans in a composed manner between the leaders of [[nation]]s or [[organization]]s in which leads to war. In this [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspective]], the hostility is contained due to the persons having [[respect]] in each other. Rather than being savage like animals, humans use their [[intellect]] to defeat their opponent in war—therefore, placing [[pride]], [[greed]], and [[belief]] in their own [[skill]] to lead their nation to victory. Before a war starts, there is always disagreement between the leaders. Never is there a leader raging at the other. Calmly, they would always say that it is unfortunate that the two nations disagree and would go back to their respective countries to declare war.

== Cause of War ==
Although it has been directly stated, that aggressionism is a philosophy theory that humans are the cause of war, there are more direct reasons for conflicts to escalate to war. Aggressionism is a theory that describes complex behavior of human nature that involves strong beliefs in one's own ideology. It is a description of people who cannot see the views of others and would only see their own as the only right one in the world. Throughout history, there have been a number of people who were like this and had caused war.[[File:Adolf Hitler cropped restored.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler|174x174px]]

=== Examples of Political Leaders Who Displayed Aggressionism ===
[[Adolf Hitler]] is a primary example of a person who displayed aggressionism. In his time of [[reign]], he installed a government that practiced [[fascism]] which is a form of [[statism]]. This type of government is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism. This type of nation is ruled by [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] power with overwhelming control over all the aspects of the country including the [[economy]], [[society]], and its beliefs. Hitler had a strong belief that the [[Jews|Jewish]] were in fact, the cause of Germany's loss in [[World War I|WWI]] causing his ideology to circulate around a hate for the Jewish people. Therefore, his aggressionism had started to take form in war through the initial [[invasion of Poland]].

[[File:Joseph Stalin, 1912.jpg|thumb|Joseph Stalin|180x180px]]

[[Joseph Stalin]] is another example that also displayed aggressionism. However, Stalin's aggressionism instead was more subtle than Hitler's. Stalin believed that with his dictatorial power, he would be able to bring Russia in its time out of its [[Famines in Russia and the USSR|famine]] and spread his ideology of communism towards the rest of the world. During Stalin's reign, he transformed Russia to "an industrial and military superpower." He had created programs to boost the food supply and boost its economy, however this had killed millions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/joseph-stalin|title=Joseph Stalin - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> After [[World War II|WWII]], the Soviet Union and the US had become superpowers and tension grew between these countries which started the [[Cold War]]. To gain advantage over the other, Stalin attempted to spread [[communism]] towards other states, countries, and nations. Thus, the subtle aggressionism. Unlike Hitler, he had helped spread his ideologies to other leaders, including China's [[Mao Zedong]].

== Source of Aggressionism ==
In both of the examples of aggressionism, there are [[instinct|basic natures]] of human beings that cause their ideologies to take form. With Hitler, he had displayed his overwhelming hate for the Jewish due to his nationalism for Germany. One of the more basic forms of emotion is hate, which was the source of his aggression towards the millions of Jewish who were killed during the Holocaust. The cause of war was due to his inhumane actions towards a specific group of people. Therefore, his unreasonable action for killing people, thinking that he has the right to do so, is one of the most lethal forms of aggression. For Stalin, he had created a country through is dictatorship with the ideology of communism. He had aggressed his beliefs upon his own people with his plans of creating a country that would be seen as a military superpower. He had caused many to die with the famine and plan to boost agriculture. However, the source for this action was due to the fact that he believed in his ideology of [[Marxism]]/[[Leninism]].
