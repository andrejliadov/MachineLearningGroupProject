{{short description|Misrepresenting a person's age}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2018}}
'''Age fabrication''' occurs when a person deliberately misrepresents his or her true age. This is usually done with the intention to garner privileges or [[Social status|status]] that would not otherwise be available to that person (i.e., a minor misrepresenting their age in order to garner the privileges given to adults). It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of [[vital records]].

On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in showbusiness or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as [[publicist]]s, parents, and other handlers.  Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] and [[Charo]], a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage license|marriage]] and [[death certificate]]s, the census, and other [[identity document]]s) typically provide the correct date.

Although uncommon in modern [[Western society]], it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth which after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual.

Subtracting time from one's age is often known in English as "shaving", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as "napping".

*American golfer [[Tom Shaw (golfer)|Tom Shaw]] claimed throughout his career on the [[PGA Tour]] to have been born on December 13, 1942. He was suspected by some of being older, notably by Frank Hannigan, who as Executive Director of the [[United States Golf Association]] paired him with the then-19-year-old [[Ben Crenshaw]] and 24-year-old [[Johnny Miller]], both known as fast players, for the first two rounds of the [[1971 U.S. Open (golf)|1971 U.S. Open]] for his apparent amusement. As it turned out, Hannigan was right; in 1988, Shaw produced a birth certificate proving that he had been born on the same date in 1938, which made him eligible for the Senior PGA Tour (now [[PGA Tour Champions]]) starting with the 1989 season.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Majors: In Pursuit of Golf's Holy Grail |first=John |last=Feinstein |author-link=John Feinstein |isbn=978-0-316-27795-2 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=Boston |year=2000 |page=[https://archive.org/details/majorsinpursuito00john/page/199 199] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/majorsinpursuito00john/page/199 }}</ref>

==In the entertainment industry==

Age fabrication is common in the entertainment industry. Many actresses subtract at least one year from their actual age so that producers and casting directors will be more likely to hire them for roles, or for publicity purposes. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' joked in 1949:{{r|time19490822}}

{{quote|To find the age of a star, a Hollywood [[press agent|press-agent]] takes the year of her (or his) birth, subtracts it from itself, and burns the paper the numbers were written on; then adds last week's fan mail to the [[box office|box-office receipts]] from the star's last picture, subtracts her salary, divides the remainder by the number of press agents assigned to care for her career, subtracts the number of her marriages, adds three months for every child she has had (things grow fast in the sub tropics), and knocks off ten years just for gallantry. If the age is still higher than the one the boss ordered, he works in slight mathematical errors until the answer comes out right.<ref name="time19490822">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,800624,00.html | title=Elizabeth Taylor: Star Rising | accessdate=March 23, 2011 | date=August 22, 1949 |work=Time}}</ref>}}

===Actors===
*[[Gracie Allen]], comedian, was notorious for keeping her true age concealed and even her husband [[George Burns]] did not know her exact age. Various sources claim she was born on July 26 in 1894, 1895, 1897, 1902 or 1906. Her exact age could not be retrieved by a birth certificate, as it was destroyed in the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Allen herself gave her year of birth as 1906, despite the fact the earthquake occurred three months before her birthday that year. When the 1900 [[United States Census]] became public information, the true year was revealed as 1895, which meant she was actually a few months older than her husband.<ref name="fn_1">{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/index.htm |title=Ancestry of Gracie Allen |publisher=Genealogy.com |date=July 18, 2002 |accessdate=August 2, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503085054/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/gracie-allen/d0/i0000001.htm#s1 |archive-date=May 3, 2012 }}</ref>
*[[Sandra Bullock]]'s birthdate was erroneously given as July 26 in 1965, 1966, and 1967 for most of her early career. In 1997, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' discovered that the correct year was 1964.
*[[Irene Cara]]'s exact age was a mystery for most of her career, with various sources claiming that she was born on March 18 in either 1964 or 1959. In 2004, the [[Associated Press]] retrieved a copy of her voter registration records from Florida, which verified that she was actually born in 1959. Cara vehemently claimed that she was born in 1964, but refused to comment on the voter registration records.
*[[Charo]] is often accused of trimming 10 years from her age. In 1977, a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] federal district court allowed Charo's claim that she was born in 1951 and that her March 13, 1941 birth date on her original Spanish birth certificate, passport, and American naturalization papers was incorrect based on affidavits submitted by Charo's parents, a claim that has been viewed with skepticism.<ref>[http://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jul/20/playful-and-ageless-charo-sultry-sensation-still/ "Playful and ageless, Charo a sultry sensation still"], ''Las Vegas Sun'', July 20, 2009</ref> The same judge who permitted Charo to change her legal age issued a near-identical order finding that Charo's older sister Carmen Martinez Molina was 29, not 40 as stated in her Spanish passport.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19771110&id=EIBIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OW0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7006,1824348&hl=en "Charo, Sister 'Younger'"] ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', November 10, 1977</ref> That order was similarly premised on affidavits submitted by Carmen's parents, who claimed that Carmen was 11 years younger than stated in all Spanish public records.

Day had attempted to explain the discrepancy, saying that as a young woman she pretended to be two years older so she could sing with big bands. However, US census records show that she was 7 years old on April 1, 1930, and 18 years old on April 10, 1940, indicating that she was born in 1922. One day before her birthday in 2017, she admitted that she was about to turn 95 not 93, after the [[Associated Press]] obtained a copy of her birth certificate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/only-ap-birthday-surprise-doris-day-shes-really-173100422.html |title=Birthday Surprise for Ageless Doris Day: She's Actually 95 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo! |date=April 2, 2017 |accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref>
*[[Alexa Demie]]'s age is a current subject of debate.

*[[Toni Tennille]], half of the husband-and-wife duo [[Captain & Tennille]], born May 8, 1940, was encouraged by [[A&M Records|her record label]] to shave five years off her age because the label was concerned that a 35-year-old starting a recording career would be seen as unusual. She compromised by using 1943 as her birth year, which has appeared in numerous sources. Tennille herself corrected the error in a 2006 entry on her blog, in which she also confirmed that she had married her musical partner [[Daryl Dragon]] on November 11, 1975, instead of February 14 in the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://captainandtennille.net/tonis-take_blog_06.htm |title=Toni's Take: Toni's Thoughts on Life, Music and Whatever… |author=Toni Tennille |website=CaptainandTennille.net |date=June 17, 2006 |accessdate=November 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223165101/http://www.captainandtennille.net/tonis-take_blog_06.htm |archive-date=December 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }} (scroll down to June 17, 2006, entry)</ref>

== Online and social media ==
Many websites and online services ban children under 13-years-old from joining their platforms in compliance with the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], a U.S. federal law which prohibits website operators under U.S. jurisdiction from collecting personal information about children under age 13 without parental consent. To avoid the ban, many children under 13 falsify their age in order to sign-up to use those websites, many with the help of an adult.<ref name="TNYT281112">{{cite news |last1=Sengupta |first1=Somini |title=For Children, a Lie on Facebook Has Consequences, Study Finds |url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/for-children-a-lie-on-facebook-has-consequences-study-finds/ |work=The New York TImes |date=28 November 2012}}</ref> It is estimated that around 5 million [[Facebook]] users are under the age of 13.<ref name="TNYT281112"/>

=== Politics ===
*[[Joseph Stalin]], born December 18 (December 6 [[Julian calendar|OS]]), 1878, changed the date to December 21, 1879, later in his life for unknown reasons. The December 18, 1878, birth date is maintained by his birth registry, his school leaving certificate, his extensive tsarist Russia police file, and all other surviving pre-revolution documents. Russian playwright and historian Edward Radzinski argues in his book, ''Stalin'', that Stalin changed the year to 1879 to have a national birthday celebration of his 50th birthday. He could not do it in 1928 because his rule was not absolute enough. The incorrect December 21, 1879, date was printed in many almanacs and encyclopedias during Stalin's reign and remains one of the most widely reported incorrect dates of birth.<ref>[http://www.classicalvalues.com/archives/001189.html When was Stalin born?].

*[[Eva Perón]], born May 7, 1919, had her birth certificate altered to 1922 after becoming First Lady of Argentina. She made herself seem to be younger and also to appear that her parents had been married when she was born.<ref>''Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron'' by Nicholas Fraser and Maryssa Navarro</ref>
*[[Gary Hart]], former senator from Colorado and 1984 and 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, originally claimed in campaign and Senate biographies that he was born on November 28, 1937, when in fact he was one year older exactly, this fact unearthed after he briefly overtook Walter Mondale as the party front-runner in the 1984 primary race. This among other things (his name change from Hartpence mainly) would be a nagging source of controversy throughout his national political career.

*While official records of film producer [[S. S. Vasan]] show his date of birth as March 10, 1903, according to his family he was actually born on January 4, 1904. Film historian [[Randor Guy]] suggested in 2003 that, as with many families in that period, Vasan's date of birth could have been deliberately fabricated to help in his school admission. The 1903 date of birth entered Vasan's [[SSLC]] book, and has remained his official date of birth since,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2003/05/23/stories/2003052301510600.htm |title=With a finger on people's pulse |last=Guy |first=Randor |date=23 May 2003 |website=The Hindu |access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> although a postage stamp of him was released in 2004 to commemorate his centenary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2004/08/27/stories/2004082702091300.htm|title=The Hindu : Tamil Nadu News : Stamp on S.S.
