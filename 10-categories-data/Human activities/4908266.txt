The '''Neptune Memorial Reef''' is an underwater [[columbarium]] in what was conceived by the creator as  the world's largest man-made [[reef]] (covering over {{convert| 600,000 |ft2|m2}} of ocean floor) at a depth of {{convert|40|ft}} ).<ref>{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Les|title=Florida's Exclusive Underwater Burial Ground|url=http://www.publicnewsservice.org/index.php?/content/article/24571-1|publisher=Public News Service -FL|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>  It was originally conceived by [[Gary Levine]] and designed by artist [[Kim Brandell]] and known as the '''Atlantis  Reef Project''' or the '''Atlantis Reef'''<ref name="ptn">{{cite news|url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/21903|title=Atlantis Reef Project Announces Partnership with Neptune Society|date=2007-03-09|work=The California Chronicle|accessdate=2009-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708112424/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/21903|archive-date=2011-07-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>  As of 2012, the Reef occupies a half-acre space, but a planned expansion {{convert|16|acres}} is underway. The city design involves underwater roads leading to a central feature with benches and statuary. 

The place was chosen at 3.25 miles (5.2 km)<!--if you can determine accurately what these "statute miles" are, then you can remove one of the conversions--> off the coast of [[Key Biscayne]], [[Florida]]. It is a type of [[burial at sea]] and the first phase is estimated to be able to accommodate 850 remains,<ref name="abcn">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/wireStory?id=4837294|title=Artificial Reef Near Miami Is Cemetery, Diving Attraction|last=Orkin Emmanuel|first=Lisa|date=2008-05-12|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2009-03-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> with an eventual goal of more than 125,000 remains.<ref name="gfn">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/12/conservation.usa?gusrc=rss&feed=travel|title= Watery graves offer a haven for divers|last=Orkin Emmanuel|first=Lisa|date=2008-05-12|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-07}}</ref> Though often referred to in news articles as an underwater mausoleum or underwater cemetery, the Neptune Society Memorial Reef meets the criterion for neither. Cremated remains are mixed with cement to form features of the Reef, and memorial plaques are added.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrigan|first=Stephen|title=Artificial Reefs|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/02/artificial-reefs/harrigan-text/1|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>  The Reef is more correctly identified as a cremation memorial site.

The man-made reef, located three miles (5 km) off the coast of Florida's Key Biscayne, opened in 2007 after a number of difficulties, including permits.<ref name="LaTimes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/12/nation/na-cremation-reef12|title=Off Florida, a cemetery under the sea|last=Nolin|first=Robert |date=2009-07-12|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref> After an extensive evaluation and permitting process, the Atlantis Reef Project has been permitted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], DERM, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], [[Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission|Florida Fish and Wildlife]], and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]]. One of the construction requirements was that the Memorial Reef be built to withstand the strongest storm in the last 100 years. During the permitting process, [[Hurricane Andrew]], a category 5 hurricane swept through, requiring a re-engineering of the Reef.

The reef stretches across {{convert|16|acre|m2}} of ocean floor designed as both a home for sea life and "a destination for divers".<ref name="LaTimes"/> The Neptune Memorial Reef lies in a special management zone.{{cn|date=November 2014}} Boaters and divers are welcome, but no fishing or lobster-taking is allowed. Now that reef-building coral have developed at the site, the Reef can be properly identified as a coral reef.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

The Neptune Memorial Reef is actively working the site and is currently expanding.  There was a major addition to the site placed on {{clarify|text=7/2/2018.|date=February 2020|reason=Ambiguous date format, see MOS:BADDATE}}
