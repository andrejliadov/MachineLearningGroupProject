'''''El Monstruo''''' ('''''{{lang-en|The Monster}}''''') is the popular designation given in [[Chile]] to the audience attending [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]]. The name is due to the great authority of the audience in each day of the event. From pressing to lengthen presentations favorite artists to interruptions with catcalls to singers and comedians who are not talented or funny,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070207/pags/20070207194822.html |title = Humor: el plato favorito del "monstruo" |date= 8 February 2007|access-date = 6 October 2008 |work = [[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]}}</ref> booing to prevent them to complete their show and force them to step off from the stage. In that case, in Chile it is said that "''El Monstruo'' ate the artist".

The audience at  Viña del Mar International Song Festival is the only one in the world that has received a special name. This creates an expectation in people attending the show, waiting for the slightest opportunity to show their intolerance. Most artists booed by ''El Monstruo'' have been comedians, both for being unfunny or by the misfortune to get on the stage right between performances of singers or bands of renown.

Sometimes, however, the public has manifested catcalls to protest the presenters of the event. This happened in the 2007 edition, when the hosts, [[Tonka Tomicic]] and [[Sergio Lagos]], dismissed the artist [[Ana Torroja]] to the crowd surprise, it wanted her to keep singing.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/408691.html |title = Despierta Ana Torroja al Monstruo de Viña del Mar |work= [[El Universal (México)|El Universal]] |date = 24 February 2007 |access-date = 6 October 2008}}</ref> The spectators booing to Lagos and Tomicic lasted nearly an hour. The same happened in 2009 when ''El Monstruo'' was in favor of [[Simply Red]], booing for an hour for the group to return, and incidentally interrupting the ''Folk Competition'', the singer [[Paolo Meneguzzi]], a humorous routine performed by the trio ''Manpoval'' until they partially calmed their minds with the presentation of [[Rakim and Ken-Y]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terra.cl/entretencion/especiales/2009/verano/index.cfm?seccion=vina_aldia&id_reg=1131113&id_cat=3067 |title=Meneguzzi vive su hora más difícil ante un Monstruo embravecido |work=[[Terra Networks|Terra.cl]] |date=27 February 2009 |access-date=27 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228103657/http://www.terra.cl/entretencion/especiales/2009/verano/index.cfm?seccion=vina_aldia&id_reg=1131113&id_cat=3067 |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

A memorable occasion happened when ''El Monstruo'' asked the ''[[Gaviota (award)|Gaviota de Plata]]'' for [[José Luis Rodríguez (singer)|José Luis Rodríguez]] in 1988; the refusal of the mayor of Viña del Mar, Eugenia Garrido, who in the 1980s was who corroborated the awards, the singer said: "''Sometimes the people's voice must be heard!''", a phrase which some thought that had a political background in relation to the military regime that was ruling the country; the artist has said that his sentence was not thought out or had a direct political intention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacuarta.cl/diario/2007/07/07/07.23.4a.ESP.puma.html|title=El "Puma" se sacó contumelia en "Primer Plano"|work=La Cuarta|date=7 July 2007|access-date=21 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015134329/http://lacuarta.cl/diario/2007/07/07/07.23.4a.ESP.puma.html|archivedate=15 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The most recent manifestation of this phenomenon was in [[2017 Viña del Mar International Song Festival|the edition of 2017]], during the presentation of the Chilean singer [[Mon Laferte]], who was nicknamed "the woman who woke ''El Monstruo''". She achieved one of the greatest ovations of [[Quinta Vergara]] for a Chilean artist living in another country, as well as causing chaos and booing towards the animators and the organization of the event, due to the denial of these to award her the ''[[Gaviota (award)|Gaviota de Platino]]''. This award recognizes the career of great artists; and only had been granted to the Mexican singer [[Luis Miguel]] in 2012 and to the Spanish singer [[Isabel Pantoja]] in the same version of the contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.24horas.cl/tendencias/festival-de-vina-del-mar-2017/noticias/desperto-el-monstruo-fin-del-show-de-mon-laferte-desato-la-furia-del-publico-de-vina-2312539|title=Despertó el Monstruo: fin del show de Mon Laferte desató la furia del público de Viña|work=24 Horas.cl|date=26 February 2017|access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> Given the situation, the host of the festival [[Carolina de Moras]] commented in an interview: "She took a much bigger prize, she took the real ovation of La Quinta Vergara and the ''Platino'' can not pay that". The general director of the show, Alex Hernández, also commented, "At that moment I felt that ''El Monstruo'' was something wonderful, I found a wonderful television moment in which it was happening". Hernandez also explained the reason why it was decided not to deliver a second ''Gaviota de Oro'' to the artist to replace the ''Gaviota de Platino'': "We did not deliver it simply because we did not wanted to set a precedent that later could cost us double ''Gaviotas'' with many artists".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/Espectaculos/2017/02/26/846809/Alex-Hernandez-y-pifias-por-el-fin-del-show-de-Mon-Laferte-Fue-un-momento-televisivo-maravilloso.html|title=Alex Hernandez y pifias por el fin del show de Mon Laferte: "Fue un momento televisivo maravilloso"|work=Emol|date=26 February 2017|access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref>

== Explanation of the phenomenon ==

The possible reason for the existence of ''El Monstruo'' is over-dimensioned quality public festival to voice their catcalls heavily and for a long time. This is because the place and time of its completion, the [[Quinta Vergara Amphitheater]] (located on top of a small hill) and at night, provides a level of noise from the stands to the very large stage, even the whistling of a single person can be heard.

In addition, the gallery is very high in relation to the orchestra, which makes the audience look like a huge mountain of people from stage, simulating to be a semi-coliseum capable of holding 15,000 people in it.

== List of ousted artists ==
Some of the artists that the public of Viña del Mar International Song Festival has prevented from completing their stage show, but there are others that have been split by ''El Monstruo'', that is, some people were booing and other cheering, and others amazingly have managed to silence them.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lacuarta.cl/sitios/humorvina/humor3.htm |title = Pifiados y engullidos |work = [[La Cuarta]] |access-date = 6 October 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081203053439/http://www.lacuarta.cl/sitios/humorvina/humor3.htm |archivedate = 3 December 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>
