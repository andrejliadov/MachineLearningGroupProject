The '''45×90 points''' are the four points on [[Earth]] which are halfway between the [[geographical pole]]s, the [[equator]], the [[Prime Meridian]], and the [[180th meridian]].

==45°N, 90°W==
The best-known and most frequently visited such point is {{coord|45|0|0|N|90|0|0|W}} which is located on land at {{convert|1345|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} above sea level in the town of [[Rietbrock, Wisconsin]] near the unincorporated community of [[Poniatowski, Wisconsin|Poniatowski]].  An incorrect geographic marker was placed there by the [[Marathon County, Wisconsin|Marathon County]] Park Commission, but in 2017, it was removed and relocated to the actual location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/45-x-90-geographical-marker|title=45 X 90 Geographical Marker|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref> It re-opened September 12, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2FyYTJucm9pZnNiMGQ3ZGVjMTM1ZjAyNzIyZjlfQ2FtZXJhWk9PTS0yMDE3MDcwMjEyMzYzNzU3OV9jb3B5LmpwZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwieDM5MD4iXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il1d/CameraZOOM-20170702123637579_copy.jpg&imgrefurl=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/45-x-90-geographical-marker&docid=Uff-hl9HleZk0M&tbnid=CMlZT2G8oL2RhM:&vet=1&w=693&h=390&source=sh/x/im|title=Redirect Notice|website=images.google.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref>

The point has become something of a pop culture phenomenon thanks to Gesicki's Tavern in the tiny cluster of establishments in Poniatowski.<ref name="gesicki">{{cite web|first=Bill |last=Hart |title=Gesicki, John Raymond |url=http://www.marathoncountyhistory.org/PeopleDetails.php?PeopleId=778 |publisher=Marathon County Historical Society |accessdate=24 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062527/http://www.marathoncountyhistory.org/PeopleDetails.php?PeopleId=778 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They once sold 45×90 [[T-shirt]]s and registered visitors as members of the "45x90 Club".<ref name="gesicki"/> Since 2006, the Wausau/Central Wisconsin Convention & Visitors Bureau has been the holder of the official "45x90 Club" registration book.

==45°N, 90°E==
The only other 45×90 point located on land is {{coord|45|0|0|N|90|0|0|E}}, which is at an elevation of {{convert|3311|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} above sea level. This point is located in a desolate region of the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] of [[China]], near the [[Mongolia]]n border, approximately {{convert|240|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Ürümqi]]. Administratively, it is on the border of [[Qitai County|Qitai]] and [[Qinggil County|Qinggil]] Counties. Greg Michaels, an American, and Ru Rong Zhao, a taxi driver from the closest town of [[Qitai County|Qitai]], itself 110&nbsp;km to the south-southwest, visited this point on April 13, 2004 and documented the visit on the [[Degree Confluence Project]].<ref>{{cite web|title=45°N 90°E|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?id=6993|publisher=[[Degree Confluence Project]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=13 April 2004}}</ref> Their visit found no monument or any physical recognition of the status and documented that the nearest community to the site documented on maps, [[Jiangjunmiao]], had long since been abandoned.

==45°S, 90°E==
[[File:MH370_SIO_search.png|thumb|400px|The search for [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]] was near the coordinate 45°S, 90°E. The coordinate is closest to the red dot labeled as [[Gaofen 1]] at the bottom, halfway between the center and left side of the image.]]

Located in the southern [[Indian Ocean]], {{coord|45|0|0|S|90|0|0|E}} has an ocean floor depth of {{convert|10,489|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below sea level and is {{convert|773|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southeast of the nearest uninhabited island of [[Île Saint-Paul]], {{convert|920|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Elephant Spit]] on [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands|Heard Island]], {{convert|975|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} east north east of [[Port aux Français]] in the [[Kerguelen Islands]], {{convert|1507|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north of [[Antarctica]], {{convert|1521|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southwest of the closest inhabited land of [[Augusta, Western Australia]], {{convert|2535|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Réunion]] Island, and {{convert|3450|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Benguerra Island]], Mozambique, and {{convert|3600|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Mossel Bay]], [[South Africa]].

In March 2014, the location in the southern Indian Ocean was the subject of an aerial search for the missing [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]], after potential debris were spotted by satellite centered on the 45°S, 90°E location.<ref>{{cite news|title=Malaysia plane search: China checks new 'debris' image|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26697048|accessdate=24 March 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=22 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Murdoch|first=Lindsay|title=Missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: Floating debris spotted by Chinese satellite image|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-floating-debris-spotted-by-chinese-satellite-image-20140322-35ap6.html|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=22 March 2014}}</ref>

== 45°S, 90°W==
Located in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]], {{convert|806|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west south west of [[Guaitecas]] in [[Chile]], and {{convert|1910|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north of Antarctica, {{coord|45|0|0|S|90|0|0|W}} has an ocean floor depth of {{convert|13,730|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below sea level.

==Antipodes ==

Each 45x90 point is the [[Antipodes|antipode]] - the point on the opposite side of the each - of another 45x90 point. 

The southern Indian Ocean location and the point in Wisconsin are antipodes of each other. 

The southern Pacific Ocean location and the point in China are antipodes of each other.
