There have been many conflicts during [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] events since the founding of the worldwide bicycling [[advocacy]] event in 1992. The conflicts have resulted in injuries, property damage, and arrests, and both bicyclists and motorized vehicle drivers have been victims. Critics say that Critical Mass, held primarily in large [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] cities, is a deliberate attempt to obstruct automotive [[traffic]] and disrupt normal [[city]] functions, when individuals taking part refuse to obey [[Traffic code|traffic laws]],<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Winnipeg Sun|url=http://winnipegsun.com/News/Columnists/MacFarlane_Gord/2006/08/06/1722420.html|title=Critical Mass protesters too critical|author=Gord MacFarlane|date=August 7, 2006}}</ref> while participants variously consider it a celebration of cycling, of cyclists' rights, and a practical re-imagining of urban space.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Wiley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kk_9vDOoU0QC&q=%22critical+mass%22+cycling+proponents&pg=PA137|title=Critical Mass protesters too critical|author=Zack Furness|date=August 7, 2006|isbn = 9781444341362}}</ref>

==Buffalo, New York, US==
On May 30, 2003, in [[Buffalo, New York]], during an incident known locally as "Critical Massacre," police stopped two cyclists for "failure to yield to an [[emergency vehicle]]." Several people were allegedly attacked by police. Nine cyclists were arrested and three were later convicted, including a journalist.<ref>http://www.mediastudy.com/articles/av5-27-04.html</ref>

[[Chicago Police Department]] officers are often seen riding with Critical Mass participants, and squad cars block intersections to provide safe passage to Critical Mass cyclists. However, on August 31, 2007, seven riders were arrested on charges of obstructing traffic and disobeying police, and were held overnight. According to some of those arrested, they were released late at night or early in the morning. On multiple occasions, Critical Mass participants attempted to ride on [[Lake Shore Drive]], a road off limits to cyclists. Police prevented participants riding on Lake Shore Drive, by blocking entrance ramps with squad cars when Critical Mass riders approached the road.<ref>{{cite web |title= Tips For Newcomers |url=http://chicagocriticalmass.org/about/newbies |accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>

==London, United Kingdom==
[[Image:Metropolitan Police officers at Critical Mass London, April 2006.jpg|right|thumb|[[Metropolitan Police]] officers with their cycles awaiting the start of Critical Mass London, April 2006.]]
In [[London]] on September 2005, a few weeks after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005 bombings]], Metropolitan Police required the organisers to provide a route six days before the event and placed strict restrictions on riders, under threat of arrest. The threat was retracted when politicians and cyclist groups objected. In October 2005, the ride had close to 1,200 participants, significantly more than usual. A long stop in [[Parliament Square]], part of the government's exclusion area in the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], led to a slow and cumbersome ride.

One participant sought a declaration from the [[High Court of England and Wales]] that police need not be notified about the rides, in a "friendly action" in which neither side sought [[damages]]. The High Court<ref name=kayvc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2006/1536.html|title=Kay v. the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis, EWHC 1536 (Admin)|date=June 27, 2006|publisher=Royal Courts of Justice}}</ref> agreed, exempting Critical Mass from notification under Section 11 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

The police presence included [[Undercover operation|undercover]] officers, three marked [[Police car|squad cars]], a state [[patrol]] helicopter, and unmarked vehicles. The ride had been linked with weekend protests of the following year's [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. After the arrest of a cyclist for "riding in a snake-like manner," cyclists began chanting "Let him go!" and "What's the charge?" The police called for backup, and dozens of police officers responded, using [[Mace (spray)|mace]] and [[taser]]s. Minneapolis police arrested 19 participants, including three [[Minor (law)|minors]].

===July 1997===

On the night of July 25, 1997, in [[San Francisco]], the ride attracted 5,000 participants, which resulted in congested traffic, confrontations with motorists, and arrests. Interest and tension had been growing for several weeks due to increased [[rhetoric]] from then-Mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] regarding cracking down on the event. The local newspapers published a city-approved route after the mayor withdrew his threat to have bicyclists arrested for not obtaining a [[parade]] permit. Because of the large turnout, it was difficult if not impossible for cyclists to follow the sanctioned route. Riders instead found themselves engaged in verbal and physical altercations with motorists and police, as well as among themselves. Two officers reported injuries in confrontations with bike riders. Local media reported that "about 250" bicyclists were arrested, most for disrupting traffic, and a few for being drunk in public, [[Battery (crime)|battery]], and outstanding [[Warrant (law)|warrants]].<ref>{{cite news

===March 2007===
On the March 2007 ride in San Francisco, a rider was arrested on felony (later reduced to misdemeanor) charges in San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin neighborhood]] for denting a [[limousine]] using a [[bicycle lock]]. The driver told police he got out of his car to talk to two cyclists who allegedly blocked his path. After exchanging words with one of the cyclists, the driver said he grabbed one of the bicycles and tried to pull it out of the way. He then got back into his limo to go around the riders, but before he could move, he said, another cyclist ran into the side of his car, then punched the hood with a U-shaped lock. The cyclist told police he only hit the limousine after the driver gunned his engine. During the incident, one of the limousine's tires was slashed and the driver's keys were stolen.<ref>{{cite news

In November 2009, Stanley Roberts of [[KRON]] 4 News recorded several Critical Mass confrontations between bicyclists and vehicles at [[Van Ness Avenue (San Francisco)|Van Ness]] and O'Farrell Streets. An old Critical Mass website advised riders not to be confrontational and block traffic, but in footage filmed by Roberts, bicyclists engaged in confrontational arguments with motorists and blocked roads to vehicular traffic.<ref name="KRON4">{{cite web

==Walnut Creek, California, US==
In [[Walnut Creek, California]], on June 20, 2008, a car bumped into the rear wheel of a Critical Mass rider. An argument ensued among the driver and passenger of the car and the cyclist involved, after which the passenger and driver of the car assaulted the cyclist. The police arrived and arrested the passenger and driver of the automobile involved in the assault.<ref>http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2008/06/20/18509674.php</ref>

On June 21, 2002, in [[Warsaw, Poland]], the Critical Mass event was stopped by a cordon of fully armed [[riot police]] on [[Constitution Square (Warsaw)|Plac Konstytucji (Constitution Square)]], who demanded their dispersal and detained some of the participants. Other Critical Mass participants responded with a [[Sit-in|sit-in protest]], blocking an important traffic [[Junction (traffic)|junction]], and then tried to evade the [[blockade]] by taking different routes to [[Castle Square, Warsaw|Plac Zamkowy (Castle Square)]], the Critical Mass rally point.<ref>http://www.raster.art.pl/galeria/artysci/rowelucja/rowelucja.htm</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20080603011249/http://www.masa.waw.pl/2002/0621.html</ref><ref>http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,890904.html {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120710195928/http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/kraj/1,34309,890904.html |date=2012-07-10 }}</ref> This event was widely reported by the media and, as a result, the Warsaw [[municipality]] decided to legalize future events, rather than escalate the conflict.
