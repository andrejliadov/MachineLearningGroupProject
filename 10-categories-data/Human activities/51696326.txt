== Strategy ==
99Rise plans on achieving their goal to reclaim democracy from the domination of big money through a five phase approach:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/02/reader-poll-whats-the-proper-punishment-for-99rise-protesters/|title=Reader poll: What's the proper punishment for 99Rise protesters?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/strategy|title=How do we win?|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref>
# (Before April 2016) Build the movement. 99Rise prepared each activist through encompassing trainings, team building exercises, and leadership meetings.
# (April 2016 - September 2016) Participate in forms of civil disobedience to get the attention of political leadership during the 2016 election. For example, 99Rise disrupted the Supreme Court on April 1, 2015 and Donald Trump at the GOP debate.
# (September 2016 - December 2016) Mobilize members to get out and elect representatives and a president who will be their champion for the causes they are fighting for.
# (January 2017- December 2017) Hold Congress, the President, and state legislatures accountable when it comes to meeting their demands to reclaim democracy. If the governing bodies do not meet their demands for constitutional and legislative reform, then participate in forms of civil disobedience and/or mass noncooperation.
# (January 2017 - November 2018) Monitor and enforce the reform agenda until it is enacted. Further escalation of civil disobedience if necessary.

== Leadership ==
Kai Newkirk is the co-founder and most visible member of 99Rise.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/130178-who-was-donald-trumps-heckler-at-the-gop-debate-kai-newkirk-disrupts-for-an-important-reason|title=Who Was Donald Trump's Heckler At The GOP Debate? Kai Newkirk Disrupts For An Important Reason|last=Yang|first=Melissah|access-date=2016-11-18}}</ref> While Newkirk understands the difficulties of 99rise's mission, he stresses that there are important smaller victories that can be achieved to restore some integrity back into the political process. Newkirk wants to push for the adoption of disclosure laws to address the problem of dark money and wants to create a democracy voucher system which would give a tax credit to voters to let every voter direct $50 or $100 to a candidate of their choosing. He believes that these two victories would be a step in the right direction towards achieving their ultimate goal of reclaiming democracy from the power of big money.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=101534597&S=R&D=f5h&EbscoContent=dGJyMMTo50Sep7Y4zOX0OLCmr06ep7RSsqu4TK6WxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGnsEq0qbVIuePfgeyx43zx|title=Is there a pathway to ending corporate rule in America?|last=Engler|first=Mark|date=April 2015|work=Issue 481, p33, 1p|access-date=November 15, 2016|via=EBSCOHost}}</ref>

== Actions ==

=== Supreme Court Hearing Protests ===

==== Jan 21, 2015 ====
A group of seven 99rise activists protested during a Supreme Court Hearing. They chose this day to disrupt the court because they were condemning the ruling in the Citizens United case which happened five years ago from this day. In a report following the incident, 99Rise members also noted that a Princeton study concluded the average American had "near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy."<ref>Martin Gilens and Benjamin I. Page, "Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens". Princeton University. Retrieved 2016-11-18.</ref> They rationalized that there disturbance of the court was one way they could make an impact, or draw attention towards public policy that they find unjust. Immediately following the disruption, the activists were escorted out of the courtroom and were charged with making a harangue or oration.<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|last=Bellew|first=Chelsea Elizabeth|date=2015-12-04|title=Combating Corruption in Campaign Finance in the United States: Why a Grass Roots Approach Is the Only Solution|ssrn=2699349|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}</ref> The individuals charged were Andrew Batcher, Irandira Gonzales, Margaret Johnson, Alexandra Flores-Quilty, Katherine Philipson, Curt Ries, and Mary Zeiser. The 8th member in the courtroom, Ryan Clayton, allegedly used a concealed camera to film the incident. It is still unclear as to what penalty Clayton will receive.<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-windsor/exclusive-video-citizens-_b_6542166.html|title=EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Citizens United Protest Inside the Supreme Court|last1=Producer|first1=Lauren Windsor Executive|last2=Undercurrent|first2=The|date=2015-01-26|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-11-19}}</ref>

==== April 1, 2015 ====
A group of five 99rise activists protested during another [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] hearing. The 99rise members stood up and said, "We rise to demand democracy.  One person, one vote".<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.99rise.org/supreme_court_civil_disobedience|title=Watch: Video From Inside Supreme Court Disruption|newspaper=99Rise|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref>  Immediately after, they were tackled and arrested.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/joolaw6&div=16&id=&page=|title=A Year in the Life of the Supreme Court (Almanac Excerpts)|journal= 6 Journal of Law |year=2016|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> They now face two charges: picketing with the intent of interfering with or obstructing the administration of justice and making a harangue or oration.<ref name=":1" /> The date that they protested, April 1, 2015, is also of significance because it is the one year anniversary of the McCutcheon vs FEC Supreme Court ruling. The ruling "struck down the aggregate limits on the amount an individual may contribute during a two-year period to all federal candidates, parties and political action committees combine."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/law/litigation/McCutcheon.shtml|title=McCutcheon|website=www.fec.gov|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref> 99rise contends that this ruling gave the 1% even more power to control our democracy through political donations by getting rid of the previously held restriction of $123,400 that one may contribute to a candidate, PACs, or parties.<ref name=":3" />

=== GOP Debate Interruption ===
During the 2016 GOP debate, Kai Newkirk, one of the cofounders of 99rise, stood up and interrupted Donald Trump.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4">{{cite web |last1=Durkin |first1=J.
