'''Calligraphic projection''' is a system for displaying or projecting an image composed of a beam of light or electrons directly tracing the image, as opposed to sweeping in [[raster graphics|raster order]] over the entire display surface, as in a standard pixel-based display. Calligraphic projection is presently often used for [[laser lighting display]]s, whereby one or more [[laser]] beams draws an image on a screen by reflecting the laser beam from one or more mirrors attached to a deflecting mechanism.

Analog [[oscilloscope]]s have customarily employed this kind of [[vector graphics]], as did a number of [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]]-based [[vector monitor]] [[computer graphics]] terminals in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the [[Tektronix 4014]] and the [[Evans & Sutherland]] Picture System.

Calligraphic projection is sometimes called [[Jules Antoine Lissajous|Lissajous]] projection, after the mathematical figure (and mathematician).
