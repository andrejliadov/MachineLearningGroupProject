In the study of the [[mind|human mind]], the term '''Intellect''' refers to and identifies the ability of the mind to reach correct conclusions about what is [[truth|true]] and what is [[falsehood|false]], and about how to [[problem solving|solve problems]]. The term ''intellect'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek Philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophy]] term ''[[nous]]'', which translates to the Latin ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]]'' (from ''intelligere'', “to understand”) and into the French and English languages as ''[[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]]''. Discussion of the intellect is in two areas of [[knowledge]], wherein the terms ''intellect'' and ''intelligence'' are related terms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Andrew M.|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=9780191726828|edition=3rd}}</ref> 

* In philosophy, especially in [[classical philosophy|classical]] and [[medieval philosophy]] the intellect (''[[nous]]'') is an important subject connected to the question: How do humans [[knowledge|know things]]? Especially during [[late antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], the intellect was proposed as a concept that could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|Nature]], with [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the divine intellect of the [[cosmos]]. During the Latin Middle Ages the distinction developed whereby the term ''intelligence'' referred to the incorporeal beings that governed the celestial sphere; see: [[passive intellect]] and [[active intellect]].<ref name=Davidson>{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}} page 6.</ref>
* In modern [[psychology]] and in [[neuroscience]], the terms ''intelligence'' and ''intellect'' describe [[Theory of multiple intelligences|mental abilities]] that allow people to [[understanding|understand]]; the distinction is that ''intellect'' relates to facts, whereas ''intelligence'' relates to feelings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-consciousness-question/201205/intellect-and-intelligence|title=Intellect and Intelligence|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> 


== Intellect and intelligence ==
Intellect is the branch of [[intelligence]] that reflects the [[logical]] and the [[rational]] aspects of the human mind, which, lacking [[emotion]]al engagement with a psychological problem, usually is considered as limited to [[fact]]s and raw [[knowledge]];<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/article/instinct-intellect-intelligence-intuition#gsc.tab=0|title = Instinct, Intellect, Intelligence, Intuition|accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = Nithyananda Sangha|last = Sangha|first = Nithyananda|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170723021943/http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/article/instinct-intellect-intelligence-intuition#gsc.tab=0|archive-date = 23 July 2017|url-status = dead}}</ref> In addition to the functions of [[linear logic]] and patterns of [[formal logic]] the intellect also processes the non-linear functions of [[fuzzy logic]] and [[dialectical logic]].<ref>Rowan, John. (1989) ''The Intellect''. SAGE Social Science Collections, p. 000.</ref>

Intellect and intelligence are contrasted by [[etymology]]; derived from the Latin [[present active participle]] ''intelligere'', the term ''intelligence'' denotes “to gather in between”, whereas the term ''intellect'' derived from the [[past participle]] of ''intelligere'' denotes “what has been gathered”. Therefore, intelligence relates to the creation of new categories of understanding, based upon similarities and differences, while intellect relates to understanding existing [[Categorization|categories]].<ref>Bohm, David and Peat, F. David. ''[[Science, Order, and Creativity]]'' (1987) p.114.</ref>

== Development of intellect ==
Personal [[experience]] is crucial to the development of intellect, because in resolving the problems of life a person can attain [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the full, intellectual comprehension of a situation, and so improve his and her [[behavior]] in order to act reasonably and appropriately in society. The development of the intellect occurs consequent to the person’s emotional dissatisfaction that arises from the negative outcome of a given situation in life; mental development occurs from the search for solutions to the problems of life. Only experience can provide genuine and thoughtful [[understanding]] of [[reality]], which consequently contributes to the person’s intellectual development.<ref>{{Cite web|title =Psychology of Knowledge: Development of the Intellect|url =http://augustinianparadigm.com/psychology_of_knowledge.htm|website=augustinianparadigm.com|accessdate=2015-11-01}}</ref>

[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|375x375px|The Structure of Intellect (SI) model organizes intellectual functions in three dimensions: (i) Operations, (ii) Contents, and (iii) Products. (Joy Paul Guilford, 1955)]]
Intellectual understanding is built upon creating a [[conceptual model]] of reality through [[perception]] and the reflective processes of [[cognition]]. The process of finding solutions to the problems of life enriches the human memory with the attributes of reality. The full potential of the intellect is achieved when a person acquires an accurate understanding of the real world, which is mirrored in the [[mind]]. The mature intellect is identified by the capability of emotional “self-management”, the psychological state wherein a person can encounter, face, and resolve problems as they arise in the course of life, thereby being capable of personal change, and also capable of altering his or her reality into a desirable life situation, thus success and [[failure]] depend upon the person possessing a mature intellect.<ref>{{cite book|last1=VandenBos|first1=Gary R.|title=APA Dictionary of Psychology|date=2006|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-1-59147-380-0|edition=1st|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/apadictionaryofp00vand}}</ref>

=== Structure of intellect ===
In 1955, the psychologist [[J. P. Guilford|Joy Paul Guilford]] (1897–1987) proposed a Structural Intellect (SI) model in three dimensions: (i) Operations, (ii) Contents, and (iii) Products. Each parameter contains specific, discrete elements that are individually measured as autonomous units of the human mind.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Structure of Intellect (J.P. Guilford)|url = http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/intellect.html|website = www.instructionaldesign.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}</ref> Intellectual operations are represented by [[cognition]] and [[memory]], production (by [[divergent thinking]] and [[convergent thinking]]), and [[evaluation]]. Contents are figurative and [[symbol]]ic, [[semantics|semantic]] and behavioral. Products are in units, classes, and [[Relation of Ideas|relations]], systems, transformations, and implications.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guilford's 'structure of intellect' model|url = http://homepages.which.net/~gk.sherman/mbaaaaab.htm|website = homepages.which.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}</ref>

== Intellect in psychotherapy ==
[[Intellectualization]] is a psychotherapeutic method based upon intense intellectual focus in order to avoid a problem penetrating the person’s mind. In psychological praxis, intellectualization is a [[defense mechanism]] that blocks [[feeling]]s in order to prevent [[anxiety]] and [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] from acting upon the person’s [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], which would interfere with his or her normal functioning in real life. As psychotherapy, intellectualization is a rational, dispassionate, and scientific attitude towards the mental problem causing psychological disturbance in the person. 
	
The functions of intellectualization involve the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id, ego, and super-ego]]. The [[Ego psychology|Ego]] is the conscious aspect of [[Personality|human personality]]; the Id is the unconscious, animal-instinct aspect; and the super-ego is the control mechanism that mediates and adjusts a person’s thoughts and actions and behavior in accordance with the social norms of society. The purpose of intellectualization is to isolate the Id from the real world, and so make the conscious aspects of a person’s life the only object of reflection and consideration. Therefore, intellectualization defends and protects the Ego from the Id, the unconscious aspect of human personality that usually is impossible to control.<ref>{{Cite web|title =Teaching Psychology — Defense Mechanisms|url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/13951/1/Teaching-Psychology--Defense-Mechanisms.html|website = www.healthguidance.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25|last = Lemouse, M}}</ref>

Socially, intellectualization uses technical [[jargon]] and complex [[scientific terminology]] instead of plain language; e.g. a physician uses the word ''carcinoma'' instead of ''cancer'' to lessen the negative impact of a diagnosis of terminal disease — by directing the patient’s attention away from the bad news. The different registers of language, scientific (''carcinoma'') and plain language (''cancer''), facilitate the patient’s acceptance of medical fact and medical treatment, by avoiding an outburst of negative emotions that would interfere with the successful treatment of the disease.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Intellectualization: Isolation from Emotions! (A Psychological Tranquilizer) {{!}} Mindful Cogitations|url=http://abhakhetarpal.in/blog/intellectualization-isolation-from-emotions|website = abhakhetarpal.in|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Khetarpal, A}}</ref>

Moreover, the defense mechanism of intellectualization is criticized because it separates and isolates the person from the painful emotions caused by the psychological problem. As such, the defense mechanism subsequently leads to the denial of [[intuition]], which sometimes contributes to the processes of [[decision-making]]; a negative consequence of the absence of emotional stimuli can deprive the person of [[motivation]], and lead to a mood of dissatisfaction, such as [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]; such “emotional constipation” threatens his or her [[creativity]], by replacing such capabilities with factual solutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=On Finding Out How We Don't Know Ourselves in Therapy and Counselling.
