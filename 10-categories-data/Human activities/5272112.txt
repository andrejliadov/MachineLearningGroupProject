'''''Avoda''''', or '''''Avodah''''' ({{Lang-he|עֲבוֹדָה}}), literally means "work, worship, and service" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In a modern context, usually referring to business-type activities, it can also mean [[agricultural]] work and, more traditionally, serving God.

==Original meaning==
In its original, traditional sense, ''avodah'' was applied to sacrifices offered in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The word was also used to describe the epitome of sacrificial rite, the complex and fraught main service of the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] on [[Yom Kippur]] (The Day of Atonement). Today it refers to a liturgical reenactment of the aforementioned ceremony which is recited during the [[Musaf]] [[Amidah]] of Yom Kippur.<ref>[https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/934080/rabbi-yechezkel-freundlich/journey-through-the-machzor-yom-kippur-seder-ha-avodah/ Journey Through the Machzor - Yom Kippur Seder Ha'Avodah ]</ref>

==In Chassidism==
In [[Hasidic philosophy|Chassidism]] ''avodah'' generally refers to divine service (or worship). For example, it is part of the divine service to serve God with joy.<ref>Talmud Bavli, Ta'anit 2a</ref>

==Avodah and Bnei Akiva==
''Avodah'' is one of the two concepts that underlie the [[ideology]] of the [[Bnei Akiva]] movement; the other is [[Torah]].<ref>[https://toravoda.org.il/%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99-%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%91%D7%90-%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%A2%D7%9D/ בני עקיבא – תנועה של עם ?]</ref>

In this ideological framework, the word was originally utilised in a strictly agricultural context. "Avodah" meant working on a kibbutz.{{cn|date=September 2019}} In more recent years, Bnei Akiva has had to redefine the terminology. Tens of thousands of its members currently live, or plan to live in an urban setting in Israel and it is generally perceived that the needs of Israel have developed somewhat since Bnei Akiva was founded. The movement has therefore subtly redefined Avodah, to mean work that contributes towards the building up of the land of Israel.{{cn|date=September 2019}}
