'''Coon hunting''' or '''raccoon hunting''' is the practice of [[hunting]] [[raccoon]]s, most often for their meat and fur. It is almost always done with specially bred dogs called [[coonhound]]s, of which there are six breeds, and is most commonly associated with [[rural life]] in the [[Southern United States]]. Coon hunting is also popular in the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Most coon hunts take place at night, with the dogs being turned loose, trailing and putting the raccoon up a tree without human assistance. Once the raccoon is in the tree, with the dog at the base, it is referred to as "treed", with "[[treeing]]" being the active verb form.

In addition to meat or fur hunts, there are also competition hunts to demonstrate the speed and skill of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition hunts are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as ''[[Where the Red Fern Grows]]'' and popularized in stories and songs recorded by [[Jerry Clower]], [[Jimmy Martin]] and others. In Alabama, there is [[Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard|a cemetery]] specifically for the burial of coon dogs.

==Training==

Coonhound puppies typically start their hunting training at less than six months of age. The dog's owner or trainer will begin by teaching it to follow the scent of a raccoon's pelt or commercial scent stick dragged across the ground.<ref name="auto3">{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA232|title=Popular Mechanics|date=1963|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=232|volume=119|issue=2|issn=0032-4558}}</ref>

After the young dog has mastered this, it is taken hunting, either by itself or with other dogs. Many dog trainers prefer hunting older dogs alongside a younger one, with the reasoning that they will set an example for the inexperienced dog. Experienced dog trainers note that the most difficult part is often not teaching the dog to hunt raccoons but teaching it to ignore other animals such as opossums, [[whitetail deer]] and rabbits, which are colloquially called "trash".<ref name="auto3"/>

==Practice==
<!--This is NOT a how-to coon hunt, obviously, but I don't think it's possible to understand coon hunting without a brief description of what actually happens, and why dogs are used.-->
Modern coon hunting is practiced with the use of a trained dog or pigs.<ref name=Edge>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-qnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA148|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture|volume=7 (Foodways)|first=John T.|last=Edge|date=2014|publisher=UNC Press Books|page=148|isbn=9781469616520}}</ref> While historically coon hunting dogs were of any breed, modern coon dogs are almost always members of the [[scenthound]] subgroup called [[coonhound]]s. There are six distinct breeds of coonhound developed specifically to hunt climbing game by scent; [[Black and Tan Coonhound]], [[Redbone Coonhound]], [[Bluetick Coonhound]], [[English Coonhound]], [[Treeing Walker Coonhound]], and [[Plott Hound]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOapDdbRJ_QC&pg=PA83|title=Basset Hounds|first=Joe|last=Stahlkuppe|date=1997|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|page=83|isbn=9780812097375}}</ref> The breeds vary somewhat in size, though color is the largest obvious difference.

A major difference in hunting performance is whether a dog is hot-nosed, meaning it will skip an older scent to follow a fresher one, or cold-nosed, meaning it will follow an older scent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EYlAQAAMAAJ&q=hot%20nose%20cold%20nosed%20coonhound&dq=hot%20nose%20cold%20nosed%20coonhound|title=Texas parks & wildlife|date=1992|publisher=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department|page=40|volume=50|oclc=27732672}}</ref> Of the six coonhound breeds, the hot-nosed Treeing Walker Coonhound is the most popular.<ref name=Outdoor>{{cite magazine|last=Lynn|first=Brian|date=March 18, 2013|url=http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/gun-dogs/2013/03/hunting-dogs-best-dog-breeds-every-game-species|title=Hunting Dogs: Best Dog Breeds for Every Game Animal|magazine=Outdoor Life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321134352/http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/gun-dogs/2013/03/hunting-dogs-best-dog-breeds-every-game-species|archive-date=21 March 2013|issn=0030-7076|oclc=67866152}}</ref> Some hunters also use [[Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog]]s, although this breed is not a hound but a [[cur]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-dS3oB1_gkC&q=hunting%20Louisiana%20Catahoula&dq=hunting%20Louisiana%20Catahoula|title=The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog|first=Don|last=Abney|date=1996|publisher=i-5 Publishing LLC|page=27|isbn=978-0944875445}}</ref> 

[[File:I tree.jpg|thumb|A [[Redbone Coonhound]] treeing a raccoon at night]]
The dog or dogs are released at night in an area where raccoons are likely to be, such as a forest, crop field or swamp, and allowed to find a raccoon scent. Most dogs will emit a long, distinct bay upon striking a trail, and will continue to bay the entire time they are tracking the raccoon.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto4">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EK7pC-LqZjYC&pg=PA41|title=The Mythology of Dogs: Canine Legend|first1=Gerald|last1=Hausman|first2=Loretta|last2=Hausman|date=1997|publisher=Macmillan|pages=40–44|isbn=9780312181390}}</ref> The dog's voice may change timbre depending on how fresh or "hot" a scent is.<ref name="auto4"/> Unlike some breeds of hunting dog that use sight to locate their prey, coonhounds use their sense of smell alone.<ref name="google.com">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/natureofdogs0000ludi|url-access=registration|title=The Nature of Dogs|date=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=[https://archive.org/details/natureofdogs0000ludi/page/23 23]|isbn=9781416542872}}</ref> The hunt typically ends when the raccoon climbs a tree. Upon reaching the tree, the dog or dogs will stop baying and begin the "tree" bark, also referred to as the chop bark for its short, sharp sound. This change in vocalization lets the hunter know when a raccoon is treed.<ref name="auto"/> Some dogs have emitted as many as 150 chop barks per minute when on a tree.<ref name=Indy>{{cite news|last=Hunsinger|first=Dana Benbow|date=August 28, 2014|title=A dog worth $40,000?

Regardless of how they choose to travel, hunters typically wear a headlight in order to allow free use of both hands, though years ago flashlights or lanterns were more common. The first coon hunting headlights were [[carbide]] lights similar to those used by [[coal miner]]s, but today headlights are made and sold specifically for hunting. A [[.22 rifle]] is the preferred caliber of gun, and boots are highly recommended due to mud and rough terrain.<ref name="nrafamily.org">{{cite web|last=Mann|first=Richard|date=18 April 2016|url=https://www.nrafamily.org/articles/2016/4/18/raccoon-hunting-great-for-new-hunters/|title=Raccoon Hunting: Great For New Hunters|publisher=National Rifle Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302193837/https://www.nrafamily.org/articles/2016/4/18/raccoon-hunting-great-for-new-hunters/|archive-date=2 March 2017|oclc=237879204}}</ref>

===Regulations===
{{main|Game (hunting)}}
As with all [[Game (hunting)|game animal]]s in the United States, the hunting of raccoons is regulated by wildlife conservation officials in each state and seasons and bag limits will therefore vary. In Tennessee, for example, coon hunting season begins in mid-September and ends in February, with a bag limit of one raccoon per hunter per day,<ref name=Season/>  while in Kentucky, it begins in October and ends on the last day of February, with no bag limit.<ref name="ky.gov"/> Some states, including Iowa, require a valid trapping or hunting license to train a coonhound to hunt.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XdJPAQAAMAAJ&q=coon%20hunting%20ATV&dq=coon%20hunting%20ATV|title=Iowa Hunting and Trapping Regulations|date=2005|publisher=Iowa Department of Natural Resources|page=18|oclc=44229976}}</ref> Inadvertent hunting or running of deer by coonhounds is particularly problematic for hunters, as hunting deer with dogs is illegal in most states.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Keith Sutton|date=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXFvplk1EssC&pg=PA211|title=Arkansas Wildlife: a History|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|page=211|isbn=9781610750387}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Coonhound|Raccoon}}
Raccoons were first hunted by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s, who harvested the common animals both for meat and fur. British and European settlers in North America later adopted the practice.<ref name=Southern>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSaaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA274|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture|volume=14 (Folklife)|first1=Glenn|last1=Hinson|first2=William|last2=Ferris|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|page=274|isbn=978-0807898550}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

While Native hunters did not rely on dogs, white hunters utilized them from Colonial times; [[George Washington]] is credited with owning some of the first coon hunting dogs, French hounds given to him by the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref name="auto1"/> Most of the early coon dogs were actually [[Foxhound]]s imported from Europe<ref name="google.com"/> or mixed breeds with hound blood, but these dogs often had trouble finding raccoons when the latter climbed trees, and breeders began to specifically develop dogs for their [[treeing]] ability: the ability to follow the scent to the base of a tree and stay there until the hunter came.<ref name=AKC/>

[[File:Treed Raccoons.jpg|thumb|A pair of raccoons in a [[maple tree]]]]
Coonhounds existed as a distinct type by the mid-to-late 1800s. By 1885 a raccoon pelt sold for approximately 25 cents, a fair price for the time. Up to [[World War I]] raccoons were very common despite being hunted often, and were sometimes poisoned to keep them from destroying crops.<ref name="auto"/>

Raccoon fur car coats were a fashion trend in the 1920s, leading to high pelt prices and an increase in hunting and trapping. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, when many rural families lived in poverty, raccoons were hunted extensively and became relatively rare. Hunters sold the pelts for needed money, and the meat provided protein. In the 1940s and '50s conservation efforts were undertaken, including teaching hunters not to cut down den trees that raccoons used for raising offspring. The raccoon population subsequently expanded, to the point that they became recognized as a [[least-concern species]].<ref name="auto"/> 

During the 1950s, staged nite hunts <!--that is how they spell it in the source--> were created and by the 1970s had become popular with some hunts involving over one thousand dogs.<ref name=AKC/>

In the 1970s, the price of raccoon pelts rose again to a high of 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was possible to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs.<ref name="auto"/> One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r9zhAAAAMAAJ&q=Michigan%20coon%20hunting&dq=Michigan%20coon%20hunting|title=Hunt Michigan!: How To, Where To, When To|first=T.|last=Huggler|date=1985|publisher=Michigan United Conservation Clubs|pages=16–19|isbn=9780933112124}}</ref> This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s,<ref name="auto"/> and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs.<ref name=Edge/>

The practice of coon hunting is sometimes associated with [[Virginia opossum|possum]] hunting, since the same dogs were often used, the animals are both climbers by nature, and are common in the same geographic areas. However, opossums are criticized for being too easy to hunt and too greasy to be edible if killed, and are seldom hunted today.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-qnAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|title=The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture|volume=7(Foodways)|first=John T.|last=Edge|date=2014|publisher=UNC Press Books|page=150|isbn=9781469616520}}</ref>

Coon hunting continues to be popular in the rural South and Midwest. The ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' noted in a 2014 article that while some coon hunters are "overalls-clad people from the backwoods", some earn six-figure salaries, and a top coonhound can cost as much as $40,000.<ref name=Indy/>
