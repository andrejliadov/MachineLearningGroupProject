{{short description|Trophy hunt without fair chase}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2014}}
A '''canned hunt''' is a [[trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] which is not "[[fair chase]]"; it has been made too easy for the hunter. In some examples, animals have been kept in a confined area, such as in a fenced-in area, increasing the likelihood of the [[hunter]] obtaining a kill. The term has been used for [[driven grouse shooting]], in which large areas of Britain are farmed for [[red grouse]].<ref>Rebirding: Rewilding Britain and its birds. Benedict Macdonald, 2019, Pelagic Publishing. p. 171.</ref> According to [[WordNet]], a canned hunt is a "hunt for animals that have been raised on game ranches until they are mature enough to be killed for trophy collections."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/canned_hunt |title=Canned hunt: Definition with Canned hunt Pictures and Photos |publisher=Lexic.us |date= |accessdate=2018-04-11}}</ref>  

There have been criticisms of this method of hunting from both hunters and animal welfare advocacy groups. "Canned hunting" and "vanity hunting" are derogatory terms not generally applied by the practitioners of activities so described.

== Legislation in the U.S. ==
Canned hunting has been banned or restricted in 20 states of the US, including Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christinabush.com/cannedhunting.html |title=Canned Hunting |publisher=Christinabush.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-11}}</ref>

In 2006, Alabama was the most recent state to pass legislation banning many forms of canned hunting.<ref>http://www.hsus.org The Humane Society of the United States</ref>  In 2007, a bill in the [[New York State Legislature]] to ban all canned hunting of certain "exotic" animals was defeated by legislative inaction.<ref>Benjamin Klein, [http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2007-06-25-61997.113122-Bill-to-ban-canned-hunts-falls-prey-to-the-legislative-clock.html ''Bill to ban canned hunts falls prey to the legislative clock''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224135446/http://www.legislativegazette.com/Articles-c-2007-06-25-61997.113122-Bill-to-ban-canned-hunts-falls-prey-to-the-legislative-clock.html |date=February 24, 2015 }}, Legislative Gazette, June 25, 2007.</ref>

== Criticism ==
A number of groups object to the practice of canned hunting for reasons such as cruelty to animals or that it takes away what is known as "[[fair chase]]."

The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) criticizes canned hunting. In a statement, the HSUS called canned hunts "cruel and brutal activities," in which the hunted animal has "absolutely no chance of escape." It went on to say that animals have been "psychologically conditioned to behave as a target by life in captivity," among other objections.<ref name="hsus">{{cite web

Some hunting groups, especially those who focus on hunters' ethics, also object to canned hunting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/canned-hunts-unfair-any-price|title=Canned Hunts: Unfair at Any Price &#124; Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info}}</ref> These objections are on the grounds of "[[fair chase]]", the idea that an animal has a fair chance of escaping the hunter, and it's not too easy for the hunter to kill the animal. It is believed that canned hunts remove these elements.

Hunting groups such as the [[Pope and Young Club]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] do not accept animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in their record books. [[Boone and Crockett Club]] refers to the activity as a "canned shoot", as they claim that there is no hunting involved.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boone and Crockett Club Position Statement|url=http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_cannedshoot.asp?area=huntingEthics|website=Boone and Crockett Club}}</ref>

[[Safari Club International]] no longer accepts animals killed in canned hunts for inclusion in its record books and award categories.

In 2014, 62 cities across the globe participated in the first-ever global march against canned hunting. The march was organized by Campaign Against Canned Hunting. People from many parts of the world took part: Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, Middle East, New Zealand, South America and the United States.<ref>Your African Safari, [http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/campaign-against-canned-hunting-in-south-africa-interview-with-chris-mercer "Campaign against canned hunting in South Africa: interview with Chris Mercer"]</ref>

== In the news ==

In 2005, [[internet hunting]] became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the [[Humane Society]], most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.<ref name=HSUS-FactSheet>Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, {{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202802/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife_abuse/campaigns/internet/fact_sheet_internet_hunting.html |archivedate=October 28, 2008 |title=Fact sheet on Internet Hunting }}</ref>

On August 15, 2006, [[Troy Gentry]], half of the country music singing duo [[Montgomery Gentry]], appeared in federal court in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] charged with canned hunting. Federal prosecutors allege that Gentry bought a bear named "Cubby" from Lee Marvin Greenly, then shot the tame bear while it was in an enclosed pen, tagged the bear as if it had been killed in the wild, then arranged for the editing of a videotape of the alleged "wild" kill.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/16/people.troyleegentry.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821012617/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/08/16/people.troyleegentry.ap/index.html |archivedate=August 21, 2006 |title=Country star accused of illegally killing tame bear |accessdate=August 16, 2006 }}</ref> Gentry and Greenly were said to face a maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a $20,000 fine if convicted. On November 27, 2006, Gentry pleaded guilty to a charge of falsely tagging the bear. Under the plea agreement, he agreed to pay a $15,000 fine, give up hunting, fishing and trapping in Minnesota for 5 years, and forfeit both the stuffed bear and the bow used to shoot the animal in 2004. Gentry posted a statement on the duo's website on November 9, 2010, apologizing for his actions.

Another less well-known incident occurred two years prior to the [[Dick Cheney hunting incident]] when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in [[Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania]]. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 [[ringneck pheasant]]s, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of [[mallard duck]]s.<ref name="walls">{{cite web

In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. [[Marthinus van Schalkwyk]], in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of "canned hunting"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huntersouthafrica.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023145325/http://www.huntersouthafrica.com/ |archivedate=October 23, 2006 |title=Huntersouthafrica supports Dart safaris|accessdate=October 22, 2006 }}</ref> in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African [[rhinoceros]] 'Baixinha.'{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban "canned" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape.
In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts.
"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal," he told a press conference. "Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle."<ref>{{cite news|last=Nullis|first=Clare|title=South Africa bans hunting caged lions|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1058/south-africa-bans-hunting-caged-lions|accessdate=October 26, 2011|date=February 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401192134/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1058/south-africa-bans-hunting-caged-lions|archive-date=April 1, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051&nbsp;pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named "[[Monster Pig]]" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog. It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named "Fred," had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son, Jamison, hunted him in a {{convert|150|acre|km2}} fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/wildlife_news/monster_pig_canned_hunt.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606151221/http://www.hsus.org/wildlife/wildlife_news/monster_pig_canned_hunt.html |archivedate=June 6, 2007 |title=Eight Shots, Three Hours, One Death: The Story of a Canned Hunt |accessdate=June 1, 2007 }}

In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, the organization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts.<ref>{{cite web|title=

In November 2017 PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.
