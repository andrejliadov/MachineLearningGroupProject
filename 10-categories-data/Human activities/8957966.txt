'''Entertainment management''' is a relatively new [[business management]] discipline that is increasingly being taught as a [[Bachelor of Arts degree]]. Entertainment management courses aim to provide graduates with appropriate knowledge and skills to progress into management careers within the [[show business|entertainment sector]], managing facilities such as sport events, theme parks, theaters, cinemas, live music venues, museums, art galleries, broadcast media companies and night clubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Lubin School of Business]] at [[Pace University]] offers a [[Bachelor of Business Administration|BBA]] degree in [[management]] with a concentration in arts and entertainment.<ref>http://www.pace.edu/lubin/arts-and-entertainment-bba</ref>

A number of master's-level programs have emerged recently, including [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] [[Heinz College|Master of Entertainment Industry Management]] â€“ which offers students with undergraduate degrees in the film and television the opportunity to refocus their education on the management dimension of the work, or Northwestern University's [http://www.creative.northwestern.edu Master of Science in Leadership for Creative Enterprises] program, which offers students with backgrounds in visual, performing, or interactive arts with management and entrepreneurial skills.

Growth in these courses has been linked with growth in both the creative and cultural industries. This growth is linked to increased [[consumer expenditure]] on recreation and entertainment activities. The result is a population assigning greater importance to the free time they have and a consequential willingness to spend more of their income on the 'experience' economy.
