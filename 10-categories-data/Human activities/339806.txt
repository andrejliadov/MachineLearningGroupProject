A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.<ref name=oed>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque"], ''Oxford English Dictionary'', [[Oxford University Press]], accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.<ref>In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot".

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].<ref>[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96</ref>  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.<ref name=Baldick>Baldick, Chris.

An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.<ref name="Grove">Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref> [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.<ref name=stanton>Stanton, p. 50</ref>

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028220023/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/Burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012</ref>  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.<ref name=Baldick/>

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".<ref>Sanders, p. 291</ref> Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.<ref>Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233</ref>

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.<ref>Sanders, pp. 290–91</ref> '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].<ref>''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.</ref>

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref name=stanton/>  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.<ref>Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242</ref>

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.<ref name=kennedy>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134</ref> As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.<ref name=kennedy/>

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),<ref>Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'', 1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)<ref>Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).<ref>Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].<ref name=kennedy/>  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].<ref>McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 & 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011</ref>

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well-known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''[[Russian Rag (composition)|Russian Rag]]'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].<ref>Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229</ref>

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",<ref>According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45</ref> was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].<ref>Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44</ref>  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].<ref name=times70/>

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."<ref name=grove>[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al.

Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].<ref name=times70>"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9</ref><ref name=Timesobit>"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

==American burlesque==

{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.<ref name=Friends>Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.

They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.<ref name=britannica>[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref>

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].<ref>[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96</ref>  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.<ref name=Baldick>Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque"], ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref>  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.<ref name="Grove">Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref> [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.<ref name=stanton>Stanton, p. 50</ref>

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028220023/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/Burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012</ref>  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.<ref name=Baldick/>

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".<ref>Sanders, p. 291</ref> Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.<ref>Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233</ref>

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.<ref>Sanders, pp. 290–91</ref> '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].<ref>''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.</ref>

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref name=stanton/>  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.<ref>Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242</ref>

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.<ref name=kennedy>[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134</ref> As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.<ref name=kennedy/>

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),<ref>Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'', 1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)<ref>Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}</ref> and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).<ref>Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref> [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].<ref name=kennedy/>  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].<ref>McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 & 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011</ref>

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well-known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''[[Russian Rag (composition)|Russian Rag]]'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].<ref>Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229</ref>

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",<ref>According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45</ref> was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].<ref>Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44</ref>  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].<ref name=times70/>

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."<ref name=grove>[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al.

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].<ref name=times70>"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9</ref><ref name=Timesobit>"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.<ref name=Friends>Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.

They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.<ref name=britannica>[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}</ref>

The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres.
