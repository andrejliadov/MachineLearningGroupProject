'''Commemoration of the American Revolution''' typifies the patriotic sentiment surrounding the [[American Revolution]] and the desire to preserve and honor the "[[Spirit of '76 (sentiment)|Spirit of '76]]". As the founding story of the [[United States]], it is covered in the schools, memorialized by a national holiday, and commemorated in innumerable monuments. Thus [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (the "Fourth of July") is a major national holiday celebrated annually. Besides local sites such as Bunker Hill, one of the first national pilgrimages for memorial tourists was [[Mount Vernon]], George Washington's estate, which attracted ten thousand visitors a year by the 1850s.<ref>Jean B. Lee, "Historical Memory, Sectional Strife, and the American Mecca: Mount Vernon, 1783-1853," ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (2001) 109#3 pp. 255-300 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4249931 in JSTOR]</ref>

==Memory==
Every nation constructs and honors the memory of its founding, and following generations use it to establish its identity and define patriotism.<ref>Barry Schwartz,  "The social context of commemoration: A study in collective memory." ''Social forces'' 61.2 (1982): 374-402. [https://www.sfu.ca/cmns/faculty/marontate_j/487/07-spring/Readings/schwarts1982.pdf online]</ref> 
The memory of the Founding and the Revolution has long been used as a political weapon.  For example, the right-wing "[[Tea Party movement]]" of the 21st century explicitly memorialized the Boston Tea Party as a protest against intrusive government.<ref>Jill Lepore, ''The Whites Of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle Over American History'' (Princeton University Press, 2010).</ref>  In the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.<ref>Jonathan B. Crider, "De Bow's Revolution: The Memory of the American Revolution in the Politics of the Sectional Crisis, 1850-1861," ''American Nineteenth Century History'' (2009) 10#3 pp 317–332</ref> David Ryan, noting that the Bicentennial was celebrated a year after the United States' humiliating 1975 withdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and presented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and fresh.<ref>David Ryan, "Re-enacting Independence through Nostalgia - The 1976 US Bicentennial after the Vietnam War," ''Forum for Inter-American Research'' (2012) 5#3 pp 26–48.</ref>

The Revolution became the main source of the non-denominational "[[American civil religion]]" that has shaped patriotism, and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Specific battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). The American Revolution is remembered for its  [[Moses]]-like leader ([[George Washington]]),<ref>Robert P. Hay, "George Washington: American Moses," ''American Quarterly'' (1969) 21#4 pp 780-91 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2711609 in JSTOR]</ref> its [[prophet]]s ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]]), disciples ([[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]]) and [[martyr]]s ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Crispus Attucks]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as its devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), holy sites ([[Valley Forge]], [[Charlestown, Boston|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), holy symbol ([[Flag of the United States|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]), and holy scriptures whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied ([[United States Declaration of Independence|The Declaration of Independence]], [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|the Bill of Rights]]).<ref>Catherine L. Albanese, ''Sons of the Fathers: The Civil Religion of the American Revolution'' (1977)</ref>

==Great Men==
There are innumerable monuments or commemorations of the major [[Founding Fathers]], with the names of Washington and Jefferson (and Lincoln) most often selected for buildings, sculptures, [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps|postage]], and [[United States dollar|currency]].<ref>Lawrence S. Kaplan, ''Thomas Jefferson: Westward the Course of Empire'' (1999) p. 1.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Randal Strock|title=The Presidential Book of Lists: From Most to Least, Elected to Rejected, Worst to Cursed|year=2008|publisher=Random House |pages=228–34}}</ref>  In the 1920s, Washington and Jefferson, together with Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, were chosen by sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]] and approved by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to be the four American heroes celebrated at the [[Mount Rushmore National Memorial]].    Over the decades the interpretive framework used by the [[National Park Service]] to explain this commemoration has changed, with such themes as localism giving way to nationalism, and overpowering gigantic images of Great Men giving way a little to increased attention paid to the ordinary workers who built it. The visit became less a patriotic pilgrimage than a family-oriented tourist event with success measured in terms of attendance at the remote South Dakota site, which reached a million visitors a year in 1959, and passed the two million level in 2005.<ref>Teresa Bergman, "Can Patriotism Be Carved in Stone? A Critical Analysis of Mt. Rushmore's Orientation Films" ''Rhetoric and Public Affairs'' (2008) 11#1 pp. 89-112 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41940343 online]</ref>

==Sites and battlefields==
{{Further|Category:American Revolutionary War sites}}
Today, more than 100 battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution are protected and maintained by federal, state and local governments.  The [[National Park Service]], a federal agency, alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/revwar/contact/park_info.html National Park Service Revolutionary War Sites.] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.</ref> On Veteran's Day (November 11) in 2014, the [[Civil War Trust]], the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and other preservation groups announced the creation of "Campaign 1776," an initiative to protect and interpret the battlefields of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. As does the [[Civil War Trust]], "Campaign 1776" uses public-private partnerships to provide the funding to acquire battlefield properties.<ref>See [https://www.civilwar.org/news/historians-and-preservation-groups-announce-landmark-national-campaign-save-revolutionary-war Campaign 1776 Announced] Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.</ref>  By the end of 2017, "Campaign 1776" had acquired more than 675 battlefield acres at 10 battlefields of the Revolutionary War or War of 1812 in six states.<ref>See [https://www.civilwar.org/preserve/saved-land Civil War Trust "Saved Land" webpage.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125084922/https://www.civilwar.org/preserve/saved-land |date=2017-11-25 }} Accessed Jan. 4, 2018.</ref> On May 8, 2018, the organization became the [[American Battlefield Trust]] comprised two divisions, the Civil War Trust and the Revolutionary War Trust.<ref>[https://www.battlefields.org/news/national-historic-preservation-group-forms-american-battlefield-trust] [[American Battlefield Trust]] May 8, 2018 announcement, "National historic preservation ground forms American Battlefield Trust."

==Bicentennial of 1976==
{{Main|United States Bicentennial}}
The [[United States Bicentennial]] was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the [[American Revolution#Commemorations|American Revolution]]. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.<ref>Christopher Capozzola, "'It Makes You Want to Believe in the Country': Celebrating the Bicentennial in the Age of Limits" in Beth Bailey & David Farber, eds., ''America in the 70s'' (2004) pp 29-45.</ref>

A Canadian specialist on the Revolutionary era has evaluated the evidence, the accuracy and the historical themes employed by twelve Hollywood films featuring the American Revolution from 1939-2002. She covers the major characters, heroes and villains, Patriots and Loyalists, plots, and social and class themes. She compares cinematic understandings of the Revolution with the interpretations of historians to reveal thematic consistencies, variations, and conceptual gulfs between filmmakers and historians.<ref>Nancy L.
