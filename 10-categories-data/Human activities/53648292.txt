== Architecture overview ==

Both the Gateway and the DST would be fitted with the [[International Docking System Standard]].<ref name="Inverse 2017"/> The DST spacecraft would comprise two elements: an [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion capsule]] and a habitation module<ref name="Rucker 2018"/> that would be propelled by both [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] and chemical propulsion, and carry a crew of four in a medium-sized habitat.<ref name="ARS Tech DST"/> The fully assembled spacecraft with the Orion capsule mated, would have a mass of about 100 metric tons.<ref name="2017 architecture"/><ref name="Inverse 2017"/><ref name="Rucker 2018"/><!--slide #11 refers to a landing cargo mission with 100-200 tons--> The spacecraft's habitat portion will likely be fabricated using tooling and structures developed for the [[Space Launch System|SLS]] propellant tank;<ref name="Smitherman 2018">{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180002054.pdf |title=Research Possibilities Beyond Deep Space Gateway |conference=Deep Space Gateway Concept Science Workshop.

The habitat portion of the DST spacecraft may also be equipped with a laboratory with research instrumentation for physical sciences, [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], chemical analyses, freezers, medical research, small live animal quarters, plant growth chambers, and [[3D printing]].<ref name="Smitherman 2018"/> External payloads might include cameras, telescopes, detectors, and a robotic arm.<ref name="Smitherman 2018"/>

Its initial target for exploration is Mars (flyby or orbit), and other suggested destinations are Venus (flyby or orbit), and a sample return from a large [[asteroid]].<ref name="MacDonald 2017">{{cite conference |url=http://spacearchitect.org/pubs/AIAA-2017-5100.pdf |title=Towards an Interplanetary Spaceship: The Potential Role of Long-Duration Deep Space Habitation and Transportation in the Evolution and Organization of Human Spaceflight and Space Exploration |conference=AIAA SPACE and Astronautics Forum and Exposition.

Orlando, Florida. |first=Alexander C. |last=MacDonald |date=2017 |id=AIAA 2017-5100}}</ref>  If the DST spacecraft were to orbit Mars, it would enable opportunities for real-time remote operation of equipment on the Martian surface, such as a human-assisted [[Mars sample-return mission|Mars sample return]].<ref name="MacDonald 2017"/><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/langley/nasa-langley-talk-to-highlight-sending-humans-to-the-deep-space-gateway |title=NASA Langley Talk to Highlight Sending Humans to the Deep Space Gateway |publisher=NASA |first=Eric |last=Gillard |date=April 25, 2018 |accessdate=May 20, 2018}}</ref>

It would use a lunar flyby to build up speed and then using solar electric propulsion (SEP) it would accelerate into a heliocentric orbit. There it would complete its transit to Mars or other possible destinations. It would use chemical propulsion to enter Mars orbit. Crews could perform remote observations or depart for the surface during a 438-day window. The vehicle would depart Mars orbit via a chemical burn. It would use a mix of SEP and lunar gravity assists to recapture into Earth's sphere of influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nvite.jsc.nasa.gov/presentations/b2/D1_Mars_Connolly.pdf|title=Deep Space Transport (DST) and Mars Mission Architecture|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Suggested timeline ==
If funded, the DST would be launched toward the Lunar Gateway in one [[Space Launch System|SLS]] cargo flight,<ref name="Inverse 2017"/> probably in 2027.<ref name="ARS Tech DST"/>  The spacecraft would be  expected to undergo 100–300 days of DST Habitat crewed operation before<ref name="Rucker 2018"/> it starts a one-year long flight test ([[shakedown cruise]]) in cislunar space in 2029 at the earliest.<ref name="ARS Tech DST"/><ref name="Inverse 2017"/> It would be designed to transport a crew to orbit Mars, but not land, in the 2030s.<ref name="ARS Tech DST"/> Its first mission would likely involve a Venus flyby and a short stay around Mars.<ref name="Free 2017">[https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/march_2017_nac_charts_architecturejmf_rev_3_tagged.pdf Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate - Architecture Status]. (PDF) Jim Free. NASA. March 28, 2017.</ref> Additional developments and vehicles would be required for a Mars human surface mission.<ref name="Rucker 2018"/>

In August 2019, the [[Science and Technology Policy Institute]] (STPI) delivered a report commissioned by NASA in 2017 specifically for a technical and financial assessment of "a Mars human space flight mission to be launched in 2033" using the DST.<ref name='Foust Aug2019'/> The report concluded that "even without budget constraints, a Mars 2033 orbital mission cannot be realistically scheduled under NASA's current and notional plans," and that "the analysis suggests that a Mars orbital mission could be carried out no earlier than the 2037 orbital window without accepting large technology development, schedule delay, cost overrun, and budget shortfall risks."<ref name='Foust Aug2019'/> A mission to Mars launching in 2033, the report concluded, would need to have [[life support system]]s and propulsion tested by 2022, which is unlikely.<ref name='Foust Aug2019'/> The report estimated that the total cost of the  elements needed for the Mars mission, including SLS, Orion, Gateway, DST and other logistics, at $120.6 billion through fiscal year 2037.<ref name='Foust Aug2019'/>
