'''Girls of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختران خیابان انقلاب}}) was a series of protests against [[Hijab by country#Iran|compulsory hijab]] in Iran. The protests were inspired by '''Vida Movahed''' ({{lang-fa|ویدا موحد}}), an Iranian woman known as the '''Girl of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختر خیابان انقلاب}}), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the [[Enqelab Street|Enghelab Street]] (Revolution Street) of [[Tehran]] on 27 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag.<ref name="al-monitor.com_1"/><ref name="albawaba.com_1"/><ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/><ref name="foxnews.com_1"/> She was arrested on that day<ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/><ref name="foxnews.com_1"/> and was released temporary on bail<ref name="iranhumanrights.org_1"/><ref name="newyorker.com_1"/> a month later, on 28 January 2018.<ref name="independent.co.uk_1"/> Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on [[Masih Alinejad]]'s call for [[White Wednesdays]], a protest movement that the presenter at [[VOA-PNN|VOA Persian Television]] started in early 2017.<ref name="globalvoices.org_1"/><ref name="theguardian.com_1"/><ref name="rferl.org_2"/> Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media.

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==
{{see|Theocracy#Iran}}
In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the [[1979 Islamic revolution]], article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]].<ref name="article_638_iran_law"/> Fines are recalculated in the courts to index for inflation.

Article 639 of the same book says, two types of people shall be sentenced one year to ten years' imprisonment; first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second, a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.<ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/><ref name="article_639_iran_law"/>

These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.<ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/>

== Background ==
Before the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 (during the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran), the hijab was not compulsory,<ref name="El Guindi"/> though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or [[chador]].<ref name="Abrahamian"/>

After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory.<ref name="Milani"/> In 1979, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] announced that women should observe Islamic dress code;<ref name="Milani"/><ref name=Algar84/> His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.<ref name="Milani"/><ref name=Algar84/> Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.<ref name="Milani"/>

In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President [[Hassan Rouhani]], showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab.<ref name="nytimes.com_1"/><ref name="post-gazette.com_1"/> The report was released by the [[Center for Strategic Studies]], the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" on July 2014 in a PDF format.<ref name="css.ir_1"/>

On 2 February 2018, a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Most Iranians feel Trump’s comments in support of protesters didn’t help, poll finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|website=washingtonpost|access-date=2 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202063129/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.<ref name="firstpost.com_1"/> For example, in January 2018, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470|title=Chinese Musician 'Humiliated' in Iran as Hijab Imposed Mid-performance|website=Al Bawaba|access-date=16 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603132039/https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470|archive-date=3 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
