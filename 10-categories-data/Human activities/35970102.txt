A '''caption contest''' or '''caption competition''' is a competition between multiple participants, who are required to give the best description for a certain [[image]] offered by the [[Competition|contest]] organizer. Rules and information about the competition process are also given by the competition organizer.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain problem, or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In several caption contests, [[champion|winners]] are awarded with [[prize]]s.

== History ==
It is considered that the origins of caption contests are related to the increase of [[popularity]] of [[cartoon]]s and [[comics]] as well as widespread use of [[illustration]]s and the rise of [[photojournalism]] in printed media at the end of the 19th century. All these areas share the combination of words and images that could be multiplied and made available to a wide audience with the beginnings of mass printing and wide spread of newspapers and magazines.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/20/business/earlier-media-achieved-critical-mass-printing-press-yelling-stop-presses-didn-t.html D.

From currently available information, the first caption contests in printed media appeared in the [[United States|U.S.]] press of the late 19th century (such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine<ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1920-11-07/ed-1/seq-25/ "$1000.00 in Prizes."

At that time these competitions were called ''picture title'' or ''picture headline'' contests, but their concept and meaning was identical to current caption contests.

== General information ==
Caption contest participants have to describe a given image as accurately and [[originality|originally]] as possible. Contests may vary by image type ([[photograph|photo]] or [[drawing]]), [[Photo caption|caption]] format ([[description]] of a situation or a [[dialogue]]), as well as [[judgement|judging]] criteria. The competition organizer is required to give information about caption submission rules and other information that is important for the contest.

Caption contests are mainly arranged as an [[amusement]], and they can be organized under different conditions (between separate individuals, in public events, [[mass media]], etc.), as well as using various means (drawn pictures on paper, digital image, printed image, press publication, etc.). Traditionally, the most popular and typical format has been publication of caption contests in [[newspaper]]s or [[magazine]]s, but with the development of modern technologies, it is also very popular to organize caption contests on the [[Internet]].

Caption contests can be used not only as an [[entertainment]] but also for other purposes, such as newspaper promotion, bringing forward a certain problem, or product [[advertising|advertisement]]. An important aspect of caption competition is to look at an object, event or issue from unusual point of view.

The caption, unless competition rules do not restrict, can be in any form of literary expression - [[prose]], [[poetry]], as one [[word]] or a [[word play]]. Usually the submitted captions are judged by the originality and [[wit]], but not always the decisive assessment is [[humour]]. It is generally assumed that the caption has to describe image as precisely as possible, so both humour and precision are equally important.

As caption writing is an [[art]] of words, it is rarely possible to evaluate the superiority of one caption over others accurately and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]]. Consequently, the judging of submitted captions is usually quite [[subjectivity|subjective]]. Sometimes competition rules limit caption size, but usually the caption is no longer than one [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] (10 - 20 words). As an exception, the caption can consist of several sentences. Usually it is not allowed to use [[profanity|profane]] or offensive language in submitted captions.

In a children's novel ''[[Absolute Zero (novel)|Absolute Zero]]'' by [[Helen Cresswell]] its character Uncle Parker has won a trip to the [[Caribbean]] in a caption contest. The rest of the family immediately enter similar competitions in an attempt to better his prize but, much of the time, beating the others to an entry form is a victory in itself.

In season two of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', George (played by [[Ted Danson]]) struggles to caption a New Yorker cartoon, which portrays a police duck interacting with a suicidal bear.
