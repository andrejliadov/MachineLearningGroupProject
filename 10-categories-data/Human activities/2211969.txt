An '''administrative centre''' is a seat of regional administration or [[local government]], or a [[county town]], or the place where the central administration of a [[Township|commune]] is located.

In countries with French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate ''capoluogo''), a '''chef-lieu''' ({{IPA-fr|ʃɛfljø}}, plural form ''chefs-lieux'', literally "chief place" or "head place"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute.

==Algeria==
The capital of an [[provinces of Algeria|Algerian Province]] is called a '''chef-lieu'''. The capital of a [[districts of Algeria|district]], the next largest division, is also called a '''chef-lieu'''. While the capital of the lowest division, the [[municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]], is called '''agglomeration de chef-lieu''' (chef-lieu  [[Urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]) and is abbreviated as '''A.C.L.'''

==Belgium==
The '''chef-lieu''' in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten [[Provinces of Belgium]].  Three of these cities also give their name to their province ([[Antwerp]], [[Liège]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]).

==Luxembourg==

Luxembourg is divided into two judicial [[arrondissement]]s (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve [[Cantons of Luxembourg|canton]]s and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: ''Gemengen'').

Arrondissements, districts and cantons have each a '''chef-lieu''' and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.

==France==
The '''chef-lieu of a [[departments of France|département]]''' is known as the ''[[Prefectures in France|préfecture]]''. This is the town or city where the [[prefect]] of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the [[prefecture]]. In every [[French region]], one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of ''Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…'' and the city where the regional prefect is found is known  as ''chef-lieu of the  region'' or,  more commonly, ''Regional prefecture''. The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment.

The '''chef-lieu of an [[arrondissements of France|arrondissement]]''', commonly known as the ''[[Subprefectures in France|sous-préfecture]]'' is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the [[sub-prefecture]]. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the ''Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture'', who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement.

The '''chef-lieu of a [[cantons of France|canton]]''' is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it.  In past decades, there was always a [[Gendarmerie]], a treasurer and a justice of the peace.

The '''chef-lieu of a [[communes of France|commune]]''' is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.

==Jordan==
In the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]], the administrative centres are known as "chief towns" or [[Nahias of Jordan|''nahias'']].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Annex B: Analysis of the municipal sector |work=Third Tourism Development Project, Secondary Cities Revitalization Study |date=24 May 2005 |page=4 |publisher=Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan |url=http://www.mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052114/http://mota.gov.jo/Documents/Municipal_sector.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (''qda''), a district (''liwa''), or a [[Governorates of Jordan|governorate]] (''muhafazah'').

==New Caledonia==
The '''chef-lieu''' indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So [[Nouméa]] is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So [[Wé]] is part of the town of [[Lifou]], but is the chef-lieu of Lifou.  In the [[Loyalty Islands]] and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.

==Francophone West Africa==
Many of the West African states which gained independence from [[France]] in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a ''Chief-Lieu''.  States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include [[Senegal]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Mali]], and [[Niger]].<ref>Bierschenk T., Olivier de Sardan, J.‑P. (eds), 1998, "Les arènes locales face à la décentralisation et démocratisation. Analyses comparatives en milieu rural béninois", in Bierschenk T. & Olivier de Sardan J.-P. (eds), Les pouvoirs au village. Le Bénin rural entre démocratisation et décentralisation, Paris, Karthala : 11‑51.</ref>

Taking [[Communes of Niger|Niger]] and [[Communes of Mali|Mali]] as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu.  The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of [[French West Africa]], and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories.<ref>Claude Fay [La décentralisation dans un Cercle (Tenenkou, Mali). Autrepart: Logiques identitaires, logiques territoriales, 2000, IRD http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/autrepart/010021949.pdf#page=122].</ref>  With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, [[Cercles of Mali]]/[[Departments of Niger]], and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies.<ref>Bréhima Béridogo, [« Processus de Décentralisation au Mali et Couches Sociales Marginalisées », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997 http://apad.revues.org/581]</ref><ref>for Mali, see Bréhima Kassibo, [« La Décentralisation au Mali : État des Lieux », Bulletin de l'APAD, 14, 1997  http://apad.revues.org/579]</ref> The ''chefs-lieux'' of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a "High Council of Collectivites" seated at the nation's capital.  Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a ''Place''/''Site'' (''Site'' in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the ''Chief-Place'' even at the lowest level.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-17%20regime%20financier.pdf REPUBLIQUE DU NIGER Loi n° 2002-017 du 11 JUIN 2002 déterminant le régime financier des Régions, des Départements et des Communes]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref><ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/den/Documents/code_rural/cdrom/doc%20pdf/Loi%20N%B02002-14%20cr%E9ation%20des%20communes.pdf Loi n° 2002-014 du 11 JUIN 2002 portant création des communes et fixant le nom de leurs chefs-lieux]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], the term is applied to the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|inhabited localities]], which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the [[republics of Russia|republics]], for which the term "[[capital city|capital]]" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term "administrative centre" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in [[Ukraine]].

==Sweden==
In [[Sweden]] there are two levels of administrative centre; the local [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipal]] and the regional [[Counties of Sweden|county]].

===Central locality {{Anchor|Municipal central locality}} ===
''Central locality'' ''([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "centralort")'' is a term commonly ascribed to the settlement that serves as a municipal administrative centre. This level handles the local administrative and political tasks of the surrounding settlements. Since [[central place theory]] was the guiding principle during the municipal reform 1962–1977, most municipalities were dominated by a larger urban area where the political seat was located. Most municipalities are named for their central locality, but there are several exceptions.

There are many deviations from the central locality principle. Some municipalities are dominated by two or more towns of similar size, and sometimes they share the municipal administration, with the municipality having its official address in one of the towns. For example, both [[Skillingaryd]] and [[Vaggeryd]] are central localities of [[Vaggeryd Municipality]]. Conversely, there are municipalities within [[Metropolitan Areas of Sweden|metropolitan areas]]. For example, there are twenty-six municipalities within the [[Stockholm metropolitan area]].

The term ''central locality'' has no legal standing and it is unclear how it should be applied to these municipalities. Some municipalities appointing one or several localities to be the central locality.

===Residence city {{Anchor|County residence city}} ===
A ''residence city'' (Swedish: "residensstad") is the town or city which is the [[County administrative boards of Sweden|political and administrative seat of the county]]. This level handles the more regional political and administrative tasks of the county, such as healthcare and [[public transport]]. The name comes from that this is the town or city where the governor ''([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "landshövding")'' have their [[residence]]. There are some exceptions to this, however. In the newer amalgamated "greater counties", often referred to as "regions", the administrative centre is placed in one of the older ''residence cities''. Examples of this is  [[Malmö]] in [[Skåne Regional Council|Region Scania]] and [[Gothenburg]] in the [[Västra Götaland Regional Council|Västra Götaland Region]].

==Switzerland==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is applied to the capital of each [[Swiss canton]].  In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.

==Tunisia==
The term '''chef-lieu''' is used to designate the capital of each  '''gouvernorat''' (department).  Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into '''delegations'''  (districts) which each have a central city as '''chef-lieu of delegation'''.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] it is the centre of a [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authority]], which is distinct from a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|historic county]] with a county town.

==Popular culture==
* ''[[A Very Curious Girl|The Fiancée of the pirate]]'' (1969) is a film by [[Nelly Kaplan]], where the action takes place in a hamlet where everyone spends their time worrying about what everyone thinks about the chef-lieu of the town.
