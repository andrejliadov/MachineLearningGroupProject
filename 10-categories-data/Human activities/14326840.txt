Smith]] to identify and describe the many forms, past and present, of ''writing on food'' and ''letters as food''.  The term is a concatenation of ''esca'' (from Latin meaning "victuals" or "things to be eaten") and ''graph'' (after the Greek meaning: "mark" or the infinitive verb "to write").

== History ==
Research has identified examples of escagraphs as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]] <ref name=BREASTED>'''[[James Henry Breasted]]''' 1962	''Ancient Records of Egypt'' (New York: Russell & Russell, Inc.).</ref> and the [[Roman Empire]],<ref name=GUSMAN>'''Gusman, Pierre''' 1900	''Pompeii: The City, Its Life and Art'' (London, William Heinemann).</ref> primarily bread with words stamped into them prior to baking.   Use of escagraphs waned a bit during periods of [[early Christianity]] <ref name=GALAVARIS>'''Galavaris, George''' 1970	''Bread and the Liturgy: The Symbolism of Early Christian and Byzantine Bread Stamps'' (Madison, University of Wisconsin Press). {{ISBN|0-299-05310-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-05310-9}}.</ref> to the 19th century, though some interesting examples exist in [[Assize of Bread and Ale|bread assizes]] and [[Subtlety|sotelties]].

== Examples ==
=== Sweet ===
Most forms of escagraphs today are sweet, either molded into or drawn onto the surface of the food.  Cakes with "Happy Birthday" are extremely common.  Heart-shaped candies<ref name=NECCO>'''Necco Sweatheart'''

Many chocolate bars bear the name of their maker imprinted on their surface.<ref name=HERSHEY>'''Hershey's Chocolate Bar with Almonds'''<br>

=== Moveable Type ===
From alphabet cookies to cereal to pasta, letters and moveable type are very common even today.  Throughout the western world, cookies shaped as letters are made both as edible toys and ostensibly to help children learn their letters.  Many manufacturers provide alphabet pasta letters (and numbers) in both ready-to-eat and dry forms.
