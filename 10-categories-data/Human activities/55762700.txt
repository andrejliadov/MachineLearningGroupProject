'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly for the [[United Kingdom]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]].<ref>[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.</ref><ref>[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.</ref>  Nevertheless, the two terms ''hegemon'' and ''global policeman'' are not identical in meaning.  The former term defines capacity for dominant control anywhere on earth, whereas the latter may also include small or large areas ''outside control'', along with monitoring and attempted enforcements, but does not define any level of effectiveness.

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] seeks to take over the role<ref name="Stop fretting">[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.</ref> as it reaches out to control [[shipping lanes]] and protect its overseas workers and interests.

==In international law==
{{Further|Westphalian sovereignty}}
No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied, although, in reality some states are relatively [[List of modern great powers|more powerful]] than others. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].<ref>[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109</ref>

==Comparison with state policing==

Within [[Sovereign state|states]], law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.<ref>Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102</ref>

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.<ref>[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.</ref> The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13 July 2016</ref>) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.<ref>[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016</ref>

==History==

The UK made efforts to end the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]<ref>http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk>pdf>britain-and-the-trade.pdf</ref> In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sevastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914â€“1945 no one state was hegemonic, with [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] power decreasing, but still very much a leading, world role, and with rising powers such as the United States, the [[Empire of Japan]], and later [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].<ref>'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014</ref>

Between the years 1945 to 1990, the world trade as dominated by the Soviet Union and the United States in what was known to be the [[Cold War]].

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'<ref>[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[Independent Institute]], 20/3/2015</ref> Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.<ref>ibid,</ref> But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]<ref>[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013</ref> and [[Rwanda]].<ref>[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.</ref>

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.<ref>[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008</ref><ref>[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003</ref>

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.<ref>[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011</ref><ref>[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013</ref> As the 21st century progresses, the morality of global policing itself is increasingly in question, with the inevitable loss of self-determination by nations in which intervention occurs.<ref>[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016</ref> Furthermore, with the advent of non-state threats to global security, prior legal justifications such as general '[[law of war|laws of war]]' are of questionable jurisdiction.
