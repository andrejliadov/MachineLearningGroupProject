AITAF serves all branches of the military at US installations domestically and abroad. They choose content that features diverse themes, ages, ethnicities and experiences.<ref name=":0" /> Following each of AITAF’s events, the artists interact with the audience through a question and answer session.<ref name=":0" />

AITAF’s goal is "to use the powerfully emotional shared experience of the arts to start conversations capable of bridging the divides between military and civilian, service member and family member, the world of the arts and the world of practical action."<ref name=":0" />

== The Bridge Awards ==

In 2018, '''The Bridge Award for Playwriting''' was established in honor of AITAF's tenth anniversary with the purpose of recognizing an emerging playwright of exceptional talent within the United States military. The biennial (as of 2020) award consists of a $10,000 prize, and an AITAF produced reading of the winning work. 

In addition to bringing world-class theater to the military, AITAF is committed to supporting and sharing the talents of those who serve. This Award offers a deserving current military service member or veteran artist important connections with the theater community and access to developmental resources, helping to facilitate a deeper understanding and more active dialogue between military and civilian communities.

The Bridge Award for Playwriting winner is chosen by a selection committee, judged each year by a notable playwright. Past judges include [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners [[Suzan-Lori Parks]] and [[Tony Kushner]].<ref name="NYT Bridge Award">{{cite web |last1=Ugwu |first1=Reggie |title=Adam Driver’s Nonprofit Seeks Soldiers for the Stage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/theater/adam-driver-arts-armed-forces-award.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

2020 Bridge Award Winner: LOCAL GODS by Anton Sattler (U.S. Marine Corps Veteran)



'''The Bridge Award for Screenwriting''' was established in 2020. This biennial Award is open to all persons who are currently serving or have served in the United States military, regardless of age, experience, or background. This Award seeks to identify and encourage talented screenwriters/filmmakers from the military community. First time screenwriters are encouraged to apply, and the Award is particularly interested in elevating and celebrating underrepresented voices and stories. The Award gives aspiring filmmakers with a military background the resources and mentorship to advance their visions and refine their work. It encourages members of the military community to conceive of themselves as artists and to tell their important and powerful stories.

This Award was created as a cinematic corollary to AITAF’s successful Bridge Award for Playwriting

== Student Veteran Internship Program ==
In the summer of 2018, AITAF launched an internship program for student veterans. AITAF is committed to providing work and learning opportunities to veterans currently enrolled full-time in a college or university. By offering a summer housing stipend comparable to what a student might receive as part of the GI Bill, AITAF aims to create a rigorous, competitive program that offers a unique opportunity for a summer intern to relocate to New York City for the duration of the internship. 

They hire a new student veteran every summer, spring, and fall. 

2018 Summer Intern: Daní Rodriguez (U.S. Marine Corps Veteran)

2019 Spring Intern: Shyendra Chandrasena (U.S. Coast Guard Veteran)

2019 Summer Intern: Brian Lepak (U.S. Marine Corps Veteran)

2020 Spring Intern: Cole Smith (U.S. Air Force Veteran)

== In the Media ==
