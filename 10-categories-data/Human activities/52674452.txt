A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].
