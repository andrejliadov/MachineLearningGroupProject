A '''game''' is a structured form of [[play (activity)|play]], usually undertaken for [[enjoyment|entertainment]] or [[fun]], and sometimes used as an [[education]]al tool.<ref name="merriam-webster.com">{{cite web |title=Definition of GAME |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/game |website=www.merriam-webster.com |access-date=May 7, 2017 }}</ref> Games are distinct from [[Manual labor|work]], which is usually carried out for [[wikt:remuneration|remuneration]], and from [[art]], which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as [[professional sports|professional]] players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as [[jigsaw puzzle]]s or games involving an artistic layout such as [[Mahjong]], [[solitaire]], or some [[video games]]).

Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Key components of games are goals, [[wikt:rule|rules]], [[wikt:challenge|challenge]], and [[interaction]]. Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical [[skills]], serve as a form of [[exercise]], or otherwise perform an [[education]]al, [[simulation]]al, or [[psychological]] role.

===Ludwig Wittgenstein===
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word ''game''. In his ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'',<ref name="wittgen">{{cite book

|publisher=Blackwell|title-link=Philosophical Investigations
}}</ref> Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as [[play (activity)|play]], rules, and [[competition]], all fail to adequately define what games are. From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term ''game'' to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call [[family resemblance]]s. As the following game definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers, like [[Thomas Hurka]], think that Wittgenstein was wrong and that [[Bernard Suits]]' definition is a good answer to the problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtualphilosopher.com/2007/12/was-wittgenstei.html |title=Was Wittgenstein Wrong About Games? |publisher=Nigel Warburton] |year=2007 |access-date=2013-06-28}}</ref>

===Roger Caillois===
French sociologist [[Roger Caillois]], in his book ''Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men)'',<ref name="callois">{{cite book
|title=Les jeux et les hommes

* ''fun'': the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character
* ''separate'': it is circumscribed in time and place
* ''uncertain'': the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable
* ''non-productive'': participation does not accomplish anything useful
* ''governed by rules'': the activity has rules that are different from everyday life
* ''fictitious'': it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality

===Chris Crawford===

}}</ref> using a series of [[dichotomy|dichotomies]]:
# Creative expression is ''[[art]]'' if made for its own beauty, and ''[[entertainment]]'' if made for [[money]].
# A piece of entertainment is a ''[[play (activity)|plaything]]'' if it is [[interactive]]. [[Movies]] and [[book]]s are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.
# If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a ''[[toy]]''. ''(Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[SimCity]]'' are toys, not games.)'' If it has goals, a plaything is a ''challenge''.
# If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete", it is a ''[[puzzle]]''; if there is one, it is a ''conflict''. ''(Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably [[algorithm]]ic [[artificial intelligence]] can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade [[Pac-Man#Ghosts|ghosts in ''Pac-Man'']].)''
# Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a ''competition''. ''(Competitions include [[racing]] and [[figure skating]].)'' However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.

Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as{{original research inline|date=July 2013}}: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.

Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment and games are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain.

==Gameplay elements and classification==
Games can be characterized by "what the player does".<ref name="craw"/> This is often referred to as [[gameplay]]. Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.

===Tools===
[[File:Game pieces.jpg|thumb|A selection of pieces from different games. From top: [[Chess]] pawns, [[marbles]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] tokens, [[dominoes]], Monopoly hotels, [[jacks (game)|jacks]] and [[checkers]] pieces.]]
Games are often [[game classification|classified]] by the components required to play them (e.g. [[miniatures game|miniatures]], a [[ball game|ball]], [[card game|cards]], [[board game|a board and pieces]], or a [[computer game|computer]]). In places where the use of [[leather]] is well-established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as [[rugby football|rugby]], [[basketball]], [[soccer (football)]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[volleyball]]. Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of [[playing card]]s. Other games such as [[chess]] may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces.

Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token may be a pawn on a board, [[play money]], or an intangible item such as a point scored.

Games such as [[hide-and-seek]] or [[tag (game)|tag]] do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment. Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a [[school]] building differs from the same game in a [[park]]; an [[auto race]] can be radically different depending on the [[race track|track]] or [[street racing|street]] course, even with the same cars.

===Rules and aims===
Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules. While rules are [[house rules|subject to variations and changes]], enough change in the rules usually results in a "new" game. For instance, [[baseball]] can be played with "real" baseballs or with [[wiffleball]]s. However, if the players decide to play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different game. There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable [[meta]]-rules.

Rules generally determine [[Turns, rounds and timekeeping systems in games|the time-keeping system]], the rights and responsibilities of the players, and each player's goals. Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens.

The rules of a game are to be distinguished from its aims.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwyzer|first=Hubert|date=October 1969|title=Rules and Practices|journal=The Philosophical Review|volume=78|issue=4|pages=451–467|doi=10.2307/2184198|issn=0031-8108|jstor=2184198}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> For most competitive games, the ''ultimate'' ‘aim’ is winning: in this sense, checkmate is the aim of chess.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Gary|date=2007|title=Assertion as a practice|journal=Truth and Speech Acts: Studies in the Philosophy of Language}}</ref> Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in [[Settlers of Catan]]), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's [[checkmate]]). However, when we talk about the aims of a game, we also refer to ''intermediate'' aims: the things that you have to do in order to win the game. For instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase your likelihood to win the game (but isn't alone sufficient to win the game).

Aims are not just a 'special' kind of rules: the difference between the rules of a game and the aims of a game is a fundamental one. This can be seen by considering some examples. The aim of chess is to checkmate, but although it is expected that players will ''try'' to checkmate each other, it is not a rule of chess that a player ''must'' checkmate the other player whenever he can (as a matter of fact, unskilled players often fail to take the opportunity to do so). Similarly, it is not a rule of [[football]] that a player must score a goal if he shoots a penalty (it is only expected, and not required, that he will try). On a general level, the distinction between the rules and the aims of a game can be characterised as follows: an aim identifies a [[Sufficient Condition|sufficient condition]] for successful action, whereas the rule identifies a [[necessary condition]] for permissible action.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Marsili|first=Neri|date=2018-06-12|title=Truth and assertion: rules versus aims|journal=Analysis|volume=78|issue=4|pages=638–648|doi=10.1093/analys/any008|issn=0003-2638|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/127177/7/MARTAA-35v1.pdf}}</ref> While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a game merely requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow them; it rarely (if ever) requires luck or demanding skills.

===Skill, strategy, and chance===
A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring [[skill]], [[strategy]], [[luck]], or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly.

[[Games of skill]] include games of physical skill, such as [[wrestling]], [[tug of war]], [[hopscotch]], [[shooting sport|target shooting]], and [[stake (lawn game)|stake]], and games of mental skill such as [[checkers]] and [[chess]]. [[Games of strategy]] include checkers, chess, [[Go (board game)|Go]], [[arimaa]], and [[tic-tac-toe]], and often require special equipment to play them. [[Games of chance]] include [[gambling]] games ([[blackjack]], [[Mahjong]], [[roulette]], etc.), as well as [[snakes and ladders]] and [[rock, paper, scissors]]; most require equipment such as cards or [[dice]]. However, most games contain two or all three of these elements. For example, [[American football]] and [[baseball]] involve both physical skill and strategy while [[tiddlywinks]], [[poker]], and [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] combine strategy and chance. Many card and board games combine all three; most [[trick-taking game]]s involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as [[Risk (game)|Risk]], [[Settlers of Catan]], and [[Carcassonne (board game)|Carcassonne]].

===Single-player games===
Most games require multiple players. However, single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a one-player game is a battle solely against an element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own skills, against time, or against chance. Playing with a [[yo-yo]] or playing [[tennis]] against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a game due to the lack of any formidable opposition. Many games described as "single-player" may be termed actually [[puzzle]]s or [[recreation]]s.

===Multiplayer games{{anchor|Multiplayer}}===
{{Redirect|Multiplayer game|multiplayer video games|Multiplayer video game|section=yes}}
[[File:The Card Players by Lucas van Leyden.jpg|right|thumb|''The Card Players'' by [[Lucas van Leyden]] (1520) depicting a multiplayer card game.]]
A multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent opponents or [[team]]s. Games with many independent players are difficult to analyze formally using [[game theory]] as the players may form and switch [[coalition]]s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/gametheorysocial0001binm_1994 |url-access=registration |title=Game Theory and the Social Contract |author=K.G. Binmore |isbn=978-0-262-02444-0 |publisher=MIT Press |year=1994}}</ref> The term "game" in this context may mean either a true game played for entertainment, or a competitive activity describable in principle by mathematical game theory.

====Game theory====
{{main|Game theory}}
[[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] proved that games with several players have a stable solution provided that coalitions between players are disallowed. Nash won the [[Nobel prize]] for [[economics]] for this important result which extended [[Minimax|von Neumann's theory]] of [[zero-sum]] games. Nash's stable solution is known as the [[Nash equilibrium]].<ref name=moral>{{cite book |title=Moral calculations: game theory, logic, and human frailty |author1=Laszlo Mero |author2=Anna C. Gosi-Greguss |author3=David Kramer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqQjX-S1idsC |isbn=978-0-387-98419-3 |year=1998 |publisher=Copernicus |location=New York}}</ref>

If cooperation between players is allowed, then the game becomes more complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such games. While these have had some partial success in the fields of economics, [[politics]] and [[Conflict resolution|conflict]], no good general theory has yet been developed.<ref name=moral/>

In [[quantum game theory]], it has been found that the introduction of [[quantum information]] into multiplayer games allows a new type of [[equilibrium strategy]] not found in traditional games. The [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] of players's choices can have the effect of a [[contract]] by preventing players from profiting from what is known as ''betrayal''.<ref>{{Cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review A]] |title=Multiplayer quantum games |author1=Simon C.

==Types==

{{See also|List of types of games}}
[[File:Tug-of-war.jpg|thumb|[[Tug of war]] is an easily organized, impromptu game that requires little equipment]]
Games can take a variety of forms, from competitive [[sport]]s to [[board game]]s and [[video game]]s.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:UEFA-Women's Cup Final 2005 at Potsdam 1.jpg|thumb|[[Soccer (football)|Association football]]  is a popular sport worldwide.|alt=]]
Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields, leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of players. A [[city]] or [[town]] may set aside such resources for the organization of sports leagues.

Popular sports may have [[spectator sport|spectators]] who are entertained just by watching games. A community will often align itself with a local sports team that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its players only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their opponents or have traditional rivalries. The concept of [[fan (aficionado)|fandom]] began with sports fans.

Certain competitive sports, such as [[racing]] and [[gymnastics]], are not games by definitions such as Crawford's (see above)&nbsp;– despite the inclusion of many in the [[Olympic Games]]&nbsp;– because competitors do not interact with their opponents; they simply challenge each other in indirect ways.

====Lawn games====
[[Lawn game]]s are outdoor games that can be played on a [[lawn]]; an area of mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a [[sports field]] (pitch). Variations of many games that are traditionally played on a sports field are [[marketing|marketed]] as "lawn games" for home use in a front or back yard. Common lawn games include [[horseshoes]], [[sholf]], [[croquet]], [[bocce]], [[lawn bowls]], and [[stake (lawn game)|stake]].

===Tabletop games===
{{Main|Tabletop game}}
A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply placing, picking up and moving game pieces. Most of these games are played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the game's elements are located. However, many games falling into this category, particularly [[party game]]s, are more free-form in their play and can involve physical activity such as mime. Still, these games do not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of strength or stamina, or specialized equipment other than what comes in a box.

====Dexterity and coordination games====
This class of games includes any game in which the skill element involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but excludes the class of video games (see below). Games such as [[Knucklebones|jacks]], [[paper football]], and [[Jenga]] require only very portable or improvised equipment and can be played on any flat level surface, while other examples, such as [[pinball]], [[billiards]], [[air hockey]], [[foosball]], and [[table hockey games|table hockey]] require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on which the game is played. The advent of home video game systems largely replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey, billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and public game rooms. These games and others, as they require reflexes and coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such the games are popular as [[drinking games]]. In addition, dedicated drinking games such as [[Quarters (drinking game)|quarters]] and [[beer pong]] also involve physical coordination and are popular for similar reasons.

====Board games====
{{Main|Board game}}
[[File:Clann.jpg|thumb|right|[[Parcheesi]] is an American adaptation of a [[Pachisi]], originating in India.]]
Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status, resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens. Many also involve [[dice]] or cards. Most games that simulate war are board games (though a large number of [[video game]]s have been created to simulate strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players' tokens move. Virtually all board games involve "turn-based" play; one player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does the same, and a player can only act on their turn. This is opposed to "real-time" play as is found in some card games, most sports and most video games.

Some games, such as [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]], are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element for their interest. Such games are usually described as having "[[perfect information]]"; the only unknown is the exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any unknown event inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll). Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as [[Candy Land]] and [[Chutes and Ladders]] having virtually no decisions to be made. By some definitions, such as that by [[Greg Costikyan]], they are not games since there are no decisions to make which affect the outcome.<ref>{{Cite web |title=I Have No Words & I Must Design |url=http://www.costik.com/nowords.html |last=Costikyan |first=Greg |author-link=Greg Costikyan |year=1994 |access-date=2008-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812015347/http://www.costik.com/nowords.html |archive-date=2008-08-12 }}</ref> Many other games involving a high degree of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player within the game, which is independent of any other player; the "game" then is actually a "race" by definitions such as Crawford's.

Most other board games combine strategy and luck factors; the game of [[backgammon]] requires players to decide the best strategic move based on the roll of two [[dice]]. Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets. [[German-style board game]]s are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board games.

Board game groups include [[race games]], [[:Category:Roll-and-move board games|roll-and-move]] games, [[abstract strategy games]], [[word games]], and [[wargaming|wargames]], as well as [[trivia]] and other elements. Some board games fall into multiple groups or incorporate elements of other genres: [[Cranium (game)|Cranium]] is one popular example, where players must succeed in each of four skills: artistry, live performance, trivia, and language.

====Card games====
{{Main|Card game}}
{{further|Collectible card game}}
[[File:Theodoor Rombouts - Kaartspelers.JPG|thumb|''Playing Cards'', by [[Theodoor Rombouts]], 17th century]]
Card games use a deck of cards as their central tool. These cards may be a standard [[Playing card#Anglo-American|Anglo-American]] (52-card) deck of [[playing cards]] (such as for [[Contract Bridge|bridge]], [[poker]], [[Rummy]], etc.), a regional deck using 32, 36 or 40&nbsp;cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game [[skat (card game)|skat]]), a [[tarot card games|tarot deck]] of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of [[trick-taking game]]s collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as ''[[Set (game)|Set]]'' or [[1000 Blank White Cards]]). [[Uno (card game)|Uno]] and [[Rook (card game)|Rook]] are examples of games that were originally played with a standard deck and have since been commercialized with customized decks. Some [[collectible card game]]s such as ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' are played with a small selection of cards that have been collected or purchased individually from large available sets.

Some board games include a deck of cards as a gameplay element, normally for randomization or to keep track of game progress. Conversely, some card games such as [[Cribbage]] use a board with movers, normally to keep score. The differentiation between the two genres in such cases depends on which element of the game is foremost in its play; a board game using cards for random actions can usually use some other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be scored on paper. These elements as used are simply the traditional and easiest methods to achieve their purpose.

Dice games use a number of [[dice]] as their central element. Board games often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the central indicator of the person's standing in the game. Popular dice games include ''[[Yahtzee]]'', [[Farkle]], [[Bunco]], [[Liar's dice]]/[[Perudo]], and [[Poker dice]]. As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce [[random number generator|apparently random numbers]], these games usually involve a high degree of luck, which can be directed to some extent by the player through more strategic elements of play and through tenets of [[probability theory]]. Such games are thus popular as gambling games; the game of [[Craps]] is perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were originally conceived of as gambling games.

====Domino and tile games====
{{Main|Tile-based game|Dominoes}}
Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the generic device is instead a set of tiles called [[dominoes]], which traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or "pips", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears on a tile is unique in the set. The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's "hand" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board. Sets vary in the number of possible dots on one end, and thus of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common set historically is ''double-six'', though in more recent times "extended" sets such as ''double-nine'' have been introduced to increase the number of dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a game. [[Muggins]], [[Mexican Train]], and [[Chicken Foot (domino game)|Chicken Foot]] are very popular domino games. [[Texas 42]] is a domino game more similar in its play to a "trick-taking" [[card game]].

Variations of traditional dominoes abound: [[Triominoes]] are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile. Similarly, a game known as [[Quad-Ominos]] uses four-sided tiles.

Some other games use tiles in place of cards; [[Rummikub]] is a variant of the [[Rummy]] card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck "pack" of Anglo-American [[playing cards]]. [[Mahjong]] is another game very similar to [[Rummy]] that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art.

Lastly, some games use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which other elements of the game are played. [[Settlers of Catan]] and [[Carcassonne (board game)|Carcassonne]] are examples. In each, the "board" is made up of a series of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but static, while in Carcassonne the game is played by "building" the board tile-by-tile. [[Hive (game)|Hive]], an abstract strategy game using tiles as moving pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to [[chess]], although it has no board; the pieces themselves both form the layout and can move within it.

====Pencil and paper games====
Pencil and paper games require little or no specialized equipment other than writing materials, though some such games have been commercialized as board games (''[[Scrabble]]'', for instance, is based on the idea of a [[crossword puzzle]], and [[tic-tac-toe]] sets with a boxed grid and pieces are available commercially). These games vary widely, from games centering on a design being drawn such as ''[[Pictionary]]'' and "connect-the-dots" games like [[sprouts (game)|sprouts]], to letter and word games such as ''[[Boggle]]'' and ''[[Scattergories]]'', to solitaire and logic puzzle games such as [[Sudoku]] and [[crossword puzzles]].

====Guessing games====
{{main|Guessing game}}
A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word. [[Charades]] is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as ''[[Catch Phrase (game)|Catch Phrase]]'', ''[[Taboo (game)|Taboo]]'', ''[[Pictionary]]'', and similar. The genre also includes many [[game shows]] such as ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', ''[[Password (American game show)|Password]]'' and ''[[$25,000 Pyramid]]''.

===Video games===
{{Main|Video game}}
{{See also|Electronic game}}
Video games are [[computer]]- or [[microprocessor]]-controlled games. Computers can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types. Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design, each with its own set of rules or goals.

A computer or video game uses one or more [[input device]]s, typically a [[button (control)|button]]/[[joystick]] combination (on [[arcade games]]); a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or [[trackball]] ([[computer games]]); or a [[Game controller|controller]] or a motion sensitive tool ([[Video game console|console games]]). More esoteric devices such as [[paddle (game controller)|paddle controllers]] have also been used for input.

There are many genres of video game; the first commercial video game, ''[[Pong]]'', was a simple simulation of [[table tennis]]. As processing power increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles. This "real-time" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to "turn-based" strategy; this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically. Additionally, the playing of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or simulations of sports. Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table games such as [[chess]], leading to simulations of such games that can be played by a single player.

In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style games, the game provides a virtual environment in which the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe. Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred some debate on whether these should be considered "games" or "toys". (Crawford specifically mentions [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]'s ''[[SimCity]]'' as an example of a toy.)<ref name="craw"/>

====Online games====
{{Main|Online game}}
[[Online games]] have been part of culture from the very earliest days of [[computer network|networked]] and [[time-share]]d computers. Early commercial systems such as [[PLATO (computer system)|Plato]] were at least as widely famous for their games as for their strictly educational value. In 1958, ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' dominated Visitor's Day and drew attention to the [[oscilloscope]] at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]; during the 1980s, [[Xerox PARC]] was known mainly for ''[[Maze War]]'', which was offered as a hands-on demo to visitors.

Modern online games are played using an Internet connection; some have dedicated [[client (computing)|client]] programs, while [[browser game|others]] require only a [[web browser]]. Some simpler browser games appeal to more casual gaming demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very few video games.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Bob|date=March 2011|title=Never Too Old to Play: The Appeal of Digital Games to an Older Audience|journal=Games and Culture|language=en-US|volume=6|issue=2|pages=155–170|doi=10.1177/1555412010364978|issn=1555-4120}}</ref>

===Role-playing games===
{{Main|Role-playing game}}
Role-playing games, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of game in which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting in a fictional setting. The original role playing games&nbsp;– or at least those explicitly marketed as such&nbsp;– are played with a handful of participants, usually face-to-face, and keep track of the developing fiction with pen and paper. Together, the players may collaborate on a story involving those characters; create, develop, and "explore" the setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of everyday life. Pen-and-paper role-playing games include, for example, ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and ''[[GURPS]]''.

The term ''role-playing game'' has also been appropriated by the video game industry to describe [[role-playing video game|a genre of video games]]. These may be single-player games where one player experiences a programmed environment and story, or they may allow players to interact through the internet. The experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing games. Single-player games include ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect]]''. Online multi-player games, often referred to as [[Massively multiplayer online game|Massively Multiplayer Online role playing games]], or MMORPGs, include ''[[RuneScape]]'', ''[[EverQuest 2]]'', ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[MapleStory]]'', ''[[Anarchy Online]]'', and ''[[Dofus]]''. {{As of|2009}}, the most successful MMORPG has been ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', which controls the vast majority of the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmogchart.com/analysis-and-conclusions/ |title=An Analysis of MMOG Subscription Growth |last=Woodcock |first=Bruce Sterling |access-date=2008-11-16 |year=2008}}</ref>

===Business games===
{{Main|Team building}}
Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board games to interactive games involving different props (balls, ropes, hoops, etc.) and different kinds of activities. The purpose of these games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to generate discussions about business improvement. Many business games focus on organizational behaviors. Some of these are computer simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing. Team building is a common focus of such activities.

===Simulation===
{{Main|Simulation game}}
The term "game" can include simulation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roleplaysim.org/papers/ |title=Roleplay Simulation for Teaching and Learning |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205122144/http://www.roleplaysim.org/papers/ |archive-date=2008-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playburg.com |title=Roleplay Simulation Gamer Site |publisher=Playburg.com |access-date=2009-07-29}}</ref> or re-enactment of various activities or use in "real life" for various purposes: e.g., [[training]], analysis, prediction. Well-known examples are [[military exercise|war games]] and [[role-playing]]. The root of this meaning may originate in the human prehistory of games deduced by [[anthropology]] from observing [[primitive culture]]s, in which children's games mimic the activities of adults to a significant degree: [[hunting]], [[war]]ring, [[nursing]], etc. These kinds of games are preserved in modern times.{{Original research inline|date=February 2009}}
