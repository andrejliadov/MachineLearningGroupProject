'''Art-based research''' is a mode of formal qualitative inquiry that uses artistic processes  in order to understand and articulate the subjectivity of human experience.<ref>Denzin, Norman K., and Yvonna S.

Routledge (2013).</ref><ref>Baden, Maggi Savin, and Katherine Wimpenny. A practical guide to arts-related research. Springer, 2014.</ref>

The term was first coined by [[Elliot Eisner]]  (1933 - 2014) who was a professor of Art and Education at the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]] and  one of the United States' leading academic minds.<ref>Vanderbilt University News, 'Artist Educator Elliot Eisner to Speak at Vanderbilt'.

September 13, 2006.</ref><ref>Tampa Bay Times Bulletin Board, 'School Reform Lecture', St. Petersburg, FL, USA: St. Petersburg Times Newspaper. 21 January 1999. p43.</ref>

Eisner used the term 'art-based research' as the title of a conference presentation held at [[Stanford University]] in 1993.<ref>Wang, Qingchun, Sara Coemans, Richard Siegesmund, and Karin Hannes.

Subsequently, the concept of art-based research was defined by [[Lesley University |Shaun McNiff]], professor of [[expressive therapies|Creative Arts Therapies]] at Lesley College, as 'the systematic use of the artistic process, the actual making of artistic expressions in all of the different forms of the arts, as a primary way of understanding and examining experience by both researchers and the people that they involve in their studies.'<ref>McNiff, Shaun. Art-based research. Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1998.</ref> It was later additionally defined as 'research that uses the arts,  in the broadest broadest sense, to explore, understand, represent and even challenge human action and experience'.<ref>Baden, Maggi Savin, and Katherine Wimpenny. A practical guide to arts-related research. Springer, 2014.</ref>

Many practitioners of art-based research trace the origins of their approach to the work of German arts theorist and psychologist [[Rudolf Arnheim]],<ref>Arnheim, Rudolf. Art and visual perception: A psychology of the creative eye. Univ of California Press, 1965. </ref><ref>Arnheim, Rudolf. Toward a psychology of art: Collected essays. Vol. 242. Univ of California Press, 1966.</ref> and American philosopher [[Susanne Langer]],<ref>Langer, Susanne K. Philosophy in a new key: A study in the symbolism of reason, rite, and art. Harvard University Press, 2009.</ref><ref>Langer, S. "Feeling and Form: A Theory of Art/Langer S." New York: Charles Scribner’s (1953). </ref> both of whom elucidated the use of artistic experimentation and production as a means by which to acquire and document knowledge about the art, the artist, and its audience, inspiring a range of academic programs that facilitated students in using the process of making art, including performance, painting, and music as the means by which to understand the nature of human experience, teaching, and learning.<ref>Knowles, J. Gary, and Ardra L. Cole. Handbook of the arts in qualitative research: Perspectives, methodologies, examples, and issues. Sage, 2008.</ref>

Expanding on Eisner's ideas, researchers in Canada developed a discipline they named 'a/r/tography', a hybrid form of practice-based research within education and the arts.<ref> Irwin, R., & de Cosson, A. (Eds.)(2002). a/r/tography: Rendering self through arts‐based living inquiry. Vancouver, BC: Pacific Educational Press.</ref><ref>Springgay, S., Irwin, R. L., Leggo, C., & Gouzouasis, P. (2007).

Commitments to a community of artistic inquiry: Becoming pedagogical through a/r/tography in teacher education. International Journal of Education & the Arts, 14(1). Available at http://www.ijea.org/v14n1/v14n1.pdf</ref> A/R/Tography stands for (a)rtmaking, (r)esearching, and (t)eaching. It is a popular methodology for artists, teachers and makers in which A/R/Tography transforms information and the relationships between art-making, research and theory in order to inform the public on various issues. For example, Australian artist, art theorist, and educator, Graeme Sullivan, states that, “Arts-informed researchers, [Artographers], and the like, have a similar interest in schools, community and culture, but their focus is on developing the practitioner-researcher who is capable of imaginative and insightful inquiry”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Graeme|date=2006|title=Research Acts in Art Practice|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00393541.2006.11650497|journal=Studies in Art Education|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=19–35|doi=10.1080/00393541.2006.11650497|issn=0039-3541}}</ref> 

Further developments in arts-based approaches as a means of communicating complex research ideas from diverse research sources have been a component of this innovation, merging the domains of arts-based research and knowledge translation research in the health science and the social sciences. This domain of arts-based knowledge translation has been developed by [[Mandy Archibald]], assistant professor and interdisciplinary artist at the University of Manitoba and others. <ref> Archibald, M., Caine, V., & Scott, S.D. (2014). The development of a classification schema for arts-based approaches to knowledge translation. Worldviews on Evidence Based Nursing, 11(5), 316-324.</ref>

Today, art-based research is employed not only in arts education, but also in [[health care]], and the [[social science|social]] and [[behavioral sciences| behavioral]] sciences.<ref>Butler-Kisber, Lynn.
