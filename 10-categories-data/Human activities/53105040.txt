A '''democratic intervention''' is a [[military intervention]] by external forces with the aim of assisting [[democratization]] of the country where the intervention takes place.<ref name=":6" /> Examples include [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name=":6">Merkel, W. and Grimm, S., 2008.

[[File:Macarthur hirohito.jpg|thumb|314x314px|[[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] and General MacArthur at the U.S. Embassy, Tokyo, 27 September, 1945.|alt=|left]]
The occupation of Japan and Germany following the victory of the Allies in World War II are early examples of democratic intervention.<ref>Hobson, C., 2015. Democracy Promotion. In: B. Isakhan and S. Stockwell, ed., ''The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy''. [online] Edinburgh University Press, pp.455-466. Available at: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb.43> [Accessed 18 March 2020].</ref> In Japan during the years 1947 to 1952, the wartime cabinet was removed via military aggression and was replaced by a cabinet acceptable to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and one that would implement the [[Potsdam Declaration]] which called for the promotion of a [[Parliamentary Democracy|parliamentary democracy]]. The United States Government took an active role in shaping the policies of the democratic intervention into Japan. The United States Government encouraged democratic reform by sending billions of dollars in foreign aid in exchange for increased democratization.<ref>Takemae, E., 2003. ''Allied Occupation of Japan''. A&C Black, p.126</ref> [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] outlawed cultural practices such as [[prostitution]] for being against the ideals of democracy and imposed the promotion of democratic values in all facets of education.<ref>Tanaka, Y., 2003. Japan's Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery and Prostitution during World War II and the U.S. Occupation. ''The American Historical Review'', 108(4), pp.1122-1123.</ref> 

The United States played an influential role in the forced democratization and [[denazification]] of post-Nazi Germany in the years following 1945. Democratic intervention into [[West Germany]] consisted of foreign Allied military presence, [[censorship]] of all German media outlets and persecution of anti-democratic, [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] sympathizing individuals and movements.<ref>Montgomery, J., 1957.

== 21st Century Implementation ==

=== Iraq (2003-2011) ===
[[File:International Security Assistance Force DVIDS198334.jpg|thumb|255x255px|An [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B]] Harrier used by the ISAF.]]
Democratic intervention in Iraq started in 2003. Intervention into Iraq was partly inspired by democratic principles and the assumption that installing a democracy in Iraq would inspire further democratization in the [[Middle East]]. It involved the overthrowing of [[Saddam Hussein]]’s authoritarian regime via the use of military force and replacing it with a parliamentary democracy.<ref>Wright, S., 2007. ''The United States And Persian Gulf Security: The Foundations Of The War On Terror''. Reading: Ithaca Press, p.248.</ref> The US led [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] helped instigate the drafting process of the constitution for Iraq's new democracy. In the year 2005, the US assisted Iraq in holding multi-party democratic elections which in turn materialized the inclusion of the once oppressed [[Kurdish population|Kurdish]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] populations.<ref name=":2">Natz, M., n.d. ''The U.S. And Democratization In Iraq''. [online] Middle East Policy Council. Available at: <https://mepc.org/commentary/us-and-democratization-iraq> [Accessed 29 May 2020].</ref> The new government was headed by Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki|Nouri Al Maliki.]] Up until 2011, United States military presence continued after authority had been given to the post-invasion government in order to protect the newly built democratic institutions from violent insurgencies from the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority.<ref name=":2" />  In response to the rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), the US militarily intervened in 2014 to prevent the spread of violent [[terrorism]] and to maintain Iraq's democratic state institutions.

=== Afghanistan (2001-Present) ===
In Afghanistan, the intervening body responsible for supporting the democratization of the Post-Taliban government was the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).  This was a [[NATO]] led coalition responsible for training [[Afghan National Security Forces]] to protect and develop democratic institutions as well as combat non-democratic Islamist forces such as the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]].<ref>Natz, M., n.d. ''The U.S. And Democratization In Afghanistan''. [online] Middle East Policy Council. Available at: <https://mepc.org/commentary/us-and-democratization-afghanistan> [Accessed 29 May 2020].</ref> The ISAF was active during the years 2001 to 2014 and were heavily supported by the United States. While the ISAF was disbanded in 2014, the United States continued to play an active role in defending state institutions and democratic bodies from [[Islamic extremism]] through the [[Resolute Support Mission]] which was founded in 2015.<ref>North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 2015.

[[File:Mechanized infantry syria.jpg|thumb|US Mechanized Infantry in Syria.|alt=|left|245x245px]]

=== Northern Syria (2015-2019) ===
A Western coalition composed of the United States, [[France]] and other allies intervened in the [[Syrian civil war|Syrian Civil War]] in support of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) which was founded in 2015. The SDF is an alliance of Syria and Kurdish militias committed to the development of a [[Secularism|secular]], democratic state in North Syria.<ref>Gilbert, R., 2019. ''True Aims Of The Syrian Democratic Forces''. [online] The Guardian. Available at: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/true-aims-of-the-syrian-democratic-forces> [Accessed 29 May 2020].</ref> Western intervention was composed of [[ammunition]] supplies, [[Airstrike|air raids]], ground offensives and military personnel against Islamist anti-democratic forces such as [[Al-Nusra Front|Al Nusra]] and ISIL. In 2019, US President [[Donald Trump]] withdrew support of US troops who were cooperating with SDF forces on the Turkish border.<ref name=":3">Wright, R., 2019.

== Legal Grounds ==
[[File:UN General Assembly hall.jpg|thumb|UN General Assembly Hall|328x328px]]
Chapter VIII of the [[Charter of the United Nations|UN Charter]] allows the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] to militarily intervene if there is a 'threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression.' It does not explicitly provide an avenue for intervention on the grounds of democratization. Article 2(4) outlaws the use of force and provides no suggestion nor does it imply that there may be motives underpinning military aggression that may nullify the article.<ref>Hurd, I., 2011. Is Humanitarian Intervention Legal? The Rule of Law in an Incoherent World. ''Ethics & International Affairs'', 25(3), pp.293-313.</ref> The article stipulates that [[Use of force by states|force]] that undermines and opposes the political independence of a state is illegal. This domain of illegality is broader than cross-border military action and outlaws both the use of force and the threat of its use for any political means, including democratization.<ref>Stürchler, N. 2007. ''The Threat of Force in International Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law).</ref> Ian Hurd, Associate Professor at the [[Northwestern University]] Department of [[Political science|Political Science]] affirms that a strict legal interpretation of international law prohibits any legal ground for democratic intervention undertaken by states.

Cases for legality suggests that the ban on any form of military intervention in Article 2(4) has lost legal force after repeated violations by states. Thomas Franck, in 1970, suggests that the twenty-five-year history post UN Charter, which has seen various uses of force violating international law, signals that the illegality of intervention into states has eroded beyond recognition.<ref>Franck, T. M. 1970. “Who Killed Article 2(4)? or: Changing Norms Governing the Use of Force by States,” ''American Journal of International Law''. Cambridge University Press, 64(5), pp. 809–837</ref> This argument was reinforced by Michael Glennon who conceded that the general banning of the use force has collapsed.<ref>Glennon, M., 2002. The Fog of Law: Self-Defense, Inherence, and Incoherence in Article 51 of the United Nation Charter. ''Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy'', 25, p.539.</ref> Frank references the general notion in international legal scholarship that rules lose their force if they are frequently violated, demonstrating that democratic intervention could be legally acceptable on that basis.<ref>Glennon, M., 2005. How International Rules Die. ''Georgetown Law Journal'', 93, p.939.</ref>

== Causes ==
The Bueno de Mesquita model suggests that given governments are concerned with their own domestic actors who can depose them, states that engage in democratic intervention do so to maximize their political survival.<ref name=":4">de Mesquita, B. and Downs, G., 2006. Intervention and Democracy. ''International Organization'', [online] 60(3), pp.627-649. Available at: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/3877822> [Accessed 18 March 2020].</ref> The model demonstrates that states will pursue democratic intervention if it will be perceived by electorates to further national interests or benefit a significant portion of the world population. [[George W. Downs (political scientist)|George Downs]], political scientist at [[New York University]] provides an example of this model. Downs demonstrates that the construction of democratic institutions in the post-war occupation of Japan and Germany was underpinned by the belief that their citizens would not politically support the emergence of militarism thus preventing another world war.<ref name=":4" /> 

The [[World Bank]] proposed that the notion of democratic peace induces democratic intervention. Democracies rarely engage in interstate [[War|warfare]], as confirmed by studies conducted by [[foreign policy]] analysts Rakerud and Hegre.<ref name=":5">World Bank, 2007. ''Democratic Jihad? Military Intervention and Democracy''. pp.12-21.</ref> Their statistical studies estimate that two democracies have a 57% lower probability of engaging in interstate warfare than a mixed pair and a 35% lower probability than a non-democratic pair.<ref>Raknerud, A. and Hegre, H., 1997. The Hazard of War: Reassessing the Evidence for the Democratic Peace. ''Journal of Peace Research'', 34(4), pp.385-404.</ref> Levy argues that this relationship has been labelled as one of the closest principles to an [[Empiricism|empirical]] law in world politics.<ref>Levy, J., 1989. Domestic Politics and War. In: R. Rotberg and T. Rabb, ed., ''The Origin and Prevention of Major Wars''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.79-99.</ref> German sociologist Erich Weede disagrees with that notion but nonetheless concedes that the relationship is very strong.<ref>Weede, E., 1992. Some Simple Calculations on Democracy and War Involvement. ''Journal of Peace Research'', 29(4), pp.377-383.</ref>  

== Views Held by States ==
[[File:George H. W. Bush and Margaret Thatcher.jpg|thumb|[[George H. W. Bush]] and Margaret Thatcher.|alt=|left|245x245px]]
Western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] have historically and publicly supported democratic intervention on the basis that it would reduce military conflicts between modern nation states. In 1992, [[James Baker|James Backe]]<nowiki/>r, Secretary of State in the George H.W. Bush Administration, stated ‘real democracies do not go to war with one another’.<ref name=":5" /> Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] affirmed the United States acceptance of this by stating in his [[State of the Union]] address ‘Democracies don’t attack each other.’<ref name=":5" />  The United Kingdom has also echoed these exact sentiments as former [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] was quoted to have said ‘Democracies do not attack each other.’<ref name=":5" /> Non-western states however, like China, have not encouraged the promotion of democracy and have intervened at the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] against enforced democratization proposals, as well as [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian interventions]]. China regularly [[Veto|vetoed]] military intervention against the autocratic [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]] during the years 2011 to 2016.<ref>Fung, C., 2019. ''China And Intervention At The UN Security Council''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.78-84.</ref>

== Proponents ==
Scholars in the field of democratic development such as Larry Diamond, Juan J. Linz, and Seymour Martin Lipse affirm “Democracy was imposed on Germany, [[Italy]], and Japan, and surprisingly took hold and endured”.<ref>Espinal, R. 1999. “Larry Diamond, Juan J. Linz and Seymour Martin Lipset (eds.), Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America, Volume Four (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner and London: Adamantine Press, 1989), pp. ix 515.,” ''Journal of Latin American Studies''. Cambridge University Press, 23(2), pp. 431–433.</ref>  Gary Dempsey, a foreign-policy analyst at [[Cato Institute]], states that Western intervention was responsible for turning Japan and Germany into self-sustaining peaceful, democracies.<ref>Payne, J., 2006. Did the United States Create Democracy in Germany? ''Independent Review'', XI(2), pp.209-221.</ref>  
[[File:StrobeTalbott.jpg|thumb|Strobe Talbott, Former US Deputy Secretary of State|176x176px]]
Liberal proponents see democratic intervention in a mutual relationship with other [[Liberalism|liberal]] values such as economic interdependence, international law and effective organization.<ref name=":5" /> Russel and Oneal also believe enforcing these values strengthens both international and domestic peace, and as a result, also strengthens the case for increased democratic intervention.<ref>Russett, B. and Oneal, J., 2001. ''Triangulating Peace: Democracy, Interdependence, And International Organizations.''. New York: Yorton.</ref> Holmes in his book 'Passions and Constraint: On the Theory of Liberal Democracy' proposes that democratic intervention would enhance the lives of those living in the target state through the provision of what he sees as widely supported values such as individual [[liberty]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of expression]].<ref>Holmes, S., 1995. ''Passions and Constraint: On The Theory Of Liberal Democracy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>   

[[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]], former director of Harvard's Centre for International Affairs, also proposes the imposition of liberal democracies would result less death as a result of civil unrest or government instigated violence.<ref>Huntington, S., 1991. ''The Third Wave: Democratization in The Late Twentieth Century''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pp.28-29.</ref> His studies have confirmed this trend as they find only 0.14% of a population living under a democracy die annually, which is lower than the 1.48% figure characterizing [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes.<ref>Rummel, R., 1997. ''Power Kills: Democracy as A Method of Nonviolence''. New Brunswick: Transaction Books, pp.87-88.</ref> [[Rudolph Rummel]], founder of the [[democratic peace theory]], reasons that Huntington's statistical trend stems from the sentiment that should a government be committed to democratic principles, critics of the state would not need to stage violent insurgencies, but rather, engage in the [[Election|electoral]] system.<ref>Rummel, R., 1994. Power, Genocide, and Mass Murder. ''Journal of Peace Research'', 31(1), pp.1-10.</ref>

Economic benefits of democratic institutions have also been cited by proponents. In a 1996 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] analysis, transitions from autocracy to democracy in the years 1980-1993 have seen [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] increases top 4.32%.<ref>Holmes, K. and Kirkpatrick, M., 1996. ''Freedom and Growth''. Interactive Edition. Wall Street Journal.</ref> [[Strobe Talbott]], former US Deputy Secretary of State, argued that the political legitimacy afforded by democracies, even if imposed by intervention, allows states to better implement economic [[reform]] that would be accepted by their electorate.<ref>Talbott, S., 1996. Democracy and the National Interest. ''Foreign Affairs'', 75(6), p.51.</ref> 

== Criticisms ==
[[File:Protest against the Iraq War, New Orleans, March 2005 01.jpg|left|thumb|232x232px|Protest against the Iraq War, New Orleans, March 2005.]]
The social theorist [[David Beetham]] states that democratic intervention infringes the sovereignty of the target state. He proposes that the intervening state risks being an illegitimate occupying force, which in turns incurs resistance from within the target state resulting in intensified insecurity.<ref name=":1" /> Beetham also argues that intervention may not be able to achieve democratization if outweighed by the other interests of the intervening state. De Mesquita and Downs proposed that the US military and hegemonic interests are reasons as to why democratic interventions into Iraq and Afghanistan failed to produce self-sustaining and effective democracies.<ref name=":0" /> Democratic intervention is also scrutinized by Beetham for the loss of human life it has caused. US intervention into Iraq had resulted in [[Casualties of the Iraq War|hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed or wounded]] with four million displaced internally or living refugees in other countries.<ref name=":1" />   

Democratic intervention is also criticized on the basis that it ignores the social conditions and dynamics that define the target state. Feffer and Junes of [[Foreign Policy in Focus|Foreign Policy In Focus]] suggest a failure to understand the communities and a unified sense of nationhood would result in democratic intervention stirring and inciting civil unrest, as demonstrated in the sectarian conflicts which were considered a symptom of the US intervention into Iraq.<ref>Feffer, J. and Zunes, S., 2007. ''Iraq: The Failures Of Democratization''. [online] Foreign Policy In Focus. Available at: <https://fpif.org/iraq_the_failures_of_democratization/> [Accessed 24 April 2020].</ref>  German and Japanese [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] critics have also stated that enforced democratization policies resulted in negative outcomes such as ‘distorting cultural perspectives’ and compare democratic intervention to [[colonialism]].<ref>n.d. ''History of Occupation in Japan''. [online] Available at: <<nowiki>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20020428a6.html</nowiki>> [Accessed 23 April 2020].</ref>
