'''AntiGravity Fitness''' is a fitness company founded by [[Christopher Calvin Harrison|Christopher Harrison]] in 2007 and based in [[New York City]], specializing in hybrid aerial fitness techniques that combine [[aerial silk|silk hammocks]] with [[modern yoga]], [[pilates]], [[barre (ballet)|ballet barre exercises]], and traditional [[strength training]] techniques for aerialists into different exercise curriculums. Harrison first developed the initial program, AntiGravity [[aerial yoga]], based on warm-up exercises through which he would lead his athletes as director/choreographer of the performance troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/gym-class-antigravity-yoga/?_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Gym Class: AntiGravity Yoga | first=Karen | last=Barrow | year=2011}}</ref>

==History==
In 1991, Christopher Harrison founded the acrobatic troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc|AntiGravity]] to choreograph a performance for the [[New York Marathon]]. In the following decade, they performed in hundreds of live shows, corporate events, and advertising campaigns. Then in 1997, AntiGravity performed during the opening ceremonies of the [[Femina Miss India]] pageant, and Harrison, while unable to perform due to injury, cites this time in [[India]] as his first exposure to [[yoga]] and a major influence on the development of aerial yoga and what would become AntiGravity Fitness.<ref name=":0">{{cite news| url=http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/AntiGravity-Yogas-Upside-Down-Workout.html| work=Outside Online | title=The Upside Down Workout | first=Ali Taylor | last=Lange | year=2011}}</ref>

Later, during a retreat at [[Club Med]], Harrison and his performers came across a [[gazebo]] with hammocks hanging from the ceiling. After experimenting and developing a few flips, they hung up similar hammocks in their [[New York City]] rehearsal studio, The AntiGravity Skyloft. Harrison states that they soon discovered that "hanging upside down for a minute would take all the kinks out". The hammocks soon became a regular part of their warm-up routine.<ref name=":0" />
