'''Loss exchange ratio''' is a [[figure of merit]] in [[attrition warfare]]. It is usually relevant to a condition or state of war where one side depletes the resources of another through attrition. Specifically and most often used as a comparator in aerial combat, where it is known as a '''kill-ratio'''. For example, during the [[Korean War]], American combat jets had a kill-ratio of 4-1.{{dubious|date=January 2013}} This means for every four aircraft shot down by an American aircraft, one American plane was shot down by an enemy fighter.

== Historical applications ==
Loss exchange ratio has played a significant role in past wars, especially those that have devolved into [[stalemate]] and become wars of [[attrition warfare|attrition]]. For example, the German objective at the [[Battle of Verdun]] (1916) during World War I was not the seizure of any strategic objective, but rather to inflict an LER of 2:1 on the French forces and thereby cripple the French army.{{dubious|date=January 2013}}

During the [[First Indochina War]], [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]], the leader of the [[Việt Minh]], told his French opposite number that "you can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, and at that rate, I will still triumph." In fact, the LER was approximately 3:1 in favor of the French, and they did indeed withdraw in defeat. A total of 500,000+ Vietnamese were either killed, wounded or captured during the First Indochina War.<ref>Smedberg, M (2008), ''Vietnamkrigen: 1880–1980''. Historiska Media, p. 88</ref>

It is arguable that the concept of the Loss exchange ratio has become relatively less important in modern Western military doctrine, as some military theories{{who|date=January 2013}} posit that it is just as militarily effective to [[Interdiction|disrupt enemy forces]] and outmaneuver them, thereby reducing their combat effectiveness without necessarily inflicting massive casualties.
