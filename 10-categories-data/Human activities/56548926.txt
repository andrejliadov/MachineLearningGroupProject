The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to underwater diving:
[[File:Diving_stage.jpg|thumb|Surface-supplied divers riding a stage to the underwater workplace|alt= Two divers wearing lightweight demand helmets stand back-to-back on an underwater platform holding on to the railings. The photo also shows the support vessel above the surface in the background.]]
'''[[Underwater diving]]''' &ndash; as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment.
<!--{{TOC limit|limit=2}}-->

== What ''type'' of thing is underwater diving? ==

Underwater diving can be described as all of the following:
*A [[Action (philosophy)|human activity]] &ndash; intentional, purposive, conscious and subjectively meaningful sequence of actions. Underwater diving is practiced as part of an occupation, or for recreation, where the practitioner submerges below the surface of the water or other liquid for a period which may range between seconds to the order of a day at a time, either exposed to the ambient pressure or isolated by a pressure resistant suit, to interact with the underwater environment for pleasure, competitive sport, or as a means to reach a work site for profit or in the pursuit of knowledge, and may use no equipment at all, or a wide range of equipment which may include breathing apparatus, environmental protective clothing, aids to vision, communication, propulsion, maneuverability, buoyancy and safety equipment, and tools for the task at hand.

== Diving activity, by type ==

=== Modes of underwater diving ===
<noinclude>[[File:Marin du commerce en formation de plongeur de bord à l'I.N.P.P..JPG|thumb|Surface-supplied diver with helmet, bailout set and umbilcal cable]]</noinclude>
There are several modes of diving distinguished by the equipment and procedures used:
* {{Annotated link|Freediving}}
* {{Annotated link|Scuba diving}}
* {{Annotated link|Surface-supplied diving}}
* {{Annotated link|Saturation diving}}
* {{annotated link|Atmospheric pressure diving}}
