==Species==

===African elephant===
[[File:Elephant Kruger 2003.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'')]]
The [[African elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') is a very large [[herbivore]] having thick, almost hairless skin, a long, flexible, prehensile trunk, upper [[incisor]]s forming long curved tusks of [[ivory]], and large, fan-shaped ears. The two distinct species of African elephant are: [[African forest elephant]] (''Loxodonta cyclotis'') and the [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'').They become aggressive when their young ones are being maltreated.  Elephants are difficult to hunt because, despite their large size, they are able to hide in tall grass and are more likely to charge than the other species.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fodor's African Safari, 1st Edition: From Budget to Big Spending Where and How to Find the Best Big Game Adventure in Southern and Eastern Africa|year=2004|publisher=Fodor's|isbn=978-1-4000-1234-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/fodorsafricansaf0000unse/page/142 142]|url=https://archive.org/details/fodorsafricansaf0000unse/page/142}}</ref>

===Black rhinoceros===
[[File:Black rhinos in crater.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Black rhinoceros]] (''Diceros bicornis'')]]
The [[black rhinoceros]] (''Diceros bicornis'') is a large herbivore having two upright horns on the nasal bridge. Its thick (1.5â€“5&nbsp;cm) protective skin, formed from layers of [[collagen]] positioned in a [[crystal structure|lattice]] structure, is very hard to puncture. It is now [[critically endangered]], and hunting is extremely limited due to this. In the context of big-game hunting in Africa, the term "rhinoceros" may also refer to the [[white rhinoceros]], but among big five game hunters, the black rhinoceros is preferred.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Cape buffalo===

The [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'') is a large [[Felidae|feline]] of Africa and northwest [[India]], having a short, tawny coat, a tufted tail, and in the male, a heavy [[mane (lion)|mane]] around the neck and shoulders.

===African leopard===
[[File:Leopard africa.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[African leopard]] (''Panthera pardus pardus'')]]

The [[African leopard]] (''Panthera pardus pardus'') is a large, carnivorous feline having either tawny fur with dark rosette-like markings or black fur. The leopard is considered the most difficult of the big five to hunt because of their nocturnal and secretive nature. They are wary of humans and will take flight in the face of danger. The leopard is solitary by nature, and is most active between sunset and sunrise, although it may hunt during the day in some areas. Leopards can be found in the savanna grasslands, brush land and forested areas in Africa. Of the big five, it is most difficult to acquire hunting as well as the licenses for.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Conservation status==
Africa's Big Five have become major concerns for wildlife conservationists in recent years. The African lion, African leopard and African bush elephant are all classified as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. The [[southern white rhinoceros]] is classified as [[near threatened]] while the [[black rhinoceros]] is classified as [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]], so hunting them is greatly restricted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6557/0|title=Diceros bicornis}}</ref> The African buffalo is the most popular big five game animal to hunt, as its conservation status is [[least concern]], but it is experiencing a population decline in uncontrolled areas due to poaching and urbanization.
