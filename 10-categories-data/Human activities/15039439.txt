An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. They often target political, trade union, dissident, religious and social figures.

When General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in 1973, he immediately ordered the purges, torture, and deaths of more than 3,000 supporters of the previous government without trial.<ref>{{Cite book|title=War Crimes and Justice: A Reference Handbook|last=Ball|first=Howard|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2002|isbn=157607899X|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=33}}</ref> During his [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|regime]], which lasted from 1973 to 1989, elements of the military and [[carabineros de Chile|police]] continued committing extrajudicial killings. These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[secret police]]. He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]].

During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

==== Honduras ====
[[Honduras]] also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson}}</ref>

{{main|Disposition Matrix}}
One issue regarding extrajudicial killing is the legal and moral status of [[Targeted killing#Use by the United States Government|targeted killing by unmanned aerial vehicles of the United States]].

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.<ref>{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ|isbn = 9780160729669}}</ref>{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however {{nowrap| ... }}" covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

The legality of killings such as in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011 and the death of [[Qasem Soleimani]] in 2020 have been brought into question. In that case, the US defended itself claiming the killing was not an assassination but an act of "National Self Defense".<ref name=OBLQ>{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Aiden|title=Osama Bin Laden: Legality of Killing questioned|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372|accessdate=June 16, 2017|agency=BBC News|work=BBC News|date=May 12, 2011|ref=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372}}</ref>

{{main|Killings of Aaron Danielson and Michael Reinoehl}}
In a ''[[Fox News]]'' cable television interview September 12, 2020, hosted by [[Jeanine Pirro]], President Trump expressed encouragement for law enforcement officers to carryout [[extrajudicial executions|extrajudicial]] retribution killing of suspected criminals. Trump made his comments in reference to a law enforcement officer who – on September 3, 2020, in [[Lacey, Washington]] – fatally shot [[Michael Forest Reinoehl]], a self-described anti-fascist activist who is suspected of fatally shooting on August 29, 2020, a [[Patriot Prayer]] supporter, [[Aaron J.

==== Iran ====
{{See also|Chain murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}</ref>

Iraq was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939}}</ref>

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}</ref> In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref> They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.<ref>{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}</ref> Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].<ref name=Nytimes050501>{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&en=f0604488a64924cd&ex=1272686400&pagewanted=all&position= |work=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |work=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.<ref>{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.<ref>{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus: Events of 2005 |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2006/country-chapters/belarus  | newspaper=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref>

It has been regarded that the [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]] was linked to Russian special forces. USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overtlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}</ref> The United Kingdom attributes the [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in March 2018 to the Russian military-intelligence agency [[GRU (G.U.)|GRU]]. The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said there were "several indications" that Russia was behind the [[poisoning of Alexei Navalny]].

==== Soviet Union ====
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute [[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]] without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920. The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands were executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases, the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotsky]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

==== Spain ====
{{Main|GAL (paramilitary_group)}}

From 1983 until 1987, the Spanish government supported paramilitary squads, denominated [[GAL (paramilitary group)|GAL]], to fight [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], a Basque terrorist organization. A relevant example was the [[Killing of Lasa and Zabala|Lasa and Zabala case]], in which José Antonio Lasa and José Ignacio Zabala were kidnapped, tortured and executed by police forces in 1983.

Operation Kratos referred to tactics developed by London's Metropolitan Police Service for dealing with suspected suicide bombers, most notably firing shots to the head without warning. Little was revealed about these tactics until after the [[Death of Jean Charles de Menezes|mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes]] on 22 July 2005.

In [[Northern Ireland]], members of the British armed forces, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], and British agents, on occasion killed without lawful excuse during [[The Troubles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/WR93/Hsw-09.htm|title=Hsw}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/24/Opinion/A_grim_lesson_from_Ul.shtml|title=Opinion: A grim lesson from Ulster}}</ref> [[Brian Nelson (double agent)|Brian Nelson]], an [[Ulster Defence Association]] member and British Army agent was convicted of sectarian murders.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Duffy|first1=Brendan|last2=O'Leary|first2=Brendan|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/bodbol.htm|title=Violence in Northern Ireland, 1969-June 1989|publisher=CAIN Web Service - Conflict and Politics in Northern Ireland}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/83509.stm | work=BBC News | title=N.Ireland police arrest 2 suspected of sectarian killing | date=April 25, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/48753.stm| work=BBC News | title=Tit-for-tat murders in N Ireland | date=January 20, 1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
