}}  "An antipattern is just like a pattern, except that instead of a solution it gives something that looks superficially like a solution, but isn't one."</ref> was inspired by a book, ''[[Design Patterns (book)|Design Patterns]]'', which highlights a number of [[design pattern]]s in [[software development]] that its authors considered to be highly reliable and effective.

The term was popularized three years later by the book ''[[AntiPatterns]]'', which extended its use beyond the field of software design to refer informally to any commonly reinvented but bad solution to a problem. Examples include [[analysis paralysis]], [[cargo cult programming]], [[death march (software development)|death march]], [[groupthink]] and [[vendor lock-in]].

== Definition ==
According to the authors of ''Design Patterns'', there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti-pattern from a simple bad habit, bad practice, or bad idea:

# A commonly used process, structure, or pattern of action that despite initially appearing to be an appropriate and effective response to a problem, has more bad consequences than good ones.
# Another solution exists that is documented, repeatable, and proven to be effective.

*[[Cash cow]]: A profitable legacy product that often leads to complacency about new products
*[[Design by committee]]: The result of having many contributors to a design, but no unifying vision
*[[Escalation of commitment]]: Failing to revoke a decision when it proves wrong
*[[Groupthink]]: A collective state where group members begin to (often unknowingly) think alike and reject differing viewpoints

*[[Seagull manager|Seagull management]]: Management in which managers only interact with employees when a problem arises, when they "fly in, make a lot of noise, dump on everyone, do not solve the problem, then fly out"
*[[Stovepipe (organisation)|Stovepipe or Silos]]: An organizational structure of isolated or semi-isolated teams, in which too many communications take place up and down the hierarchy, rather than directly with other teams across the organization
*[[Typecasting (acting)|Typecasting]]: Locking successful employees into overly safe, narrowly defined, predictable roles based on their past successes rather than their potential
*[[Vendor lock-in]]: Making a system excessively dependent on an externally supplied component

==== Project management ====

=== Software engineering ===

==== Software design ====
<span id="General design anti-patterns"></span>
*[[Abstraction inversion]]: Not exposing implemented functionality required by callers of a function/method/constructor, so that the calling code awkwardly re-implements the same functionality in terms of those calls
*[[Ambiguous viewpoint]]: Presenting a model (usually [[Object-oriented analysis and design]] (OOAD)) without specifying its viewpoint
*[[Big ball of mud]]: A system with no recognizable structure
*[[Database-as-IPC]]: Using a database as the message queue for routine [[Inter-process communication|interprocess communication]] where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable

==== Object-oriented programming ====
*[[Anemic domain model]]: The use of the [[domain model]] without any [[business logic]].  The domain model's objects cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places). Martin Fowler considers this to be an anti-pattern, but some disagree that it is always an anti-pattern.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/02/04/the-anaemic-domain-model-is-no-anti-pattern-its-a-solid-design/|title = The Anaemic Domain Model is no Anti-Pattern, it’s a SOLID design|date = 4 February 2014|access-date = 3 January 2015|website = SAPM: Course blog}}</ref>

*[[Sequential coupling]]: A class that requires its methods to be called in a particular order
*[[Singleton Pattern]]: This design pattern brings coupling and is considered a bad solution
*[[Yo-yo problem]]: A structure (e.g., of inheritance) that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation

*[[Caching failure]]: Forgetting to clear a cache that holds a negative result (error) after the error condition has been corrected
*[[Cargo cult programming]]: Using patterns and methods without understanding why
*[[Coding by exception]]: Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
*[[Design pattern]]: The use of patterns has itself been called an anti-pattern, a sign that a system is not employing enough [[Abstraction principle (computer programming)|abstraction]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html|title=Revenge of the Nerds|quote=In the OO world you hear a good deal about "patterns". I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough— often that I'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.}}</ref>
*[[Error hiding]]: Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message. This anti-pattern is also named ''Diaper Pattern''. Also can refer to erasing the [[Stack trace]] during exception handling, which can hamper debugging.
*[[Hard code]]: Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
*[[Spaghetti code#Lasagna code|Lasagna code]]: Programs whose structure consists of too many layers of inheritance
*[[Lava flow (programming)|Lava flow]]: Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.antipatterns.com/lavaflow.htm |title = Lava Flow|website = antipatterns.com|date = 2 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icmgworld.com/corp/news/Articles/RS/jan_0202.asp |title=Undocumented 'lava flow' antipatterns complicate process |publisher= Icmgworld.com |date=14 January 2002 |access-date=3 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311103207/http://www.icmgworld.com/corp/news/Articles/RS/jan_0202.asp |archive-date=11 March 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
