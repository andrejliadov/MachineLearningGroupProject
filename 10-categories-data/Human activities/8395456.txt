'''Astrophilately''' is a branch of [[philately]] which deals with the [[Stamp collecting|collection of stamps]] and postmarked envelopes related to [[spaceflight]]. It is the intersection of space and postal history. Covers cancelled on the date and at a post office near the controlling agency are used in postal exhibits to share the development and conquest of the [[cosmos]].
==Scope==
Topics of interest include [[postage stamp]]s, [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellations]], and [[cover (philately)|covers]] connected to various projects. Examples include [[rocket mail]], dating from as early as the 1928, and mail actually carried on space flights, a practice that began with [[Project Apollo]] missions, and has continued since then. Specialists distinguish astrophilately from [[topical collecting]] with a space theme; astrophilatelic items are those with direct connections to space missions, whether or not they include any special pictorial depiction.

The [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] has a Section for Astrophilately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-i-p.ch/fip-organisation/commissions-sections |title=FIP Commissions |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] |year=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-11 }}</ref> Included are covers and cards cancelled at [[launch site]]s, [[tracking station]]s, [[Mission Control]] facilities, research laboratories, and [[NASA recovery ship|recovery ship]]s. Many, though not all, such items have [[cachet]]s produced for the mission; others are recognizable only with specific knowledge of the postmark location and date corresponding to a launch.

==Collecting==
As with regular [[airmail]], items of mail carried aboard spacecraft are known as "flown covers".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.americanairmailsociety.org/resources/collecting-airmail/safe-landing/ |title=Glossary of Aerophilatelic Covers |website=American Air Mail Society |access-date=November 18, 2020}}
</ref> They are known from both [[Soviet space program|Soviet-]] and [[NASA|American-flown]] missions. While some types are rare, others, such as space shuttle covers, were carried in large numbers, and are thus relatively common, costing less than US$50.

Perhaps the most common item of astrophilately is the "STS-8 flight cover". In cooperation with the [[United States Postal Service|USPS]], the shuttle flight [[STS-8]] carried several hundred thousand covers, [[franking|franked]] with $9.35 express mail stamps, which were then sold to the public after the shuttle's return.{{cn|date=November 2020}} The original plan was to carry 500,000, but the final number was reduced to 261,900, of which 2,523 were damaged during the flight and discarded.{{cn|date=November 2020}} The remaining covers were each enclosed in a souvenir folder describing the mission and the cover, and sold for $15.35 each.{{cn|date=November 2020}} They were sold out by November 1983, just a few months after the flight.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Much rarer are the "Sieger" covers, carried on [[Apollo 15]].<ref name="Sieger covers">{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceflownartifacts.com/flown_apollo15_covers.html |title=The Flown Apollo 15 Sieger Covers |last=Weinberger |first=Howard |website=Space Flown Artifacts |access-date=November 18, 2020}}</ref> German stamp dealer Hermann Sieger had [[Apollo 15 postage stamp scandal|arranged a deal]], in which H. Walter Eierman convinced the Apollo 15 crew members to carry 100 cacheted covers to the [[moon]] and back, for the sum of US$7000 each, with the understanding that they would not be sold until after the end of the Apollo program.<ref name="Sieger covers" /> These covers, along with an additional 300 that the crew would keep for themselves, were stuffed in [[David Scott|David Scott's]] spacesuit pocket, and never listed on the manifest.<ref name="Sieger covers" /> However, Sieger began selling the covers he received soon after the mission's return, reportedly for $1500 each, and when the whole affair came to light, NASA confiscated the astronauts' 298 surviving covers (two had been destroyed pre-flight), and grounded them permanently.<ref name="Sieger covers" /> In 1983, hearing of the STS-8 plans, astronaut [[Alfred Worden]] sued for the return of the 298 covers, and the crew eventually recovered them.<ref name="Sieger covers" /> The covers have appeared on the market from time to time since then. In an October 2000 auction, one of the crew covers realized US$14,950.<ref name="Sieger covers" />
