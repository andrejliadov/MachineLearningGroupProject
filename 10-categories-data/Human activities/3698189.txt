'''Beelining''' (also known as '''bee lining''', '''bee hunting''', and '''coursing bees''') is an ancient art used to locate [[feral]] [[Western honey bee|bee]] colonies. It is performed by capturing and marking foraging worker bees, then releasing them from various points to establish (by elementary [[trigonometry]]) the direction and distance of the colony's home.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Beeliners generally have homemade capture boxes which aid them in their quest.

Beelining was formerly a serious occupation in [[Appalachia]] where it was a means to obtain [[honey]] as a sweetener, and sometimes to capture wild colonies for [[domestication]]. When a [[hollow tree]] (gum) was found, it often was sawed above and below the colony and carried back to be set up as a kept [[beehive (beekeeping)|hive]] near home. Honey was harvested from such colonies by "sulphuring," (using burning [[sulfur]]) to kill the [[insect]]s.

Feral hives in the USA are uncommon since the arrival of [[varroa]] mites in the 1980s, and may represent an important, though small, pool of genetic resistance to the mites.  Their value as potential breeding stock may far outweigh the value of their honey.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
