The '''purple poppy''' is a symbol  of remembrance in the United Kingdom for animals that served during wartime.<ref name=bbc /> The symbol was created in 2006 based on the principle of the traditional red [[remembrance poppy]] for [[Remembrance Day]].<ref name=bbc />

In contemporary service, most animals in United Kingdom military service are [[military working dogs]], particularly in the [[1st Military Working Dog Regiment]]. Historically the greatest number of animal casualties in conflict have been [[Horses in warfare|horses and ponies]].

== Background ==
The purple [[poppy]] was created in 2006 by the charity [[Animal Aid]] as a way to commemorate animals which served during conflicts as the charity viewed that they had been the forgotten victims of war.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|first=James |last=McClean |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/29848595/remembrance-poppy-controversies-and-how-to-wear-it |title=Remembrance poppy: Controversies and how to wear it |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref> Approximately eight million horses and donkeys died during the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/poppy-appeal-white-gold-purple-remembrance-day-a3971771.html |title=Poppy Appeal: White, gold and purple poppy meanings and where to get them for Remembrance Day 2018 |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=2018-10-25 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref> It was created to be worn alongside red or white poppies.<ref name=bbc /> Animal Aid continued to sell the purple poppy with proceeds going to them until 2015 when they replaced the symbol with an enamel purple paw badge as they felt it was being misinterpreted {{mdash}} the animals are not "heroes" but victims.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Andrew |last1=Tyler |url=https://www.animalaidshop.org.uk/accessories/the-purple-poppy |publisher=Animals Aid |title=Purple poppy |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/25/what-is-the-purple-poppy-appeal-and-where-can-i-buy-one-8074878/ |title=What is the purple poppy appeal and where can I buy one? |publisher=Metro |date=2018-10-25 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref> The purple poppy symbol was subsequently picked up by the Murphy's Army charity in 2016 and continued to be sold by them.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/purple-poppy-remembrance-day-what-15345757 |title=What is a purple poppy and where can you buy one for Remembrance Day? |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smallholder.co.uk/news/15652375.Purple_poppies__lest_we_forget_animals_harmed_in_conflict/ |title=Purple poppies: lest we forget animals harmed in conflict |work=[[Smallholder (magazine)|Smallholder]] |date=2017-11-12 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref>

There is a specified purple poppy day in addition to Remembrance Day on 11 November where purple poppies would be worn. The date is movable, however. In 2018, in order to coincide with 100 years since the end of the First World War, 23 August was chosen as purple poppy day to coincide with the [[Battle of Mons]]. This was the date of the first battle between British and German forces during the First World War.<ref>{{cite web |author=Centenary Digital |url=http://www.centenarynews.com/article/purple-poppy-day-launches---august-23---in-memory-of-first-world-war-horses |title=Purple Poppy Day launches, August 23, in memory of First World War horses |newspaper=Centenary News |date=2018-08-23 |accessdate=2018-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031173900/http://www.centenarynews.com/article/purple-poppy-day-launches---august-23---in-memory-of-first-world-war-horses |archive-date=2018-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The purple poppy was not endorsed by [[The Royal British Legion]], which sells the official red remembrance poppies.<ref name=bbc /> However they did state: "We see no conflict in wearing the red poppy next to the purple or [[white poppy]]. Many animal rights supporters also support our work. We do ask that the items are not offered alongside each other however as this would confuse the public."<ref name=bbc /> Some towns have included purple poppies alongside red ones in official Remembrance displays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-45933097 |title=Prince Harry 'proud' of Rutland's poppy WW1 tribute |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}</ref>
