Regulations distinguish lawful hunting from [[poaching]], which involves the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as [[Game (food)|game]] or [[prey]] and are usually [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s. Economists classify hunting as part of [[Primary production (economics)|primary production]] - alongside [[forestry]], [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]].

Hunting by humans arose in ''[[Homo erectus]]'' or earlier, in the order of millions of years ago.  Hunting has become deeply embedded in human culture.

The pursuit, capture and release, or capture for food of [[fish]] is called [[fishing]], which is not commonly categorised as a form of hunting. It is also not considered hunting to pursue animals without intent to kill them, as in [[wildlife photography]], [[birdwatching]], or scientific-research activities which involve [[Tranquillizer gun|tranquilizing]] or [[Electronic tagging|tagging]] of animals or birds. The practice of [[foraging]] or [[hunter-gatherer|gathering]] materials from [[plant]]s and [[mushroom]]s is also considered{{by whom|date=February 2020}} separate from hunting.

Skillful tracking and acquisition of an elusive target has caused the word ''hunt'' to be used in the [[vernacular]] as a metaphor, as in [[treasure hunting]], "bargain hunting", and even "hunting down" corruption and waste.

Some [[animal-rights|animal rights]] activists regard hunting as cruel, unnecessary, and unethical.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/issues/wildlife/wildlife-factsheets/sport-hunting-cruel-unnecessary/|title=Why Sport Hunting Is Cruel and Unnecessary|date=2003-12-15|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/animal-exploitation-section/animals-used-for-entertainment-and-as-companions-introduction/hunting/|title=Hunting|website=Animal Ethics|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word ''hunt'' serves as both a [[noun]] ("the act of chasing game") and a [[verb]]. The noun has been dated to the early 12th century, from the verb ''hunt''. [[Old English]] had ''huntung'', ''huntoþ''. The meaning of "a body of persons associated for the purpose of hunting with a pack of hounds" is first recorded in the 1570s. "The act of searching for someone or something" is from about 1600.

The verb, Old English ''huntian'' "to chase game" ([[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]), perhaps developed from ''hunta'' "hunter," is related to ''hentan'' "to seize," from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''huntojan'' (the source also of [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''hinþan'' "to seize, capture," [[Old High German]] ''hunda'' "booty"), which is of uncertain origin. The general sense of "search diligently" (for anything) is first recorded c. 1200.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=hunt |author= Harper, Douglas |title= Hunt |dictionary= Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date= 24 December 2016}}</ref>

==History==
{{anchor|Paleolithic}}

===Lower to Middle Paleolithic===
{{Further|Hunting hypothesis|Endurance running hypothesis}}
Hunting has a long history. It pre-dates the emergence of  ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ([[anatomically modern humans]]) and may even predate genus ''[[Homo]]''.

The oldest undisputed evidence for hunting dates to the [[Early Pleistocene]], consistent with the emergence and early dispersal of ''[[Homo erectus]]'', about 1.7 million years ago ([[Acheulean]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gaudzinski | first1 = S | year = 2004 | title = Subsistence patterns of Early Pleistocene hominids in the Levant&nbsp;– Taphonomic evidence from the 'Ubeidiya Formation (Israel) | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 31 | pages = 65–75 | doi=10.1016/s0305-4403(03)00100-6}}.

While it is undisputed that ''Homo erectus''  were hunters, the importance of this for the emergence of ''Homo erectus'' from its australopithecine ancestors, including the production of [[stone tool]]s and eventually the [[control of fire]], is emphasised in the so-called "[[hunting hypothesis]]" and de-emphasised in scenarios that stress omnivory and [[social interaction]].

There is no direct evidence for hunting predating ''Homo erectus'', in either ''[[Homo habilis]]'' or in ''[[Australopithecus]]''.
The early [[hominidae|hominid]] ancestors of humans were probably [[frugivore]]s or [[omnivore]]s, with a partially carnivore diet from [[scavenging]] rather than hunting.
Evidence for australopithecine meat consumption was presented in the 1990s.<ref>1992 [[trace element]] studies of the strontium/calcium ratios in [[Paranthropus|robust australopithecine]] fossils suggested the possibility of animal consumption, as did a 1994 using stable carbon isotopic analysis. {{cite web | author=Billings, Tom | access-date = 6 January 2007 | title = Comparative Anatomy and Physiology Brought Up to Date—continued, Part 3B | url = http://www.beyondveg.com/billings-t/comp-anat/comp-anat-3b.shtml}}</ref>
It has nevertheless often been assumed that at least occasional hunting behavior may have been present well before the emergence of ''Homo''.
This can be argued on the basis of comparison with [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, the closest extant relatives of humans, who also engage in hunting, indicating that the behavioral trait may have been present in the [[Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor]] as early as 5 million years ago. The common chimpanzee (''[[Pan troglodytes]]'') regularly engages in troop predation behaviour where bands of beta males are led by an [[alpha male]]. [[Bonobo]]s (''[[Pan paniscus]]'') have also been observed to occasionally engage in group hunting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/9601-bonobos-hunt-primates.html |title=Bonobos Hunt Other Primates |work=livescience.com |year=2008 |access-date=5 August 2012}}</ref> although more rarely than ''Pan troglodytes'', mainly subsisting on a [[frugivorous]] diet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |title=Bonobo social spacing |author=Courtney Laird |access-date=10 March 2008 |work=Davidson College |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123151613/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/vecase/Behavior/Spring2004/laird/Social%20Organization.htm |archive-date=23 January 2008 }}</ref>
Indirect evidence for [[Oldowan]] era hunting, by early ''Homo'' or late ''Australopithecus'', has been presented in a 2009 study based on
an Oldowan site in southwestern Kenya.<ref>Plummer, T.W., Bishop, L., Ditchfield, P., Kingston, J., Ferraro, J., Hertel, F. & D. Braun (2009).

[[Louis Binford]] (1986) criticised the idea that early hominids and early humans were hunters. On the basis of the analysis of the skeletal remains of the consumed animals, he concluded that hominids and early humans were mostly [[scavengers]], not hunters,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Binford | first1 = Louis | year = 1986 | title = Human ancestors: Changing views of their behavior | journal = Journal of Anthropological Archaeology | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 292–327 | doi = 10.1016/0278-4165(85)90009-1 }}</ref>
Blumenschine (1986) proposed the idea of ''confrontational scavenging'', which involves challenging and scaring off other [[predator]]s ''after'' they have made a kill, which he suggests could have been the leading method of obtaining [[protein]]-rich meat by early humans.<ref>Blumenschine, Robert J. (1986) ''Early hominid scavenging opportunities: Implications of carcass availability in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro ecosystems''. Oxford, England: B.A.R.</ref>

Stone spearheads dated as early as 500,000 years ago were found in South Africa.<ref>Monte Morin, [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/16/science/la-sci-hafting-spears-20121116 "Stone-tipped spear may have much earlier origin"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 16 November 2012</ref> Wood does not preserve well, however, and Craig Stanford, a primatologist and professor of anthropology at the [[University of Southern California]], has suggested that the discovery of spear use by chimpanzees probably means that early humans used wooden spears as well, perhaps, five million years ago.<ref>Rick Weiss, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201007.html "Chimps Observed Making Their Own Weapons"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 22 February 2007</ref>
The earliest dated find of surviving wooden hunting [[spear]]s dates to the very end of the [[Lower Paleolithic]], just before 300,000 years ago. The [[Schöningen spears]], found in 1976 in [[Germany]], are associated with ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/385807a0 | volume=385 | title=Lower Palaeolithic hunting spears from Germany | year=1997 | journal=Nature | pages=807–810 | last1 = Thieme | first1 = Hartmut | issue=6619 | pmid=9039910| bibcode=1997Natur.385..807T | s2cid=4283393 }} [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/abs/385807a0.html].</ref>

The [[hunting hypothesis]] sees the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] as directly related to hunting, including [[Mating|mating behaviour]], the establishment of [[language]], culture, and [[origin of religion|religion]], [[mythology]] and [[animal sacrifice]].

Evidence exists that hunting may have been one of the multiple [[environmental factor]]s leading to the [[Holocene extinction]] of [[megafauna]] and their replacement by smaller [[herbivores]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Surovell | first = Todd |author2=Nicole Waguespack |author3=P.

[[North American]] megafauna extinction was coincidental with the [[Younger Dryas impact event]], possibly making hunting a less critical factor in prehistoric species loss than had been previously thought.<ref>American Geophysical Union paper PP43A-01, [http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm07/sm07-sessions/sm07_PP43A.html abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193019/http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm07/sm07-sessions/sm07_PP43A.html |date=27 September 2007 }} retrieved 26 October 2007</ref>

Hunting was a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies before the [[domestication]] of livestock and the dawn of [[Neolithic Revolution|agriculture]], beginning about 11,000 years ago in some parts of the world. In addition to the [[spear]], [[hunting weapon]]s developed during the Upper Paleolithic include the [[atlatl]] (a spear-thrower; before 30,000 years ago) and the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] (18,000 years ago). By the [[Mesolithic]], [[Hunting strategy|hunting strategies]] had diversified with the development of these more far-reaching weapons and the [[domestication of the dog]] about 15,000 years ago. Evidence puts the earliest known [[mammoth]] hunting in Asia with [[spears]] to approximately 16,200 years ago.<ref>{{cite conference |first=Vasiliy N. |last=Zenin |author2=Evgeny N.

Many species of animals have been hunted throughout history. It has been suggested that in North America and [[Eurasia]], [[reindeer|caribou and wild reindeer]] "may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting"<ref name=Burch>"In North America and Eurasia the species has long been an important resource—in many areas ''the'' most important resource—for peoples inhabiting the northern [[Taiga|boreal forest]] and tundra regions. Known human dependence on caribou/wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the Middle Pleistocene (Banfield 1961:170; Kurtén 1968:170) and continuing to the present.

[[Mesolithic]] hunter-gathering lifestyles remained prevalent in some parts of the [[Americas]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Siberia]], as well as all of Australia, until the European [[Age of Discovery]]. They still persist in some [[tribal societies]], albeit in rapid decline. Peoples that preserved Paleolithic hunting-gathering until the recent past include some [[List of indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples of the Amazonas]] ([[Aché]]), some Central and Southern African ([[San people]]), some peoples of [[New Guinea]] ([[Fayu people|Fayu]]), the [[Mlabri people|Mlabri]] of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]], the [[Vedda people]] of [[Sri Lanka]], and a handful of [[uncontacted peoples]].

===Neolithic and Antiquity===

Even as [[domestication#Animals|animal domestication]] became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply.
The supplementary meat and materials from hunting included [[protein]], [[bone]] for implements, [[sinew]] for [[rope|cordage]], [[fur]], [[feathers]], [[Rawhide (textile)|rawhide]] and leather used in clothing.

Hunting is still vital in marginal climates, especially those unsuited for [[pastoral]] uses or agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mystique Melodies|last=Porter|first=V.I.|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|year=2018|isbn=978-1-4809-5591-2|location=Pittsburgh, PA|pages=48}}</ref> For example, [[Inuit]] people in the [[Arctic]] trap and hunt animals for clothing and use the skins of [[Marine mammal|sea mammals]] to make [[kayak]]s, clothing, and footwear.

On ancient [[reliefs]], especially from [[Mesopotamia]], kings are often depicted as hunters of [[Big game hunting|big game]] such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a [[war chariot]]. The cultural and [[psychological]] importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as [[Horned God|the horned god]] [[Cernunnos]] and [[Lunar deity|lunar goddesses]] of [[classical antiquity]], the Greek [[Artemis]] or Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. [[Taboo]]s are often related to hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a [[divinity]] could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a [[Nature reserve|reserve]] surrounding a temple. [[Euripides]]' tale of Artemis and [[Actaeon]], for example, may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting.

With the domestication of the dog, [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], and the [[ferret]], various forms of animal-aided hunting developed, including [[Medieval hunting|venery]] ([[scent hound]] hunting, such as [[fox hunting]]), [[coursing]] ([[sight hound]] hunting), [[falconry]], and [[ferreting]]. While these are all associated with [[medieval hunting]], over time, various [[dog breed]]s were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names as [[Pointing breed|pointer]] and [[setter]].

===Pastoral and agricultural societies===
[[File:Nobleman in Hunting Costume preceded by his Servant trying to find the Scent of a Stag.png|thumb|right|[[Nobleman]] in hunting costume with his servant following the scent of a [[stag]], 14th century]]

Even as agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] became more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunter-gatherer societies persisted, even when increasingly confined to marginal areas. And within agricultural systems, hunting served to kill animals that prey upon [[List of domesticated animals|domestic and wild animals]] or to attempt to [[Local extinction|extirpate]] animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage.

When hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a social one, two trends emerged:

# the development of the role of the specialist hunter, with special training and equipment
# the co-option of hunting as a "sport" for those of an upper social class

The meaning of the word ''game'' in [[Middle English]] evolved to include an animal which is hunted. As game became more of a luxury than a necessity, the stylised pursuit of it also became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, such as for lions or [[wild boar]]s, often done on [[horseback]] or from a [[chariot]], had a function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports. Hunting ranked as an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the [[aristocracy]] practice skills of war in times of peace.<ref>
Machiavelli provides a rationale, if not the origin, of noble hunting:

In most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the [[Robin Hood]] legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they "hunt the King's deer". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all.<ref>

===Use of dog===
[[File:'Jachtgezellen' Rijksmuseum SK-A-1023.jpeg|thumb|''Hunting Companions'', [[Dutch people|Dutch]] 19th-century painting featuring two dogs, a [[shotgun]] and a game bag]]

Although various other animals have been used to aid the hunter, such as [[ferrets]], the dog has assumed many very important uses to the hunter.
The domestication of the dog has led to a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] in which the dog's independence from humans is deferred. Though dogs can survive independently of humans, and in many cases do, as with feral dogs, where hunger is not a primary factor, the species tends to defer to human control in exchange for habitation, food and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://huntingguide.info/|title=The Hunting Guide >> Read Before Hunt|website=Hunting Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>

Dogs today are used to find, chase, retrieve, and sometimes to kill the game. [[Hunting dog]]s allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting. Waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as the [[Labrador Retriever]], the [[Golden Retriever]], the [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]], the [[Brittany Spaniel]], and other similar breeds. [[Upland game bird|Game birds]] are flushed out using flushing [[spaniel]]s such as the [[English Springer Spaniel]], the various [[Cocker Spaniel]]s and similar breeds.

The hunting of wild mammals in England and Wales with dogs was banned under the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. The wild mammals include fox, hare, deer and mink.  Hunting with dogs is permissible, however, where it has been carried out in accordance with one of the exceptions in the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/countryside/hunting/ |title=Hunting with dogs « Defra |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |date=18 February 2005 |access-date=20 April 2012}}</ref>

Many prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey of humans, often in a [[zoomorphic]] form, perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most Palaeolithic cultures.

In many pagan religions, specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

[[Hindu scripture]]s describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god [[Shiva]] is Mrigavyadha, which translates as "the deer hunter" (''mriga'' means deer; ''vyadha'' means hunter). The word ''Mriga'', in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic [[Ramayana]], [[Dasharatha]], the father of [[Rama]], is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed [[Shravana]], mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, [[Ravana]] kidnapped his wife, [[Sita]], from their hut, while [[Rama]] was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother [[Lakshman]] went after him. According to the [[Mahabharat]], [[Pandu]], the father of the [[Pandavas]], accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer. [[Krishna]] is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter.

[[Jainism]] teaches followers to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a [[Jain]].

[[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] first [[precept]] is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] explained the issue by saying "all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill."

In [[Sikhism]], only meat obtained from hunting, or slaughtered with the [[Jhatka]] is permitted. The [[Sikh gurus]], especially [[Guru Hargobind]] and [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were ardent hunters. Many old Sikh [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehatnamas]] like [[Prem Sumarag]], recommend hunting [[wild boar]] and [[deer]]. However, among modern Sikhs, the practise of hunting has died down; some even saying that all meat is forbidden.

===Christianity, Judaism, and Islam===

From early Christian times, hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting.

Ferraris (s.v. "Clericus", art. 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, utility or "honest" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming to the [[Ecclesiastical government|ecclesiastical state]]. Ziegler, however (De episc., l. IV, c. xix), thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the church.

Nevertheless, although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible, it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese, as was done by [[synod]]s at [[Milan]], [[Avignon]], [[Liège]], [[Cologne]], and elsewhere. [[Benedict XIV]] (De synodo diœces., l. II, c. x) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. In practice, therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether.

It is important to note that most Christians do not observe [[kosher]] [[dietary laws]] hence most Christians have no religious restrictions on eating the animals hunted. This is in accord with what is found in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 15:28–29, and 1 Timothy 4:4.

In Jewish law hunting is not forbidden although there is an aversion to it. The great 18th-century authority [[Rabbi Yechezkel Landau]] after a study concluded although "hunting would not be considered cruelty to animals insofar as the animal is generally killed quickly and not tortured... There is an unseemly element in it, namely cruelty." The other issue is that hunting can be dangerous and Judaism places an extreme emphasis on the value of human life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/be/The_Jewish_Ethicist_Judaism_and_Hunting.html|title=The Jewish Ethicist: Judaism and Hunting|website=aish.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1589324/jewish/The-Jewish-View-on-Hunting-for-Sport.htm|title=The Jewish View on Hunting for Sport|website=chabad.org}}</ref>

During the [[feudal]] and [[British Raj|colonial]] times in [[British Raj|British India]], hunting was regarded as a regal sport in the numerous [[princely states]], as many [[maharaja]]s and [[nawab]]s, as well as British officers, maintained a whole corps of ''shikaris'' ([[Big-game hunting|big-game hunters]]), who were native professional hunters. They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who might be styled ''mir-shikar''. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their [[traditional knowledge]] of the environment and hunting techniques. Big game, such as [[Bengal tigers]], might be hunted from the back of an elephant.

Regional [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few [[sect]]s, such as the [[Bishnoi]], lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species, such as the [[antelope]]. India's [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] bans the killing of all wild animals. However, the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life, or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal. In this case, the body of any wild animal killed or wounded becomes government property.<ref>{{cite web|author=Helplinelaw |url=http://www.helplinelaw.com/docs/wildlife/01.php |title=Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 |publisher=Helplinelaw.com |access-date=20 April 2012}}</ref>

A safari, from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word meaning "a long journey", especially in Africa, is defined as an overland journey. Safari as a distinctive way of hunting was popularized by the US author [[Ernest Hemingway]] and President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Claire|date=2015-07-03|title="An Africa on your own front door step": the development of an Australian safari|journal=Journal of Australian Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=396–410|doi=10.1080/14443058.2015.1052833|s2cid=142998322|issn=1444-3058}}</ref> A safari may consist of a several-days – or even weeks-long journey, with [[camping]] in [[the bush]] or [[jungle]], while pursuing [[Game (food)|big game]]. Nowadays, it is often used to describe tours through African [[List of African national parks|national parks]] to watch or hunt wildlife.

Hunters are usually tourists, accompanied by [[hunting license|licensed]] and highly [[Regulation|regulated]] professional hunters, local guides, [[Skinner (profession)|skinners]], and [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] in more difficult terrains. A special safari type is the solo-safari, where all the license acquiring, stalking, preparation, and outfitting is done by the hunter himself.

Unarmed [[fox hunting]] on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the United Kingdom; in fact, "hunting" without qualification implies fox hunting. What in other countries is called "hunting" is called "shooting" (birds) or "stalking" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of [[vermin]] control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with [[hound]]s. Pairs of [[Sight hound]]s (or long-dogs), such as [[greyhounds]], may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with [[scent hound]]s such as [[beagle]]s or harriers. Other sorts of [[foxhound]]s may also be used for hunting [[stag|stags (deer)]] or [[American mink|mink]]. [[Deer stalking]] with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.{{clear left}}

These forms of hunting have been controversial in the UK. [[Animal welfare]] supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes, horses, and hounds. Proponents argue that it is culturally and perhaps economically important. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was [[fox hunting legislation|made illegal]] in February 2005 by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]; there were a number of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act for hunting with hounds, but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing.

====Shooting traditions====
Game birds, especially [[pheasant]]s, are shot with shotguns for sport in the UK; the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] says that over a million people per year participate in shooting, including game shooting, [[clay pigeon shooting]], and [[Shooting sports|target shooting]].<ref>[http://basc.org.uk/media-centre/basc-appeals/basc-youth-appeal BASC site]</ref>
Shooting as practised in Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game—around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been [[factory farming|factory farmed]]. Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns. When in position, "beaters" move through the areas of cover, swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called "drives". The open season for [[grouse]] in the UK begins on 12 August, the so-called [[Glorious Twelfth]]. The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the [[Game Act 1831]].

A similar tradition exists in [[:es:Ojeo|Spain]].

North American hunting pre-dates the United States by thousands of years and was an important part of many [[pre-Columbian]] Native American cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under [[federal law]]—examples include [[eagle feather law]]s and exemptions in the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]]. This is considered particularly important in [[Alaska Native|Alaskan native]] communities.

Hunting is primarily regulated by [[State law (United States)|state law]]; additional regulations are imposed through [[United States environmental law]] in the case of [[migratory birds]] and [[endangered species]]. Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between [[protected species]] and unprotected species (often [[vermin]] or [[varmint]]s for which there are no hunting regulations). Hunters of protected species require a [[hunting license]] in all states, for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite.

Typically, game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes. Typical categories, along with example species, are as follows:
* ''Big game'': [[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], [[moose]], [[elk]], [[caribou]], [[bear]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[pronghorn]], [[boar]], [[javelina]], [[bison]]
* ''Small game'': [[rabbit]], hare, [[squirrel]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[porcupine]], [[skunk]], [[ring-tailed cat]], [[armadillo]], [[ruffed grouse]]
* ''Furbearers'': [[beaver]], [[red fox]], [[mink]], [[pine marten]], [[musk rat]], [[otter]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]
* ''Predators'': [[cougar]] (mountain lion and [[Panthera|panther]]), [[Gray wolf|wolf]], [[coyote]]
* ''[[Upland game bird]]'': [[grouse]], [[woodcock]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]], [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[dove]]
* ''[[Waterfowl]]'': [[duck]], [[common teal|teal]], [[merganser]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]

Hunting big game typically requires a "tag" for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags may be further restricted to a specific area, or wildlife management unit. [[Waterfowl hunting|Hunting migratory waterfowl]] requires a duck stamp from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] in addition to the appropriate state hunting license.

Harvest of animals other than big game is typically restricted by a bag limit and a possession limit. A bag limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that an individual can harvest in a single day. A possession limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's possession at any time.

====Shooting====
[[File:Hectors photos 109.JPG|thumb|A man target practicing for the hunting seasons]]

Gun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for [[big-game hunting]] often specify a minimum [[caliber]] or [[muzzle energy]] for [[firearm]]s. The use of [[rifle]]s is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [[population density|population densities]] or limited [[Terrain|topographic relief]]. Regulations may also limit or ban the use of [[lead]] in [[ammunition]] because of environmental concerns. Specific seasons for [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] hunting or [[Muzzle-loader|muzzle-loading]] [[Black powder|black-powder]] guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective [[weapons]].

Hunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting,<ref>[http://www.responsivemanagement.com/download/news/newsrls_09_06.pdf Results] from a 2006 poll (813 people were polled) done by Responsive Management</ref> although relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, just six percent of Americans hunted. [[Southern United States|Southerners]] in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent, slightly below the national average, and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent, these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states, where twelve percent of [[Midwesterners]] hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.<ref>National statistics from [[United States Department of the Interior|US Department of the Interior]], Fish and Wildlife Service and [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation, 27.</ref> Overall, in the 1996–2006 period, the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent, a drop attributable to a number of factors including [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and changes in recreation habits.<ref>Jackson, Patrick. [http://www.trailcamerareviews.net/number-hunters-dwindling/ ''Number of hunters is dwindling—Urbanization and cultural changes discourage newcomers to the sport''].</ref>

====Regulation====
Regulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century. Some modern hunters see themselves as [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] and sportsmen in the mode of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]]. Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups represent a specific hunting interest, such as [[Ducks Unlimited]], [[Pheasants Forever]], or the [[Delta Waterfowl Foundation]]. Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government.

Each year, nearly $200&nbsp;million in hunters' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs, the purchase of lands open to hunters, and hunter education and safety classes. Since 1934, the sale of [[Federal Duck Stamp]]s, a required purchase for migratory [[waterfowl]] hunters over sixteen years old, has raised over $700&nbsp;million to help purchase more than {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat for the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]] lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting. States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals, as designated by law. A key task of federal and state [[park ranger]]s and [[game warden]]s is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting, including species protection, [[hunting season]]s, and hunting bans.

====Varmint hunting====
{{Main |Varmint hunting}}
[[File:Nutria (Myocastor coypus).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[coypu]] is hunted as a pest in Louisiana.]]

Varmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests. While not always an efficient form of [[pest control]], varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated. Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops, livestock, [[landscaping]], [[infrastructure]], and pets. Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass. Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area. Common varmints may include various [[rodent]]s, [[coyotes]], [[Corvus (genus)|crows]], [[fox]]es, [[feral cats]], and feral [[pig|hogs]]. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as wolves. In the US state of [[Louisiana]], a non-native rodent, the [[coypu]], has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] program to help control the population.

====Fair chase====
{{Main|Fair chase}}

The principles of the [[fair chase]]<ref>Interpretations of the Fair Chase can be found on the web sites of various hunter's organizations, such as the [http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics Boone and Crockett Club] and [http://www.huntfairchase.com/ Hunt Fair Chase].</ref> have been a part of the American hunting tradition for over one hundred years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, popularised by Theodore Roosevelt, and perpetuated by Roosevelt's formation of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], has been central to the development of the modern fair chase tradition. ''Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting'', a book by Jim Posewitz, describes fair chase:
<blockquote>
"Fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase. This concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted. It is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken."<ref>{{cite book |last= Posewitz |first= Jim |title= Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dkkmL8TuiMkC&pg=PA57|date= 1 August 1994 |publisher= [[Globe Pequot Press]] |isbn= 978-1-56044-283-7 |page= 57 }}</ref>
</blockquote>

When [[Internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) explained, "The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting."<ref name=HSUS-FactSheet>Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/internet_hunting/facts/internet_hunting_fact_sheet.html#.UzjiW61dW9Y Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]</ref>

[[File:Bear-hunters-kephart-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hunters with an [[American black bear]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]]]]

One hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions:
* Helpless in a trap, deep snow or water, or on ice.
* From any power vehicle or power boat.
* By "[[spotlighting|jacklighting]]" or shining at night.
* By the use of any tranquilizers or poisons.
* While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures.
* By the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals, including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground.
* By the use of electronic devices for attracting, locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game, or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |title=The Rules of Fair Chase |publisher=[[Pope and Young Club]] |location=[[Chatfield, Minnesota]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315072242/http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=24 May 2012 |quote=While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures}}</ref>

===Ranches===
Indian [[blackbuck]], [[nilgai]], [[axis deer]], [[fallow deer]], [[zebra]]s, [[barasingha]] and many other exotics can now be found on hunting [[ranches]] in Texas, where they were introduced for sport hunting. These hunters can be found paying in excess of $10,000 dollars to take trophy animals on these controlled ranches.

===Russia===
{{Main|Hunting in Russia}}
The [[Russia]]n imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers—[[Grand Prince]]s and [[Russian Czar|Tsars]]—under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organised mainly in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]], and [[Gatchina]].

===Australia===
{{Main |Hunting in Australia}}
Hunting in [[Australia]] has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests. All native animals are protected by law, and can only be killed under a special permit.  Hunted introduced species include deer, pigs, goats, foxes, and rabbits.

=== Japan ===
The numbers of licensed hunters in Japan, including those using [[Snare trap|snares]] and guns, is generally decreasing, while their average age is increasing. {{as of|2010}}, there were approximately 190,000 registered hunters, approximately 65% of whom were sixty years old or older.<ref>http://www.env.go.jp/nature/choju/docs/docs4/menkyo.pdf</ref>

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===
There is a very active tradition of hunting small to medium-sized wild game in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Hunting is carried out with firearms, slingshots and cage traps, and sometimes aided by the use of hounds. The illegal use of trap guns and snare nets also occurs. With approximately 12,000 to 13,000 hunters applying for and being granted hunting permits in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometres and 1.2 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months – October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species ([[red-rumped agouti]], [[lowland paca]], [[nine-banded armadillo]], [[collared peccary]], and [[red brocket deer]]) are thought to be relatively low when compared to less-hunted regions in nearby mainland [[South America]] (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted {{as of|2013|lc=y}}). It appears that the [[red brocket deer]] population has been extirpated in [[Tobago]] as a result of over-hunting. By some time in the mid 20th century another extirpation due to over-hunting occurred in [[Trinidad]] with its population of [[horned screamer]] (a large game bird). Various herons, ducks, doves, the [[green iguana]], the [[cryptic golden tegu]], the [[spectacled caiman]], the [[common opossum]] and the [[capybara]] are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including [[Guyanan red howler|red howler]] monkey and [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[southern tamandua]], [[Brazilian porcupine]], [[yellow-footed tortoise]], the critically endangered island endemic [[Trinidad piping guan]] and even one of the national birds, the [[scarlet ibis]]. Legal hunters pay relatively small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic [[conservation biology]] or hunting-ethics/[[fair chase]] training, and are not assessed regarding their knowledge and comprehension of the local wildlife conservation laws. There is presumed to be relatively little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authorities are under-staffed and under-funded, and as such little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting/poaching occurring both in and out of season and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.

==Wildlife management==

In some cases, hunting actually can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established, resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area, thus artificially increasing the population.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://freefromharm.org/common-justifications-for-eating-animals/hunting-wildlife-population-control-ethical-eating/|title=Hunting for Wildlife Population Control and Ethical Eating?|date=2015-01-14|work=Free From Harm|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Hunting advocates{{Who|date=June 2012}} assert that hunting reduces [[intraspecific competition]] for food and shelter, reducing mortality among the remaining animals. Some [[environmentalist]]s assert{{Who|date=December 2009}} that (re)introducing [[predator]]s would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect, such as introducing significant amounts of free [[lead]] into the environment and [[food chain]].

In the United States, wildlife managers are frequently part of hunting regulatory and licensing bodies, where they help to set rules on the number, manner and conditions in which game may be hunted.

Management agencies sometimes rely on hunting to control specific animal populations, as has been the case with deer in North America. These hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters, although others may include amateur hunters. Many US city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous in a restricted area, such as neighbourhood parks and [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] open spaces.

A large part of managing populations involves managing the number and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population. Tools that are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates in countries that rely on bag limits per hunter instead of per area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Laws==
{{main|Hunting legislation|Poaching}}
Illegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and wildlife management laws is called poaching. [[Game preservation]] is one of the tactics used to prevent poaching. Violations of hunting laws and regulations involving poaching are normally punishable by law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://knifemetrics.com/elk-hunting-laws-and-regulations/|title=Hunting Laws and Regulations|year=2020|work=knifemetrics.com|access-date=3 January 2020}}</ref> Punishment can include [[Confiscation|confiscation of equipment]], [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or a [[prison]] sentence.

===Bag limits===
{{Main|Bag limits}}
[[File:Bird shooting game rack.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Red-legged partridge]]s on a game rack]]
Bag limits are provisions under the law that control how many animals of a given species or group of species can be killed, although there are often species for which bag limits do not apply. There are also [[jurisdiction]]s where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The phrase ''bag limits'' comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a [[fishing creel]].

Where bag limits are used, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits; for example, ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Debbie Young|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2003/n03-015.html |title=US Fish and Wildlife Service 2003 proposed bag limits for waterfowl |publisher=Fws.gov |access-date=20 April 2012}}</ref> Big game, like [[moose]], most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex, or age of animal that a hunter can kill. In many cases, bag limits are designed to allocate harvest among the hunting population more equitably rather than to protect animal populations, as protecting the population would necessitate regional density-dependent maximum bags.

===Closed and open season===
A [[closed season]] is a time during which hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law. Typically, closed seasons are designed to protect a species when they are most vulnerable or to protect them during their [[breeding season]].<ref>[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/childdocs/-7380F92E35E27D99CA2573750023D375-DE772B04C4005AEDCA25737500243226?open When can I hunt, Game Hunting, Recreation and Tourism; The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE), Government of Victoria, Australia.], Accessed 4 December 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401063439/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/childdocs/-7380F92E35E27D99CA2573750023D375-DE772B04C4005AEDCA25737500243226?open |date=1 April 2011 }}</ref> By extension, the period that is not the closed season is known as the [[Open season (hunting)|open season]].

Historical, subsistence, and sport hunting techniques can differ radically, with modern hunting regulations often addressing issues of where, when, and how hunts are conducted. Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, hunting equipment, and the animal being hunted. Often a hunter will use a combination of more than one technique. Laws may forbid sport hunters from using some methods used primarily in poaching and wildlife management.

Trophy hunting is the selective seeking of wild game. It may also include the controversial hunting of captive or semi-captive animals expressly bred and raised under controlled or semi-controlled conditions so as to attain trophy characteristics; this is sometimes known as [[canned hunt]]s.<ref>[http://dspace.nmmu.ac.za:8080/jspui/bitstream/10948/1328/1/Examination%20Copy%20Final%20Document%20Dissertation.pdf Motivations of International Trophy Hunters Choosing to Hunt in South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503213609/http://dspace.nmmu.ac.za:8080/jspui/bitstream/10948/1328/1/Examination%20Copy%20Final%20Document%20Dissertation.pdf |date=3 May 2015 }}</ref>

===History===
In the 19th century, southern and central European sport hunters often pursued game only for a [[trophy]], usually the head or [[Fur|pelt]] of an animal, which was then displayed as a sign of prowess. The rest of the animal was typically discarded. Some cultures, however, disapprove of such waste. In [[Nordic countries]], hunting for trophies was—and still is—frowned upon. Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Hunting#Safari|safari]] method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies. In modern times, [[trophy hunting]] persists and is a significant industry in some areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Conservation tool===
According to the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]], hunting "provides an economic incentive" for ranchers to continue to breed those species, and that hunting "reduces the threat of the species' extinction."<ref>http://www.fws.gov/policy/library/2005/05-17432.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-hunting-endangered-animals-save-the-species/|title=Can hunting endangered animals save the species?|website=cbsnews.com}}</ref>

A scientific study in the journal, ''Biological Conservation'', states that trophy hunting is of "major importance to conservation in Africa by creating economic incentives for conservation over vast areas, including areas which may be unsuitable for alternative wildlife-based land uses such as photographic ecotourism."<ref name="africanwildlifeconservationfund.org">{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117050938/http://www.africanwildlifeconservationfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Economic-and-conservation-significance.pdf |archive-date=17 November 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> However, another study states that less than 3% of a trophy hunters' expenditures reach the local level, meaning that the economic incentive and benefit is "minimal, particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy."<ref name="economistsatlarge">http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/Ecolarge-2013-200m-question.pdf</ref>

Financial incentives from trophy hunting effectively more than double the land area that is used for wildlife conservation, relative to what would be conserved relying on national parks alone according to ''Biological Conservation'',<ref name="africanwildlifeconservationfund.org"/> although local communities usually derive no more than 18 cents per hectare from trophy hunting.<ref name="economistsatlarge"/>

[[Trophy hunting]] has been considered essential for providing economic incentives to conserve large carnivores according to research studies in ''Conservation Biology'',<ref name="cbs.umn.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/Effects%20of%20trophy%20hunting%20on%20populations%20of%20lions%20and%20leopards%20in%20TZ.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160036/http://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/downloads/Effects%20of%20trophy%20hunting%20on%20populations%20of%20lions%20and%20leopards%20in%20TZ.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> ''Journal of Sustainable Tourism'',<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09669589708667294 | volume=5 | issue=4 | title=Trophy Hunting as a Sustainable Use of Wildlife Resources in Southern and Eastern Africa | journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism | pages=306–321| year=1997 | last1=Baker | first1=Joni E. | s2cid=153994508 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a5d05710407e97f4c973a246c124eeb6e634ddc }}</ref> ''Wildlife Conservation by Sustainable Use'',<ref>{{cite book | doi=10.1007/978-94-011-4012-6_15 | title=Hunting and Its Benefits: an Overview of Hunting in Africa with Special Reference to Tanzania | journal=Wildlife Conservation by Sustainable Use | pages=295–313|year = 2000|last1 = Hurt|first1 = Robin| last2=Ravn | first2=Pauline | isbn=978-94-010-5773-8 | s2cid=168071478 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6394230715bad84ce2316b45875fe9c9911fb28d }}</ref> and ''Animal Conservation''.<ref name="cbs.umn.edu"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ewca.gov.et/sites/default/files/Lindsey%20et%20al%20%202006%20Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting%20to%20create%20incentives%20for%20wildlifeconservationin%20Africa.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714141728/http://www.ewca.gov.et/sites/default/files/Lindsey%20et%20al%20%202006%20Potential%20of%20trophy%20hunting%20to%20create%20incentives%20for%20wildlifeconservationin%20Africa.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> Studies by the Centre for Responsible Tourism<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bear-watching-more-profitable-than-bear-hunting-says-study-1.2488311|title=Bear watching more profitable than bear hunting, says study |website=cbc.ca}}</ref> and the IUCN state that ecotourism, which includes more than hunting, is a superior economic incentive, generating twice the revenue per acre and 39 times more permanent employment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/should-trophy-hunting-of-lions-be-banned-155657735/|title=Should Trophy Hunting of Lions Be Banned?|first=Alastair|last=Bland|website=smithsonianmag.com}}</ref> At the crosssection of trophy hunting, ecotourism and conservation is [[green hunting]], a trophy hunting alternative where hunters pay to dart animals that need to be tranquilized for conservation projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cousins|first1=Jenny A.|last2=Sadler|first2=Jon P.|last3=Evans|first3=James|date=2010|title=The Challenge of Regulating Private Wildlife Ranches for Conservation in South Africa|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=15|issue=2|doi=10.5751/es-03349-150228|issn=1708-3087|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources]] in 2016 concluded that trophy hunting may be contributing to the extinction of certain animals.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Jada F. |date=13 June 2016 |title=Trophy Hunting Fees Do Little to Help Threatened Species, Report Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/trophy-hunting-fees-do-little-to-help-threatened-species-report-says.html?_r=1| work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=26 May 2017 }}</ref> Animal welfare organizations, including the [[IFAW|International Fund for Animal Welfare]], claim that trophy hunting is a key factor in the "silent extinction" of [[giraffes]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Milman|first=Oliver |date=19 April 2017 |title=Giraffes must be listed as endangered, conservationists formally tell US|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/19/giraffes-endangered-species-conservation-hunting|work=The Guardian |access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref>

According to a national survey that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducts every five years, fewer people are hunting, even as population rises. National Public Radio reported, a graph shows 2016 statistics, that only about 5 percent of Americans, 16 years old and older, actually hunt, which is half of what it was 50 years ago. The decline in popularity of hunting is expected to accelerate over the next decade, which threatens how US will pay for conservation.

===Controversy===
Trophy hunting is most often criticised when it involves rare or [[endangered]] animals.<ref>[http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28737&SESSION=875 Early Day Motion on trophy hunting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222022827/http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28737&SESSION=875 |date=22 February 2006 }}</ref> Opponents may also see trophy hunting as an issue of [[morality]]<ref>see, for example, [http://flaflooga.com/trophy_hunting.php this internet page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710234644/http://flaflooga.com/trophy_hunting.php |date=10 July 2015 }}</ref> or [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], criticising the killing of living creatures for [[recreation]]. [[Victorian era]] dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] remarked, "[[Deer-stalking]] would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns."<ref>[[George Grossmith|Grossmith, George]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 1911</ref>

There is also debate about the extent to which trophy hunting benefits the [[local economy]]. Hunters argue that fees paid contribute to the local economy and provide value to animals that would otherwise be seen as competition for grazing, livestock, and crops.<ref>Martin, Glen. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/10/06/MNG1UF392D1.DTL ''The lion, once king of vast African savanna, suffers alarming decline in population''], San Francisco Chronicle, 6 October 2005. Retrieved 30 October 2007.</ref> However, the argument is disputed by animal welfare organizations and other opponents of trophy hunting.<ref>League Against Cruel Sports.

A variety of industries benefit from hunting and support hunting on economic grounds. In [[Tanzania]], it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average [[ecotourist]]. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In the United Kingdom, the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important to the rural economy. The Cobham Report of 1997 suggested it to be worth around £700&nbsp;million, and hunting and shooting lobby groups claimed it to be worth over a billion pounds less than ten years later.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States, with many companies specialising in hunting [[sports equipment|equipment]] or speciality tourism. Many different technologies have been created to assist hunters, even including iPhone applications. Today's hunters come from a broad range of economic, social, and cultural backgrounds. In 2001, over thirteen million hunters averaged eighteen days hunting, and spent over $20.5&nbsp;billion on their sport.<ref>Why You're Wrong About the Right: Behind the Myths: The Surprising Truth About Conservatives. p. 137. By S.E. Cupp & Brett Joshpe Published by: Simon and Schuster, 2009</ref> In the US, proceeds from hunting licenses contribute to state game management programs, including preservation of wildlife habitat.

Hunting contributes to a portion of caloric intake of people and may have positive impacts on greenhouse gas emissions by avoidance of utilization of meat raised under industrial methods. <ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/10871209.2020.1799266|title=Reported U.S. Wild game consumption and greenhouse gas emissions savings|year=2020|last1=Johnson|first1=Jamie L.|last2=Zamzow|first2=Benjamin K.|last3=Taylor|first3=Nathan T.|last4=Moran|first4=Matthew D.|journal=Human Dimensions of Wildlife|pages=1–11}}</ref>

Lead bullets that miss their target or remain in an unretrieved carcass could become a [[toxicant]] in the environment but lead in ammunition because of its metallic form has a lower solubility and higher resistance to corrosion than other forms of lead making it hardly available to biological systems.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Dr. Göttlein Axel|title=Eco-toxicological assessment of hunting rifle ammunition|url=http://www.leadinammunition.com/independent-studies-002/|publisher=Bavarian Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry upon an initiative of the Bavarian Hunting Association|date=2016-04-07|access-date=17 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018082938/https://www.leadinammunition.com/independent-studies-002/|archive-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Waterfowl or other birds may ingest the lead and poison themselves with the neurotoxicant, but studies have demonstrated that effects of lead in ammunition are negligible on animal population size and growth.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Frederik Verdonck|title=Population Trend modelling of European Upland Birds due to Lead Shot Ingestion|url=http://www.leadinammunition.com/independent-studies-001/|date=2016-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Angelo Moretto |author2=Piermannuccio Mannucci |title=Lead in game meat and implications for human health |url=http://www.leadinammunition.com/independent-studies-013/ |access-date=18 February 2013}}</ref> Since 1991, US federal law forbids lead shot in waterfowl hunts, and 30 states have some type of restriction.<ref name=ps1013>{{cite news|author1=Michael Todd |title=Gunning for Lead Bullets |url=https://psmag.com/nature-and-technology/duel-lead-green-bullets-68369 |access-date=30 December 2014 |work=Pacific Standard |date=14 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228102856/https://psmag.com/nature-and-technology/duel-lead-green-bullets-68369 |archive-date=28 December 2014}}</ref>

In December 2014, a federal appeals court denied a lawsuit by environmental groups that the [[EPA]] must use the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] to regulate lead in shells and cartridges.

Hunters have been driving forces throughout history in the movement to ensure the preservation of [[Habitat (ecology)|wildlife habitats]] and [[wildlife]] for further hunting.<ref>Brockington, Dan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hanwVhP-JFQC&pg=PA47&dq Nature unbound: conservation, capitalism and the future of protected areas]'', Earthscan, 2008.<br /> "The birth of the international conservation movement as we recognize it today was due to the influence of powerful aristocratic hunters who wished to preserve suitable specimens for their sport from the alleged depredations of Africans (Mackenzie, 1988). The international hunting fraternity remains a powerful force behind conservation today."</ref> However, excessive hunting and poachers have also contributed heavily to the endangerment, extirpation and extinction of many animals, such as the [[quagga]], the [[great auk]], [[Steller's sea cow]], the [[thylacine]], the [[bluebuck]], the [[Arabian oryx]], the [[Caspian tiger|Caspian]] and [[Javan tiger]]s, the [[markhor]], the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], the bison, the [[North American cougar]], the [[Altai argali]] sheep, the [[Asian elephant]] and many more, primarily for commercial sale or sport.

===Legislation===
====Pittman–Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937====
In 1937, American hunters successfully lobbied the US Congress to pass the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act|Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act]], which placed an eleven percent tax on all hunting equipment. This self-imposed tax now generates over $700&nbsp;million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore and protect wildlife habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/federalaid/pittmanrobertson.html|title=The Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|access-date=11 May 2007}}</ref> The act is named for Nevada Senator [[Key Pittman]] and Virginia Congressman [[Absalom Willis Robertson]].

====Federal Duck Stamp program====
On 16 March 1934, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen. The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the [[US Postal Service]] and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest. They play an important role in [[habitat conservation]] because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of [[wetland]] habitat for protection in the [[National Wildlife Refuge|National Wildlife Refuge System]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/birds/policies-and-regulations/laws-legislations/migratory-bird-hunting-and-conservation-stamp-act.php|title=Migratory Bird Hunting & Conservation Stamp Act|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Since 1934, the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670&nbsp;million, and helped to purchase or lease {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat. The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas, and are also considered collectors items often purchased for [[aesthetic]] reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters, which is logical, as hunters are required to purchase them. Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/realty/mbcc.html|title=Migratory Bird Conservation Commission|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=31 May 2007}}</ref>

===Species===
====Arabian oryx====
The [[Arabian oryx]], a species of large [[antelope]], once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East.<ref name="Talbot, Lee Merriam 1960 pp. 84"/> However, the species' striking appearance made it (along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters, especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered.<ref>The Fundamentals of Conservation Biology, Malcolm L Hunter, Jr., James P. Gibbs</ref> However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from "extinct in the wild" to "vulnerable" due to conservation efforts like captive breeding<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2011/06/17/arabian-oryx-makes-history-as-first-species-to-be-upgraded-from-extinct-in-the-wild-to-vulnerable/|title=Arabian Oryx Makes History as First Species to Be Upgraded from "Extinct in the Wild" to "Vulnerable"|first=John|last=Platt|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>

====Markhor====
The [[markhor]] is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains of [[Central Asia]] and [[Pakistan]]. The [[colonization]] of these regions by [[British Empire|Britain]] gave British sport hunters access to the species, and they were hunted heavily, almost to the point of extinction. Only their willingness to breed in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented this. Despite these factors, the markhor is still endangered.<ref>Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World, 2001</ref>

====American bison====
The [[American bison]] is a large [[bovid]] which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened due to lack of habitat.<ref>American Bison: A Natural History, By Dale F. Lott, Harry W. Greene, ebrary, Inc, Contributor Harry W. Greene, Edition: illustrated, Published by University of California Press, 2003  {{ISBN|978-0-520-24062-9}}</ref>

====White rhino====
The ''Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy'' cites that the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/|title=Can trophy hunting actually help conservation?|publisher=Conservation|date=15 January 2014|website=conservationmagazine.org}}</ref>

However, the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging to the population and is currently growing globally,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8388606.stm 'Global surge' in rhino poaching ] [[BBC]]. 1 December 2009</ref> with 1004 being killed in South Africa alone according to the most recent estimate.<ref>{{cite news| title=946 rhino killed in 2013 |url=http://ewn.co.za/2013/12/19/946-Rhino-poached-in-2013| access-date=25 December 2013| newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>

====Other species====
According to [[Richard Conniff]], Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of various species. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, which "are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory", have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995. Lions, which were on the brink of extinction "from Senegal to Kenya", are increasing in Namibia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/opinion/a-trophy-hunt-thats-good-for-rhinos.html|title=Opinion – A Trophy Hunt That's Good for Rhinos|date=2014-01-20|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Conniff|first1=Richard}}</ref>

In contrast, Botswana in 2012 banned trophy hunting following a precipitous wildlife decline.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20544251|title=Botswana to ban wildlife hunting|date=29 November 2012|work=BBC News}}</ref> The numbers of antelope plummeted across Botswana, with a resultant decline in predator numbers, while elephant numbers remained stable and hippopotamus numbers rose. According to the government of Botswana, trophy hunting is at least partly to blame for this, but many other factors, such as poaching, drought and habitat loss are also to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/18/botswana-natural-wonder-brink-of-catastrophe|title=Drought and poachers take Botswana's natural wonder to brink of catastrophe|first=David|last=Smith|date=17 June 2011|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Uganda recently did the same, arguing that "the share of benefits of sport hunting were lopsided and unlikely to deter poaching or improve [Uganda's] capacity to manage the wildlife reserves."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/11/23/uganda_ends_sport_hunting/ |title=National Geographic Society Newsroom |access-date=16 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313012029/http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/11/23/uganda_ends_sport_hunting/ |archive-date=13 March 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2020, Botwana reopened trophy hunting on public lands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana to Kickstart Elephant Hunting With Auction This Week|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-03/botswana-to-kickstart-elephant-hunting-with-auction-this-week|date=3 February 2020|publisher=Bloomberg}}</ref>

===Studies===
[[File:Cage trap on a farm, Namibia.jpg|thumb|Cage [[Trapping#Trap types|trap]] ([[Trapping#Cage traps (live traps)|live trap]]) for [[cheetah]]s on a farm in [[Namibia]]]]
A study published by the [[Wildlife Society]] concluded that hunting and trapping are cost effective tools that reduce wildlife damage by reducing a population below the capacity of the environment to carry it and changing the behaviors of animals to stop them from causing damage. The study furthermore states that the cessation of hunting could cause wildlife to be severely harmed, rural property values to fall, and the incentive of landowners to maintain natural habitats to diminish.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.njfishandwildlife.com/pdf/bear/policy_lit/conover01.pdf|last=Conover|first= Michael R. |title=Effect of Hunting and Trapping on Wildlife Damage|work= [[Wildlife Society Bulletin]]|volume= 29.

Although deforestation and forest degradation have long been considered the most significant threats to tropical biodiversity, across Southeast Asia (Northeast India, Indochina, Sundaland, Philippines) substantial areas of natural habitat have few wild animals (>1&nbsp;kg), bar a few hunting‐tolerant species.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.12785 Harrison, R., Sreekar, R., Brodie, J.

==Opposition to hunting==
{{expand section|date=December 2018}}
{{Main|Opposition to hunting}}

It has been argued by animal rights activists that killing animals for sport is unethical, cruel, and unnecessary.<ref name=":1" /> They note the suffering and cruelty inflicted on animals hunted for sport: "Many animals endure prolonged, painful deaths when they are injured but not killed by hunters [...] Hunting disrupts migration and hibernation patterns and destroys families."<ref name=":1" /> Animal rights activists also comment that hunting is not needed to maintain an [[ecological balance]], and that "nature takes care of its own".<ref name=":1" /> They say that hunting can be combated on public lands by "spread[ing] deer repellent or human hair (from barber shops) near hunting areas".<ref name=":1" /> Animal rights activists also argue that hunting is [[speciesism|speciesist]]:<ref name=":2" />

<blockquote>Whether hunters try to justify their killing by citing human deaths caused by wild animals, by making conservationist claims, by claiming that it’s acceptable to hunt as long as the animals' bodies are eaten, or simply because of the pleasure it brings them, the fact remains that hunting is morally unacceptable if we consider the interests of nonhuman animals. Hunted animals endure fear and pain, and then are deprived of their lives. Understanding the injustices of speciesism and the interests of nonhuman animals makes it clear that human pleasure cannot justify nonhuman animals' pain.<ref name=":2" />
