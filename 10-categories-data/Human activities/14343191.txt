A '''BLUF''' ('''bottom line up front''')<ref name="thefreedictionary">{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/BLUF|title=BLUF|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2017|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> is a paragraph where the conclusions and recommendations are placed at the ''beginning'' of the text, rather than the end, in order to facilitate rapid decision making. This differs from an older, more-traditional style in which conclusions and recommendations are included at the end, following the arguments and considerations of facts. The concept is not exclusive to writing; it can also refer to conversations and interviews.<ref name="LeadersInc">{{cite web|url=http://www.leadersinc.com/default2.asp?active_page_id=920|title=Leaders Inc.

A BLUF differs from an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] or [[executive summary]] in that it does not necessarily summarize the arguments or evidence included.  

The term is common in US military writing.<ref name="ArmyRegulation25–50">[https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=65218 Army Regulation 25–50, "Preparing and Managing Correspondence," Chapter 1-IV, Effective Writing and Correspondence: The Army Writing Style, 1–36b, Standards for Army writing, page 6 (17 May 2013)]</ref>

== Writing ==
Use of BLUF can be routinely seen in executive summaries in reports, subject lines in e-mails, and abstracts in scholarly articles.<ref name="eWriteOnline">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ewriteonline.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/1439/pid/1016 |title=eWrite Online |access-date=2007-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620124344/http://www.ewriteonline.com/ht/display/ArticleDetails/i/1439/pid/1016 |archive-date=2008-06-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It may be applied directly to the format of a [[résumé]] to prevent it being too long or wordy.<ref name="GIJobs">{{cite web|url=http://www.gijobs.net/magazine.cfm?issueId=46&id=563|title=GI Jobs|website=gijobs.net|accessdate=17 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216052300/http://www.gijobs.net/magazine.cfm?issueId=46&id=563|archive-date=2007-12-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> In certain [[technical writing]], BLUF may be considered desirable. It has also been advocated for scholarly articles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/writingmatterssite/Home/being-direct-1-bottom-line-up-front|title=Being Direct 1: Martin Krieger's 'Bottom Line Up Front' - writingmatterssite|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref>

== Conversation ==
In conversation, the BLUF model can be used to keep conversation or answers to questions concise and focused on the immediate topic, in order to help a person talk less (such as in an interview).<ref name="LeadersInc"/>

== Planning ==
The BLUF model can also be used in planning and management to ensure the purpose of plans are kept in mind, decision-maker support is more readily attainable, and impact may more easily and accurately be measured.<ref name="Keys2EHP">{{cite web|url=http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/dhpw/Population/Documents/12BLUF_HealthPromotionKey.pdf|title=Keys to Effective Health Promotion (based around a BLUF model)|website=army.mil|accessdate=17 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716125827/http://chppm-www.apgea.army.mil/dhpw/Population/Documents/12BLUF_HealthPromotionKey.pdf|archive-date=2007-07-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Psychological assessment ==
