{{Capitalism}}
'''Consumerism''' is a [[social]] and economic order that encourages the acquisition of [[goods and services]] in ever-increasing amounts. With the [[industrial revolution]], but particularly in the 20th century, [[mass production]] led to [[overproduction]]—the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of goods would grow beyond consumer [[Demand (economics)|demand]], and so manufacturers turned to [[planned obsolescence]] and [[advertising]] to manipulate consumer spending.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Czarnecka|first1=Barbara|last2=Schivinski|first2=Bruno|date=17 June 2019|title=Do Consumers Acculturated to Global Consumer Culture Buy More Impulsively?

(also available: [http://www.gutenberg.net/browse/BIBREC/BR833.HTM Project Gutenberg e-text])</ref> In it, Veblen "views the activities and spending habits of this leisure class in terms of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste.

In [[economics]], consumerism may refer to economic policies which emphasise [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. In an abstract sense, it is the consideration that the [[free choice]] of [[consumer]]s should strongly orient the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how, and therefore orient the economic organization of a society (compare [[producerism]], especially in the British sense of the term).<ref>"Consumerism". Britannica Concise Encyclopedia Online. 2008.</ref> In this sense, consumerism expresses the idea not of "one man, one voice", but of "one pound, one voice", which may or may not reflect the contribution of people to society.

{{quote|In the almost complete absence of other sustained macro-political and social narratives, concern about global [[Global warming|climate change]] notwithstanding, the pursuit of [[Eudaimonia|the 'good life']] through practices of what is known as 'consumerism' has become one of the dominant global social forces, cutting across differences of religion, class, gender, ethnicity and nationality. It is the other side of the dominant ideology of [[market globalism]] and is central to what [[Manfred Steger]] calls the 'global imaginary'.<ref>

==Term==
The term ''consumerism'' has several definitions.<ref name="Modern Consumerism">{{cite book |last1=Swagler |first1=Roger |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=Brobeck |editor1-link=Stephen Brobeck |title=Encyclopedia of the Consumer Movement |year=1997 |publisher=ABC-Clio |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn=0874369878 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00brob/page/172 172–173] |chapter=Modern Consumerism |title-link=Encyclopedia of the Consumer Movement }}, which is based on {{Cite journal | last1 = Swagler | first1 = R. | title = Evolution and Applications of the Term Consumerism: Theme and Variations | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6606.1994.tb00856.x | journal = Journal of Consumer Affairs | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–360 | year = 1994 }}</ref> These definitions may not be related to each other and confusingly, they conflict with each other.

#One sense of the term relates to efforts to support consumers' interests.<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> By the early 1970s it had become the accepted term for the field and began to be used in these ways:<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/>
##Consumerism is the concept that consumers should be informed decision makers in the marketplace.<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> In this sense consumerism is the study and practice of matching consumers with trustworthy information, such as [[product testing]] reports.
##Consumerism is the concept that the marketplace itself is responsible for ensuring [[social justice]] through fair economic practices.<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> [[Consumer protection]] policies and laws compel manufacturers to make products safe.
##Consumerism refers to the field of studying, regulating, or interacting with the marketplace.<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> The [[consumer movement]] is the social movement which refers to all actions and all entities within the marketplace which give consideration to the consumer.
#While the above definitions were becoming established, other people began using the term ''consumerism'' to mean "high levels of consumption".<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> This definition has gained popularity since the 1970s and began to be used in these ways:
##Consumerism is the selfish and frivolous collecting of products, or [[economic materialism]]. In this sense consumerism is negative and in opposition to positive lifestyles of [[anti-consumerism]] and [[simple living]].<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/>
##Consumerism is a force from the marketplace which destroys individuality and harms society.<ref name="Modern Consumerism"/> It is related to [[globalization]] and in protest against this some people promote the "[[anti-globalization movement]]".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/shrunken-sovereign-consumerism-globalization-and-american-emptiness |title= Shrunken Sovereign: Consumerism, Globalization, and American Emptiness |first= Benjamin R. |last= Barber |work= [[World Affairs]]|date= Spring 2008 |access-date= 23 April 2013}}</ref>

In a 1955 speech, [[John Bugas]] (number two at the [[Ford Motor Company]]) coined the term ''consumerism'' as a substitute for ''capitalism'' to better describe the American economy:<ref name="Eriksson">{{cite web |url = http://est.sagepub.com/content/16/2/153 |title= On self-service democracy: Configurations of individualizing governance and self-directed citizenship |first= Kai |last= Eriksson |work= European Journal of Social Theory|date= 20 November 2012 |access-date= 1 November 2014}}</ref>
{{quote|The term ''consumerism'' would pin the tag where it actually belongs – on Mr. Consumer, the real boss and beneficiary of the American system. It would pull the rug right out from under our unfriendly critics who have blasted away so long and loud at capitalism. Somehow, I just can't picture them shouting: "Down with the consumers!"<ref>{{cite news |title= Consumerism Label Urged |publisher= Independent Press-Telegram |date= 23 January 1955}}</ref>}}
Bugas's definition aligned with [[Austrian economics]] founder [[Carl Menger]]'s vision (in his 1871 book [[Principles of Economics (Menger)|''Principles of Economics'']]) of consumer sovereignty, whereby consumer preferences, valuations, and choices control the economy entirely (a concept directly opposed to the [[Karl Marx|Marxian]] perception of the capitalist economy as a system of exploitation).<ref>{{cite book|last= Caldwell|first= Bruce J.|title= Carl Menger and His Legacy in Economics|year= 1990|publisher= Duke University Press}}</ref>

[[Vance Packard]] worked to change the meaning of the term ''consumerism'' from a positive word about consumer practices to a negative word meaning excessive materialism and waste.<ref name="Glickman">

===Origins===

The consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century.<ref>

 | quote = McKendrick dated ''The Birth of a Consumer Society'' confidently to the third quarter of the eighteenth century, and located it in Britain. [...] Yet historians working on earlier European periods were not entirely happy to see their subjects treated as static or defective, little more than a 'traditional' backdrop to the main drama of the birth of modernity in Hanoverian Britain. A race got under way, as one after another claimed a 'consumer revolution' for their own period. Stuart historians have spotted it in seventeenth-century England, Renaissance scholars traced its roots to fifteenth-century Florence and Venice, while medieval historians detected its embryonic stirrings in a new taste for beef and ale and playing cards. Scholars of China added that the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), too, had a cult of things and deserved to be recognized as 'early modern'.

While some{{which|date=October 2018}} claim that change was propelled by the growing [[middle-class]] who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and about the growing importance of [[fashion]] as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity, many{{quantify|date=October 2018}} critics argue that consumerism was a political and economic necessity for the reproduction of [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[Competition (economics)|competition]] for markets and profits, while others{{who|date=October 2018}} point to the increasing political strength of international working-class organizations during a rapid increase in technological productivity and decline in necessary scarcity as a catalyst to develop a consumer culture based on therapeutic entertainments, [[home-ownership]] and [[debt]]. The "middle-class" view argues that this revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed{{by whom|date=October 2018}} to cater for comfort and the increased availability of [[luxury goods]] aimed at a growing market. Such luxury goods included [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]]; these were increasingly grown on vast plantations (historically by [[slavery|slave]] labor) in the Caribbean as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in [[Great Britain|Britain]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.recercat.net/bitstream/handle/2072/41988/1163.pdf?sequence=1 |title= recercat.net |website= www.recercat.net}}</ref> during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20.

Critics{{which|date= July 2018}} argue that [[colonialism]] did indeed help drive consumerism, but they would place the emphasis on the supply rather than the demand as the motivating factor. An increasing mass of exotic imports as well as domestic manufactures had to be consumed by the same number of people who had been consuming far less than was becoming necessary. Historically, the notion that high levels of consumption of consumer goods is the same thing as achieving success or even freedom did not precede large-scale capitalist production and colonial imports. That idea was produced{{by whom|date= July 2018}} later{{when|date= July 2018}}, more or less strategically, in order to intensify consumption domestically and to make resistant cultures more flexible to extend its reach.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ewen |first= Stuart |title= Captains of Consciousness |orig-year= 1976 |year= 2001 |publisher= Basic Books.}}</ref><ref>

|quote = The origins of the consumer society as we know it today can be traced back  a  few  hundred  years.  According  to  McKendrick,  Brewer  and Plumb (1982) the birthplace can be found in eighteenth century England. However,   as   McCracken   (1988)   has   pointed   out,   the   consumer revolution as a whole needs to be seen as part of a larger transformation in  Western  societies,  which  began  in  the  sixteenth  century.  The  social changes    brought    about    by    that    transformation    resulted in the modification of Western concepts of time, space, society, the individual, the family and the state. This provided the base on which the consumer revolution could thrive and develop into a mass phenomenon.McCracken   (1988)   was   one   of   the   first   scholars   offering   acomprehensive review of the history of consumption. He approached the subject  by  dividing  the  course  of  events  into  three moments.  The  first moment falls   within   the   last   quarter   of   the   sixteenth   century   in Elizabethan  England  where  profound  changes  in  consumption  pattern occurred  in  a  small  section  of  the  population.  This  was  the  moment where  some  of  the  established  concepts,  notably  the  concepts  of  space, the individual and the family began to falter. The circumstances bringing about these changes served as a primer for the consumer movement that would  come  a  century  later.  McCracken  describes  this  as  the  second moment. It was characterized by a heightened propensity to spend, by a greatly   extended   choice   of   goods,   and   an   increased   frequency   of purchases. Fashion started to play an important role too, and, for the first time,  the  individual  as  a  consumer  became  the  target  of  manipulative attempts.  The  origins  of  modern  marketing  instruments  can  be  traced back  to  this  time.  With  the  rise  of  the  third  moment, the  consumer movement  was  already  a  structural  feature  of  life  (McCracken,  1988). However,  the  development  was  not  yet  completed.  The  19th  century added new qualities to the movement and turned it into a 'dream world of consumption' (Williams, 1982).

===Mass production===
{{main|Mass production}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] dramatically increased the availability of consumer goods, although it was still primarily focused on the capital goods sector and industrial infrastructure (i.e., mining, steel, oil, transportation networks, communications networks, industrial cities, financial centers, etc.).<ref>Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 701</ref> The advent of the [[department store]] represented a paradigm shift in the experience of shopping. Customers could now buy an astonishing variety of goods, all in one place, and shopping became a popular leisure activity.
While previously the norm had been the scarcity of resources, the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial era]] created an unprecedented economic situation. For the first time in history, products were available in outstanding quantities, at outstandingly low prices, being thus available to virtually everyone in the industrialized West.

By the turn of the 20th century, the average worker in [[Western Europe]] or the [[United States]] still spent approximately 80–90% of their income on food and other necessities. What was needed to propel consumerism, was a system of [[mass production]] and consumption, exemplified by [[Henry Ford]], an American [[car]] manufacturer. After observing the assembly lines in the meat packing industry, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] brought his theory of [[scientific management]] to the organization of the assembly line in other industries; this unleashed incredible productivity and reduced the costs of commodities produced on assembly lines around the world.<ref>Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 702</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}

Consumerism has long had intentional underpinnings, rather than just developing out of capitalism. As an example, [[Earnest Elmo Calkins]] noted to fellow [[advertising]] executives in 1932 that "consumer engineering must see to it that we use up the kind of goods we now merely use", while the domestic theorist [[Christine Frederick]] observed in 1929 that "the way to break the vicious deadlock of a low standard of living is to spend freely, and even waste creatively".<ref name="DEADMALL">{{cite web|url=http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11747|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114231851/http://changeobserver.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=11747|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 November 2009|title=Essay – Dawn of the Dead Mall|date=11 November 2009|work=The Design Observer Group|access-date=14 February 2010}}</ref>

The older term and concept of "[[conspicuous consumption]]" originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writings of sociologist and economist, [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{cquote|It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Veblen|first=Thorstein|title=The Theory of the Leisure Class|year=2010}}</ref>}}

The term "conspicuous consumption" spread to describe consumerism in the United States in the 1960s, but was soon linked to debates about [[media influence|media theory]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]].

{{cquote|By 1920 most Americans had experimented with occasional installment buying.<ref>{{cite book|last=Calder|first=Lendol Glen|title=Financing the American Dream: A Cultural History of Consumer Credit|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1990|location=Princeton, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/financingamerica00cald_0/page/222 222]|isbn=0-691-05827-X|url=https://archive.org/details/financingamerica00cald_0/page/222}}</ref>

===In the 21st century===
[[File:Dongmen.JPG|thumb|[[McDonald's]] and [[KFC]] restaurants in [[China]]]]
Madeline Levine criticized what she saw as a large change in American culture – "a shift away from values of [[community]], [[spirituality]], and integrity, and toward competition, materialism and disconnection."<ref>Levine, Madeline. "[http://www.nais.org/publications/ismagazinearticle.cfm?ItemNumber=150274 Challenging the Culture of Affluence]". Independent School. 67.1 (2007): 28–36. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060753/http://www.nais.org/publications/ismagazinearticle.cfm?ItemNumber=150274 |date=27 September 2011 }}</ref>

Businesses have realized that wealthy consumers are the most attractive targets of marketing. The upper class's tastes, lifestyles, and preferences trickle down to become the standard for all consumers. The not-so-wealthy consumers can "purchase something new that will speak of their place in the tradition of affluence".<ref>Miller, Eric. Attracting the Affluent. Naperville, Illinois: Financial Sourcebooks, 1990.</ref> A consumer can have the [[Deferred gratification|instant gratification]] of purchasing an expensive item to improve social status.

Emulation is also a core component of 21st century consumerism. As a general trend, regular consumers seek to emulate those who are above them in the social hierarchy. The poor strive to imitate the wealthy and the wealthy imitate celebrities and other icons. The celebrity endorsement of products can be seen as evidence of the desire of modern consumers to purchase products partly or solely to emulate people of higher social status. This purchasing behavior may co-exist in the mind of a consumer with an image of oneself as being an individualist.

Cultural capital, the intangible social value of goods, is not solely generated by [[Information pollution#Cultural factors|cultural pollution]]. Subcultures also manipulate the value and prevalence of certain commodities through the process of [[bricolage]]. Bricolage is the process by which mainstream products are adopted and transformed by subcultures.<ref>Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. "Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture". Oxford UP, 2001, p.78</ref> These items develop a function and meaning that differs from their corporate producer's intent. In many cases, commodities that have undergone bricolage often develop political meanings. For example, Doc Martens, originally [[Marketing|marketed]] as workers boots, gained popularity with the punk movement and AIDs activism groups and became symbols of an individual's place in that social group.<ref>Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. "Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture". Oxford UP, 2001, p. 79</ref> When corporate America recognized the growing popularity of Doc Martens they underwent another change in cultural meaning through counter-bricolage. The widespread sale and marketing of Doc Martens brought the boots back into the mainstream. While corporate America reaped the ever-growing profits of the increasingly expensive boot and those modeled after its style, Doc Martens lost their original political association. Mainstream consumers used Doc Martens and similar items to create an "individualized" sense [[Consumer identity|identity]] by appropriating statement items from subcultures they admired.

When consumerism is considered as a movement to improve rights and powers of buyers in relation to sellers, there are certain traditional rights and powers of sellers and buyers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gary Armstrong|author2=Stewart Adam|author3=Sara Denize|author4=Philip Kotler|title=Principles of Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKyaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA463|year=2014|publisher=Pearson Australia|isbn=978-1-4860-0253-5|page=463}}</ref>

Since consumerism began, various individuals and groups have consciously sought an alternative lifestyle. These movements range on a spectrum from moderate "[[simple living]]",<ref>See for example: Janet Luhrs's ''The Simple Living Guide'' (NY: Broadway Books, 1997); Joe Dominquez, Vicki Robin et al., ''Your Money or Your Life'' (NY: Penguin Group USA, 2008)</ref> [[Environmentally friendly|"eco-conscious shopping"]],<ref>See for example: Alan Durning, ''How Much is Enough: The Consumer Society and the Future of the Earth'' (New York: W.

Building on these movements, the discipline of [[ecological economics]] addresses the macro-economic, social and ecological implications of a primarily consumer-driven economy.

In many critical contexts, ''consumerism'' is used{{by whom|date=August 2018}} to describe the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially those with commercial [[brand]]-names and perceived [[status symbol|status-symbolism]] appeal, e.g. a [[luxury car]], [[designer clothing]], or expensive [[jewelry]]. Consumerism can take extreme forms – such that consumers sacrifice significant time and income not only to purchase but also to actively support a certain firm or brand.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Eisingerich|first1= Andreas B.|last2= Bhardwaj|first2= Gunjan|last3= Miyamoto|first3= Yoshio|date= April 2010|title= Behold the Extreme Consumers and Learn to Embrace Them|journal= Harvard Business Review|volume= 88|pages= 30–31|url= http://hbr.org/2010/04/vision-statement-behold-the-extreme-consumersand-learn-to-embrace-them/ar/1}}</ref> As stated by Gary Cross in his book "All Consuming Century: Why Consumerism Won in Modern America", he states "consumerism succeeded where other ideologies failed because it concretely expressed the cardinal political ideals of the century – liberty and democracy – and with relatively little self-distructive behavior or personal humiliation." He discusses how consumerism won in its forms of expression. However, many people are skeptical of this over-romanticised outlook. 

Opponents of consumerism argue that many luxuries and unnecessary consumer-products may act as a social mechanism allowing people to identify like-minded individuals through the display of similar products, again utilizing aspects of status-symbolism to judge [[socioeconomic status]] and [[social stratification]]. Some people believe relationships with a product or brand name are substitutes for healthy human relationships lacking in [[societies]], and along with consumerism, create a [[cultural hegemony]], and are part of a general process of social control<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newindpress.com/sunday/sundayitems.asp?id=SEV20060406083003&eTitle=Focus&rLink=0/ |title= Fool Britannia |publisher= Newindpress.com |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080414235736/http://www.newindpress.com/sunday/sundayitems.asp?id=SEV20060406083003&eTitle=Focus&rLink=0%2F |archive-date= 14 April 2008 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> in modern society.

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated:
{{cquote|Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.<ref>Lebow, Victor. http://hundredgoals.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/journal-of-retailing.pdf</ref>}}

Critics of consumerism include [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI]],<ref>Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/</ref> [[Pope Francis]],<ref>"Loss of Biodiversity". Laudato Si': on Care for Our Common Home: Encyclical Letter, by Pope Francis, Our Sunday Visitor, 2015, pp. 27–27.</ref> German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), who said: "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure and lacks depth"<ref name="ReferenceA">Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge</ref>), and French writer [[Georges Duhamel]] (1884–1966), who held American materialism up as "a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Pope Francis also critiques consumerism in his book "Laudato Si' On Care For Our Common Home." He critiques the harm consumerism does to the environment and states, "The analysis of environmental problems cannot be separated from the analysis of human, family, work-related and urban contexts, nor from how individuals relate to themselves, which leads in turn to how they relate to others and to the environment."<ref>https://www.cssr.org.au/justice_matters/dsp-default.cfm?loadref=643</ref> Pope Francis believes obsession with consumerism leads individuals further away from their humanity and obscures the interrelated nature between humans and the environment.

Another critic is James Gustave Speth. He argues that the [[growth imperative]] represents the main goal of capitalistic consumerism. In his book ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World'' he notes, "Basically, the economic system does not work when it comes to protecting environmental resources, and the political system does not work when it comes to correcting the economic system".

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion ... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities."<ref name="Coghlan">{{cite web|last= Coghlan|first= Andy|title= Consumerism is 'eating the future' |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17569-consumerism-is-eating-the-future.html|access-date= 12 December 2009}}</ref> According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries, which have a material surplus due to their lower consumption.<ref name="Coghlan"/> Not only that, but McCraken indicates that the ways in which consumer goods and services are bought, created and used should be taken under consideration when studying consumption.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Fp8WVG1S_QAC&q=consumerism&pg=PP10|title= Consumerism: As a Way of Life|last= Miles|first= Steven|date= 31 August 1998|publisher= SAGE|isbn= 9780761952152|language= en}}</ref>

Furthermore, some theorists have concerns with the place commodity takes in the definition of one's self. Media theorists Straut Ewen coined the term "commodity self" to describe an identity built by the goods we consume.<ref name="Sturken 2001, p. 279">Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. "Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture". Oxford UP, 2001, p. 279</ref> For example, people often identify as PC or Mac users, or define themselves as a Coke drinker rather than Pepsi. The ability to choose one product out of an apparent mass of others allows a person to build a sense "unique" individuality, despite the prevalence of Mac users or the nearly identical tastes of Coke and Pepsi.<ref name="Sturken 2001, p. 279"/> By owning a product from a certain brand, one's ownership becomes a vehicle of presenting an identity that is associated with the attitude of the brand. The idea of individual choice is exploited by corporations that claim to sell "uniqueness" and the building blocks of an identity. The invention of the commodity self is a driving force of consumerist societies, preying upon the deep human need to build a sense of self.

Not all anti-consumerists oppose [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] in itself, but they argue against increasing the consumption of resources beyond what is [[sustainability|environmentally sustainable]]. [[Jonathan Porritt]] writes that consumers are often unaware of the negative environmental impacts of producing many modern goods and services, and that the extensive [[advertising]]-industry only serves to reinforce increasing consumption.<ref>{{cite web

Likewise, other ecological economists such as [[Herman Daly]] and [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] recognize the inherent conflict between consumer-driven consumption and planet-wide ecological degradation.

In the 21st century's globalized economy, consumerism has become a noticeable part of the culture.<ref>{{Cite journal | year=2012 | last1= James | first1= Paul | last2= Scerri | first2= Andy | author-link1= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalizing Consumption and the Deferral of a Politics of Consequence | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230921 | journal= Globalizations | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 225–240| doi= 10.1080/14747731.2012.658249 | s2cid= 67761604 }}</ref> Critics of the phenomenon not only criticized it against what is environmentally sustainable, but also the spread of consumerism in cultural aspects. However, several scholars have written about the intersection of consumer culture and the environment. Discussions of the environmental implications of consumerist ideologies in work by economists Gustave Speth<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bridgeatedgeofwo00spet|title=The bridge at the edge of the world : capitalism, the environment, and crossing from crisis to sustainability|last=Gustave.|first=Speth, James|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300136111|location=New Haven|oclc=177820867}}</ref> and Naomi Klein,<ref>{{Cite book|title=This changes everything : capitalism vs. the climate|last=1970-|first=Klein, Naomi|isbn=9781451697384|edition= First Simon & Schuster trade paperback |location=New York|oclc=894746822|date = 16 September 2014}}</ref> and consumer cultural historian Gary Cross.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An all-consuming century : why commercialism won in modern America|last=S.|first=Cross, Gary|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0231502532|location=New York|oclc=50817376}}</ref> Leslie Sklair proposes the criticism through the idea of culture-ideology of consumerism in his works. He says that,

{{quote|First, capitalism entered a qualitatively new globalizing phase in the 1950s. As the electronic revolution got underway, significant changes began to occur in the productivity of capitalist factories, systems of extraction and processing of raw materials, product design, marketing and distribution of goods and services. […] Second, the technical and social relations that structured the mass media all over the world made it very easy for new consumerist lifestyles to become the dominant motif for these media, which became in time extraordinarily efficient vehicles for the broadcasting of the culture-ideology of consumerism globally.<ref>Sklair, L. 2012. Culture-Ideology of Consumerism. The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization</ref>}}

As of today, people are exposed to mass consumerism and [[product placement]] in the media or even in their daily lives. The line between information, entertainment, and promotion of products has been blurred so people are more reformulated into consumerist behaviour.<ref name="Leslie Sklair 2002">Leslie Sklair, from Chapter 5 of Globalization: Capitalism and Its Alternatives, 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002. Reprinted with permission of Oxford University Press</ref> [[Shopping centers]] are a representative example of a place where people are explicitly exposed to an environment that welcomes and encourages consumption as some of them are open for 24 hours. Goss says that the shopping center designers "strive to present an alternative rationale for the shopping center's existence, manipulate shoppers' behavior through the configuration of space, and consciously design a symbolic landscape that provokes associative moods and dispositions in the shopper".<ref>Jon Goss(1993), The "Magic of the Mall": An Analysis of Form, Function, and Meaning in the Contemporary Retail Built Environment, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 83, No. 1. (Mar. 1993), pp. 18–47</ref> On the prevalence of consumerism in daily life, Historian Gary Cross says that "The endless variation of clothing, travel, and entertainment provided opportunity for practically everyone to find a personal niche, no matter their race, age, gender or class."<ref>Cross, Gary S. An All-Consuming Century: Why Commercialism Won in Modern America. Columbia University Press, 2002. pp.233</ref>

The success of the consumerist cultural ideology can be witnessed all around the world. People rush to the mall to buy products and end up spending money with their [[credit cards]], thus locking themselves into the financial system of [[capitalist]] globalization.<ref name="Leslie Sklair 2002"/>
