The "'''Bambi effect'''" is an objection against the killing of animals that are perceived as "cute" or "adorable", such as deer, while there may be little or no objection to the suffering of animals that are perceived as somehow repulsive or less than desirable, such as pigs or other woodland creatures.<ref>{{Cite book

The effect was also cited in the events following a record snowfall in the U.S. state of [[Colorado]] in 2007, when food for [[mule deer]], [[pronghorn]]s, and [[elk]] became so scarce that they began to starve; the Colorado Department of Wildlife was inundated with requests and offers to help the animals from citizens, and ended up spending almost $2 million feeding the hungry wildlife.<ref>{{Cite book
