==Occupation==
The site was squatted on 4 July, 1991, as an [[List of environmental protests|environmental protest action]]. Local people were concerned for the rare plants and animals, since the [[Daimler-Benz]] automobile company ([[Mercedes-Benz]]) intended to build a test track (12 km long, 3 km wide). The squatters lived [[off-the-grid]] without running water and heating with woodstoves. There was an [[infoshop]] and [[small-scale agriculture]]. They also lived a [[vegan]] lifestyle, eating communally every night.<ref name="DoD">{{cite journal |title=Anatopia - Anarchy and Mercedes in Germany |journal=Do or Die |date=1996 |volume=5 |pages=43-44 |url=http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no5/world_mercedes.htm |accessdate=25 December 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225135133/http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no5/world_mercedes.htm||archivedate=25 December 2019 }}</ref>
