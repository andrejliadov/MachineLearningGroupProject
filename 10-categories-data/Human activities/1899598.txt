The use, procuring or offering of a child by others for illegal activities, including [[Drug trafficking|the trafficking]] or production of drugs, is one of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention#Predefined worst forms of child labour|''predefined worst forms of child labour'']] in terms of the [[International Labour Organization]]'s [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]], adopted in 1999.

It is also known as '''Children used by adults in the commission of crime''' (CUBAC).

In terms of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation]] ratifying countries should ensure that CUBAC is a criminal offence, and also provide for other criminal, civil or administrative remedies to ensure the effective enforcement of such national legislation (Article III(12) to (14)).
