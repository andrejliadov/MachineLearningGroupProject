A '''diplomatic mission''' or '''foreign mission'''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/ofm/property/fmc/c53113.htm |title=What is a Foreign Mission /Chancery? |website=www.state.gov |language=en-PH |access-date=2017-08-25}}</ref> is a group of people from one [[Sovereign state|state]] or an organization present in another state to represent the sending state or organization officially in the receiving state. In practice, the phrase ''[[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission'' usually denotes the resident mission, namely the '''embassy''', which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country; this is usually, but not necessarily, in the receiving state's [[Capital (political)|capital]] city. [[Consulates]], on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located in major cities of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state). As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/systemsregionsin1950nier <!-- quote="diplomatic mission" -wikipedia "non-resident". --> Tom Nierop, ''Systems and Regions in Global Politics''] (Wiley, John and Sons 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-471-94942-8}}), p. 67.</ref><ref>"The Russian Federation has diplomatic relations with a total of 187 countries, but some of them – mainly for financial reasons – maintain non-resident embassies in other countries", [https://books.google.com/books?id=87e5AAAAIAAJ&q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&hl=en&ei=zrNuTaCUKMiHhQe6kOk-&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTge ''International Affairs''], issues 4–6 (Znanye Pub.

==Terminology==
A country may have several different types of diplomatic missions in another country.

An '''embassy''' is a diplomatic mission generally located in the capital city of another country which offers a full range of services, including consular services.

A '''high commission''' is an embassy of a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country located in another Commonwealth country.

A '''permanent mission''' is a diplomatic mission to a major international organization.

A '''consulate general''' is a diplomatic mission located in a major city, usually other than the capital city, which provides a full range of consular services.

A '''[[consulate]]''' is a diplomatic mission that is similar to a consulate general, but may not provide a full range of services.

A '''[[legation]]''' was a diplomatic representative office of lower rank than an embassy. Where an embassy was headed by an [[ambassador]], a legation was headed by a [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary|minister]]. Ambassadors [[diplomatic rank|outranked]] ministers and had precedence at official events. Legations were originally the most common form of diplomatic mission, but they fell out of favor after World War II and were upgraded to embassies.

A '''consulate headed by an Honorary Consul''' is a diplomatic mission headed by an Honorary Consul which provides only a limited range of services.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/mission_types.htm|title = Types of Diplomatic Missions|website = e Diplomat|date = 2016}}</ref>

The head of an embassy is known as an [[ambassador]] or [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioner]]. The term ''embassy'' is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but, strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the ''[[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]]''. Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.

The members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission's chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf |title=1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, article 30 }}</ref>

All missions to the [[United Nations]] are known simply as ''permanent missions'', while [[EU member states]]' missions to the [[European Union]] are known as ''permanent representations'', and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador. European Union missions abroad are known as EU delegations. Some countries have more particular naming for their missions and staff: a [[Holy See|Vatican]] mission is headed by a [[nuncio]] ([[Latin]] for "envoy") and consequently known as an ''[[apostolic nunciature]]''. Under the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libya's missions]] used the name ''people's bureau'', headed by a secretary.

Missions between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries are known as ''high commissions'', and their heads are high commissioners.<ref name="name">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrRdc5SI_R4C&pg=PT50 |page=33 |title=Introduction To Tourism And Hospitality Industry |author=Sidhur Andrews |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |date=1 Jun 2007|isbn=9780070660212 }}</ref> Generally speaking, ambassadors and high commissioners are regarded as equivalent in status and function, and embassies and high commissions are both deemed to be diplomatic missions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/diplomatic-and-consular-representations/ |title=Diplomatic and Consular Representations |first=Jim S. |last=Nutt }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/cpadocs/cpa%20address%20140311.pdf|title=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, "What does the work of a High Commissioner involve?" }}</ref>

In the past, a diplomatic mission headed by a lower-ranking official (an ''envoy'' or ''minister resident'') was known as a ''[[legation]]''. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of ''legation'' is no longer used today. (See [[diplomatic rank]].)

A [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] is similar to, but not the same as a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. A consulate or consulate general is generally a representative of the embassy in locales outside of the capital city.<ref name=name/> For instance, the Philippines  has its [[Embassy of the Philippines in Washington, D.C.]], but also maintains seven consulates-general and four consulates elsewhere in the US. The person in charge of a consulate or consulate-general is known as a consul or consul-general, respectively. Similar services may also be provided at the embassy (to serve the region of the capital) in what is normally called a consular section.

In cases of dispute, it is common for a country to [[Letter of credence|recall]] its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure. This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' (usually the [[deputy chief of mission]]) who may have limited powers. A ''chargé d'affaires ad interim'' also heads the mission during the interim between the end of one chief of mission's term and the beginning of another.

==Extraterritoriality==
[[File:Diplomatic Corps seal - Corps Diplomatique emblem logo.png|thumb|upright=0.45|right|Seal of a [[diplomatic corps]]]]
Contrary to popular belief, most diplomatic missions do not enjoy full [[extraterritorial status]] and – in those cases – are not sovereign territory of the represented state.<ref>'[http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/miscellaneous/laws-and-rules-regarding-extraterritoriality/ Laws and Rules Regarding Extraterritoriality]' on integrity-legal.com: "There is a common misconception that Embassies and Consulates have extraterritoriality. As anecdotal evidence of this misconception, people will often say things like, 'the US Embassy sits upon United States soil.' For the most part, this is not the case as extraterritoriality is not conferred upon an Embassy or Consulate, but in some situations extraterritoriality may be created by Treaty".</ref> Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions usually{{examples needed|date=August 2019}} remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]]. Diplomats themselves still retain full [[diplomatic immunity]], and (as an adherent to the Vienna Convention) the host country may not enter the premises of the mission without permission of the represented country, even to put out a fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm |title=What is a U.S. Embassy? |website=diplomacy.state.gov |access-date=2014-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510232505/https://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm |archive-date=2018-05-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> International rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The term "extraterritoriality" is often applied to diplomatic missions, but normally only in this broader sense.

As the host country may not enter the representing country's embassy without permission, embassies are sometimes used by [[refugee]]s escaping from either the host country or a third country. For example, [[North Korea]]n nationals, who would be arrested and deported from China upon discovery, have sought sanctuary at various third-country embassies in China. Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country. See the [[list of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission]] for a list of some notable cases.

Notable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy, Beijing (1967),<ref>{{cite news |date=15 August 2012 |title=Sir Ray Whitney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9478296/Sir-Ray-Whitney.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=17 August 2015 |quote=Red Guards scaled the British mission's wall as diplomats watched the Ealing comedy ''Two-Way Stretch''.

==Role==
[[File:Embassy of Nicaragua.JPG|thumb|250px|Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.|[[Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.]].]]The Vienna Convention states:<blockquote>The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, ''inter alia'', in representing the sending State in the receiving State; protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf |title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships, article 3 }}</ref></blockquote>

Diplomatic missions between members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are not called embassies, but [[high commission (Commonwealth)|high commission]]s, for Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in the [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]]. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state.

The rights and immunities (such as [[diplomatic immunity]]) of diplomatic missions are codified in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].

==Multiple missions in a city==
Some cities may host more than one mission from the same country. An example is Rome, where many states maintain missions to [[Foreign relations of Italy|Italy]] and another to the [[Holy See]]. It is not customary for these missions to share premises nor diplomatic personnel. At present, only the [[Iraq]]i missions to Italy and the [[Holy See]] share premises; however, two ambassadors are appointed, one to each country. In the case of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|UN's Food Agencies]], the Head of Mission to the Italian Republic is usually accredited as [[permanent representative]]. The United States maintains a separate [[United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome]], whose head is the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]]. [[Kolkata]] in India hosts two Bangladeshi Deputy High Commissions, one at [[Park Circus]] and another, opened later, at Mirza Galib Street. This was done to reduce overcrowding inside the Deputy High Commission. Both the Deputy High Commissions issue Bangladeshi visas.

==Non-diplomatic offices==
{{main|De facto embassy}}

Governments of [[List of states with limited recognition|states not recognized by the receiving state]] and of territories that make no claim to be sovereign states may set up offices abroad that do not have official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention. Examples are the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s that represent the government of the [[Republic of China]]; [[Somaliland]]'s Representative Offices in London, [[Addis Ababa]], Rome, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s that represent the government of that territory. Such offices assume some of the non-diplomatic functions of diplomatic posts, such as promoting trade interests and providing assistance to its citizens and residents. They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto, for example.
