==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.<ref>Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.</ref> This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,<ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/>  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.<ref>Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.</ref> The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilities are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.<ref>Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243.

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” <ref name="autogenerated1"/> without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes <ref>Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.</ref> Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.<ref>Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.</ref> It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&nbsp;m/s.<ref>Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.</ref> If an individual is unable to walk at >0.4&nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.<ref>Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.</ref>

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,<ref>Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care & Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.</ref> but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.<ref>Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.</ref>

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.<ref>Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.</ref> The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.<ref>Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.</ref> The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100145/http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.<ref>Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.</ref> 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100145/http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.
