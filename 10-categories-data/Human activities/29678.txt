'''Trade''' involves the transfer of [[goods and services|goods or services]] from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for [[money]]. [[Economists]] refer to a [[system]] or network that allows trade as a [[market (economics)|market]].

An early form of trade, [[barter]], saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services.<ref name=Samuelson1939>{{cite journal | last1= Samuelson | first1= P | title= The Gains from International Trade | journal= The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science | date= 1939 | volume= 5 | issue= 2 | pages= 195–205 | doi= 10.2307/137133 |jstor= 137133 }}</ref>{{qn |date= December 2017}} Barter involves trading things without the use of money.<ref name=Samuelson1939/>  When either bartering party started to involve [[precious metal]]s, these gained symbolic as well as practical importance.{{citation needed|date= May 2018}} Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, '''buying''' can be separated from '''selling''', or [[Earnings|earning]]. The  [[History of money#The emergence of money|invention of money]] (and later of [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[paper money]] and  [[digital currency|non-physical money]]) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called [[bilateral trade]], while trade involving more than two traders is called [[multilateral trade]].

In one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the [[division of labor]], a predominant form of [[economic activity]] in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs.<ref name=DollarKraay2004>{{cite journal | last1= Dollar | first1= D | last2= Kraay | first2= A | title= Trade, Growth, and Poverty | journal= The Economic Journal | date= 2004 | volume= 114 | issue= 493 | pages= F22–F49 | doi= 10.1111/j.0013-0133.2004.00186.x | url= http://econ.worldbank.org/files/1820_dollar.pdf | citeseerx= 10.1.1.509.1584 | s2cid= 62781399 | access-date= 2017-10-26 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040307191641/http://econ.worldbank.org/files/1820_dollar.pdf | archive-date= 2004-03-07 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a [[comparative advantage]] (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able [[commodity]]—including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere.

== Etymology ==
''Trade'' is from [[Middle English language|Middle English]] ''trade'' ("path, course of conduct"), introduced into English by Hanseatic merchants, from [[Middle Low German language|Middle Low German]] ''trade'' ("track, course"), from [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] ''trada'' ("spoor, track"), from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*tradō'' ("track, way"), and cognate with [[Old English]] ''tredan'' ("to tread").

''Commerce'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''commercium'', from ''cum'' "together" and ''merx'', "merchandise."<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commerce|volume=6|page=766}}</ref>

The fall of the Roman empire and the succeeding [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] brought instability to [[Western Europe]] and a near-collapse of the trade network in the western world. Trade, however, continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China, and Southeast Asia. Some trade did occur in the west. For instance, [[Radhanite]]s were a medieval guild or group (the precise meaning of the word is lost to history) of [[Jew]]ish merchants who traded between the [[Christians]] in Europe and the [[Muslim]]s of the Near East.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moshe |first1=Gil |title=The Rādhānite Merchants and the Land of Rādhān |journal=Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=299}}</ref>

Trade networks reached north to [[Oasisamerica]]. There is evidence of established maritime trade with the cultures of northwestern South America and the Caribbean.

'''''Middle Ages'''''

During the [[Middle Ages]], commerce developed in Europe by trading luxury goods at trade fairs. Wealth became converted into movable wealth or [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Banking systems developed where money on account was transferred across national boundaries. Hand to hand markets became a feature of town life, and were regulated by town authorities.

Western Europe established a complex and expansive trade network with cargo ships being the main workhorse for the movement of goods, [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] and [[Hulk (ship type)|Hulks]] are two examples of such cargo ships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boats of the World : From the Stone Age to Medieval Times|last=McGrail|first=Sean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|location=Oxford}}</ref> Many ports would develop their own extensive trade networks. The English port city of [[Bristol]] traded with peoples from what is modern day Iceland, all along the western coast of France, and down to what is now Spain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval England|last=Poole|first=Austin Lane|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1958|location=Oxford}}</ref>[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|A map showing the main [[trade route]]s for goods within [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]].]]

During the Middle Ages, Central Asia was the economic center of the world.<ref name="Beckwith2011_xxiv">[[#Beckwith2011|Beckwith (2011)]], p.&nbsp;xxiv.</ref> The [[Sogdiana|Sogdians]] dominated the East-West trade route known as the [[Silk Road]] after the 4th century CE up to the 8th century CE, with [[Suyab]] and [[Taraz|Talas]] ranking among their main centers in the north. They were the main [[caravan (travelers)|caravan]] merchants of Central Asia.

From the 8th to the 11th century, the [[Viking]]s and [[Varangians]] traded as they sailed from and to Scandinavia.  Vikings sailed to Western Europe, while Varangians to Russia.  The [[Hanseatic League]] was an alliance of trading cities that maintained a trade [[monopoly]] over most of [[Northern Europe]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], between the 13th and 17th centuries.

===The Age of Sail and the Industrial Revolution===
[[Vasco da Gama]] pioneered the European [[Spice trade]] in 1498 when he reached [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] after sailing around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] at the southern tip of the African continent. Prior to this, the flow of spice into Europe from India was controlled by Islamic powers, especially Egypt. The spice trade was of major economic importance and helped spur the [[Age of Discovery]] in Europe. Spices brought to Europe from the Eastern world were some of the most valuable commodities for their weight, sometimes rivaling [[gold]].

From 1070 onward, kingdoms in West Africa became [[Economic history of Africa|significant members of global trade]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A fistful of shells : West Africa from the rise of the slave trade to the age of revolution|last=Green, Toby, 1974-|isbn=9780226644578|location=Chicago|oclc=1051687994|date = 2019-03-21}}</ref> This came initially through the movement of gold and other resources sent out by Muslim traders on the [[Trans-Saharan trade|Trans-Saharan trading]] network.<ref name=":0" /> Later, West Africa exported gold, spices, cloth, and [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]] to European traders such as the Portuguese, Dutch, and English.<ref name=":0" /> This was often in exchange for cloth, iron, or [[cowrie shells]] which were used locally as currency.<ref name=":0" />

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Portuguese gained an economic advantage in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] due to different philosophies of trade.<ref name=":0" /> Whereas Portuguese traders concentrated on the accumulation of capital, in Kongo spiritual meaning was attached to many objects of trade. According to economic historian [[Toby Green]], in Kongo "giving more than receiving was a symbol of spiritual and political power and privilege."<ref name=":0" />

In the 16th century, the [[Seventeen Provinces]] were the center of free trade, imposing no [[exchange control]]s, and advocating the free movement of goods.  Trade in the [[East Indies]] was dominated by Portugal in the 16th century, the [[Dutch Republic]] in the 17th century, and the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the 18th century. The [[Spanish Empire]] developed regular trade links across both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans.

In 1776, [[Adam Smith]] published the paper ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]''. It criticized [[Mercantilism]], and argued that [[economic]] specialization could benefit nations just as much as firms.  Since the [[division of labour]] was restricted by the size of the market, he said that countries having access to larger markets would be able to divide labour more efficiently and thereby become more [[productive]]. Smith said that he considered all rationalizations of [[International trade|import]] and [[export]] controls "dupery", which hurt the trading nation as a whole for the benefit of specific industries.

In 1799, the [[Dutch East India Company]], formerly the world's largest company, became [[bankrupt]], partly due to the rise of competitive free trade.

=== 19th century ===
In 1817, [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] showed that free trade would benefit the industrially weak as well as the strong, in the famous theory of [[comparative advantage]]. In [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]] Ricardo advanced the doctrine still considered the most counterintuitive in [[economics]]:
: ''When an inefficient producer sends the merchandise it produces best to a country able to produce it more efficiently, both countries benefit.''

The ascendancy of free trade was primarily based on national advantage in the mid 19th century. That is, the calculation made was whether it was in any particular country's self-interest to open its borders to imports.

[[John Stuart Mill]] proved that a country with monopoly [[pricing power]] on the international market could manipulate the [[terms of trade]] through maintaining [[tariff]]s, and that the response to this might be [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] in trade policy.  Ricardo and others had suggested this earlier.  This was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade, as it was believed that more of the [[economic surplus]] of trade would accrue to a country following ''reciprocal'', rather than completely free, trade policies.  This was followed within a few years by the [[infant industry]] scenario developed by Mill promoting the theory that the government had the duty to [[protectionism|protect]] young industries, although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity. This became the policy in many countries attempting to [[industrialize]] and out-compete English exporters. [[Milton Friedman]] later continued this vein of thought, showing that in a few circumstances tariffs might be beneficial to the host country; but never for the world at large.<ref>Price theory Milton Friedman</ref>

===20th century===
The [[Great Depression]] was a major economic recession that ran from 1929 to the late 1930s.  During this period, there was a great drop in trade and other economic indicators.

The lack of free trade was considered by many as a principal cause of the depression causing stagnation and inflation.<ref>(secondary) [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] – [https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/ history]</ref>  Only during [[World War II]] did the recession end in the United States. Also during the war, in 1944, 44 countries signed the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]], intended to prevent national trade barriers, to avoid depressions.  It set up rules and institutions to regulate the [[international political economy]]: the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (later divided into the World Bank and Bank for International Settlements).  These organizations became operational in 1946 after enough countries ratified the agreement.  In 1947, 23 countries agreed to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] to promote free trade.<ref>(secondary) M Smith – [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lf2VQgAACAAJ&dq=China+Hidden+Cloak+and+Dagger+History+of+MI5&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Z6DsT-yYE8LO8QOSkqXCBQ&redir_esc=y V. Gollancz, 1996] {{ISBN|0-575-06150-2}}</ref>

The [[European Union]] became the world's largest exporter of manufactured goods and services, the biggest export market for around 80 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=EU position in world trade|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>

===21st century===
{{See also|Globalization}}

Today, trade is merely a subset within a complex system of [[Corporation|companies]] which try to maximize their profits by offering [[Product (business)|products]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]] (which consists both of individuals and other companies) at the lowest [[production cost]]. A system of [[international trade]] has helped to develop the world economy but, in combination with bilateral or multilateral agreements to lower [[tariff]]s or to achieve [[free trade]], has sometimes harmed [[Third World|third-world markets]] for local products.

===Free trade===
{{main|Free trade}}

Free trade advanced further in the late 20th century and early 2000s:
* 1992 [[European Union]] lifted barriers to internal trade in [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]].
* January 1, 1994 the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) took effect.
* 1994 The GATT [[Marrakech Agreement]] specified formation of the WTO.
* January 1, 1995 [[World Trade Organization]] was created to facilitate [[free trade]], by mandating mutual [[most favored nation]] trading status between all signatories.
* EC was transformed into the European Union, which accomplished the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2002, through introducing the Euro, and creating this way a real single market between 13 member states as of January 1, 2007.
* [[File:Accarias de Sérionne - Intérêts des nations de l'Europe, dévélopés relativement au commerce, 1766 - 5790093.tif|thumb|''Intérêts des nations de l'Europe, dévélopés relativement au commerce'' (1766)]]2005, the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] was signed; It includes the United States and the Dominican Republic.

== Perspectives ==

===Protectionism===
{{main|Protectionism}}
Protectionism is the policy of restraining and discouraging trade between states and contrasts with the policy of free trade.  This policy often takes the form of [[tariff]]s and restrictive [[Import quota|quotas]].  Protectionist policies were particularly prevalent in the 1930s, between the [[Great Depression]] and the onset of World War II.

===Religion===
Islamic teachings encourage trading (and condemn [[usury]] or [[interest]]).<ref>[[#Nomani1994|Nomani & Rahnema (1994)]], p.&nbsp;?. "I want nine out of ten people from my Ummah (nation) as traders" and "Trader, who did trading in truth, and sold the right quantity and quality of goods, he will stand along with Prophets and Martyrs, on Judgment day".</ref><ref>"O ye who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves in vanities, but let there be among you traffic and trade by mutual good-will." {{cite quran|4|29|style=ref}} and "Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury." {{cite quran|2|275|style=ref}}</ref>

[[Judeao-Christian]] teachings prohibit fraud and dishonest measures, and historically also forbade the charging of interest on loans.<ref>

===Development of money===
{{Main|History of money}}
[[File:Maximinus denarius - transparent background.PNG|thumb|A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[denarius]]]]

The first instances of money were objects with intrinsic value. This is called [[commodity money]] and includes any commonly available commodity that has intrinsic value; historical examples include pigs, rare seashells, whale's teeth, and (often) cattle. In medieval Iraq, bread was used as an early form of money.  In Mexico under [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]], cocoa beans were money.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm |title=Is There Slavery In Your Chocolate? |access-date=November 24, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128090830/http://www.foodrevolution.org/slavery_chocolate.htm |archive-date=November 28, 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Currency]] was introduced as standardised money to facilitate a wider exchange of goods and services.  This first stage of currency, where metals were used to represent stored value, and symbols to represent commodities, formed the basis of trade in the Fertile Crescent for over 1500 years.

[[Numismatist]]s have examples of coins from the earliest large-scale societies, although these were initially unmarked lumps of [[precious metal]].<ref name="originsofmoney">Gold was an especially common form of early money, as described in [[#Davies2002|Davies (2002)]].</ref>

==Trends==

===Doha rounds===
{{Main|Doha round}}

The Doha round of World Trade Organization negotiations aimed to lower [[trade barrier|barriers to trade]] around the world, with a focus on making [[fair trade|trade fairer]] for [[developing countries]].  Talks have been hung over a divide between the rich [[developed countries]], represented by the [[G20]], and the major developing countries. [[Agricultural subsidies]] are the most significant issue upon which agreement has been the hardest to negotiate. By contrast, there was much agreement on [[trade facilitation]] and capacity building. The Doha round began in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]], and negotiations were continued in: [[Cancún]], Mexico; [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]; and [[Paris]], [[France]] and Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===China===
Beginning around 1978, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) began an experiment in [[economic reforms in China|economic reform]]. In contrast to the previous [[USSR|Soviet]]-style [[centrally planned economy]], the new measures progressively relaxed restrictions on farming, agricultural distribution and, several years later, urban enterprises and labor. The more market-oriented approach reduced inefficiencies and stimulated private investment, particularly by farmers, which led to increased productivity and output. One feature was the establishment of four (later five) [[Special Economic Zone]]s located along the South-east coast.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Documents & Reports - All Documents {{!}} The World Bank|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/home|website=documents.worldbank.org|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>

The reforms proved spectacularly successful in terms of increased output, variety, quality, [[price]] and [[demand]]. In real terms, the economy doubled in size between 1978 and 1986, doubled again by 1994, and again by 2003. On a real per capita basis, doubling from the 1978 base took place in 1987, 1996 and 2006. By 2008, the economy was 16.7 times the size it was in 1978, and 12.1 times its previous per capita levels. International trade progressed even more rapidly, doubling on average every 4.5 years. Total two-way trade in January 1998 exceeded that for all of 1978; in the first quarter of 2009, trade exceeded the full-year 1998 level. In 2008, China's two-way trade totaled US$2.56 trillion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.html|title=Foreign Trade: Data|last=Division|first=US Census Bureau Foreign Trade|website=Census.gov|access-date=2017-05-07}}</ref>

In 1991 China joined the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] group, a trade-promotion forum.
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/Member-Economies|title=Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation}}</ref> In 2001, it also joined the World Trade Organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/countries_e/china_e.htm|title=China and the WTO}}</ref>

==International trade==
{{Main|International trade}}
{{Trade bloc}}

International trade is the exchange of goods and services across national borders.  In most countries, it represents a significant part of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. While international trade has been present throughout much of history (see Silk Road, [[Amber Road]]), its economic, social, and political importance have increased in recent centuries, mainly because of [[Industrialization]], advanced transportation, [[globalization]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[outsourcing]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Empirical evidence for the success of trade can be seen in the contrast between countries such as [[South Korea]], which adopted a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]], and India, which historically had a more closed policy.  South Korea has done much better by economic criteria than India over the past fifty years, though its success also has to do with effective state institutions.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Trade sanctions===
[[Trade sanctions]] against a specific country are sometimes imposed, in order to punish that country for some action.  An [[embargo]], a severe form of externally imposed isolation, is a blockade of all trade by one country on another. For example, the United States has had an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]] against [[Cuba]] for over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|title=U.S.–Cuba Relations|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2017-05-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511123927/http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|archive-date=2015-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Fair trade===
The "[[fair trade]]" movement, also known as the "trade justice" movement, promotes the use of [[Manual labour|labour]], [[environmental movement|environmental]] and [[Social issues|social]] standards for the production of [[Commodity|commodities]], particularly those exported from the [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]]s to the [[First World]]. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a [[human right]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Should trade be considered a human right? |date=9 December 2008 |publisher=COPLA |url=http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429004458/http://www.cop-la.net/en/node/523 |archive-date=29 April 2011 }}</ref>

Importing firms voluntarily adhere to fair trade standards or governments may enforce them through a combination of [[employment law|employment]] and [[commercial law]].  Proposed and practiced fair trade policies vary widely, ranging from the common prohibition of [[good (economics)|goods]] made using [[slave labour]] to minimum [[price support]] schemes such as those for coffee in the 1980s. [[Non-governmental organization]]s also play a role in promoting fair trade standards by serving as independent monitors of compliance with labeling requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAIRTRADE Certification Mark.
