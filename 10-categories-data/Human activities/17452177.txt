'''Acroyoga''' (also written ''Acro-Yoga'' or ''Acro Yoga'') is a physical practice which [[list of yoga hybrids|combines yoga]] and [[acrobatics]].<ref name="YJ Alpert 2017">{{cite web |last1=Alpert |first1=Yelena Moroz |title=10 Poses to Steal from Yoga Hybrids |url=https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/10-poses-steal-yoga-hybrids |publisher=[[Yoga Journal]] |date=5 April 2017}}</ref> Acroyoga includes many types of (mostly recreational) partner and group acrobatics in which at least someone is lifted. As such it also draws on traditions of circus arts, cheer-leading, and dance acro.

Acroyoga is more vigorous than many traditional forms of [[yoga as exercise]], and may lead to more injuries.<ref name="yogainjuries">{{citation |first=Eva Norlyk |last=Smith |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eva-norlyk-smith-phd/yoga-injuries-debate_b_2896134.html |title=The Yoga Injuries Debate: How 'Dangerous' Is Yoga, Really? |publisher=HuffPost Healthy Living |date=23 March 2013 |accessdate=2 February 2014 }}</ref>

== Roles ==
There are three primary roles in an Acroyoga practice: '''base''', '''flyer''', and '''spotter'''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Chee |last=Gates |work=Fitness Magazine |url=http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/workout/yoga/poses/extreme-yoga-poses |title=Extreme Yoga Poses and Positions |accessdate=29 April 2014 }}</ref>

* '''Base''' - this is the individual who has the most points of contact with the ground. Often this person is lying on the ground with the entire back torso in full contact. This enables both the arms and legs to be "bone-stacked" for maximum stability and support of the Flyer. Main points of contact with the flyer are the feet (generally placed on the Flyer's hips, groin or lower abdomen) and the hands (which either form handholds or grasp the shoulders).
* '''Flyer''' - this is the individual who is elevated off the ground by the Base. The Flyer can move into a series of dynamic positions, and generally lets gravity do the work for them. A Flyer needs balance, confidence, and core strength.
* '''Spotter''' - this is the individual who has an objective view of the partners, and whose entire focus is on making sure that the Flyer lands safely in case of any slips. The spotter can also make recommendations to the Base and Flyer to improve their form.

=== Acrobatics ===
is the physical part of Acroyoga that uses gymnastics techniques to build strength, flexibility, trust and teamwork between partners.

In the Acrobatic element we have:

==== Static poses ====
Initially basic poses such as bird, throne and whale. When the partners hold the position using equilibrium which is a state of rest or balance due to the equal action of opposing forces.

====    Acrobatic flying ====
Focus on movement - first, the flyer and base learn a static pose, later, how to move from one pose to another, creating a movement that is called "transition" in between the two poses.

In the acrobatic flying, there is a sequence of movements that start and end in the same position, which is called ''washing machine''. There are many different washing machines. These basics washing machines that are taught are: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV5mdp_e00Y barrel roll] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fk_YQI_YrU ninja star].

=== Pops ===
Small jumps where the partners keep physical contact with each other, usually keeping their hands connected.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kww0J4Fr3WM]

=== Icarian Pops ===
Movements in which the flyer is thrown (and or jumps / kips) off of the base leaving no points of contact and then is typically caught once more.

=== Yoga ===
Reflects the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of [[yoga]], in particular modern [[yoga as exercise]].

=== Therapeutics ===
[[File:AcroYoga pose Super Yogi.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga therapeutic flying – this pose is called Super Yogi.]]At AcroYoga Inc this includes Thai massage, therapeutic flying and partner yoga.

A basic therapeutic pose is ''Folded Leaf'' in which one partner is inverted and supported on the vertical legs of the other partner whose hands are then free for back massage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2660|title=Partners In Play|website=Yoga Journal|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

====  Therapeutic flying====
The flyer relaxes the body and is guided by the base through some stretches and massage.

To help the flyer to relax, it is crucial to develop trust first, which can be done by practicing the acrobatic flying. Also, it is important that the base has a strong sense of responsibility, care and trust in all the movements that will execute, before start to heal flyers using therapeutic flying techniques.

It can use techniques from different types of massage, having as a result, a deep level of relaxation.

==Learning AcroYoga==
[[File:AcroYoga Jam.jpg|thumb|Acro Yoga meeting in a public park in Austin, Texas.]]
Learning Acroyoga requires strength training, flexibility training and technique training.<ref name="flightmanual">Nemer, Jason and Sauer-Klein, Jenny. ''AcroYoga Flight Manual'', 2008, acroyoga.org</ref> Strength training is accomplished through repetition of exercises like [[push-up]]s, [[hand walking]] and [[handstand]]s. [[Yin yoga|Flexibility training]] is best done at the end of a session with a partner. Learning good Acroyoga technique takes time and effort and is best learned with an expert teacher.<ref name="flightmanual" />  One important Acroyoga technique is called ''bone stacking.'' This involves the base partner keeping arms and legs straight to maximize the weight load on bones rather than muscles to support the flyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pilgrimageyoga.com/five-reasons-you-should-do-acroyoga/|title=FIVE REASONS YOU SHOULD DO ACROYOGA|website=Pilgrimage of the Heart Yoga|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

A typical Acro Yoga session may include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulamovement.com/yoga/acro.html|title=AcroYoga|work=Kula Movement|accessdate=April 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513232314/http://www.kulamovement.com/yoga/acro.html|archive-date=May 13, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* '''Circle ceremony''' promotes communication and openness
* [[Warming up|'''Warm-up''']] to gradually get your muscles ready for more strenuous exercise
* '''Partner flow''' - continue warming up with [[asana]]s and stretching with a partner<ref name="yogajournal practice">{{cite web|url=http://www.yogajournal.com/article/practice-section/a-touch-of-kindness/|title=Partner Up|last=Lee|first=Cyndi|date=November 2012|work=Yoga Journal|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>
* '''Inversions''' help build trust between the partners<ref name="yogajournal practice"/>
* '''Flying and acrobatics'''

Some communities have regular Acro Yoga meetings to provide a place for interested people to come together and practice for free, called ''jams''. There are also larger Acro Yoga events such as the Dutch Acrobatics Convention, Acro SF, Vancouver Acro Festival, to name a few, that draw a global audience of practitioners.

All over the world, there are instructors teaching Acro Yoga in regular classes and workshops.

You can learn Acroyoga by yourself, but it takes time, discipline and responsibility, as you may not know all the techniques that will make the practice safe, for yourself and others.

== Poses ==
There are many static acro yoga poses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Poses – Alphabetized|url=http://acropedia.org/poses/|website=acropedia.org|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>  A series of acro yoga poses that are repeated in a continuous flow is called a Washing Machine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washing Machines – Alphabetized|url=http://acropedia.org/washing-machines/|website=acropedia.org|accessdate=29 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718001450/http://acropedia.org/washing-machines/|archive-date=2013-07-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>
