The engineering problems associated with leaving [[Earth]] and developing [[space propulsion]] systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of hours of research have been spent on them. In recent years there has been an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human [[space exploration]]. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is trying to understand the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body.

In October 2015, the [[NASA Office of Inspector General]] issued a health hazards report related to [[human space exploration|space exploration]], including a [[human mission to Mars]].<ref name="AP-20151029">{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Report: NASA needs better handle on health hazards for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151029/us-sci-space-travel-health-6dfd5b2c76.html |date=October 29, 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=October 30, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="NASA-20151029oig">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA's Efforts to Manage Health and Human Performance Risks for Space Exploration (IG-16-003) |url=https://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY16/IG-16-003.pdf |date=October 29, 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}</ref>

On 12 April 2019, [[NASA]] reported medical results, from the [[ISS year long mission|Astronaut Twin Study]], where one [[astronaut]] [[twin]] spent a year in space on the [[International Space Station]], while the other twin spent the year on [[Earth]], which demonstrated several long-lasting changes, including those related to alterations in [[DNA]] and [[cognition]], when one twin was compared with the other.<ref name="NYT-20190412">{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Zimmer |title=Scott Kelly Spent a Year in Orbit.

In November 2019, researchers reported that [[astronaut]]s experienced serious [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]] and [[Thrombus|clot]] problems while on board the [[International Space Station]], based on a six-month study of 11 healthy astronauts. The results may influence long-term [[spaceflight]], including a mission to the planet [[Mars]], according to the researchers.<ref name="CNN-20191115">{{cite news |last=Strickland |first=Ashley |title=Astronauts experienced reverse blood flow and blood clots on the space station, study says |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/health/astronaut-blood-flow-clot-scn-trnd/index.html |date=15 November 2019 |work=[[CNN News]] |accessdate=16 November 2019 }}</ref><ref name="JAMA-20191113">{{cite journal |author=Marshall-Goebel, Karina |display-authors=et al. |title=Assessment of Jugular Venous Blood Flow Stasis and Thrombosis During Spaceflight |date=13 November 2019 |journal=[[JAMA Network Open]] |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=e1915011 |doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.15011 |pmid=31722025 |pmc=6902784 }}</ref>

==Physiological effects==
Many of the [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental conditions]] experienced by humans during [[spaceflight]] are very different from those in which humans evolved; however, technology such as that offered by a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] or [[spacesuit]] is able to shield people from the harshest conditions. The immediate needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by a [[life support system]], a group of devices that allow human beings to survive in outer space.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm |title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921141609/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast13nov_1.htm |archive-date=2008-09-21 }}</ref> The life support system supplies [[air]], [[water]] and [[space food|food]]. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits and [[space toilet|deal with the body's waste products]]. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary.

Some hazards are difficult to mitigate, such as weightlessness, also defined as a [[Micro-g environment|microgravity environment]]. Living in this type of environment impacts the body in three important ways: loss of [[proprioception]], changes in fluid distribution, and deterioration of the [[musculoskeletal system]].

On November 2, 2017, scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the [[brain]] have been found in [[astronaut]]s who have taken [[Human spaceflight|trips in space]], based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI studies]]. Astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes.<ref name="NEJM-20171102">{{cite journal |author=Roberts, Donna R.|display-authors=etal|title=Effects of Spaceflight on Astronaut Brain Structure as Indicated on MRI |date=2 November 2017 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=377 |issue=18 |pages=1746–1753  |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1705129 |pmid=29091569 |s2cid=205102116}}</ref><ref name="QTZ-20171103">{{cite web |last=Foley |first=Katherine Ellen |title=Astronauts who take long trips to space return with brains that have floated to the top of their skulls |url=https://qz.com/1119668/space-travel-changes-astronauts-brains/ |date=3 November 2017 |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=3 November 2017 }}</ref>

In October 2018, [[NASA]]-funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into [[outer space]], including travel to the [[Mars|planet Mars]], may substantially damage the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tissues]] of astronauts. The studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the [[brain]]s of [[astronaut]]s, and age them prematurely.<ref name="TI-20181002">{{cite news |last=Griffin |first=Andrew |title=Travelling to Mars and deep into space could kill astronauts by destroying their guts, finds Nasa-funded study

In March 2019, NASA reported that latent [[virus]]es in humans may be activated during [[Human spaceflight|space missions]], adding possibly more risk to astronauts in future deep-space missions.<ref name="EA-20190315">{{cite news |title=Dormant viruses activate during spaceflight -- NASA investigates |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/f-dva031519.php |date=15 March 2019 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=16 March 2019 }}</ref>

===Research===
{{Main|Space medicine}}
Space medicine is a developing [[medicine|medical practice]] that studies the [[health]] of astronauts living in outer space. The main purpose of this academic pursuit is to discover how well and for how long people can survive the extreme conditions in space, and how fast they can re-adapt to the Earth's environment after returning from space. Space medicine also seeks to develop [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] and [[Palliative care|palliative]] measures to ease the suffering caused by living in an environment to which humans are not well adapted.

===Ascent and re-entry===
{{See also|High-G training}}
During takeoff and re-entry space travelers can experience several times normal gravity. An untrained person can usually withstand about 3g, but can blackout at 4 to 6g. [[G-force]] in the vertical direction is more difficult to tolerate than a force perpendicular to the spine because blood flows away from the brain and eyes. First the person experiences a temporary loss of vision and then at higher g-forces loses consciousness. G-force training and a [[G-suit]] which constricts the body to keep more blood in the head can mitigate the effects. Most spacecraft are designed to keep g-forces within comfortable limits.

===Space environments===
The environment of space is lethal without appropriate protection: the greatest threat in the vacuum of space derives from the lack of oxygen and pressure, although temperature and radiation also pose risks. The effects of space exposure can result in [[ebullism]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hypocapnia]], and [[decompression sickness]]. In addition to these, there is also [[Health threat from cosmic rays|cellular mutation]] and [[Cell death|destruction]] from high energy [[photons]] and [[Subatomic particle|sub-atomic particles]] that are present in the surroundings.<ref name = Pilmanis2003>{{cite journal|last=Pilmanis|first=Andrew|author2=William Sears |title=Physiological hazards of flight at high altitude|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2003|volume=362|pages=s16–s17|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)15059-3|pmid=14698113|s2cid=8210206|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259789}}</ref> Decompression is a serious concern during the [[Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]] (EVAs) of astronauts.<ref name="Conkin2001">{{Cite web |last=Conkin |first=Johnny |date=January 2001 |url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2001-210196.pdf |title=Evidence-Based Approach to the Analysis of Serious Decompression Sickness With Application to EVA Astronauts}}{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005100715/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-2001-210196.pdf |date=2006-10-05 }} NASA TP-2001-210196.

Human physiology is adapted to living within the atmosphere of Earth, and a certain amount of oxygen is required in [[Breathing gas|the air we breathe]]. If the body does not get enough oxygen, then the astronaut is at risk of becoming unconscious and dying from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. In the vacuum of space, [[gas exchange]] in the lungs continues as normal but results in the removal of all gases, including oxygen, from the bloodstream. After 9 to 12 seconds, the deoxygenated blood reaches the brain, and it results in the loss of consciousness.<ref name=Landis>{{cite web |url=http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html |title=Human Exposure to Vacuum |date=7 August 2007 |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Landis |author-link=Geoffrey A.

In December 1966, [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] and test subject Jim LeBlanc of [[NASA]] was participating in a test to see how well a pressurized [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|space suit prototype]] would perform in vacuum conditions. To simulate the effects of space, NASA constructed a massive [[vacuum chamber]] from which all air could be pumped.<ref name="gizmodo">{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/inside-the-chamber-where-nasa-recreates-space-on-earth-1657027041|title=Inside the Chamber Where NASA Recreates Space on Earth|last=Rose|first=Brent|date=17 November 2014|website=Gizmodo|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> At some point during the test, LeBlanc's pressurization hose became detached from the space suit.<ref name="awesci">{{cite web|url=http://awesci.com/2410/|title=The Only Person who Survived in Vacuum|last=Pant|first=Anupum|date=23 May 2015|website=AweSci|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> Even though this caused his suit pressure to drop from {{convert|3.8|psi|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0.1|psi|1|abbr=on}} in less than 10 seconds, LeBlanc remained conscious for about 14 seconds before [[Unconsciousness|losing consciousness]] due to hypoxia; the much lower pressure outside the body causes rapid de-oxygenation of the blood.

Another effect from a vacuum is a condition called [[ebullism]] which results from the formation of bubbles in body fluids due to reduced ambient pressure, the steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture.<ref name="NASA Bio Data Book">{{Cite book| first=Charles E. | last=Billings | editor=Parker, James F. |editor2=West, Vita R. | year=1973 | title=Bioastronautics Data Book| edition=Second | publisher=NASA | id=NASA SP-3006 | chapter= Chapter 1) Barometric Pressure | page=5| hdl=2060/19730006364 }} 942&nbsp;pages.</ref>  Technically, ebullism is considered to begin at an elevation of around {{convert|19|km}} or pressures less than 6.3 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] (47 [[Torr|mm Hg]]),<ref name="NASA Bio Data Book2">{{Cite book| first=Charles E. | last=Billings | editor=James F. |editor2=West, Vita R| year=1973 | title=Bioastronautics Data Book | edition=Second | publisher=NASA | id=NASA SP-3006 | chapter= Chapter 1) Barometric Pressure| chapter-url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19730006364_1973006364.pdf | pages=2–5| accessdate= 2012-09-23}}</ref> known as the [[Armstrong limit]].<ref name="Pilmanis2003" /> Experiments with other animals have revealed an array of symptoms that could also apply to humans.

====Temperature====
In a vacuum, there is no medium for removing heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so there is no danger of immediately freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99383.htm |title=Ask a scientist. Why is space cold? |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory, Division of Educational Programs}}</ref> Rapid evaporative cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, but this is not a significant hazard.

Exposure to the intense [[radiation]] of direct, unfiltered [[sunlight]] would lead to local heating, though that would likely be well distributed by the body's conductivity and blood circulation. Other solar radiation, particularly [[ultraviolet]] rays, however, may cause severe sunburn.

Without the protection of Earth's [[atmosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] astronauts are exposed to high levels of [[radiation]].

Crew living on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) are partially protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the [[magnetosphere]] deflects [[solar wind]] around the earth and the ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars|first=Ker |last=Than|publisher=Space.com|date=23 February 2006|url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A new kind of solar storm|publisher=NASA|date=10 June 2005|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref> However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's [[magnetosphere]], interplanetary human missions are much more vulnerable.

In particular, it causes '[[chromosomal]] aberrations' in [[lymphocyte]]s. As these cells are central to the [[immune system]], any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, [[virus]]es already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, [[T-cells]] (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems.

===Weightlessness===
[[Image:Foale ZeroG.jpg|thumb|left|Astronauts on the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in weightless conditions. [[Michael Foale]] can be seen exercising in the foreground.]]
Following the advent of [[space station]]s that can be inhabited for long periods of time, exposure to [[weightlessness]] has been demonstrated to have some deleterious effects on human health. Humans are well-adapted to the physical conditions at the surface of the earth, and so in response to weightlessness, various [[Biological system|physiological systems]] begin to change, and in some cases, [[atrophy]]. Though these changes are usually temporary, some do have a long-term impact on human [[health]].

Short-term exposure to microgravity causes [[space adaptation syndrome]], self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the [[vestibular system]]. Long-term exposure causes multiple health problems, one of the most significant being loss of bone and muscle mass. Over time these [[deconditioning]] effects can impair astronauts' performance, increase their risk of injury, reduce their [[aerobic capacity]], and slow down their [[cardiovascular system]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/SOPO/ICHO/HRP/ExPC/ |title=Exercise Physiology and Countermeasures Project (ExPC): Keeping Astronauts Healthy in Reduced Gravity |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-05-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504165244/http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/SOPO/ICHO/HRP/ExPC/ |archive-date=2012-05-04 }}</ref> As the human body consists mostly of fluids, gravity tends to force them into the lower half of the body, and our bodies have many systems to balance this situation. When released from the pull of gravity, these systems continue to work, causing a general redistribution of fluids into the upper half of the body. This is the cause of the round-faced 'puffiness' seen in astronauts.<ref name="JCB"/>{{r|elder}} Redistributing fluids around the body itself causes balance disorders, [[distorted vision]], and a loss of taste and smell.

The most common problem experienced by humans in the initial hours of weightlessness is known as [[space adaptation syndrome]] or SAS, commonly referred to as space sickness. It is related to [[motion sickness]], and arises as the [[vestibular system]] adapts to weightlessness.<ref name="sciencedaily">{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080521112119.htm | title = Why Do Astronauts Suffer From Space Sickness? | website = Science Daily | date = 2008-05-23 }}</ref> Symptoms of SAS include [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[headache]]s, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise.<ref name=spp22_15/> The first case of SAS was reported by [[cosmonaut]] [[Gherman Titov]] in 1961. Since then, roughly 45% of all people who have flown in space have suffered from this condition.

====Bone and muscle deterioration====
{{Main|Spaceflight osteopenia}}
[[File:Frank De Winne on treadmill cropped.jpg|thumb|Aboard the International Space Station, astronaut [[Frank De Winne]] is attached to the [[COLBERT]] with bungee cords]]
A major effect of long-term weightlessness involves the loss of [[bone]] and [[muscle]] mass. Without the effects of gravity, [[skeletal muscle]] is no longer required to maintain posture and the muscle groups used in moving around in a weightless environment differ from those required in terrestrial locomotion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back [[muscle]]s or leg muscles used for standing up.  Those muscles then start to weaken and eventually get smaller. Consequently, some muscles atrophy rapidly, and without regular exercise astronauts can lose up to 20% of their muscle mass in just 5 to 11 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf |title=Muscle Atrophy |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> The types of [[muscle fibre]] prominent in muscles also change. Slow-twitch endurance fibres used to maintain posture are replaced by fast-twitch rapidly contracting fibres that are insufficient for any heavy labour. Advances in research on exercise, hormone supplements, and medication may help maintain muscle and body mass.

[[Bone]] metabolism also changes. Normally, bone is laid down in the direction of mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment, there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a [[Spaceflight osteopenia|loss of bone tissue]] approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip, and femur.<ref name=NASAbones>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast01oct_1.htm |title=Space Bones |date=October 1, 2001 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-05-12 }}</ref> Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult.<ref>{{cite journal | author = O'Flaherty EJ | year = 2000 | title = Modeling Normal Aging Bone Loss, with Consideration of Bone Loss in Osteoporosis | journal = Toxicol Sci | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 171–88 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/55.1.171 | pmid = 10788572 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms that resemble those of osteoporosis.

This is a problem because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Blaber E, Dvorochkin N, Lee C, Alwood JS, Yousuf R, Pianetta P, Globus RK, Burns BP, Almeida EAC | year = 2013 | title = Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteocloastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 4| page = e61372 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0061372 | pmid = 23637819 | pmc = 3630201 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...861372B }}</ref> This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region because this is the region that carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood [[calcium]] levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential [[kidney stone]] formation.<ref name=NASAbones /> It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise, and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.

In space, astronauts lose fluid volume—including up to 22% of their blood volume. Because it has less blood to pump, the heart will [[atrophy]]. A weakened heart results in low blood pressure and can produce a problem with "orthostatic tolerance", or the body's ability to send enough oxygen to the brain without the astronaut's fainting or becoming dizzy. "Under the effects of the earth's [[gravity]], blood and other body fluids are pulled towards the lower body. When gravity is taken away or reduced during space exploration, the blood tends to collect in the upper body instead, resulting in facial [[edema]] and other unwelcome side effects. Upon return to earth, the blood begins to pool in the lower extremities again, resulting in [[orthostatic hypotension]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |title=When Space Makes You Dizzy |year=2002 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826230313/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2002/25mar_dizzy.htm |archive-date=2009-08-26 }}</ref>

If indeed elevated intracranial pressure is the cause, artificial gravity might present one solution, as it would for many human health risks in space. However, such artificial gravitational systems have yet to be proven. More, even with sophisticated artificial gravity, a state of relative microgravity may remain, the risks of which remain unknown.

=====Taste=====
One effect of weightlessness on humans is that some astronauts report a change in their sense of [[taste]] when in space.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASAexplores 5–8: A Matter Of Taste|url=http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=03-038&gl=58|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080107131502/http://www.nasaexplores.com/show2_5_8a.php?id=03-038&gl=58|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 7, 2008|website=NASAexplores|publisher=NASAexplores|date=May 29, 2003}}</ref> Some astronauts find that their food is bland, others find that their favorite foods no longer taste as good (one who enjoyed coffee disliked the taste so much on a mission that he stopped drinking it after returning to Earth); some astronauts enjoy eating certain foods that they would not normally eat, and some experience no change whatsoever. Multiple tests have not identified the cause,<ref name=bourland20060407>{{cite interview | title=Charles T.

Astronauts often choose strong-tasting food to combat the loss of taste.

====Additional physiological effects====

The data is inconclusive; however, the syndrome does appear to exist as a manifestation of the internal and external stress crews in space must face.{{Citation needed |date=September 2009}}

==Psychological effects==
{{see also|Psychological and sociological effects of spaceflight}}
[[Image:Moonmir sts91 big.jpg|right|thumb|Studies of Russian cosmonauts, such as those on [[Mir]], provide data on the long-term effects of space on the human body.]]

===Research===
The psychological effects of living in space have not been clearly analyzed but analogies on Earth do exist, such as [[Arctic]] research stations and [[submarine]]s. The enormous stress on the crew, coupled with the body adapting to other environmental changes, can result in anxiety, insomnia and depression.<ref name=Dickens-MR-2017-03>{{cite magazine|author=Dickens, Peter| date=March 2017|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2017/03/01/astronauts-at-work/ | title=Astronauts at Work: The Social Relations of Space Travel|magazine= [[Monthly Review]]}}</ref>

===Stress===

There has been considerable evidence that psychosocial stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book| author1 =Peter Suedfeld1| author2 = Kasia E. Wilk| author3 = Lindi Cassel| title = Flying with Strangers: Postmission Reflections of Multinational Space Crews}}</ref> Cosmonaut [[Valery Ryumin]], twice Hero of the Soviet Union, quotes this passage from ''The Handbook of Hymen'' by [[O. Henry]] in his autobiographical book about the Salyut 6 mission: "If you want to instigate the art of manslaughter just shut two men up in an eighteen by twenty-foot cabin for a month. Human nature won't stand it."<ref>[http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/ryumin/god/01.html Ryumin, Valery ''A Year off of Earth: A cosmonaut's journal.''] (In Russian). Moscow: Molodaya Gvardia Publishing, 1987. Retrieved 01.21.2013</ref>

NASA's interest in psychological stress caused by space travel, initially studied when their crewed missions began, was rekindled when astronauts joined cosmonauts on the Russian space station Mir. Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance while under public scrutiny, as well as isolation from peers and family. On the ISS, the latter is still often a cause of stress, such as when NASA Astronaut [[Daniel Tani]]'s mother died in a car accident, and when [[Michael Fincke]] was forced to miss the birth of his second child.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Sleep===
{{Main|Sleep in space}}
The amount and quality of [[sleep]] experienced in space is poor due to highly variable light and dark cycles on flight decks and poor illumination during daytime hours in the spacecraft. Even the habit of looking out of the window before retiring can send the wrong messages to the brain, resulting in poor sleep patterns. These disturbances in [[circadian rhythm]] have profound effects on the neurobehavioural responses of the crew and aggravate the psychological stresses they already experience (see [[Fatigue and sleep loss during spaceflight]] for more information). Sleep is disturbed on the [[ISS]] regularly due to mission demands, such as the scheduling of incoming or departing space vehicles. Sound levels in the station are unavoidably high because the atmosphere is unable to [[thermosiphon]]; fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere, which would stagnate in the freefall (zero-g) environment. Fifty percent of [[space shuttle]] astronauts took sleeping pills and still got 2 hours less sleep each night in space than they did on the ground. NASA is researching two areas which may provide the keys to a better night's sleep, as improved sleep decreases fatigue and increases daytime productivity.  A variety of methods for combating this phenomenon are constantly under discussion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wide Awake in Outer Space|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast04sep_1/|date=4 September 2001 |work=NASA Science |accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref>

===Duration of space travel===

A study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks represent a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dietrich Manzey |author2=Bernd Lorenz |author3=Valeri Poljakov |s2cid=953726 |year=1998 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537–559 |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |pmid=9557591}}</ref> While Skylab's three crews remained in space 1, 2, and 3 months respectively, long-term crews on Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and the ISS remain about 5–6 months, while MIR expeditions often lasted longer. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak different languages. First-generation space stations had crews who spoke a single language, while 2nd and 3rd generation stations have crews from many cultures who speak many languages. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way.

==Future use==
[[Image:Stanford torus under construction.jpg|thumb|right|Space colonization efforts must take into account the effects of space on the human body.]]
The sum of human experience has resulted in the accumulation of 58 solar years in space and a much better understanding of how the human body adapts. In the future, [[Space manufacturing|industrialisation of space]] and exploration of inner and outer planets will require humans to endure longer and longer periods in space. The majority of current data comes from missions of short duration and so some of the long-term physiological effects of living in space are still unknown. A round trip to [[Mars]]<ref name="WIRED-20140212" />  with current technology is estimated to involve at least 18 months in transit alone. Knowing how the human body reacts to such time periods in space is a vital part of the preparation for such journeys. On-board medical facilities need to be adequate for coping with any type of trauma or emergency as well as contain a huge variety of diagnostic and medical instruments in order to keep a crew healthy over a long period of time, as these will be the only facilities available on board a spacecraft for coping not only with trauma but also with the adaptive responses of the human body in space.

At the moment only rigorously tested humans have experienced the conditions of space.  If [[Space colonization|off-world colonization]] someday begins, many types of people will be exposed to these dangers, and the effects on the very young are completely unknown. On October 29, 1998, John Glenn, one of the original Mercury 7, returned to space at the age of 77. His space flight, which lasted 9 days, provided NASA with important information about the effects of space flight on older people. Factors such as nutritional requirements and physical environments which have so far not been examined will become important. Overall, there is little data on the manifold effects of living in space, and this makes attempts toward mitigating the risks during a lengthy space habitation difficult. [[Testbed]]s such as the ISS are currently being utilized to research some of these risks.

The environment of space is still largely unknown, and there will likely be as-yet-unknown hazards.  Meanwhile, future technologies such as [[artificial gravity]] and more complex bioregenerative [[life support system]]s may someday be capable of mitigating some risks.
