An '''amusement arcade''' (often referred to as a '''video arcade''', '''amusements''' or simply '''arcade''') is a venue where people play [[arcade game]]s such as [[video game]]s, [[pinball]] machines, [[Arcade game#Electro-mechanical games|electro-mechanical games]], [[redemption game]]s, [[merchandiser]]s (such as [[claw crane]]s), or coin-operated [[billiards]] or [[air hockey]] tables. In some countries, some types of arcades are also legally permitted to provide [[gambling]] machines such as [[slot machine]]s or [[pachinko|''pachinko'' machines]]. Games are usually housed in cabinets. The term used for ancestors of these venues in the beginning of the 20th century was '''penny arcades'''.<!-- bolded because of a redirect --><ref name=Nasaw>{{cite book|pages=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0eySLn7b6EC&pg=PA154 |title=Going out: the rise and fall of public amusements |access-date=2013-05-30 |quote=First use of the term [...] between 1905 and 1910}}</ref>

Video games were introduced in amusement arcades in the late 1970s and were most popular during the [[golden age of arcade video games]], the early 1980s. Arcades became popular with children and particularly adolescents, which led parents to be concerned that video game playing might cause them to [[truancy|skip school]].

A penny arcade can be any type of venue for [[coin-operated]] devices, usually for entertainment. The term came into use about 1905-1910.<ref name=Nasaw/> The name derives from the [[penny]], once a staple coin for the machines.  The machines used included:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameroomshow.com/shop/penny-arcade-machines/|title=Penny Arcade Machines|access-date=26 June 2016}}</ref>
* [[bagatelle]]s, a game with elements of [[billiards]] and non-electrical pinball,
* early forms of non-electrical [[pinball]] machines,
* [[Fortune teller machine|fortune-telling machinery]],
* [[slot machine]]s,
* coin-operated [[Amberola]]s
* peep show machines (in the original, non-pornographic, usage of the term), which allowed the viewer to see various objects and pictures
* [[Mutoscope]]s
* [[love tester machine]]s.
* coin operated shooter games

Penny arcades later led to the creation of video arcades in the 1970s.

===1970s and 1980s===
{{see also|Golden age of arcade video games}}

Video game arcades began to gain momentum in the late 1970s with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' ([[1978 in video gaming|1978]]) and ''[[Galaxian]]'' ([[1979 in video gaming|1979]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to PlayStation and Beyond|last=Wolf|first=Mark|publisher=Greenwood|year=2007|isbn=031333868X}}</ref> and became widespread in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]] with ''[[Pac-Man]],'' ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' and others. The [[central processing unit]] in these games allowed for more complexity than earlier [[Digital data|discrete-circuitry]] games such as Atari's ''[[Pong]]'' ([[1972 in video gaming|1972]]).

During the late 1970s video-arcade game technology had become sophisticated enough to offer good-quality graphics and sounds, but it remained fairly basic (realistic images and [[FMV game|full motion video]] were not yet available, and only a few games used spoken voice) and so the success of a game had to rely on simple and fun gameplay. This emphasis on the gameplay explains why many of these games continue to be enjoyed {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}, despite the progress made by modern computing technology.

The [[golden age of arcade video games]] in the 1980s became a peak era of [[arcade game|video arcade game]] popularity, innovation, and earnings. Color arcade games became more prevalent and video arcades themselves started appearing outside their traditional bowling-alley and bar locales. Designers experimented with a wide variety of [[Computer and video game genres|game genres]], while developers still had to work within strict limits of available processor-power and memory. The era saw the rapid spread of video arcades across [[North America]], [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]]. The number of video-game arcades in North America, for example, more than doubled between 1980 and 1982,<ref name="Wolf-105">{{citation|title=The Video Game Explosion: A History from PONG to PlayStation and Beyond|author=Mark J.

On November 30, 1982, Jerry Parker, the Mayor of [[Ottumwa, Iowa]], declared his city the "Video Game Capital of the World". This initiative resulted in many firsts in video game history. Playing a central role in arcade history, Ottumwa saw the birth of the [[Twin Galaxies]] Intergalactic Scoreboard and the [[U.S. National Video Game Team]], two organizations that still exist today. Other firsts that happened in the Video Game Capital of the World included:

High game-turnover in Japanese arcades required quick game-design, leading to the adoption of standardized systems like [[JAMMA]], [[Neo-Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] and [[CP System II|CPS-2]]. These systems essentially provided arcade-only consoles where the video game ROM could be swapped easily to replace a game. This allowed easier development and replacement of games, but it also discouraged the hardware innovation necessary to stay ahead of the technology curve.

Most US arcades didn't see the intended benefit of this practice since many games weren't exported to the US, and if they were, distributors generally refused to release them as simply a ROM, preferring to sell the entire ROM, console, and sometimes the cabinet as a package. In fact, several arcade systems such as Sega's [[Sega NAOMI|NAOMI]] board are arcade versions of home systems.

===1990s===
The rise of the fighting game genre with games such as ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'', combined with the release of popular sports titles such as ''[[NBA Jam]]'' and ''[[NFL Blitz]]'', led to a brief resurgence in the popularity of video arcades, with new locations opening in shopping malls and strip malls throughout the country in the early 90s. 

The arcade industry entered a major slump in mid-1994.<ref name="NGen14"/> Arcade attendance and per-visit spending, though not as poor as during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], declined to the point where several of the largest arcade chains either were put up for sale or declared bankruptcy, while many large arcade machine manufacturers likewise moved to get out of the business.<ref name="NGen14"/> In the second quarter of 1996, video game factories reported 90,000 arcade cabinets sold, as compared to 150,000 cabinets sold in 1990.<ref name="NGen21">{{cite magazine|last=Webb|first=Marcus |title=Arcade Games Down 40% in Five Years|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=September 1996|page=22}}</ref>

The main reason for the slump was increasing competition from console ports. During the 1980s it typically took several years for an arcade game to be released on a home console, and the port usually differed greatly from the arcade version; during the mid-1990s it became common for a game publisher to release a highly accurate port of an arcade game that had yet to peak in popularity, thus severely cutting into arcade owners' profits.<ref name="NGen21"/>

===2000s and beyond===
[[File:Great Yarmouth - panoramio (27).jpg|thumb|Two traditional amusement arcades on [[Great Yarmouth]] sea front, 2011]]
In the late 1990s, a bar opened in the new [[Crown Casino and Entertainment Complex|Crown Casino]] complex in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] named ''Barcode''. Barcode was a 'games bar' with the latest arcade games, the classics, pool tables, air hockey and pinball machines which players could play while consuming alcohol.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barcode |url=http://barcodebar.com.au/index.html |website=Barcode bar |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103231930/http://barcodebar.com.au/index.html |archive-date=2007-11-03 }}</ref> The bar was very popular with other bars later opening in the early 2000s in [[King Street, Melbourne|King Street]] alongside the [[strip club]]s and at the shopping centre [[Melbourne Central Shopping Centre|Melbourne Central]]. A Barcode opened in [[Times Square]], [[New York City|New York]] in May 2000 and was very popular, with the launch featuring on an episode of TV series ''[[Sex and the City]]''. Barcode Times Square closed in March 2003.

In the mid-2000s, [[Madrid]] businessman Enrique Martínez updated the video arcade for the new generation by creating a "hybrid movie theater with...fog, black light, flashing green lasers, high-definition digital projectors, vibrating seats, game pads and dozens of 17-inch screens attached to individual chairs." At the Yelmo Cineplex in Spain, $390,000 was spent refitting a theater into a "high-tech video gaming hall seating about 50 people." In Germany, the CinemaxX movie theater company is also considering this approach. It conducted a four-month trial with video games to test the level of demand for video gaming in a theater setting.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/26/technology/26games.html | work=The New York Times | first=Doreen | last=Carvajal | title=The New Video Arcade in Spain Might Be the Movie Theater | date=2007-02-26 | access-date=2014-10-02}}</ref>

Manufacturers started adding innovative features to games in the 2000s. [[Konami]] used motion and position sensing of the player in ''[[Police 911]]'' in 2000 and [[Mocap Boxing]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9066 |title=Police 911 Videogame by Konami (2000) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |access-date=2011-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8724 |title=MoCap Boxing Videogame by Konami (2001) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV |publisher=Arcade-museum.com |access-date=2011-07-21}}</ref> [[Sega]] started using "Tuning cards" in games such as the ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage|Initial D]]'' series of games allowing the customer to save game data on a card vended from the game; [[Namco]] copied the idea with the ''[[Maximum Tune]]'' series.  Arcade games continued to use a variety of games with enhanced features to attract clients, such as motorized seating areas, interconnected games, and surround sound systems. Redemption and merchandiser games are also a staple of arcades in the 2000s.  One of the most popular redemption games, ''Deal or No Deal'' by ICE, simulates the popular [[Deal or No Deal|television game show]].  Merchandiser games such as [[Stacker (game)|Stacker]] by LAI Games gives the player the chance to win high end prizes like iPods and video game consoles.

At the same time as these innovations, a small resurgence in the interest of classic video games and arcades grew with the opening of [[Barcade]] in Brooklyn, New York in 2004. Barcade combined a video arcade and a full bar, with a strict focus on classic machines from the 1970s and 1980s, known as the [[golden age of arcade video games]].<ref name="blogs.wsj.com">{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/04/22/for-arcades-survival-now-hinges-on-alcohol/ | first=Jennifer | last=Weiss | work=Wall Street Journal | title=For Arcades, Survival now Hinges on Alcohol | date=2011-04-22 | access-date = 2014-10-02}}</ref> The idea proved popular and Barcade received recognition as a good place to play classic video game cabinets, because it is "one of the few places where classic arcade games can still be found in public, and in good working order."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/16/3740422/the-life-and-death-of-the-american-arcade-for-amusement-only|title=For Amusement Only: The Life and Death of the American Arcade|first=Laura|last=June|date=2013-01-16|publisher=theverge.com|access-date=2014-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.esquire.com/bestbars/bb-barcade|title=Best Bars: Barcade|first=Ted|last=Allen|magazine=Esquire|access-date=2014-10-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113114507/http://www.esquire.com/bestbars/bb-barcade|archive-date=2014-11-13}}</ref>.

==Types of games==
===Video games===
{{See also|Arcade game|Video game|History of video games|Golden age of arcade video games}}

The [[video game]]s are typically in [[arcade cabinet]]s. The most common kind are ''uprights'', tall boxes with a monitor and controls in front. Customers insert [[coin]]s or [[Token coin|tokens]] into the machines (or, in newer models, use credit cards or mobile devices<ref>https://www.otiglobal.com/arcade_machines/</ref>) and stand in front of them to play the [[game]]. These traditionally were the most popular arcade format, although presently American arcades make much more money from deluxe driving games and ticket redemption games. However, Japanese arcades, while also heavily featuring deluxe games, continue to do well with traditional [[Japanese Amusement Machine Manufacturers' Association|JAMMA]] arcade video games.

Some machines, such as ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Joust (video game)|Joust]]'', are occasionally in smaller boxes with a flat, clear [[glass]] or [[acrylic glass]] top; the player sits at the machine playing it, looking down. This style of [[arcade game]] is known as a ''cocktail-style arcade game table'' or [[tabletop arcade machine]], since they were first popularized in [[public house|bars]] and pubs. For two player games on this type of machine, the players sit on opposite sides with the screen flipped upside down for each player.  A few cocktail-style games had players sitting next to rather than across from one another.  Both ''Joust'' and ''[[Gun Fight]]'' had these type of tables.

[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|upright|thumb|The ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' video game was popular in video arcades during the 1980s]]

===Racing games===
Some arcade games, such as [[racing game]]s, are designed to be sat in or on. These types of games are sometimes referred to as ''sit-down'' games. [[Sega]] and [[Namco]] are two of the largest manufacturers of these types of arcade games.

===Other games===
[[File:Japanese style cocktail cab.jpg|thumb|left|A cocktail cabinet or tabletop arcade machine]]

Other games include [[pinball]] machines, [[redemption game]]s and [[merchandiser]] games. Pinball machines have a tilted, glass-covered play area in which the player uses mechanical flippers to direct a heavy metal ball towards lighted targets. Redemption games reward winners with tickets that can be redeemed for prizes such as toys or novelty items. The prizes are usually displayed behind a counter or in a glass showcase, and an arcade employee gives the items to players after counting their tickets. Merchandiser games reward winners with prizes such as stuffed toys, CDs, DVDs, or candy which are dispensed directly from the machine.

In some countries, some types of video arcades are legally allowed to provide [[gambling]] machines such as [[slot machine]]s and [[pachinko|pachinko machines]]. Large arcades may also have small coin-operated ride-on toys for small children. Some businesses, such as [[Dave & Buster's]], combine a bar and restaurant with a video arcade. The [[Round One Entertainment|ROUND1]] entertainment chain combines a large arcade with a full-service bowling alley, along with billiards and [[karaoke]].

Arcades typically have change machines to dispense tokens or quarters when bills are inserted, although larger chain arcades, such as Dave and Busters and Chuck E. Cheese are deviating towards a refillable card system.<ref>[http://www.showbizpizza.com/tokens/cards/index.html "CEC Token Card"]</ref> Arcades may also have [[vending machine]]s which sell soft drinks, candy, and chips. Arcades may play recorded music or a radio station over a [[public address system]].  Video arcades typically have subdued lighting to inhibit glare on the screen and enhance the viewing of the games' [[Cathode ray tube|video display]]s, as well as of any decorative lighting on the cabinets.
