The '''Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration''' was signed in 2002, and was the result of a systematic  [[Japan]]–[[North Korea]] [[summit meeting]].  Pyongyang declaration was initiated with the goal of creating diplomacy between the two nations where previously this was non-existent due to historic hostility. The aim of the declaration was to provide low-interest long term loans to North Korea as well as economic assistance (including [[humanitarian aid]]) in accordance with the moratorium of nuclear missile development which has been in place since 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-11|title=An Overview of North Korea-Japan Relations|url=https://www.ncnk.org/resources/briefing-papers/all-briefing-papers/overview-north-korea-japan-relations|access-date=2020-06-18|website=NCNK|language=en}}</ref> However, in current developments this category of the agreement has been breached. (See [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction]]).The Japanese government was aiming to achieve the return of Japanese abducted citizens which prior to the declaration was unacknowledged.

The Pyongyang Declaration named after the North Korean capital, was a pinnacle motion in order to create an effective and fair relationship between the two countries. The declaration resulted in a temporary restraint on nuclear programs from North Korea, the return of 5 Japanese abductees occurring in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>{{Cite web|title=Far Eastern Economic Review {{!}} magazine|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Far-Eastern-Economic-Review|access-date=2020-06-18|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>  and the pledge of economic assistance once the abductees were returned.

From 2017, there have been consistent follow-up [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] due to breaches within the declaration leading to the requirement of mediators <ref>{{Cite web|last=NEWS|first=KYODO|title=North Korea fires projectiles toward Sea of Japan|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/bd43cd47d0df-n-korea-fires-projectile-toward-sea-of-japan-s-korea.html|access-date=2020-06-18|website=Kyodo News+}}</ref> to maintain a mutually beneficial declaration for the respective countries.

Following the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War|Russo-Japanese war]] led to the Japanese troops defeating Russia despite being inferior in numbers and resources and led to the 1910 annexation of Korea.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagström, Linus.

'''1945'''

The conclusion of World War II ended in a loss for Japan and therefore were unanimously removed of all their [[Colonialism|colonial]] possessions which Korea was a part of. Korea was under temporary ally control; this led to the pinnacle hostility and the [[Korean War|Korean War (1950-1953)]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagström, Linus.

As there was an unstable relationship between the two countries between 1991 and 1992, there were approximately eight bilateral discussions with the aim of creating diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagström, Linus. Söderberg, Marie.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1076576977|title=North Korea policy : Japan and the great powers|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis e-Library|isbn=978-0-203-96665-5|oclc=1076576977}}</ref>.The basis of the declaration is built on the expectation of maintaining goodwill and cooperation between the two countries. The main agenda of this meeting was Japan wanting a resolution to key incidents including the abduction of Japanese citizens housing in North Korea. These “[[Koreans in Japan|Zainichi Koreans]]” experienced systematic prejudice within Japan, to the point of loss of [[nationalism]] and barriers to future employment.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-04-11|title=An Overview of North Korea-Japan Relations|url=https://www.ncnk.org/resources/briefing-papers/all-briefing-papers/overview-north-korea-japan-relations|access-date=2020-06-18|website=NCNK|language=en}}</ref>

Following this incident in September 2002, North Korea publicly apologised to the Japanese [[government]] leading to the initial summit meeting.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagström, Linus. Söderberg, Marie.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1076576977|title=North Korea policy : Japan and the great powers|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis e-Library|isbn=978-0-203-96665-5|oclc=1076576977}}</ref> Japan has been the instigator of diplomacy attempts with North Korea in order to meet mutually beneficial terms particularly due to the sensitivity the North Korean regime has on [[Human rights|human-rights]] related criticism.

== Pyongyang Declaration ==

=== Economic Assistance, Loans, Nuclear Missile Development ===
[[File:Declaration signing between Japan Prime Minister and North Korea Supreme leader in 2002..png|thumb|Declaration signing between Japan Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and North Korea Supreme leader Kim Jong IL in 2002.]]
The first visit of Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] to North Korea occurred in 2002. Prior to this summit meeting there was no acknowledgement of the Japanese abductees on the North Korean government’s behalf. This visit resulted in a formal apology by [[Eternal leaders of North Korea|General Secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] and the official return of the abductees based in North Korea to Japanese soil. Additionally, the Japanese government made their first statement of apology to the North Korean government and their predecessors for the turmoil and suffering endured by their citizens during their colonial rule between 1910-1945.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hagström, Linus. Söderberg, Marie.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1076576977|title=North Korea policy : Japan and the great powers|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis e-Library|isbn=978-0-203-96665-5|oclc=1076576977}}</ref> Through this meeting the details of the declaration were discussed and agendas set.


The four subcategories of the ''[[Pyongyang Declaration]]'' included a pledge of economic assistance by Japan for their North Korean comrades. This would only be introduced after bilateral diplomatic relations were normalised and the abductees were returned. Stated by the Japanese Government there were approximately thirteen Japanese citizens abducted under predecessor Kim Jong Il’s reign, following the agreement five of these abductees were acknowledged and returned. Through this pledge, North Korea agreed to extend its moratorium on their missile testing which was becoming an international issue and threat of warfare.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MOFA: Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration|url=https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/n_korea/pmv0209/pyongyang.html|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.mofa.go.jp}}</ref> In correspondence with this there is a mutual responsibility of neutralising and maintaining positive relations without the involvement of the [[United States]]. This was a large factor within the declarations and played a key role in maintaining positive relations.



There were two main agendas that mutually benefited both parties, with [[North Korea|North Korea’s]] need for economic assistance and the possibility of long-term loans outweighed the interest of nuclear progression,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Submission|first=Internal|date=2020-06-17|title=Japan says it remains on alert over North Korean military moves|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/17/national/japan-alert-north-korea-military/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=The Japan Times|language=en-US}}</ref> therefore they signed.  With the agreement of nuclear progression indefinitely ceasing the declaration created mutually benefited parties with an equal level of compromise. The declaration included mutual cessation of military hostility in areas on confrontation,<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Korea Nuclear Technology & Nuclear Weapons Program {{!}} NTI|url=https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/nuclear/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.nti.org}}</ref> agreed to actively promote south-north environment cooperation, strengthen cooperation in the areas of prevention of future epidemics and the public health system through providing safety measures in which was equally available for the entirety of the population and mainly to find a form of resolution of separated families.

There was a key agreement that the [[Korea|Korean Peninsula]] must be turned into a land of peace free from nuclear weapons and nuclear threats<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Korea Nuclear Technology & Nuclear Weapons Program {{!}} NTI|url=https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/nuclear/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.nti.org}}</ref>.This was a particular essential point as Japan would not introduce the aid until normalisation and neutrality of the missile programs was certain.

In 2005, Pyongyang declared they were producing [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and thus the food aid pledged by the prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] of Japan led to the suspension of this pledge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hiraiwa|first=Shunji|date=2020-05-13|title=Japan’s policy on North Korea: four motives and three factors|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24761028.2020.1762300|journal=Journal of Contemporary East Asia Studies|language=en|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/24761028.2020.1762300|issn=2476-1028|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This resulted in several meetings titled the [[Six-party talks|six party talks]] involving representatives from [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. These talks aimed to reach a peaceful middle ground and re-uphold the initial agreements of the Pyongyang declaration for both respective parties [[Japan]] and [[North Korea]].


Following the July launch, in October representatives from [[North Korea]] announced on behalf of their government the further success of their nuclear testing leading to the [[United Nations]] to impose further sanctions including suspension of economic aid from the US government.<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Korea Nuclear Technology & Nuclear Weapons Program {{!}} NTI|url=https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/nuclear/|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.nti.org}}</ref>



'''2007'''

Following mulitaral discussion within the six party talks the three initial meetings were unsuccessful in negotiations.

'''2012'''

The diplomatic relations and meetings with incentives with the [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Japan]] and [[China]] led to a conclusive moratorium by the [[North Korea|DPRK]] state on all missile launches and nuclear programming for further aid including food.


'''2013'''

[[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea]] carried out a nuclear testing in February 2013 with rocket launches <ref>{{Cite web|title=Islands of ire: The South Korea–Japan dispute|url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/islands-ire-south-korea-japan-dispute|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.lowyinstitute.org|language=en}}</ref> and violated the security of UN resolutions in both 2014 and 2015 through short-fire rocket launches and short-range projectiles of [[North Korea|North Korea’s]] east-coast<ref>{{Cite web|title=MOFA: Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration|url=https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/n_korea/pmv0209/pyongyang.html|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.mofa.go.jp}}</ref>.  Despite the goodwill attempt from The US states and South Korea towards the North Korean Regime through postponing their respective drills and pledging humanitarian assistance the North Korean government has had minimal motivation to reinstate diplomacy.

'''2017'''

Following a three year hiatus, the government of [[North Korea|DPRK]] announced they were carrying out their sixth nuclear test leading to further six party talks which North Korea re-joined.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stout|first=David|last2=O’Neil|first2=John|date=2006-10-09|title=North Korea’s Claim Is Met With Doubt and Anger|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/world/asia/09cnd-nuke.html|access-date=2020-06-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

[[North Korea]] and [[Japan]] current diplomatic relations are neutral with sections of the [[Pyongyang Declaration|Pyongyang declaration]] being upheld by the two parties.

Recently, in 2019 [[North Korea]] re-started [[Nuclear weapons testing|Nuclear testing]] with a series of short-range missile testing leading to the January [[Summit (meeting)|Summit Meeting]] which resulted in [[Kim Jong-un|Kim Jong Un]] announcing the separation of the “unilaterally bound” [[Pyongyang Declaration|Pyongyang declaration]] including the nuclear test moratorium.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Moon: U.S., North Korea Progress Unlikely {{!}} Arms Control Association|url=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-06/news/moon-us-north-korea-progress-unlikely|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.armscontrol.org}}</ref> In March 2019, for the first time in over a decade the [[Japan|Japanese]] government decided to withdraw their participation in the motion condemning North Korea’s record in regards to their [[Human rights|Human Rights]] with the remaining [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN human rights council.]]

<br /><blockquote>''In order to resolve this abductions’ issue, we should not miss out on any single opportunity and I, myself, have to meet face-to-face with Chairman Kim Jong Un, and meet with him without attaching any conditions.

As there have been steps taken to reignite diplomatic relations between the two respective parties there is the potential for further summit meetings to create a [[Unilateralism|unilateral]] relationship which benefits both parties.
