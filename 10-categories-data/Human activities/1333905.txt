The '''applied arts''' are all the arts that apply [[design]] and [[Decorative arts|decoration]] to everyday and essentially practical objects in order to make them [[Aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.<ref>"Applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref> The term is used in distinction to the [[fine arts]], which are those that produce objects with no practical use, whose only purpose is to be beautiful or stimulate the intellect in some way. In practice, the two often overlap.  Applied arts largely overlaps with [[decorative arts]], and the modern making of applied art is usually called [[design]].

Example of applied arts are:
* [[Industrial design]] – mass-produced objects.
* [[Architecture]] – also counted as a fine art.
* [[Ceramic art]]
* [[Automotive design]]
* [[Fashion design]]
* [[Calligraphy]]
* [[Interior design]]
* [[Graphic design]]
* [[Cartographic design | Cartographic (map) design]]

==Movements==
[[Art movement]]s that mostly operated in the applied arts include the following.  In addition, major artistic styles such as [[Neoclassicism]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and others cover both the fine and applied or decorative arts. 
* [[Art Nouveau]] 
* [[Art Deco]]
* [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]
* [[Bauhaus]]
* [[Productivism]]
