In France, the '''bleuet de France''' is the symbol of memory for, and solidarity with, [[veterans]], victims of war, widows, and orphans, similar to the British Commonwealth [[remembrance poppy]]. The sale of "bleuet de France" badges on 11 November and 8 May is used to finance charitable works for those causes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onac-vg.fr/presentation-du-bleuet-de-france|title=Présentation du Bleuet de France|last=ONAC|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Origins==
[[File:Poilusrepos.jpg|thumb|left|180px|<center>[[World War I]] French soldiers at rest, wearing their iconic blue uniforms.</center>]]
In the [[language of flowers]], the [[cornflower]] symbolizes delicacy and timidity, and indicates that a message has a pure, innocent, or delicate intention.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The cornflower &ndash; like the [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] &ndash; continued to grow in land devastated by the thousands of shells which were launched daily by the entrenched armies of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. These flowers were often the only visible evidence of life, and the only sign of color in the mud of the [[Trench warfare#World War I: Entrenchment|trenches]].

At the same time, the term "bleuets" was used also to refer to the class of [[conscripted]] soldiers born in 1895 who arrived in the lead-up to the [[Second Battle of the Aisne]], because of the {{Interlanguage link multi|bleu horizon|fr}} worn by French soldiers after 1915. The uniform worn by these recruits, many of whom were not even twenty years old, was distinctive because it marked a break from the [[rose madder|garance red]] trousers worn by older soldiers, which were part of the standard uniform before the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chemindesdames.fr/photos_ftp/contenus/Lettre_12.pdf|title=Des bleuets par milliers…|work=La lettre du Chemin des Dames n° 12|date=November 2007|first=Guy|last=Marival|language=fr|access-date=5 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111001616/http://www.chemindesdames.fr/photos_ftp/contenus/Lettre_12.pdf|archive-date=11 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As the war dragged on and the novelty of the term faded, the title endured because the uniforms that fresh arrivals wore into the trenches were still new and brightly colored, in contrast with the mud-stained uniforms of veteran troops.

The popularity of the term was such that the image became a potent symbol in postcards, posters, songs, and poems:

The origin of the badge dates to 1916. It was created by Suzanne Lenhardt, head nurse in [[Les Invalides]], and Charlotte Malleterre. Lenhardt was the widow of a [[French Colonial Forces|Colonial Infantry]] captain killed in 1915, and Malleterre was the sister of Général [[Gustave Léon Niox]] and the wife of Général [[Gabriel Malleterre]]. They were both moved by the suffering endured by the war wounded for whom they were responsible and, needing to provide them with some activity, organized workshops where cornflower badges were made from tissue paper. These were sold to the public at various times, with the money collected providing the men a small income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alsace1418.fr/4-memoire/symboles/f-bleuet.html|title=Guerre 14 18 en Alsace – Le symbole du bleuet.|website=alsace1418.fr|language=fr|trans-title=14-18 war in Alsace - the bleuet symbol|date=25 December 2009|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref> They gradually became a symbol of the rehabilitation of soldiers through labor.

On 15 September 1920, Louis Fontenaille, the president of ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Mutilés de France|fr}}'', proposed making the ''bleuet'' the eternal symbol of [[mort pour la France|those who died for France]]. This had the support of the [[FIDAC]] (Federation Interalliee des Anciens Combattants).

In 1928, after French President [[Gaston Doumergue]] gave his patronage to the ''bleuet'', sales gradually spread countrywide. By 11 November 1934, {{formatnum:128000}} flowers were sold. From 1935, the French government officialized the sale of ''bleuets'' on [[Remembrance Day]].

In 1957, a second commemorative day was denoted for 8 May, [[VE day]], the anniversary of the surrender of [[Nazi Germany]] in the Second World War.
