In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Legendre transformation''', named after [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]], is an [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[List of transforms|transformation]] on the [[real number|real]]-valued [[convex function]]s of one real variable. In physical problems, it is used to convert functions of one quantity (such as position, pressure, or temperature) into functions of the [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate quantity]] (momentum, volume, and entropy, respectively). In this way, it is commonly used in [[classical mechanics]] to derive the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism out of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism and in [[thermodynamics]] to derive the [[Thermodynamic potential|thermodynamic potentials]], as well as in the solution of [[Differential equation|differential equations]] of several variables. 

For sufficiently smooth functions on the real line, the Legendre transform {{mvar|''f*''}} of a function {{mvar|f}} can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions' first derivatives are inverse functions of each other.  This can be expressed in [[Notation for differentiation#Euler.27s notation|Euler's derivative notation]] as
:<math>Df = \left( D f^* \right)^{-1}~,</math>
or, equivalently, as <math>f'(f^{*\prime}(x^*)) = x^*</math> and <math>f^{*\prime}(f'(x)) = x</math> in [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange.27s notation|Lagrange's notation]].

The generalization of the Legendre transformation to affine spaces and non-convex functions is known as the [[convex conjugate]] (also called the Legendre–Fenchel transformation), which can be used to construct a function's [[convex hull]].

==Definition==

Let {{math|''I'' ⊂ ℝ}} be an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]], and {{math|''f'' : ''I'' → ℝ}} a [[convex function]]; then its ''Legendre transform'' is the function {{math|''f*'' : ''I*'' → ℝ}} defined by
:<math>f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x\in I}(x^*x-f(x)),\quad x^*\in I^*</math>
where <math>\sup</math> is the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], and the [[Domain of a function|domain]] <math>I^*</math> is
:<math>I^*= \left \{x^*\in \R:\sup_{x\in I}(x^*x-f(x))<\infty \right \} ~.</math>

The transform is always well-defined when <math>f(x)</math> is [[convex function|convex]].

The generalization to convex functions {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ℝ}} on a convex set {{math|''X'' ⊂ ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>}} is straightforward: {{math|''f *'' : ''X*'' → ℝ}} has domain
:<math>X^*= \left \{x^* \in \R^n:\sup_{x\in X}(\langle x^*,x\rangle-f(x))<\infty \right \}</math>
and is defined by
:<math>f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x\in X}(\langle x^*,x\rangle-f(x)),\quad x^*\in X^*   ~,</math>
where <math>\langle x^*,x \rangle</math> denotes the [[dot product]] of {{math|''x''*}} and {{mvar|x}}.

The function {{math|''f'' *}} is called the [[convex conjugate]] function of {{mvar|f}}. For historical reasons (rooted in analytic mechanics), the conjugate variable is often denoted {{mvar|p}}, instead of {{math|''x''*}}.  If the convex function {{mvar|f}} is defined on the whole line and is everywhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], then
:<math>f^*(p)=\sup_{x\in I}(px-f(x)) = \left( p x - f(x) \right)|_{x = (f')^{-1}(p)} </math>
can be interpreted as the negative of the [[y-intercept|{{math|''y''}}-intercept]] of the [[tangent line]] to the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}} that has slope {{mvar|p}}.

The Legendre transformation is an application of the [[Duality (projective geometry)|duality]] relationship between points and lines. The functional relationship specified by {{mvar|f}} can be represented equally well as a set of {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} points, or as a set of tangent lines specified by their slope and intercept values.

===Understanding the transform in terms of derivatives===

For differentiable convex functions <math> f</math>
on the real line with an invertible first derivative, the Legendre transform <math> f^*</math>
can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions' first 
derivatives are inverse functions of each other.

To see this, first note that if  <math> f</math> is differentiable and <math> \overline{x} </math> is a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]
of the function of <math> x \mapsto p \cdot x -f(x) </math>, then the
supremum is achieved at <math> \overline{x}</math> (by convexity). 
Therefore, <math> f^*(p)= p \cdot \overline{x} - f(\overline{x})</math>.

Suppose that <math>f'</math> is invertible and let <math> h </math> denote its inverse.
Then for each <math> p</math>, the point <math> h(p)</math>  is the unique critical point of
<math> x \mapsto px -f(x) </math>.  Indeed,  <math> f'(h(p))=p </math> and so <math> p-f'(h(p))=0 </math>.
Hence we have <math> f^*(p) = p \cdot h(p) - f(h(p))</math> for each <math> p</math>. 
By differentiating with respect to <math> p</math> we find 
:<math>(f^*)'(p) =  h(p)+ p \cdot h'(p) - f'(h(p)) \cdot h'(p).</math>
Since <math> f'(h(p))=p</math> this simplifies to  <math>(f^*)'(p) =  h(p)</math>.
In other words,  <math>(f^*)'</math> and <math>f'</math> are inverses.

In general, if <math> g' </math> is an inverse of <math> f' </math>, then <math> g' = (f^*)' </math> 
and so integration provides a constant <math> c </math> so that  <math> f^* = g +c </math>.

In practical terms, given {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the parametric plot of {{math|''xf'' '(''x'') − ''f''(''x'')}} versus {{math|''f'' '(''x'')}} amounts to the graph of  {{math| ''g''(''p'')}} versus {{mvar|p}}.

In some cases (e.g. thermodynamic potentials, below), a non-standard requirement is used, amounting to an alternative definition of {{math|''f'' *}} with a ''minus sign'',
:<math>f(x) - f^*(p) = xp.</math>

==Properties==
*The Legendre transform of a convex function is convex.

: Let us show this for the case of a doubly differentiable {{mvar|f}} with a non zero (and hence positive, due to convexity) double derivative.

: For a fixed {{mvar|p}}, let {{mvar|x}} maximize {{math|''px'' − ''f''(''x'')}}. Then {{math|''f'' *(''p'') {{=}} ''px'' − ''f''(''x'')}}, noting that {{mvar|x}} depends on {{mvar|p}}.  Thus,

:: <math>f^\prime(x) = p ~.</math>

: The derivative of {{mvar|f}} is itself differentiable with a positive derivative and hence strictly monotonic and invertible.

: Thus {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''g''(''p'')}} where <math>g \equiv (f^{\prime})^{-1}</math>, meaning that {{math|''g''}} is defined so that <math>f'(g(p))= p</math>.

: Note that {{mvar|g}} is also differentiable with the following derivative,

:: <math>\frac{dg(p)}{dp} = \frac{1}{f''(g(p))} ~.</math>

: Thus {{math|''f'' *(''p'') {{=}} ''pg''(''p'') − ''f''(''g''(''p''))}} is the composition of differentiable functions, hence differentiable.

: Applying the [[product rule]] and the [[chain rule]] yields

:: <math>\begin{align}
\frac{d(f^{*})}{dp} &= g(p) +  \left(p - f'(g(p))\right)\cdot \frac{dg(p)}{dp}\\[4pt]
& =  g(p),
\end{align} </math>

: giving

:: <math>
\frac{d^2(f^{*})}{dp^2} = \frac{dg(p)}{dp} = \frac{1}{f''(g(p))} > 0,
</math>

: so {{math|''f'' *}} is convex.

*It follows that the Legendre transformation is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], i.e., {{math|''f'' ** {{=}} ''f''}}:

: By using the above equalities for {{math|''g''(''p'')}}, {{math|''f'' *(''p'')}} and its derivative,

:: <math>\begin{align}
f^{**}(x) &{} = \left(x\cdot p_s - f^{*}(p_s)\right)_{|\frac{d}{dp}f^{*}(p=p_s) = x} \\[5pt]
&{} = g(p_s)\cdot p_s - f^{*}(p_s) \\[5pt]
&{} = f(g(p_s)) \\[5pt]
&{} =  f(x)~.
\end{align}  </math>

==Examples==

===Example 1===
[[Image:LegendreExample.svg|right|thumb|200px|e<sup>''x''</sup> is plotted in red and its Legendre transform in dashed blue.]]
The [[exponential function]] <math> f(x) = e^x </math> has <math>f^*(p) = p ( \ln p - 1 ) </math>
as a Legendre transform, since their respective first derivatives {{math|''e<sup>x''</sup>}} and {{math|ln ''p''}} are inverse functions of each other.

This example illustrates that the respective [[domain of a function|domain]]s of a function and its Legendre transform need not agree.

===Example 2===
Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''cx''<sup>2</sup>}} defined on ℝ, where {{math|''c'' > 0}} is a fixed constant.

For {{math|''x''*}} fixed, the function of {{mvar|x}}, {{math|''x''*''x'' – ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''*''x'' – ''cx''<sup>2</sup>}} has the first derivative {{math|''x''* – 2''cx''}} and second derivative {{math|−2''c''}}; there is one stationary point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''*/2''c''}}, which is always a maximum.

Thus, {{math|''I''* {{=}} ℝ}} and
:<math>f^*(x^*)=\frac{{x^*}^2}{4c}  ~.</math>

The first derivatives of  {{math|''f''}},  2{{math|''cx''}}, and of {{math|''f'' *}},  {{math|''x''*/(2''c'')}}, are inverse functions to each other. Clearly, furthermore,
:<math>f^{**}(x)=\frac{1}{4 (1/4c)}x^2=cx^2~,</math>
namely {{math|''f'' ** {{=}} ''f''}}.

===Example 3===
Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} for {{math|''x'' ∈ ''I'' {{=}} [2, 3]}}.

For {{math|''x''*}} fixed, {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''(''x'')}} is continuous on {{mvar|I}} [[compact space|compact]], hence it always takes a finite maximum on it; it follows that {{math|''I''* {{=}} ℝ}}.

The stationary point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''*/2}} is in the domain {{math|[2, 3]}} if and only if {{math|4 ≤ ''x''* ≤ 6}}, otherwise the maximum is taken either at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2}}, or {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}. It follows that
:<math>f^*(x^*)=\begin{cases}2x^*-4, & x^*<4\\ \frac{{x^*}^2}{4}, & 4\leqslant x^*\leqslant 6,\\3x^*-9, & x^*>6.\end{cases}</math>

===Example 4===
The function {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''cx''}} is convex, for every {{mvar|x}} (strict convexity is not required for the Legendre transformation to be well defined). Clearly {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''(''x'') {{=}} (''x''* − ''c'')''x''}} is never bounded from above as a function of {{mvar|x}}, unless {{math|''x''* − ''c'' {{=}} 0}}. Hence {{math|''f''*}} is defined on {{math|''I''* {{=}} {''c''}}} and {{math|''f''*(''c'') {{=}} 0}}.

One may check involutivity: of course {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''*(''x''*)}} is always bounded as a function of {{math|''x''* ∈ {''c''}}}, hence  {{math|''I'' ** {{=}} ℝ}}. Then, for all {{mvar|x}} one has
:<math>\sup_{x^*\in\{c\}}(xx^*-f^*(x^*))=xc,</math>
and hence {{math|''f'' **(''x'') {{=}} ''cx'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}.

===Example 5: several variables===
Let
:<math>f(x)=\langle x,Ax\rangle+c</math>
be defined on {{math|''X'' {{=}} ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|A}} is a real, positive definite matrix.

Then {{mvar|f}} is convex, and
:<math>\langle p,x\rangle-f(x)=\langle p,x \rangle-\langle x,Ax\rangle-c,</math>
has gradient {{math|''p'' − 2''Ax''}} and [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] {{math|−2''A''}}, which is negative; hence the stationary point {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>−1</sup>''p''/2}} is a maximum.

We have {{math|''X''* {{=}} ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>}}, and
:<math>f^*(p)=\frac14\langle p,A^{-1}p\rangle-c.</math>

==Behavior of differentials under Legendre transforms==
The Legendre transform is linked to [[integration by parts]], &nbsp;  {{math|''pdx'' {{=}} ''d''(''px'') − ''xdp''}}.

Let {{mvar|f}} be a function of two independent variables {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, with the differential
:<math>df = {\partial f \over \partial x}\,dx + {\partial f \over \partial y}\,dy = p\,dx + v\,dy.</math>

Assume that it is convex in {{mvar|x}} for all {{mvar|y}}, so that one may perform the Legendre transform in {{mvar|x}}, with {{mvar|p}} the variable conjugate to {{mvar|x}}. Since the new independent variable is {{mvar|p}}, the differentials {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}}  devolve to {{math|''dp''}} and {{math|''dy''}}, i.e., we build another function with its differential expressed in terms of the new basis {{math|''dp''}} and {{math|''dy''}}.

We thus consider the function {{math|''g''(''p'', ''y'') {{=}} ''f'' − ''px''}}  so that
:<math>dg = df - p\,dx - x\,dp = -x\,dp + v\,dy</math>
:<math>x = -\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}</math>
:<math>v = \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}.</math>

The function {{math|''-g''(''p'', ''y'')}} is the Legendre transform of {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}, where only the independent variable {{mvar|x}} has been supplanted by {{mvar|p}}. This is widely used in thermodynamics, as illustrated below.

==Applications==

===Analytical mechanics===
A Legendre transform is used in [[classical mechanics]] to derive the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]] from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian formulation]], and conversely. A typical Lagrangian has the form

:<math>L(v,q)=\tfrac{1}2\langle v,Mv\rangle-V(q),</math>

where <math>(v,q)</math>  are coordinates on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> × '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, {{mvar|M}} is a positive real matrix, and

:<math>\langle x,y\rangle=\sum_jx_jy_j.</math>

For every {{mvar|q}} fixed, <math>L(v, q)</math> is a convex function of <math>v</math>, while <math>V(q)</math> plays the role of a constant.

Hence the Legendre transform of <math>L(v, q)</math> as a function of {{mvar|v}}  is the Hamiltonian function,

:<math>H(p,q)=\tfrac 12\langle p,M^{-1}p\rangle+V(q)</math>.

In a more general setting, <math>(v, q)</math> are local coordinates on the [[tangent bundle]] <math>T\mathcal M</math> of a manifold <math>\mathcal M</math>. For each {{mvar|q}}, <math>L(v, q)</math> is a convex function of the tangent space {{math|''V<sub>q</sub>''}}. The Legendre transform gives the Hamiltonian <math>H(p, q)</math> as a function of the coordinates {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} of the [[cotangent bundle]] <math>T^*\mathcal M</math>; the inner product used to define the Legendre transform is inherited from the pertinent canonical [[symplectic vector space|symplectic structure]]. In this abstract setting, the Legendre transformation corresponds to the [[tautological one-form]].

===Thermodynamics===
The strategy behind the use of Legendre transforms in thermodynamics is to shift from a function that depends on a variable to a new (conjugate) function that depends on a new variable, the conjugate of the original one. The new variable is the partial derivative of the original function with respect to the original variable. The new function is the difference between the original function and the product of the old and new variables. Typically, this transformation is useful because it shifts the dependence of, e.g., the energy from an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variable]] to its conjugate intensive variable, which can usually be controlled more easily in a physical experiment.

For example, the [[internal energy]] is an explicit function of the ''[[extensive quantity|extensive variables]]'' [[entropy]], [[volume]], and [[chemical composition]]

:<math> U = U \left (S,V,\{N_i\} \right ),</math>

which has a total differential

:<math> dU = T\,dS - P\,dV + \sum \mu_i \,dN _i.</math>

By using the (non-standard) Legendre transform of the internal energy, {{mvar|U}}, with respect to volume, {{mvar|V}}, it is possible to define the [[enthalpy]] as

:<math> H = U + PV \, = H \left (S,P,\{N_i\} \right ),</math>

which is an explicit function of the pressure, {{mvar|P}}. The enthalpy contains all of the same information as the internal energy, but is often easier to work with in situations where the pressure is constant.

It is likewise possible to shift the dependence of the energy from the extensive variable of entropy, {{mvar|S}}, to the (often more convenient) intensive variable {{mvar|T}}, resulting in the [[Helmholtz energy|Helmholtz]] and [[Gibbs energy|Gibbs]] [[thermodynamic free energy|free energies]]. The Helmholtz free energy, {{mvar|A}}, and Gibbs energy, {{mvar|G}}, are obtained by performing Legendre transforms of the internal energy and enthalpy, respectively,

:<math> A = U - TS ~,</math>
:<math> G = H - TS = U + PV - TS ~.</math>

The Helmholtz free energy is often the most useful thermodynamic potential when temperature and volume are held constant, while the Gibbs energy is often the most useful when temperature and pressure are held constant.

===An example – variable capacitor===
As another example from [[physics]], consider a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the [[force]] acting on the plates. One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the "charge" of a [[gas]] in a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], with the resulting mechanical [[force]] exerted on a [[piston]].

Compute the force on the plates as a function of {{math|'''x'''}}, the distance which separates them. To find the force, compute the potential energy, and then apply the definition of force as the gradient of the potential energy function.

The energy stored in a capacitor of [[capacitance]] {{math|''C''('''x''')}} and charge {{math|''Q''}} is

:<math> U (Q, \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} QV = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C(\mathbf{x})},~</math>

where the dependence on the area of the plates, the dielectric constant of the material between the plates, and the separation {{math|'''x'''}} are abstracted away as the [[capacitance]] {{math|''C''('''x''')}}. (For a parallel plate capacitor, this is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the separation.)

The force {{math|'''F'''}} between the plates due to the electric field is then

:<math> \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{dU}{d\mathbf{x}} ~. </math>

If the capacitor is not connected to any circuit, then the ''[[electric charge|charges]]'' on the plates remain constant as they move, and the force is the negative [[gradient]] of the [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] energy

:<math> \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dC}{d\mathbf{x}} \frac{Q^2}{C^2}. </math>

However, suppose, instead, that the ''[[volt]]age'' between the plates {{math|''V''}} is maintained constant by connection to a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], which is a reservoir for charge at constant potential difference; now the ''charge is variable'' instead of the voltage, its Legendre conjugate. To find the force, first compute the non-standard Legendre transform,

:<math>U^*  = U - \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial Q} \right)\bigg|_\mathbf{x} \cdot Q =U - \frac{1}{2C(\mathbf{x})} \left( \frac{\partial Q^2}{\partial Q} \right)\bigg|_\mathbf{x} \cdot Q = U - QV = \frac{1}{2} QV - QV = -\frac{1}{2} QV= - \tfrac{1}{2} V^2 C(\mathbf{x}).</math>

The force now becomes the negative gradient of this Legendre transform, still pointing in the same direction,

:<math>  \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{dU^*}{d\mathbf{x}}~.</math>

The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the [[linear]]ity of the [[capacitance]]—except now {{math|''Q''}} is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same "pull" between a capacitor's plates.

===Probability theory===
In [[large deviations theory]], the ''rate function'' is defined as the Legendre transformation of the logarithm of the [[moment generating function]] of a random variable. An important application of the rate function is in the calculation of tail probabilities of sums of i.i.d. random variables.

===Microeconomics===
Legendre transformation arises naturally in [[microeconomics]] in the process of finding the ''[[supply (economics)|supply]]'' {{math|''S''(''P'')}} of some product given a fixed price {{math|''P''}} on the market knowing the [[cost curve|cost function]] {{math|''C''(''Q'')}}, i.e. the cost for the producer to make/mine/etc. {{math|''Q''}} units of the given product.

A simple theory explains the shape of the supply curve based solely on the cost function. Let us suppose the market price for a one unit of our product is {{math|''P''}}. For a company selling this good, the best strategy is to adjust the production {{math|''Q''}} so that its profit is maximized. We can maximize the profit

:<math>\text{profit} = \text{revenue} - \text{costs} =  PQ - C(Q)</math>

by differentiating with respect to {{math|''Q''}} and solving

:<math>P - C'(Q_{opt}) = 0.</math>

{{math|''Q''<sub>''opt''</sub>}} represents the optimal quantity {{math|''Q''}} of goods that the producer is willing to supply, which is indeed the supply itself:
:<math>S(P) = Q_{opt}(P) = (C^')^{-1}(P)</math>.

If we consider the maximal profit as a function of price, <math>\text{profit}_\text{max}(P)</math>, we see that it is the Legendre transform of the cost function <math>C(Q)</math>.

==Geometric interpretation==
For a [[strictly convex function]], the Legendre transformation can be interpreted as a mapping between the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the function and the family of [[tangent]]s of the graph. (For a function of one variable, the tangents are well-defined at all but at most [[countable set|countably many]] points, since a convex function is [[derivative|differentiable]] at all but at most countably many points.)

The equation of a line with [[slope]] {{math|''p''}} and [[y-intercept|{{math|''y''}}-intercept]] {{math|''b''}} is given by {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''px'' + ''b''}}. For this line to be tangent to the graph of a function {{mvar|f}} at the point {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>))}} requires
:<math>f\left(x_0\right) = p x_0 + b</math>
and
:<math>p = f'(x_0).</math>

The function <math>f'</math>is strictly monotone as the derivative of a strictly convex function. The second equation can be solved for <math>x_0 = f^{\prime-1}(p)</math>, allowing elimination of {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} from the first, and solving for the {{math|''y''}}-intercept {{math|''b''}} of the tangent as a function of its slope {{math|''p''}},
:<math>b = f\left(f^{\prime-1}\left(p\right)\right) - p \cdot f^{\prime-1}\left(p\right) = -f^\star(p).</math>

Here, <math>f^\star</math> denotes the Legendre transform of {{mvar|f}}.

The [[indexed family|family]] of tangents of the graph of {{mvar|f}} parameterized by {{mvar|p}} is therefore given by
:<math>y = px - f^\star(p),</math>
or, written implicitly, by the solutions of the equation
:<math>F(x,y,p) = y + f^\star(p) - px = 0~.</math>

The graph of the original function can be reconstructed from this family of lines as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of this family by demanding
: <math>{\partial F(x,y,p)\over\partial p} = f^{\star\prime}(p) - x = 0.</math>

Eliminating {{math|''p''}} from these two equations gives
: <math>y = x \cdot f^{\star\prime-1}(x) - f^\star\left(f^{\star\prime-1}(x)\right).</math>

Identifying {{math|''y''}} with {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and recognizing the right side of the preceding equation as the Legendre transform of {{math|''f''*}},  yields
: <math>f(x) = f^{\star\star}(x) ~.</math>

==Legendre transformation in more than one dimension==
For a differentiable real-valued function on an [[open set|open]] subset {{mvar|U}} of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} the Legendre conjugate of the pair {{math|(''U'', ''f'')}} is defined to be the pair {{math|(''V'', ''g'')}}, where {{mvar|V}} is the image of {{mvar|U}} under the [[gradient]] mapping {{math|''Df''}}, and {{mvar|g}} is the function on {{mvar|V}} given by the formula
:<math>g(y) = \left\langle y, x \right\rangle - f(x), \qquad x = \left(Df\right)^{-1}(y)</math>
where
:<math>\left\langle u,v\right\rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n u_k \cdot v_k</math>

is the [[scalar product]] on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The multidimensional transform can be interpreted as an encoding of the [[convex hull]] of the function's [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] in terms of its [[supporting hyperplane]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://maze5.net/?page_id=733 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312152731/http://maze5.net/?page_id=733 |archive-date=2015-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Alternatively, if {{mvar|X}} is a [[vector space]] and {{math|''Y''}} is its [[dual space|dual vector space]], then for each point {{mvar|x}} of {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''Y''}}, there is a natural identification of the [[cotangent space]]s {{math|T*''X<sub>x</sub>''}} with {{math|''Y''}} and {{math|T*''Y<sub>y</sub>''}} with {{math|''X''}}. If {{mvar|f}} is a real differentiable function over {{math|''X''}}, then its [[exterior derivative]], {{math|''df''}}, is a section of the [[cotangent bundle]] {{math|T*''X''}} and as such, we can construct a map from {{math|''X''}} to {{math|''Y''}}. Similarly, if {{mvar|g}} is a real differentiable function over {{math|''Y''}}, then {{math|''dg''}} defines a map from {{math|''Y''}} to {{math|''X''}}. If both maps happen to be inverses of each other, we say we have a Legendre transform. The notion of the [[tautological one-form]] is commonly used in this setting.

When the function is not differentiable, the Legendre transform can still be extended, and is known as the [[Legendre-Fenchel transformation]]. In this more general setting, a few properties are lost: for example, the Legendre transform is no longer its own inverse (unless there are extra assumptions, like [[convex function|convexity]]).

==Legendre transformation on manifolds==
Let {{math|''M''}} be a [[smooth manifold]], and let {{math|''TM''}} denote its [[tangent bundle]].  Let {{math|''L'' : ''TM'' &rarr; '''R'''}} be a smooth function, which we will refer to as the Lagrangian.  The Legendre transformation of {{math|''L''}} is a morphism of vector bundles {{math|'''F'''''L'' : ''TM'' &rarr; ''T''<sup>*</sup>''M''}} defined as follows.  Suppose that {{math|''n'' {{=}} dim ''M''}} and that {{math|''U'' ⊆ ''M''}} is a chart.  Then {{math|''U'' × '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a chart on {{math|''TM''}}, and for any point {{math|(''x'', ''v'')}} in this chart, the Legendre transformation of {{math|''L''}} is defined by
:<math>\mathbf{F}L(x, v) = \left(x, \frac{\partial L}{\partial v}(x, v)\right).</math>
The '''associated energy function''' is the function {{math|''E'' : ''TM'' &rarr; '''R'''}} defined by
:<math>E(x, v) = \langle v, \mathbf{F}L(x, v)\rangle - L(x, v),</math>
where the angle brackets denote the natural pairing of a tangent and cotangent vector.  The Legendre transform can be further generalized to a function from a vector bundle over {{math|''M''}} to its dual bundle.<ref>Marsden, Jerrod E., and Ratiu, Tudor, ''Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry: A Basic Exposition of Classical Mechanical Systems'', Springer-Verlag, 1999, {{ISBN|978-0-387-98643-2}}, doi 10.1007/978-0-387-21792-5.</ref>

==Further properties==

===Scaling properties===
The Legendre transformation has the following scaling properties: For {{math|''a'' > 0}},

:<math>f(x) = a \cdot g(x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = a \cdot g^\star\left(\frac{p}{a}\right) </math>
:<math>f(x) = g(a \cdot x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star\left(\frac{p}{a}\right).</math>

It follows that if a function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree {{mvar|r}}]] then its image under the Legendre transformation is a homogeneous function of degree {{mvar|s}}, where {{math|1/''r'' + 1/''s'' {{=}} 1}}. (Since {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x<sup>r</sup>''/''r''}}, with {{math|''r'' > 1}}, implies {{math|''f''*(''p'') {{=}} ''p<sup>s</sup>''/''s''}}.)  Thus, the only monomial whose degree is invariant under Legendre transform is the quadratic.

===Behavior under translation===
:<math> f(x) = g(x) + b \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star(p) - b</math>
:<math> f(x) = g(x + y) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star(p) - p \cdot y </math>

===Behavior under inversion===
:<math> f(x) = g^{-1}(x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = - p \cdot g^\star\left(\frac{1}{p} \right) </math>

===Behavior under linear transformations===
Let {{math|''A'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> → '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} be a [[linear transformation]]. For any convex function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, one has

:<math> (A f)^\star = f^\star A^\star </math>

where {{math|''A''*}} is the [[adjoint operator]] of {{mvar|A}} defined by

:<math> \left \langle Ax, y^\star \right \rangle = \left \langle x, A^\star y^\star \right \rangle, </math>

and {{math|''Af''}} is the ''push-forward'' of {{mvar|f}} along {{mvar|A}}

:<math> (A f)(y) = \inf\{ f(x) : x \in X , A x = y \}. </math>

A closed convex function {{mvar|f}} is symmetric with respect to a given set {{mvar|G}} of [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal linear transformation]]s,
:<math>f(A x) = f(x), \; \forall x, \; \forall A \in G </math>
[[if and only if]] {{math|''f''*}} is symmetric with respect to {{mvar|G}}.

===Infimal convolution===
The '''infimal convolution''' of two functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} is defined as

:<math> \left(f \star_\inf  g\right)(x) = \inf \left \{ f(x-y) + g(y) \, | \, y \in \mathbf{R}^n \right \}. </math>

Let {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f<sub>m</sub>''}} be proper convex functions on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. Then

:<math> \left( f_1 \star_\inf \cdots \star_\inf f_m \right)^\star = f_1^\star + \cdots + f_m^\star. </math>

===Fenchel's inequality===
For any function {{mvar|f}} and its convex conjugate {{math|''f'' *}} ''Fenchel's inequality'' (also known as the ''Fenchel–Young inequality'') holds for every {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}  and {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X''*}}, i.e., ''independent'' {{math|''x'', ''p''}} pairs,
:<math>\left\langle p,x \right\rangle \le f(x) + f^\star(p).</math>
