'''Experimental physics''' is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of [[physics]] that are concerned with the [[observation]] of physical [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] and [[experiment]]s. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the [[Cavendish experiment]], to more complicated ones, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

==Overview==

Experimental physics regroups all the disciplines of physics that are concerned with data acquisition, data-acquisition methods, and the detailed conceptualization (beyond simple [[thought experiment]]s) and realization of laboratory experiments. It is often put in contrast with [[theoretical physics]], which is more concerned with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than the acquisition of knowledge about it.

Although experimental and theoretical physics are concerned with different aspects of nature, they both share the same goal of understanding it and have a symbiotic relation. The former provides data about the universe, which can then be analyzed in order to be understood, while the latter provides explanations for the data and thus offers insight on how to better acquire data and on how to set up experiments. Theoretical physics can also offer insight on what data is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the universe, and on what experiments to devise in order to obtain it.

==History==
As a distinct field, experimental physics was established in [[early modern Europe]], during what is known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], by physicists such as [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. In the early 17th century, Galileo made extensive use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in the modern scientific method. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in dynamics, in particular the law of [[inertia]], which later became the first law in [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In Galileo's ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', a dialogue between the characters Simplicio and Salviati discuss the motion of a ship (as a moving frame) and how that ship's cargo is indifferent to its motion. Huygens used the motion of a boat along a Dutch canal to illustrate an early form of the conservation of [[momentum]].

Experimental physics is considered to have reached a high point with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727). In 1687, Newton published the ''Principia'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical laws: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both laws agreed well with experiment. The ''Principia'' also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]].

From the late 17th century onward, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], and many others. In 1733, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in 1847 [[James Joule|Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of [[statistical mechanics]].

Besides classical mechanics and thermodynamics, another great field of experimental inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the 17th and eighteenth century by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current|current]]. By 1808 [[John Dalton]] had discovered that atoms of different elements have different weights and proposed the modern [[Atomic theory|theory of the atom]].

It was [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] who first proposed the connection between electricity and magnetism after observing the deflection of a compass needle by a nearby electric current. By the early 1830s [[Michael Faraday]] had demonstrated that magnetic fields and electricity could generate each other. In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] presented to the [[Royal Society]] a set of equations that described this relationship between electricity and magnetism. [[Maxwell's equations]] also predicted correctly that [[light]] is an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]. Starting with astronomy, the principles of [[natural philosophy]] crystallized into fundamental [[law of physics|laws of physics]] which were enunciated and improved in the succeeding centuries. By the 19th century, the sciences had segmented into multiple fields with specialized researchers and the field of physics, although logically pre-eminent, no longer could claim sole ownership of the entire field of scientific research.

==Current experiments==

Some examples of prominent experimental physics projects are:

* [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] which collides heavy ions such as [[gold]] ions (it is the first heavy ion collider) and [[proton]]s, it is located at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], on Long Island, USA.
* [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]], which collides [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s and protons, and is part of [[DESY]], located in [[Hamburg]], Germany.
* [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], or the Large [[Hadron]] [[Collider]], which completed construction in 2008 but suffered a series of setbacks. The LHC began operations in 2008, but was shut down for maintenance until the summer of 2009. It is the world's most energetic collider upon completion, it is located at [[CERN]], on the French-Swiss border near [[Geneva]]. The collider became fully operational March 29, 2010 a year and a half later than originally planned.<ref>{{cite web|date=2010-03-29|title=Yes, we did it!|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2010/14/News%20Articles/1246424?ln=en|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2010-04-16}}</ref>
* [[LIGO]], the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Currently two LIGO observatories exist: LIGO Livingston Observatory in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and LIGO Hanford Observatory near [[Richland, Washington|Richland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].
* [[James Webb Space Telescope|JWST]], or the [[James E. Webb|James Webb]] Space Telescope, is planned for launch in 2021. It will be the successor to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It will survey the sky in the infrared region. The main goals of the JWST will be in order to understand the initial stages of the universe, galaxy formation as well as the formations of stars and planets, and the origins of life.

==Method==
{{main|Experiment}}
Experimental physics uses two main methods of experimental research, [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]], and [[natural experiment]]s. Controlled experiments are often used in [[laboratories]] as laboratories can offer a controlled environment. Natural experiments are used, for example, in [[astrophysics]] when observing [[celestial objects]] where control of the variables in effect is impossible.
