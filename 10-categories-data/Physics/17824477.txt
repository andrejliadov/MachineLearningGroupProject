'''Zhejiang Institute of Modern Physics''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 浙江大學近代物理中心, [[Simplified Chinese]]: 浙江近代物理中心) is a research center for [[theoretical physics]].  It is part of the [[Zhejiang University]], [[People's Republic of China]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Introduction==
The institute was formally founded in 1991, due to the encouragement of [[United States|American]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and current President of [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] [[Lu Yongxiang (engineer)|Lu Yongxiang]], both of whom are [[List of Zhejiang University alumni|Zhejiang University alumni]]. Tsung-Dao Lee was named the first [[Board of directors|Director]] of the institute. The prominent leader [[Chen Yun]] also wrote (in [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]]) the name for the institute.<ref>[http://zimp.zju.edu.cn/zimp-jianjie2.htm http://zimp.zju.edu.cn]</ref>

The facility is located on the hill of the [[Lingfeng Hill|Lingfeng]] (灵峰), and in the [[Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University|Yuquan Campus]]. It has a construction area of 1,000 m².

The Institute focuses on the study of [[quantum field theory]], [[string theory]], and [[Particle physics|high-energy physics]]. Current researchers including Mr. Xiaowei TANG (唐孝威, academician of CAS) also perform [[interdisciplinary]] studies of [[biophysics]].

The institute is coupled closely with the Department of Physics of Zhejiang University.
