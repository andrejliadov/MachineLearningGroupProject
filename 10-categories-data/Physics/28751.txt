'''Superluminal communication''' is a hypothetical process in which [[information]] is sent at [[faster-than-light]] (FTL) speeds. The current scientific consensus is that faster-than-light communication is not possible, and to date it has not been achieved in any experiment.

Superluminal communication is impossible<ref>{{cite book |title=Slow Light: Invisibility, Teleportation and Other Mysteries of Light |first1=Sidney |last1=Perkowitz |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84816-753-7 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqhgDQAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QqhgDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA108 Extract of page 108]</ref> because, in a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz-invariant]] theory, it could be used to [[tachyonic antitelephone|transmit information into the past]]. This contradicts [[causality (physics)|causality]] and leads to [[grandfather paradox|logical paradoxes]].<ref name=Tipler/>

A number of theories and phenomena related to superluminal communication have been proposed or studied, including [[tachyon]]s, [[quantum nonlocality]], and [[wormhole]]s.

==Proposed mechanisms==
===Tachyons===
[[Tachyon|Tachyonic particles]] are hypothetical particles that travel faster than light. These would allow superluminal communication, and for this reason are widely believed not to exist.<ref name=Tipler/> By contrast, [[tachyonic field]]s - quantum fields with imaginary mass - certainly do exist, and exhibit superluminal [[group velocity]] under some circumstances. However, such fields have luminal [[signal velocity]] and do not allow superluminal communication.<ref name=Randall/>

===Quantum nonlocality===
Quantum mechanics is non-local in the sense that distant systems can be [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]. Entangled states lead to correlations in the results of otherwise random measurements, even when the measurements are made nearly simultaneously and at far distant points. The impossibility of superluminal communication led Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen to propose that quantum mechanics must be incomplete (see [[EPR paradox]]).

However, it is now well understood that quantum entanglement does not allow any influence or information to propagate superluminally. Technically, the [[Wightman axioms#W3 .28local commutativity or microscopic causality.29|microscopic causality postulate]] of [[axiomatic quantum field theory]] implies the impossibility of superluminal communication using any phenomena whose behavior can be described by orthodox quantum field theory.<ref name=Eberhard/> A special case of this is the [[no-communication theorem]], which prevents communication using the [[quantum entanglement]] of a composite system shared between two spacelike-separated observers. Some authors have argued that using the no-communication theorem to deduce the impossibility of superluminal communication is circular, since the no-communication theorem assumes that the system is composite.<ref name=Peacock/>

===Wormholes===
If [[wormhole]]s are possible, then ordinary subluminal methods of communication could be sent through them to achieve superluminal transmission speeds. Considering the immense energy that current theories suggest would be required to open a wormhole large enough to pass spacecraft through, it may be that only atomic-scale wormholes would be practical to build, limiting their use solely to information transmission. Some hypotheses of wormhole formation would prevent them from ever becoming "timeholes", allowing superluminal communication without the additional complication of allowing communication with the past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Fictional devices==
===Ultrawave and hyperwave===
{{Main|Ultrawave}}

The terms "ultrawave" and "hyperwave" have been used by several authors, often interchangeably, to denote faster-than-light communications. Examples include:
*[[E. E. Smith]] used the term "ultrawave" in his [[Lensman series|''Lensman'' series]], for waves which propagated through a sub-ether and could be used for weapons, communications, and other applications.
*In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], "ultrawave" and "hyperwave" are used interchangeably to represent a superluminal communications medium. The ''hyperwave relay'' also features.
*In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[technology in Star Trek#Subspace|subspace]] carries faster-than-light communication (subspace radio) and travel ([[warp drive]]).
*The ''[[Cities in Flight]]'' series by [[James Blish]] featured ultrawave communications which used the known phenomenon of phase velocity to carry information, a property which in fact is impossible. The limitations of phase velocity beyond the speed of light later led him to develop his Dirac communicator.
*[[Larry Niven]] used ''hyperwave'' in his [[Known Space]] series as the term for an FTL method of communication. Unlike the hyperdrive that moved ships at a finite FTL speed, hyperwave was essentially instantaneous.
*In [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard K. Morgan]]'s [[Takeshi Kovacs]] novels human colonies on distant planets maintain contact with earth and each other via ''hyperspatial needlecast'', a technology which moves information "...so close to instantaneously that scientists are still arguing about the terminology".

===Tachyon-like===
The ''Dirac communicator'' features in several of the works of [[James Blish]], notably his 1954 short story "[[James Blish#Beep: The Dirac communicator|Beep]]". As alluded to in the title, any active device received the sum of all transmitted messages in universal space-time, in a single pulse, so that demultiplexing yielded information about the past, present, and future.

===Ansible===
{{Main|Ansible}}
A later device was the [[ansible]] coined by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] and used extensively in her [[Hainish cycle]]. Like Blish's device it provided instantaneous communication, but without the inconvenient beep.

The ansible is also a major plot element, nearly a [[MacGuffin]], in [[Elizabeth Moon]]'s [[Vatta's War]] series. Much of the story line revolves around various parties attacking or repairing ansibles, and around the internal politics of ISC (InterStellar Communications), which holds a monopoly on the ansible technology.<ref name="vatta1">{{cite book |last= Moon |first= Elizabeth |authorlink= Elizabeth Moon |title= Trading in Danger |edition= mass ppb. |date= September 2004 |publisher= Del Rey |isbn= 0-345-44761-1 |page= 111 |quote= Attack on instersystem ansibles is just...just unthinkable |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780345447616 }}</ref>

===Quantum entanglement===
*In [[Ernest Cline]]'s novel ''[[Armada (novel)|Armada]]'', alien invaders possess technology for instant "quantum communication" with unlimited range. Humans reverse engineer the device from captured alien technology.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1137584491|title=The Cyborg Subject: Reality, Consciousness, Parallax|last=Benjamin|first=Garfield|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=978-1-137-58448-9|location=https://books.google.com.au/books?isbn=1137584491|pages=28}}</ref>
*In the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series of video games, instantaneous communication is possible using quantum-entanglement communicators placed in the communications rooms of starships.
*In the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' continuity, faster-than-light communication via a subtle control over the state of entangled particles is possible, but for practical purposes extremely slow and expensive: at a transmission rate of three bits of information per hour and a cost of $7,500 per bit, it is used for only the highest priority messages.<ref>''James Cameron's Avatar: An Activist Survival Guide'' – pg 156-157</ref>
*[[Charles Stross]]'s books ''[[Singularity Sky]]'' and ''[[Iron Sunrise]]'' make use of "causal channels" which use entangled particles for instantaneous two-way communication. The technique has drawbacks in that the entangled particles are expendable and the use of faster-than-light travel destroys the entanglement, so that one end of the channel must be transported below light speed. This makes them expensive and limits their usefulness somewhat.
*In [[Liu Cixin]]'s novel ''[[The Three-Body Problem (novel)|The Three-Body Problem]]'', the alien Trisolarans, while preparing to invade the Solar System, use a device with Ansible characteristics to communicate with their collaborators on Earth in real time. Additionally, they use spying/sabotaging devices called 'Sophons' on Earth which by penetration can access any kind of electronically saved and visual information, interact with electronics, and communicate results back to Trisolaris in real-time via quantum entanglement. The technology used is "single protons that have been unfolded from eleven space dimensions to two dimensions, programmed, and then refolded" and thus Sophons remain undetectable for humans.

===Psychic links===
[[Extrasensory perception|Psychic]] links, belonging to [[pseudoscience]],<ref>Hines, Terence. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 117–145. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}</ref><ref>Diaconis, Persi. (1978). ''Statistical Problems in ESP Research''. Science New Series, Vol. 201, No. 4351. pp. 131–136.</ref> have been described as explainable by physical principles or unexplained, but they are claimed to operate instantaneously over large distances.

In the ''[[Stargate]]'' television series, characters are able to communicate instantaneously over long distances by transferring their consciousness into another person or being anywhere in the universe using "[[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] communication stones". It is not known how these stones operate, but the technology explained in the show usually revolves around [[wormhole]]s for instant teleportation, faster-than-light, space-warping travel, and sometimes around [[quantum multiverse]]s.

In [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Time for the Stars]]'', [[twin telepathy]] was used to maintain communication with a distant spaceship.

[[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Void Trilogy]]'' features psychic links between the multiple bodies simultaneously occupied by some characters.

===Other devices===
Similar devices are present in the works of numerous others, such as [[Frank Herbert]]<ref name="star">{{cite book |last= Herbert |first= Frank |authorlink= Frank Herbert |title= The Whipping Star |origyear= 1970 |date= April 1970 |publisher= Worlds of If magazine}}</ref> and [[Philip Pullman]], who called his a ''lodestone resonator''.<ref name="amber">{{cite book |last= Pullman |first= Philip |authorlink= Philip Pullman |title= The Amber Spyglass |origyear= 2000 |edition= His Dark Materials, 3. mass pbk. |date= 2001-10-02 |publisher= [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] |location= New York |isbn= 0-345-41337-7 |page= [https://archive.org/details/amberspyglass00pull/page/156 156] |quote= Well, in our world there is a way of taking a common lodestone and entangling all its particles, and then splitting it in two so that both parts resonate together. |url= https://archive.org/details/amberspyglass00pull/page/156 }}</ref>

[[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Crystal Singer]]'' series posited an instantaneous communication device powered by rare "Black Crystal" from the planet Ballybran. Black Crystals cut from the same mineral deposit could be "tuned" to sympathetically vibrate with each other instantly, even when separated by interstellar distances, allowing instantaneous telephone-like voice and data communication. Similarly, in [[Gregory Keyes]]' series ''[[The Age of Unreason]]'', "aetherschreibers" use two halves of a single "chime" to communicate, aided by scientific alchemy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keyes|first=J. Gregory|title=The Shadows of God|date=4 March 2009|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=9780307559609|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7M0bI6HqdoC&q=aetherschreiber&pg=PT192|accessdate=15 March 2014|quote=My aetherschreiber was lost when the Coweta captured us.}}</ref> While the speed of communication is important, so is the fact that the messages cannot be overheard except by listeners with a piece of the same original crystal.

[[Stephen R. Donaldson]], in his [[The Gap Cycle|Gap cycle]], proposed a similar system, ''Symbiotic Crystalline Resonance Transmission'', clearly ansible-type technology but very difficult to produce and limited to text messages.

In the story "[[With Folded Hands]]" (1947), by [[Jack Williamson]], instant communication and power transfer through interstellar space is possible with something referred to as ''rhodomagnetic waves''.

In [[Ivan Yefremov]]'s 1957 novel [[Andromeda (novel)|''Andromeda Nebula'']], a device for instant transfer of information and matter is made real by using "bipolar mathematics" to explore use of anti-gravitational shadow vectors through a zero field and the antispace, which enables them to make contact with the planet of Epsilon Tucanae.

In [[Cordwainer Smith]]'s [[Instrumentality of Mankind|Instrumentality]] novels and stories, interplanetary and [[interstellar communication]] is normally relayed from planet to planet, presumably at superluminal speed for each stage (at least between solar systems) but with a cumulative delay. For urgent communication there is the "instant message", which is effectively instantaneous but very expensive.<ref>Smith, Cordwainer. "On the Storm Planet" (February 1965), Chap. XII, pp. 148–149 in: {{cite book |editor1-last=Dozois |editor1-first=Gardner |editor1-link=Gardner Dozois |title=Modern Classic Short Novels Of Science Fiction |date=28 October 2014 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York|pages=94–163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub6FBAAAQBAJ&q=Cordwainer+Smith+Instant+Message&pg=PA148 |accessdate=14 August 2015 |quote=The communicator was the kind they mount in planoforming ships right beside the pilot.

Casher, knowing the prices of this kind of communication, almost felt that he could see the arterial spurt of money go out of Henriada's budget as the machines reached across the galaxy, found Mizzer and came back with the answer.|isbn=9781466884472 }}</ref>

In [[Howard Tayler|Howard Taylor]]'s web comic series [[Schlock Mercenary]], superluminal communication is performed via the hypernet, a galaxy-spanning analogue to the internet.  Through the hypernet, communications and data are routed through nanoscopic wormholes, using conventional electromagnetic signals.
