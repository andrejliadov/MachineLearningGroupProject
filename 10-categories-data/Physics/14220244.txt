A '''potentiometric surface''' is the imaginary plane where a given [[reservoir]] of fluid will "equalize out to" if allowed to flow. A potentiometric surface is based on [[hydraulic]] principles. For example, we know that two connected storage tanks with one full and one empty will gradually fill/drain to the same level. This is because of atmospheric pressure and gravity. This idea is heavily used in city water supplies - a tall [[water tower]] containing the [[water supply]] has a great enough potentiometric surface to provide flowing water at a decent pressure to the houses it supplies.

For [[groundwater]] "potentiometric surface" is a synonym of "piezometric surface" which is an imaginary surface that defines the level to which water in a [[confined aquifer]] would rise were it completely pierced with [[water well|wells]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Younger|first=Paul|title=Groundwater in the Environment|date=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-2143-9}}</ref> If the potentiometric surface lies above the ground surface, a flowing [[artesian well]] results. [[Contour maps]] and profiles of the potentiometric surface can be prepared from the well data.
