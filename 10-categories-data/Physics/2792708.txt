'''Solar physics''' is the branch of astrophysics that specializes in the study of the [[Sun]]. It deals with detailed measurements that are possible only for our closest star.  It intersects with many disciplines of pure [[physics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[computer science]], including [[fluid dynamics]], [[plasma physics]] including [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[seismology]], [[particle physics]], [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[stellar evolution]], [[space physics]], [[spectroscopy]], [[radiative transfer]], [[optics|applied optics]], [[signal processing]], [[computer vision]], [[computational physics]], [[stellar physics]] and [[solar astronomy]].

Because the Sun is uniquely situated for close-range observing (other stars cannot be resolved with anything like the spatial or temporal resolution that the Sun can), there is a split between the related discipline of observational astrophysics (of distant stars) and observational solar physics.

The study of solar physics is also important as it provides a "physical laboratory" for the study of plasma physics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Solar Physics|first=Marshall Space Flight Center|title=Why we study the Sun|url=http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/whysolar.shtml|work=NASA|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Ancient times===
Babylonians were keeping a record of solar eclipses, with the oldest record originating from the ancient city of Ugarit, in modern-day Syria. This record dates to about 1300 BC.<ref>{{cite book|last=Littman|first=M.|title=Totality: Eclipses of the Sun|date=2000|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=2nd|author2=Willcox, F |author3=Espenak, F. }}</ref> Ancient Chinese astronomers were also observing solar phenomena (such as solar eclipses and visible sunspots) with the purpose of keeping track of calendars, which were based on lunar and solar cycles. Unfortunately, records kept before 720 BC are very vague and offer no useful information. However, after 720 BC, 37 solar eclipses were noted over the course of 240 years.<ref name="ancient china">{{cite web|last=Sten|first=Odenwald|title=Ancient eclipses in China|url=http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2009eclipse/ancienteclipses.php|work=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

===Medieval times===
Astronomical knowledge flourished in the Islamic world during medieval times. Many observatories were built in cities from Damascus to Baghdad, where detailed astronomical observations were taken. Particularly, a few solar parameters were measured and detailed observations of the Sun were taken. Solar observations were taken with the purpose of navigation, but mostly for timekeeping. Islam requires its followers to pray five times a day, at specific position of the Sun in the sky. As such, accurate observations of the Sun and its trajectory on the sky were needed. In the late 10th century, Iranian astronomer [[al-Khujandi|Abu-Mahmud Khojandi]] built a massive observatory near Tehran. There, he took accurate measurements of a series of meridian transits of the Sun, which he later used to calculate the obliquity of the ecliptic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arab and Islamic astronomy|url=http://www.starteachastronomy.com/arab.html|work=StarTeach Astronomy Education|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>
Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe was cut from all sources of ancient scientific knowledge, especially those written in Greek. This, plus de-urbanisation and diseases such as the Black Death led to a decline in scientific knowledge in Medieval Europe, especially in the early Middle Ages. During this period, observations of the Sun were taken either in relation to the zodiac, or to assist in building places of worship such as churches and cathedrals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Portal to the heritage of astronomy|title=Theme: medieval astronomy in Europe|url=http://www2.astronomicalheritage.net/index.php/show-theme?idtheme=16|work=UNESCO|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

===Renaissance period===
In astronomy, the renaissance period started with the work of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. He proposed that planets revolve around the Sun and not around the Earth, as it was believed at the time. This model is known as the heliocentric model.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor Redd|first=Nola|title=Nicolaus Copernicus biography: facts & discoveries|url=http://www.space.com/15684-nicolaus-copernicus.html|work=Space.com|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> His work was later expanded by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. Particularly, Galilei used his new telescope to look at the Sun. In 1610, he discovered sunspots on its surface. In the autumn of 1611, [[Johannes Fabricius]] wrote the first book on sunspots, ''De Maculis in Sole Observatis'' ("On the spots observed in the Sun").<ref>{{cite web|title=Sunspots|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/sunspots.html|work=The Galileo Project|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

===Modern times===
Modern day solar physics is focused towards understanding the many phenomena observed with the help of modern telescopes and satellites. Of particular interest are the structure of the solar photosphere, the coronal heat problem and sunspots.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Research==

The [[Solar Physics Division]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]] boasts 555 members (as of May 2007), compared to several thousand in the parent organization.<ref>{{cite web|author=Solar Physics Division|title=Membership|url=http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|work=American Astronomical Society|accessdate=28 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013145/http://spd.aas.org/navbar_members.html|archivedate=22 March 2014}}</ref>

A major thrust of current (2009) effort in the field of solar physics is integrated understanding of the entire [[Solar System]] including the Sun and its effects throughout interplanetary space within the [[heliosphere]] and on [[planet]]s and planetary [[atmosphere]]s. Studies of phenomena that affect multiple systems in the heliosphere, or that are considered to fit within a heliospheric context, are called [[heliophysics]], a new coinage that entered  usage in the early years of the current millennium.
