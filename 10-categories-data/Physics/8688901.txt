Alain Aspect, regarded as an outstanding figure in optical and atomic physics, was awarded the medal for his experiments on the [[Bell's theorem|Bell's inequalities]] test. It was presented on 7 October 2013 by [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe]] and [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Prince Henrik]] at a special event at the Honorary Residence in the [[Carlsberg_(district)#Carlsberg_Academy|Carlsberg Academy]].<ref name=nbm>{{cite web|url=http://bohr2013.nbi.ku.dk/english/events_exhibitions/niels_bohr_medaljen/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006074154/http://bohr2013.nbi.ku.dk/english/events_exhibitions/niels_bohr_medaljen/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 October 2013|title=French physicist receives the Niels Bohr Medal|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>
