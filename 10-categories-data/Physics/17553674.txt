A '''golden age of physics''' appears to have been delineated for certain periods of progress in the [[physics]] sciences, and this includes the previous and current developments of [[cosmology]] and [[astronomy]]. Each "golden age" introduces significant advancements in theoretical and [[experimental method]]s. Discernible time periods marking a "golden age" of advancements are, for example, the development of mechanics under [[Galileo]] (1564–1642) and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] (1642–1727). Another small epoch seen as a golden age is the unification of electricity, magnetism, and optics because of 19th century notables, including [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], and others.<ref name=lulek2001/>

Significant advancements in methods of investigation were introduced for [[celestial mechanics]], which includes realizing a universal [[gravitational force]], with the introduction of the [[telescope]]. Basing [[kinematics|mechanics]] on experimental results was possible with the development of devices that could measure time, and tools for measuring distance. The advances in [[electromagnetism]] in the 19th century enamored physicists, as another golden age closed, and there was a reluctance to perceive further advancement. Hence, the progress of one era, termed a "golden age" has appeared to mark the completion of physics as a science. Yet, this perception has turned out to be erroneous. For example, around 1980, [[Stephen Hawking]] predicted the end of [[theoretical physics]] within 20 years. Around 2001, he amended his prediction to twenty years more from that year. [[Steven Weinberg]] predicts a unified physics by 2050. Tadeusz Lulek, Barbara Lulek, and A. Wal&nbsp;– the authors of a 2001 book&nbsp;– believed themselves to be at the beginning of a new "golden age of physics".<ref name=lulek2001/>

[[Paul Davies]] notes that whilst "many elderly scientists" may regard the first 30 years of the 20th century as a golden age of physics, historians may well, instead, regard it to be the dawning days of "the New Physics".<ref name=Davies1992/>

The golden age of physics was the 19th century.<ref name=VanName1962/> According to [[Emilio Segrè]], in Italy it came to an end in the 18th century, after the time of [[Alessandro Volta]].<ref name=Amaldi1998/>  He reported in his autobiography that [[Enrico Fermi]] felt that it was coming to an end in 1933.<ref name="Segrè1993"/>  A golden age of physics began with the simultaneous discovery of the principle of the [[conservation of energy]] in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Sandbothe2001/><ref name=PrigogineStengers1984a/>  A golden age of physics was the years 1925 to 1927.<ref name=PrigogineStengers1984b/>  The golden age of nonlinear physics was the period from 1950 to 1970, encompassing the [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem]] and others.<ref name=Mitra2009/>  This followed the golden age of nuclear physics, which had spanned the two decades from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s.<ref name=Cook2006/>  A golden age of physics started at the end of the 1920s.<ref name=Wilhelm2008/>

The golden age of physics cabinets was the 18th century, with the rise of such lecturer-demonstrators as [[John Keill]], [[John Theophilus Desaguliers]], and [[William Whiston]], who all invented new physics apparatus for their lectures.<ref name=Brenni2002/>
