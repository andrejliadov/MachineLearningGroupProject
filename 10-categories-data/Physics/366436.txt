[[File:PassiveActive.JPG|thumb|310px|In the active transformation (left), a point moves from position P to P' by rotating clockwise by an angle θ about the origin of the coordinate system. In the passive transformation (right), point P does not move, while the coordinate system rotates counterclockwise by an angle θ about its origin. The coordinates of P' in the active case (that is, relative to the original coordinate system) are the same as the coordinates of P relative to the rotated coordinate system.]]

In [[analytic geometry]], spatial transformations in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space <math>\R^3</math> are distinguished into '''active''' or '''alibi transformations''', and '''passive''' or '''alias transformations'''. An '''active transformation'''<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlibiTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alibi Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> is a [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformation]] which actually changes the physical position (alibi, elsewhere) of a point, or [[rigid body]], which can be defined in the absence of a [[coordinate system]]; whereas a '''passive transformation'''<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AliasTransformation.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Alias Transformation." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource.]</ref> is merely a change in the coordinate system in which the object is described (alias, other name) (change of coordinate map, or [[change of basis]]). By ''transformation'', [[mathematician]]s usually refer to active transformations, while [[physicist]]s and [[engineer]]s could mean either. Both types of transformation can be represented by a combination of a [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and a [[linear transformation]].

Put differently, a ''passive'' transformation refers to description of the ''same'' object in two different coordinate systems.<ref name= Davidson>

On the other hand, an ''active transformation'' is a transformation of one or more objects with respect to the same coordinate system. For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the [[tibia]] relative to the [[femur]], that is, its motion relative to a (''local'') coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (''global'') coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.<ref name = Davidson/>

[[File:Alias and alibi rotations.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Rotation considered as a passive (''alias'') or active (''alibi'') transformation]]

As an example, let the vector <math>\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2)\in \R^2</math>, be a vector in the plane.  A rotation of the vector through an angle θ in counterclockwise direction is given by the [[rotation matrix]]:
:<math>R=
\begin{pmatrix}
 \cos \theta & -\sin \theta\\
 \sin \theta &  \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix},
</math>
which can be viewed either as an ''active transformation'' or a ''passive transformation'' (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.

==Spatial transformations in the Euclidean space <math>\R^3</math>==
In general a spatial transformation <math>T\colon\R^3\to \R^3</math> may consist of a translation and a linear transformation. In the following, the translation will be omitted, and the linear transformation will be represented by a 3×3-matrix <math>T</math>.

===Active transformation===
As an active transformation, <math>T</math> transforms the initial vector <math>\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)</math> into a new vector <math>\mathbf{v}'=(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)=T\mathbf{v}=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)</math>.

If one views <math>\{\mathbf{e}'_x=T(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_y=T(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}'_z=T(0,0,1)\}</math> as a new basis, then the coordinates of the new vector <math>\mathbf{v}'=v_x\mathbf{e}'_x+v_y\mathbf{e}'_y+v_z\mathbf{e}'_z</math> in the new basis are the same as those of <math>\mathbf{v}=v_x\mathbf{e}_x+v_y\mathbf{e}_y+v_z\mathbf{e}_z</math> in the original basis. Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.

=== Passive transformation ===
On the other hand, when one views <math>T</math> as a passive transformation, the initial vector <math>\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)</math> is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, that is, with the inverse transformation <math>T^{-1}</math>.

</ref> This gives a new coordinate system XYZ with basis vectors:
:<math>\mathbf{e}_X=T^{-1}(1,0,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Y=T^{-1}(0,1,0),\ \mathbf{e}_Z=T^{-1}(0,0,1)</math>

The new coordinates <math>(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)</math> of <math>\mathbf{v}</math> with respect to the new coordinate system XYZ are given by: 
:<math>\mathbf{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)=v_Xe_X+v_Ye_Y+v_Ze_Z=T^{-1}(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)</math>.

From this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by
:<math>(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)=T(v_x,v_y,v_z)</math>.

As a passive transformation <math>T</math> transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.

Note the equivalence between the two kinds of transformations: the coordinates of the new point in the active transformation and the new coordinates of the point in the passive transformation are the same, namely
:<math>(v_X,v_Y,v_Z)=(v'_x,v'_y,v'_z)</math>.
