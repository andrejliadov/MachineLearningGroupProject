'''''De Beghinselen der Weeghconst''''' (''The Principles of Statics'', lit. ''The Principles of the Art of Weighing'') is a landmark book authored by [[Simon Stevin]] in the 16th century.

==Importance==
''The Beghinselen of Weeghconst'' is a book about [[statics]], written by [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[physicist]] Simon Stevin. It was published in 1586, in a single volume with ''De Weeghdaet'' (''The Act of Weighing''), ''De Beghinselen des Waterwichts'' (''Principles of Hydrostatics''), and an ''Anhang'' (an [[Addendum|appendix]]). In 1605 there was another edition.

The importance of the book was summarized by the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':

{{quote|In ''De Beghinselen der Weeghconst'' (1586; “Statics and Hydrostatics”) Stevin published the theorem of the [[triangle of forces]]. The knowledge of this triangle of forces, equivalent to the parallelogram diagram of forces, gave a new impetus to the study of statics, which had previously been founded on the theory of the [[lever]]. He also discovered that the downward pressure of a liquid is independent of the shape of its vessel and depends only on its height and base.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/565994/Simon-Stevin britannica.com]</ref>}}
