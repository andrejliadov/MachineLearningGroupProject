The '''history of [[spectroscopy]]''' began in the 17th century. New designs in [[optics]], specifically [[dispersive prism|prisms]], enabled systematic observations of the [[solar spectrum]]. [[Isaac Newton]] first applied the word ''[[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]]'' to describe the [[rainbow]] of [[color]]s that combine to form white light. During the early 1800s, [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] conducted experiments with dispersive [[spectrometer]]s that enabled spectroscopy to become a more precise and quantitative scientific technique. Since then, spectroscopy has played and continues to play a significant role in [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[astronomy]]. Fraunhofer observed and measured [[Fraunhofer lines|dark lines in the Sun's spectrum]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fraunhofer|first=J.|date=1817|title=Bestimmung des Brechungs- und des Farbenzerstreuungs-Vermögens verschiedener Glasarten, in Bezug auf die Vervollkommnung achromatischer Fernröhre|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423482|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=56|issue=7|pages=264–313|bibcode=1817AnP....56..264F|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560706}}</ref> which now bear his name although several of them were observed earlier by [[William Hyde Wollaston|Wollaston]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wollaston|first=W.

[[Image:Fraunhofer lines.svg|thumb|right|320px|Solar spectrum with Fraunhofer lines as it appears visually.]]

[[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] made a significant experimental leap forward by replacing a prism with a [[diffraction grating]] as the source of wavelength [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]. Fraunhofer built off the theories of [[Interference (wave propagation)#Optical interference|light interference]] developed by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], [[François Arago]] and [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]. He conducted his own experiments to demonstrate the effect of passing light through a single rectangular slit, two slits, and so forth, eventually developing a means of closely spacing thousands of slits to form a diffraction grating. The interference achieved by a diffraction grating both improves the [[spectral resolution]] over a prism and allows for the dispersed wavelengths to be quantified. Fraunhofer's establishment of a quantified wavelength scale paved the way for matching spectra observed in multiple laboratories, from multiple sources (flames and the sun) and with different instruments. Fraunhofer made and published systematic observations of the solar spectrum, and the dark bands he observed and specified the wavelengths of are still known as [[Fraunhofer lines]].<ref name = "Brand 37">Brand, pp. 37-42</ref>

The systematic attribution of spectra to [[chemical element]]s began in the 1860s with the work of German physicists [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bunsen|first1=R.|last2=Kirchhoff|first2=G.|date=1861|title=Untersuchungen über das Sonnenspektrum und die Spektren der Chemischen Elemente|journal=Abhandl.

This laid way for spectrochemical analysis in laboratory and astrophysical science. Bunsen and Kirchhoff applied the optical techniques of Fraunhofer, Bunsen's [[Bunsen burner|improved flame source]] and a highly systematic experimental procedure to a detailed examination of the spectra of chemical compounds. They established the linkage between chemical elements and their unique spectral patterns. In the process, they established the technique of analytical spectroscopy. In 1860, they published their findings on the spectra of eight elements and identified these elements' presence in several natural compounds.<ref name="Kirchhoff">See:

Kirchhoff's applications of this law to spectroscopy are captured in [[Gustav Kirchhoff#Kirchhoff.27s three laws of spectroscopy|three laws of spectroscopy]]:

#A hot gas under low pressure emits a "bright-line" or emission-line spectrum.

Meanwhile, the substantial summary of past experiments performed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] (1873), resulted in his [[Maxwell's equations|equations of electromagnetic waves]].

In 1895, the German physicist [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] discovered and extensively studied [[X-ray]]s, which were later used in [[X-ray spectroscopy]].  One year later, in 1896, French physicist [[Antoine Henri Becquerel]] discovered radioactivity, and Dutch physicist [[Pieter Zeeman]] observed spectral lines being split by a magnetic field.<ref>See:

==Development of quantum mechanics==
Between 1920 and 1930 fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics were developed by [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pauli|first=W.|date=1925|title=Über den Zusammenhang des Abschlusses der Elektronengruppen im Atom mit der Komplexstruktur der Spektren|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=31|issue=1|pages=765–783|doi=10.1007/BF02980631|bibcode=1925ZPhy...31..765P|s2cid=122941900}}</ref> [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|date=1925|title=Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=33|issue=1|pages=879–893|doi=10.1007/BF01328377|bibcode=1925ZPhy...33..879H|s2cid=186238950}}</ref> [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schrödinger|first=E.|date=1926|title=An Undulatory Theory of the Mechanics of Atoms and Molecules|journal=Phys.

==Multiply ionized atoms==
This branch of [[spectroscopy]] deals with radiation related to [[atom]]s that are stripped of several electrons (multiply ionized atoms (MIA), multiply charged ions, highly charged [[ion]]s). These are observed in very [[Plasma (physics)|hot plasmas]] (laboratory or astrophysical) or in [[Accelerator physics|accelerator]] experiments ([[Particle accelerator|beam-foil]], [[electron beam ion trap]] (EBIT)). The lowest exited electron shells of such ions decay into stable ground states producing photons in [[Ultraviolet|VUV]], [[Extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] and soft [[X-ray]] spectral regions (so-called resonance transitions).

===Structure studies===
Further progress in studies of atomic structure was in tight connection with the advance to shorter [[wavelength]] in EUV region.

===Accuracy===
Theoretical quantum-mechanical calculations become rather accurate to describe the energy structure of some simple electronic configurations. The results of theoretical developments were summarized by [[Edward Condon|Condon]] and Shortley<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Theory of Atomic Spectra|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.212979|last1=Condon|first1=E.U.|last2=Shortley|first2=G.H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1935|location=Cambridge}}</ref> in 1935.

[[Bengt Edlén|Edlén]] thoroughly analyzed spectra of MIA for many chemical elements and derived regularities in energy structures of MIA for many isoelectronic sequences (ions with the same number of electrons, but different nuclear charges). Spectra of rather high ionization stages (e.g. Cu XIX) were observed.

The most exciting event was in 1942, when [[Bengt Edlén|Edlén]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edlén|first=B.|date=1942|title=Die Deutung der Emissionslinien im Spectrum der Sonnenkorona|journal=Z. Astrophys.|volume=20|pages=30}}</ref> proved the identification of some solar coronal lines on the basis of his precise analyses of spectra of MIA. This implied that the [[solar corona]] has a temperature of a million degrees, and strongly advanced understanding of solar and stellar physics.

After the [[World War II|WW II]] experiments on balloons and rockets were started to observe the VUV radiation of the Sun. (See [[X-ray astronomy]]). More intense research continued since 1960 including [[spectrometer]]s on satellites.

In the same period the laboratory spectroscopy of MIA becomes relevant as a diagnostic tool for hot plasmas of thermonuclear devices (see [[Nuclear fusion]]) which begun with building [[Stellarator]] in 1951 by Spitzer, and continued with [[tokamak]]s, z-pinches and the laser produced plasmas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Martinson|first1=I.|last2=Jupén|first2=C.|date=2003|title=Atomic Structure Studies Using Fusion Plasmas|journal=Phys.

A new page in the spectroscopy of MIA may be dated as 1986 with development of [[Electron beam ion trap|EBIT]] (Levine and Marrs, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|LLNL]]) due to a favorable composition of modern high technologies such as [[cryogenics]], [[ultra-high vacuum]], [[superconducting magnet]]s, powerful [[Electron-beam technology|electron beams]] and [[semiconductor detector]]s. Very quickly EBIT sources were created in many countries (see [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] summary<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/quantum-measurement/atomic-spectroscopy/electron-beam-ion-trap-ebit|title=Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT)|date=2009-10-06}}</ref> for many details as well as reviews.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beiersdorfer|first=P.|date=2009|title=Spectroscopy with trapped highly charged ions|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/357087.pdf|journal=Phys.

A wide field of spectroscopic research with EBIT is enabled including achievement of highest grades of ionization (U<sup>92+</sup>), wavelength measurement, [[hyperfine structure]] of energy levels, [[Quantum electrodynamics|quantum electrodynamic]] studies, ionization [[Cross section (physics)|cross-sections]] (CS) measurements, electron-impact excitation CS, X-ray [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], relative line intensities, dielectronic [[Recombination (physics)|recombination]] CS, magnetic octupole decay, lifetimes of [[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden transitions]], charge-exchange recombination, etc.

==Infrared and Raman spectroscopy==
Many early scientists who studied the IR spectra of compounds had to develop and build their own instruments to be able to record their measurements making it very difficult to get accurate measurements.  During [[World War II]], the U.S. government contracted different companies to develop a method for the polymerization of [[butadiene]] to create [[synthetic rubber|rubber]], but this could only be done through analysis of Ca hydrocarbon isomers. These contracted companies started developing optical instruments and eventually created the first infrared spectrometers. With the development of these commercial spectrometers Infrared Spectroscopy became a more popular method to determine the "fingerprint" for any molecule.<ref name=":0"/> Raman spectroscopy was first observed in 1928 by Sir [[C. V. Raman|Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]] in liquid substances and also by "Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam in crystals".<ref name=":1" /> Raman spectroscopy is based on the observation of the raman effect which is defined as "The intensity of the scattered light is dependent on the amount of the polarization potential change".<ref name=":1" /> The raman spectrum records light intensity vs. light frequency (wavenumber) and the wavenumber shift is characteristic to each individual compound.<ref name=":1" />

==Laser spectroscopy==

Laser spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that uses [[laser]]s to be able determine the emitted frequencies of matter.<ref name=":2" /> The laser was invented because spectroscopists took the concept of its predecessor, the [[maser]], and applied it to the visible and infrared ranges of light.<ref name=":2" /> The maser was invented by [[Charles H. Townes|Charles Townes]] and other spectroscopists to stimulate matter to determine the radiative frequencies that specific atoms and molecules emitted.<ref name=":2" /> While working on the maser, Townes realized that more accurate detections were possible as the frequency of the microwave emitted increased.<ref name=":2" /> This led to an idea a few years later to use the visible and eventually the infrared ranges of light for spectroscopy that became a reality with the help of [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow|Arthur Schawlow]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200312/history.cfm|title=December 1958: Invention of the Laser|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Since then, lasers have gone on to significantly advance experimental spectroscopy. The laser light allowed for much higher precision experiments specifically in the uses of studying collisional effects of light as well as being able to accurately detect specific wavelengths and frequencies of light, allowing for the invention of devices such as laser atomic clocks. Lasers also made spectroscopy that used time methods more accurate by using speeds or decay times of photons at specific wavelengths and frequencies to keep time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/spectroscopy/history/history-modern.html|title=MIT Spectroscopy Lab - History|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref> Laser spectroscopic techniques have been used for many different applications. One example is using laser spectroscopy to detect compounds in materials. One specific method is called Laser-induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and uses spectroscopic methods to be able to detect what materials are in a solid, liquid, or gas, ''[[in situ]]''. This allows for direct testing of materials, instead of having to take the material to a lab to figure out what the solid, liquid, or gas is made of.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fiddler|first1=Marc N.|last2=Begashaw|first2=Israel|last3=Mickens|first3=Matthew A.|last4=Collingwood|first4=Michael S.|last5=Assefa|first5=Zerihun|last6=Bililign|first6=Solomon|date=2009-12-22|title=Laser Spectroscopy for Atmospheric and Environmental Sensing |journal=Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)|volume=9|issue=12|pages=10447–10512|doi=10.3390/s91210447 |pmc=3267232|pmid=22303184}}</ref>
