In [[mathematics]] and [[classical mechanics]], the '''Poisson bracket''' is an important [[binary operation]] in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], playing a central role in Hamilton's equations of motion, which govern the time evolution of a Hamiltonian [[dynamical system]]. The Poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate transformations, called ''[[canonical transformations]]'', which map [[Canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate systems]] into canonical coordinate systems. A "canonical coordinate system" consists of canonical position and momentum variables (below symbolized by <math>q_i</math> and <math>p_i</math>, respectively) that satisfy canonical Poisson bracket relations. The set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. For instance, it is often possible to choose the Hamiltonian itself <math>H =H(q, p; t)</math> as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.

In a more general sense, the Poisson bracket is used to define a [[Poisson algebra]], of which the algebra of functions on a [[Poisson manifold]] is a special case. There are other general examples, as well: it occurs in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s, where the [[tensor algebra]] of a Lie algebra forms a Poisson algebra; a detailed construction of how this comes about is given in the [[universal enveloping algebra]] article. Quantum deformations of the universal enveloping algebra lead to the notion of [[quantum group]]s.

All of these objects are named in honour of [[Siméon Denis Poisson]].

==Properties==
Given two functions f and g that depend on [[phase space]] and time, their Poisson bracket <math>\{f, g\}</math> is another function that depends on phase space and time. The following rules hold for any three functions <math>f,\, g,\, h</math> of phase space and time:
;[[Anticommutativity]]: <math>\{f, g\} = -\{g, f\}</math>
;[[Bilinearity]]: <math>\{af + bg, h\} = a\{f, h\} + b\{g, h\}, \quad \{h, af + bg\} = a\{h, f\} + b\{h, g\}, \quad a, b \in \mathbb R</math>
;[[Product rule|Leibniz's rule]]: <math>\{fg, h\} = \{f, h\}g + f\{g, h\}</math>
;[[Jacobi identity]]: <math>\{f, \{g, h\}\} + \{g, \{h, f\}\} +  \{h, \{f, g\}\} = 0</math>

Also, if a function <math>k</math> is constant over phase space (but may depend on time), then <math>\{f,\, k\} = 0</math> for any <math>f</math>.

==Definition in canonical coordinates==
In [[canonical coordinates]] (also known as [[Darboux coordinates]]) <math> (q_i,\, p_i)</math> on the [[phase space]], given two functions <math> f(p_i,\, q_i, t)</math> and <math> g(p_i,\, q_i, t)</math>,<ref group=Note><math> f(p_i,\, q_i,\, t)</math> means <math>f</math> is a function of the <math>2N + 1</math> independent variables: momentum, <math>p</math>{{sub|1…N}}; position, <math>q</math>{{sub|1…N}}; and time, <math>t</math></ref> the Poisson bracket takes the form

:<math>\{f, g\} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial q_{i}} \frac{\partial g}{\partial p_{i}} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial g}{\partial q_i}\right).</math>

The Poisson brackets of the canonical coordinates are

:<math>\begin{align}
  \{q_i,q_j\} &= 0 \\
  \{p_i,p_j\} &= 0 \\
  \{q_i,p_j\} &= \delta_{ij}
\end{align}</math>

where ''<math>\delta_{ij}</math>'' is the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Hamilton's equations of motion==
[[Hamilton's equations of motion]] have an equivalent expression in terms of the Poisson bracket. This may be most directly demonstrated in an explicit coordinate frame. Suppose that <math>f(p, q, t)</math> is a function on the manifold. Then from the multivariable [[chain rule]],

:<math>\frac{d}{dt} f(p, q, t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{dq}{dt} + \frac {\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{dp}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}.</math>

Further, one may take <math>p=p(t)</math> and <math>q=q(t)</math> to be solutions to [[Hamilton's equations]]; that is,

:<math>\begin{cases}
  \dot{q} =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \{q, H\}; \\ 
  \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = \{p, H\}.
\end{cases}</math>

Then 
:<math>\begin{align}
  \frac {d}{dt} f(p, q, t) &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \\
                                             &= \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} ~.
\end{align}</math>

Thus, the time evolution of a function <math>f</math> on a [[symplectic manifold]] can be given as a [[flow (mathematics)|one-parameter family]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s (i.e., [[canonical transformations]], area-preserving diffeomorphisms), with the time <math>t</math> being the parameter:  Hamiltonian motion is a canonical transformation generated by the Hamiltonian. That is, Poisson brackets are preserved in it, so that ''any time <math>t</math>'' in the solution to Hamilton's equations, 

: <math> q(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \} ) q(0), \quad  p(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \}) p(0), </math> 

can serve as the bracket coordinates. ''Poisson brackets are [[Canonical transformation|canonical invariants]]''.

Dropping the coordinates, 
:<math>\frac{d}{dt} f = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \{H, \cdot\}\right)f.</math>

The operator in the convective part of the derivative, <math>i\hat{L} = -\{H, \cdot\}</math>, is sometimes referred to as the Liouvillian (see [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)]]).

==Constants of motion==
An [[integrable dynamical system]] will have [[constants of motion]] in addition to the energy. Such constants of motion will commute with the Hamiltonian under the Poisson bracket. Suppose some function <math>f(p, q)</math> is a constant of motion. This implies that if <math>p(t), q(t)</math> is a [[trajectory]] or solution to [[Hamilton's equations of motion]], then

:<math>0 = \frac{df}{dt}</math>

along that trajectory. Then

:<math>0 = \frac{d}{dt} f(p,q) = \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}</math>

where, as above, the intermediate step follows by applying the equations of motion and we supposed that <math>f</math> does not explicitly depend on time. This equation is known as the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]]. The content of [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] is that the time evolution of a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] (or "[[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]" on the phase space) is given by the above.

If the Poisson bracket of <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> vanishes (<math>\{f,g\} = 0</math>), then <math>f</math> and <math>g</math> are said to be '''in involution'''.  In order for a Hamiltonian system to be [[completely integrable]], <math>n</math> independent constants of motion must be in [[Distribution (differential geometry)#Involutive distributions|mutual involution]], where <math>n</math> is the number of degrees of freedom.

Furthermore, according to '''Poisson's Theorem''', if two quantities <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> are explicitly time independent (<math>A(p, q), B(p, q)</math>) constants of motion, so is their Poisson bracket <math>\{A,\, B\}</math>. This does not always supply a useful result, however, since the number of possible constants of motion is limited (<math>2n - 1</math> for a system with <math>n</math> degrees of freedom), and so the result may be trivial (a constant, or a function of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>.)

==The Poisson bracket in coordinate-free language==
Let <math>M</math> be a [[symplectic manifold]], that is, a [[manifold]] equipped with a [[symplectic form]]: a [[Differential form|2-form]] <math>\omega</math> which is both '''closed''' (i.e., its [[exterior derivative]] <math>d \omega</math> vanishes) and '''non-degenerate'''.  For example, in the treatment above, take <math>M</math> to be <math>\mathbb{R}^{2n}</math> and take

:<math>\omega = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d q_i \wedge d p_i.</math>

If <math> \iota_v \omega</math> is the [[interior product]] or [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] operation defined by <math> (\iota_v \omega)(w) =  \omega(v,\, w)</math>, then non-degeneracy is equivalent to saying that for every one-form <math>\alpha</math> there is a unique vector field <math>\Omega_\alpha</math> such that <math> \iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega =  \alpha</math>. Alternatively, <math> \Omega_{d H} = \omega^{-1}(d H)</math>. Then if <math>H</math> is a smooth function on <math>M</math>, the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] <math>X_H</math> can be defined to be <math> \Omega_{d H}</math>.  It is easy to see that

:<math>\begin{align}
  X_{p_i} &=  \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i} \\
  X_{q_i} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial p_i}.
\end{align}</math>

The '''Poisson bracket''' <math>\ \{\cdot,\, \cdot\} </math> on (''M'', ω) is a [[bilinear map|bilinear operation]] on [[differentiable function]]s, defined by <math> \{f,\, g\} \;=\; \omega(X_f,\, X_g) </math>; the Poisson bracket of two functions on ''M'' is itself a function on ''M''.  The Poisson bracket is antisymmetric because:

:<math>\{f, g\} = \omega(X_f, X_g) = -\omega(X_g, X_f) = -\{g, f\} </math>.

Furthermore,

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\begin{align}
  \{f, g\} &= \omega(X_f, X_g) = \omega(\Omega_{df}, X_g) \\
           &= (\iota_{\Omega_{df}}\omega)(X_g) = df(X_g) \\
           &= X_gf = \mathcal{L}_{X_g} f
\end{align}</math>.|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here ''X<sub>g</sub>f'' denotes the vector field ''X<sub>g</sub>'' applied to the function ''f'' as a directional derivative, and <math>\mathcal{L}_{X_g} f</math> denotes the (entirely equivalent) [[Lie derivative]] of the function ''f''.

If α is an arbitrary one-form on ''M'', the vector field Ω<sub>α</sub> generates (at least locally) a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] <math> \phi_x(t)</math> satisfying the boundary condition <math> \phi_x(0) = x</math> and the first-order differential equation

:<math>\frac{d\phi_x}{dt} = \left. \Omega_\alpha \right|_{\phi_x(t)}.</math>

The <math> \phi_x(t)</math> will be [[symplectomorphism]]s ([[canonical transformation]]s) for every ''t'' as a function of ''x'' if and only if <math> \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; 0</math>; when this is true, Ω<sub>α</sub> is called a [[symplectic vector field]].  Recalling [[Cartan's identity]] <math>  \mathcal{L}_X\omega \;=\; d (\iota_X \omega) \,+\, \iota_X d\omega</math> and ''d''ω = 0, it follows that <math> \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; d\left(\iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega\right) \;=\; d\alpha</math>. Therefore, Ω<sub>α</sub> is a symplectic vector field if and only if α is a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed form]].  Since <math> d(df) \;=\; d^2f \;=\; 0</math>, it follows that every Hamiltonian vector field ''X<sub>f</sub>'' is a symplectic vector field, and that the Hamiltonian flow consists of canonical transformations.  From {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} above, under the Hamiltonian flow ''X<sub>H</sub>'',

:<math>\frac{d}{dt}f(\phi_x(t)) = X_Hf = \{f,H\}.</math>

This is a fundamental result in Hamiltonian mechanics, governing the time evolution of functions defined on phase space.  As noted above, when ''{f,H} = 0'', ''f'' is a constant of motion of the system.  In addition, in canonical coordinates (with <math> \{p_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \{q_i,q_j\} \;=\; 0</math> and <math>\{q_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \delta_{ij}</math>), Hamilton's equations for the time evolution of the system follow immediately from this formula.

It also follows from {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} that the Poisson bracket is a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]; that is, it satisfies a non-commutative version of Leibniz's [[product rule]]:

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\{fg,h\} = f\{g,h\} + g\{f,h\}</math>, and <math>\{f,gh\} = g\{f,h\} + h\{f,g\}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The Poisson bracket is intimately connected to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of the Hamiltonian vector fields.  Because the Lie derivative is a derivation,

:<math>\mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = \iota_{\mathcal L_vw}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega = \iota_{[v,w]}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega</math>.

Thus if ''v'' and ''w'' are symplectic, using <math> \mathcal{L}_v\omega \;=\; 0</math>, Cartan's identity, and the fact that <math>\iota_w\omega</math> is a closed form,

:<math>\iota_{[v,w]}\omega = \mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) + \iota_vd(\iota_w\omega) = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) = d(\omega(w,v)).</math>

It follows that <math>[v,w] = X_{\omega(w,v)}</math>, so that
{{NumBlk|:|<math>[X_f,X_g] = X_{\omega(X_g,X_f)} = -X_{\omega(X_f,X_g)} = -X_{\{f,g\}}</math>.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Thus, the Poisson bracket on functions corresponds to the Lie bracket of the associated Hamiltonian vector fields.  We have also shown that the Lie bracket of two symplectic vector fields is a Hamiltonian vector field and hence is also symplectic.  In the language of [[abstract algebra]], the symplectic vector fields form a [[subalgebra]] of the [[Lie algebra]] of smooth vector fields on ''M'', and the Hamiltonian vector fields form an [[algebraic ideal|ideal]] of this subalgebra.  The symplectic vector fields are the Lie algebra of the (infinite-dimensional) [[Lie group]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s of ''M''.

It is widely asserted that the [[Jacobi identity]] for the Poisson bracket,

:<math>\ \{f,\{g,h\}\} + \{g,\{h,f\}\} + \{h,\{f,g\}\} = 0</math>

follows from the corresponding identity for the Lie bracket of vector fields, but this is true only up to a locally constant function.  However, to prove the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket, it is [[Jacobi identity#Examples|sufficient]] to show that:

:<math>\operatorname{ad}_{\{f,g\}}=[\operatorname{ad}_f,\operatorname{ad}_g]</math>

where the operator <math>\operatorname{ad}_g</math> on smooth functions on ''M'' is defined by <math>\operatorname{ad}_g(\cdot) \;=\; \{\cdot,\, g\}</math> and the bracket on the right-hand side is the commutator of operators, <math> [\operatorname A,\, \operatorname B] \;=\; \operatorname A\operatorname B - \operatorname B\operatorname A</math>.  By {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, the operator <math>\operatorname{ad}_g</math> is equal to the operator ''X<sub>g</sub>''.  The proof of the Jacobi identity follows from {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} because the Lie bracket of vector fields is just their commutator as differential operators.

The [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] of smooth functions on M, together with the Poisson bracket forms a [[Poisson algebra]], because it is a [[Lie algebra]] under the Poisson bracket, which additionally satisfies Leibniz's rule {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}.  We have shown that every [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[Poisson manifold]], that is a manifold with a "curly-bracket" operator on smooth functions such that the smooth functions form a Poisson algebra.  However, not every Poisson manifold arises in this way, because Poisson manifolds allow for degeneracy which cannot arise in the symplectic case.

==A result on conjugate momenta==
Given a smooth [[vector field]] <math>X</math> on the configuration space, let <math>P_X</math> be its [[conjugate momentum]]. The conjugate momentum mapping is a [[Lie algebra]] anti-homomorphism from the Poisson bracket to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]:

:<math>\{P_X, P_Y\} = -P_{[X, Y]}.\,</math>

This important result is worth a short proof. Write a vector field <math>X</math> at point <math>q</math> in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] as

:<math>X_q = \sum_i X^i(q) \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}</math>

where the <math>\scriptstyle \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}</math> is the local coordinate frame. The conjugate momentum to <math>X</math> has the expression

:<math>P_X(q, p) = \sum_i X^i(q) \;p_i</math>

where the <math>p_i</math> are the momentum functions conjugate to the coordinates. One then has, for a point <math>(q,p)</math> in the [[phase space]],

:<math>\begin{align}
  \{P_X,P_Y\}(q,p) &=  \sum_i \sum_j \left\{ X^i(q) \;p_i, Y^j(q)\; p_j \right\} \\
                   &=  \sum_{ij} p_i Y^j(q) \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial q^j} -  p_j X^i(q) \frac{\partial Y^j}{\partial q^i} \\
                   &= -\sum_i p_i \; [X, Y]^i(q) \\
                   &= - P_{[X, Y]}(q, p). 
\end{align}</math>

The above holds for all <math>(q, p)</math>, giving the desired result.

==Quantization==
Poisson brackets [[Deformation theory|deform]] to [[Moyal bracket]]s upon [[Weyl quantization|quantization]], that is, they generalize to a different Lie algebra, the [[Moyal bracket|Moyal algebra]], or, equivalently in [[Hilbert space]], quantum [[commutator]]s. The Wigner-İnönü [[group contraction]] of these (the classical limit, {{math|ħ → 0}})  yields the above Lie algebra.

To state this more explicitly and precisely, the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg algebra]] is the [[Weyl algebra]] (modulo the relation that the center be the unit). The Moyal product is then a special case of the star product on the algebra of symbols. An explicit definition of the algebra of symbols, and the star product is given in the article on the [[universal enveloping algebra]].
