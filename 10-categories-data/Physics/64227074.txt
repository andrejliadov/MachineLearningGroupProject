'''Hatice Altuğ''' is a Turkish physicist and professor in the [[Biological engineering|Bioengineering]] Department and head of the [[Nanophotonics|Bio-nanophotonic]] Systems laboratory at [[Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne|École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)]],<ref>[https://people.epfl.ch/hatice.altug?lang=en Hatice Altug - Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne]</ref> in [[Switzerland]]. Her research focuses on nanophotonics for biosensing and surface enhanced spectroscopy, integration with microfluidics and nanofabrication, to obtain high sensitivity, label-free characterization of biological material.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Watch Now|url=https://daylightsolutions.com/resources/webinars/imaging-based-molecular-barcoding/watch-now/|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Daylight Solutions|language=en-US}}</ref> She has developed low-cost biosensor allowing the identification of viruses such as [[Ebola]] that can work in difficult settings and therefore particularly useful in case of [[pandemics]].<ref name=":0">[http://www.bu.edu/articles/2011/meet-one-of-popular-sciences-brilliant-10 Meet One of Popular Science’s “Brilliant 10”  - ENG's Hatice Altug also receives White House honor, Boston University]</ref>

Altuğ has been recognized with many awards and honors, as she was the recipient of United States Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and [[The Optical Society|The Optical Society of America]] Adolph Lomb Medal. She also received European Research Council Consolidator Award, Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award, National Science Foundation CAREER Award and Popular Science Magazine Brilliant 10 Award. She is a Fellow of the Optical Society of America.

== Education ==
Altuğ, who was born in Karamanlı district of Burdur in 1978, completed her high school education in 1996 in Antalya Anatolian High School, [[Antalya]], Turkey. She received her B.Sc. degree in physics in 2000 in Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey), having been awarded a full scholarship there. In 2007, she was awarded a PhD in applied physics from Stanford University (California, U.S.), under the supervision of Prof. [[Jelena Vučković]]. During her education at Stanford University, she worked on laser systems and optical instruments.

== Career ==
Altuğ completed a [[Postdoctoral researcher|Postdoctoral Fellowship]] at the Center for Engineering in Medicine at the [[Harvard Medical School]]. From 2007 until 2013, she was first an assistant and later an associate professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [[Boston University]]. 

In 2010, she was awarded the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award by the National Science Foundation. “With this grant, I will able to invent and explore novel on-chip optical biosensors that can significantly impact medicine and the health sciences,” said Altuğ. “The grant will also enable me to integrate a solid education plan with my research to train scientists and engineers of all ages. I am looking forward to significantly enhancing [[nanotechnology]] education and outreach.” Altuğ disseminated her findings to the public through [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston’s Museum of Science]], local educational programs such as Boston Upward Bound Math and Science, and Boston University’s Summer Challenge program on engineering. At the College of Engineering, she added experimental modules to courses relating to [[nanotechnology]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Two ENG Faculty Win NSF CAREER Awards {{!}} College of Engineering|url=https://www.bu.edu/eng/2010/02/12/two-eng-faculty-win-nsf-career-awards-2/|access-date=2020-06-11|website=www.bu.edu}}</ref> She was also named one of ''Popular Science''’s “Brilliant 10,” a group of researchers under 40 who made transformational contributions to their fields during 2010.<ref name=":0" />

In 2011, [[IEEE Photonics Society]] named Altuğ as winner of the Young Investigator Award, which recognizes individuals who make outstanding technical contributions to the field of [[photonics]] prior to their 35th birthday. She was honored for her groundbreaking achievements in confining and manipulating [[light]] at the nanoscale to dramatically improve [[Biosensor|biosensing]] capabilities. “Professor Altuğ’s novel nanophotonic and nanofluidic inventions could be very important for clinical applications, [[Biomedical research in the United States|biomedical research]] and national defense,” said Selim Ünlü, associate dean for Research and Graduate Programs in [[Boston University]], “With her [Altuğ] creativity and fearlessness in tackling challenging new directions, she promises to be a leader in [[nanophotonics]] and [[nanobiotechnology]].”<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Hatice Altug Wins Photonics Society Young Investigator Award {{!}} College of Engineering|url=http://www.bu.edu/eng/2010/12/03/hatice-altug-wins-photonics-society-young-investigator-award-2/|access-date=2020-06-11|website=www.bu.edu}}</ref> 

Altuğ was recognized with [[The Optical Society|OSA]]’s [[Adolph Lomb Medal]] in 2012 “for breakthrough contributions on [[Integrated optics|integrated optical]] nano-biosensor and [[Spectroscopy|nanospectroscopy]] technologies based on [[Plasmonics|nanoplasmonics]], [[nanofluidics]], and novel [[Nanolithography|nanofabrication]].”

She was also named by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] among 94 researchers as a recipient of the 2011 [[Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers|Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers]] (PECASE), the highest honor bestowed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers. As well as attending the [[White House]] ceremony, awardees receive a research grant lasting up to five years. She was awarded for leading the development of a [[biosensor]] that uses tiny [[Crystal|crystals]] to manipulate light to detect a [[virus]], a [[protein]], or a [[cancer cell]] in a drop of [[blood]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" /> 

In 2013, Altuğ joined [[Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne]], where she became full professor in 2020.

In 2019, she was awarded the ERC Proof of Concept Grant by the [[European Research Council|European research council]] for her project: “Portable [[Infrared]] [[Biosensor|Biochemical Sensor]] Enabled by Pixelated Dielectric [[Metamaterial|Metasurfaces]].”<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|date=2019-07-25|title=Hatice Altug Awarded an ERC Proof of Concept Grant|url=https://actu.epfl.ch/news/hatice-altug-awarded-an-erc-proof-of-concept-gra-4/|language=en}}</ref>
