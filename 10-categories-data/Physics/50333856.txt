'''Elihu Abrahams''' (April 3, 1927 – October 18, 2018) was a theoretical physicist, specializing in condensed matter physics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aspentimes.com/obituaries/elihu-abrahams/|title=Elihu Abrahams|last=Oct. 18, 2018|first=April 3, 1927-|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Abrahams&first_nm=Elihu&year=2019 |title= 2019 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize Recipient |website= www.aps.org |language=en |access-date= October 23, 2018}}</ref> He is mostly notable for his work on electron transport in disordered systems.

Abrahams attended [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], graduating in 1944. In 1947 Abrahams received his bachelor's degree<ref name="AbrahamsFestRef">[http://abrahamsfest.rutgers.edu/Recollections.html Recollections - AbrahamsFest, rutgers.edu]</ref> and in 1952 his PhD, with [[Charles Kittel]] as thesis advisor, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with thesis ''Spin-lattice relaxation in ferromagnetics''. In 1952–1953 he was a research associate in physics at UC Berkeley. He was in 1953–1955 a research associate and in 1955–1956 an assistant professor at the [[University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1956 he became an assistant professor, then an associate professor, and in 1964 a full professor at [[Rutgers University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?abrahamse# |title=Elihu Abrahams {{!}} Array of Contemporary Physicists |access-date= April 26, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603050232/https://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?abrahamse# |archive-date=June 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1979 Abrahams, [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip W. Anderson]], Donald Licciardello and [[T. V. Ramakrishnan|T.V. Ramakrishnan]] published the highly influential paper "Scaling Theory of Localization: Absence of Quantum Diffusion in Two Dimensions" in ''[[Physical Review Letters]] 42''. Often referred to as the "gang of four paper" in physics circles, the authors proposed new, precise predictions about the behavior of electrons in disordered materials. In 2003 the [[American Physical Society]] named it among the top-ten most often cited papers published in the ''[[Physical Review]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riordon|first=James|date=February 2003|title=PRL Top Ten #7|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200302/prl-7.cfm|journal=APS News|volume=12}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Abrahams’ research is in theoretical condensed matter physics. His main interests concern the quantum-mechanical many-body problem in the presence of very strong particle-particle interactions. In this area, he has been using the techniques of quantum statistical mechanics and field theory to investigate the phase transitions and the transport and thermodynamic properties of a number of systems, including high-temperature cuprate superconductors, metals at the threshold of breakdown of Fermi-liquid behavior, iron pnictide superconductors, heavy-fermion metals, localized spins in metals, magnets with unusual spin correlations, and the disordered interacting electron fluid in two dimensions.<ref name=UCLAref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~abrahams/ |title=Physics & Astronomy - Elihu Abrahams, Adjunct Professor, Condensed Matter |website=physics.ucla.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601110815/http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~abrahams/ |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

In 1964 Abrahams was elected a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]]. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Fellow]] for the academic year 1986–1987. He was also elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1987, and to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=":0" /> In 2018, he received the [[Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize|2019 Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Physics Prize]] for "''pioneering research in the physics of disordered materials and hopping conductivity''" together with [[Alexei L. Efros]] and [[Boris Shklovskii|Boris I. Shklovskii]].<ref name=":0" />
