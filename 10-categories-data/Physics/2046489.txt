The '''Akeno Giant Air Shower Array''' ('''AGASA''') is a very 
large surface array designed to study the origin of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s. Located in the town of Akeno in Yamanashi prefecture, Japan, it covers an area of 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and consists of 111 [[Cherenkov detector|surface]] detectors and 27 [[muon]] detectors. Array experiments such as this one are used to detect [[air shower (physics)|air shower]] particles.

The array is operated by the [[Institute for Cosmic Ray Research]], [[University of Tokyo]] at the [[Akeno Observatory]].

==Results==
The results from AGASA were used to calculate the energy spectrum and [[anisotropy]] of cosmic rays. The results helped to confirm the existence of ultra-high energy cosmic rays ([[GZK limit|>{{val|5|e=19|u=eV}}]]), such as the so-called "[[Oh-My-God particle|Oh-My-God]]" particle that was observed by the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|Fly's Eye experiment]] run by the [[University of Utah]].

The [[Telescope Array Project|Telescope Array]], a merger of the AGASA and High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) groups, and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] have improved on the results from AGASA by building larger, hybrid detectors and collecting greater quantities of more precise data.
