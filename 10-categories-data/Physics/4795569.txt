{{Italic title}}
'''''Hypotheses non fingo''''' ([[Latin]] for "I feign no hypotheses", "I frame no [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]", or "I contrive no hypotheses") is a phrase used by [[Isaac Newton]] in an essay, "[[General Scholium]]", which was appended to the second (1713) edition of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

==Original remark==
A 1999 translation of ''Principa'' presents Newton's remark as follows.
{{quote|I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.<ref>[[Isaac Newton]] (1726). ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, [[University of California Press]]  {{ISBN|0-520-08817-4}}, 974 pages.</ref>}}

==Later commentary==
The nineteenth century philosopher of science, [[William Whewell]], qualified this statement, as, he said, "it was by such a use of hypotheses, that both Newton himself and [[Kepler]], on whose discoveries those of Newton were based, made their discoveries". Whewell stated:<blockquote>What is requisite is, that the hypothesis should be close to the facts, and not connected with them by other arbitrary and untried facts; and that the philosopher should be ready to resign it as soon as the facts refuse to confirm it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whewell |first=William |year=1840 |title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences |publisher=London |page=438 |url=https://archive.org/stream/philosophyinduc00whewgoog#page/n450/mode/2up}}</ref></blockquote>

Later, [[Imre Lakatos]] would assert that such a resignation should not be too rushed.{{cn|date=September 2020}}
