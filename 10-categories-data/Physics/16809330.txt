'''Isaac David Abella''' (June 20, 1934 – October 23, 2016) was a Professor of Physics at [[The University of Chicago]].<ref name=UoC>[http://physics.uchicago.edu/research/areas/atomic_x.html "Isaac Abella"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220191521/http://physics.uchicago.edu/research/areas/atomic_x.html |date=2009-02-20 }}, Department of Physics, University of Chicago, 2008</ref> He specialized in [[laser]] physics, quantum optics, and [[spectroscopy]].<ref name=who>[http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/libraries_researchers/default.asp "Marquis Who's Who in Science and Engineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514210217/http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/libraries_researchers/default.asp |date=2008-05-14 }}, [[Marquis Who's Who]], 10th Edition 2008</ref> Isaac was the cousin of [[Irving Abella]].

Isaac Abella was born on June 20, 1934 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. Abella received his Bachelor of Arts degree (1957) from the [[University of Toronto]], Master of Arts (1959) degree, and Ph.D. (1963) in Physics from [[Columbia University]] in New York. He studied under [[Charles H. Townes]]  and was involved in the early research work of laser development. Notably, Abella's thesis under Townes was among the earliest work on [[two-photon absorption]].

He was married to Mary Ann Abella, Professor of Art, Chicago State University.<ref>[http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040527/obit-abella.shtml "Mary Ann Abella"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611013033/http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/040527/obit-abella.shtml |date=2010-06-11 }}, ''Chicago Chronicle'', Vol.23 No.17, 27 May 2004</ref> He has a son Benjamin, and daughter, Sarah.

Abella was known for his work with laser coherent transients, where photon echo techniques are used to probe metastable excited states in rare gas mixtures such as helium, neon, and argon. These states are produced in a weakly ionized RF plasma discharge, and nitrogen-pumped dye lasers are used to generate the coherent super-position states.

He was also known for his work in spectroscopy of rare-earth laser materials. Samples of YLF and [[Yttrium aluminium garnet|YAG]] crystals doped with [[erbium]], [[thulium]], and [[holmium]] are being studied with selective laser excitation in the region of 780&nbsp;nm, the erbium bands. These materials can be efficiently optically pumped by the AlGaAs-GaAs laser diode arrays, but dye laser excitation is used instead. He was interested in the energy transfer process: Er to Tm, to Ho, which concentrates energy emission at 2.085&nbsp;[[µm]] at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen. The process is a radiationless, almost resonant transfer of energy between sites and depends on the relative concentrations of the rare earth ions. In particular his experimental interests are measuring decay rates, excited state absorption, and branching ratios and detailed theories of such processes.<ref name=UoC/>

Isaac Abella died on October 23, 2016 in Chicago, Illinois, at the age of 82.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2016/11/03/isaac-abella-physicist-teacher-and-resident-master-1934-2016|website=UChicago News|access-date=April 6, 2018|date=November 3, 2016|last=Borzo|first=Greg|title=Isaac Abella, physicist, teacher and resident master, 1934-2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406001409/http://news.uchicago.edu/article/2016/11/03/isaac-abella-physicist-teacher-and-resident-master-1934-2016|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-isaac-abella-obit-20161114-story.html|website=Chicago Tribune|access-date=April 6, 2018|date=November 14, 2016|last=Megan|first=Graydon|title=Isaac Abella, University of Chicago physicist who worked with lasers, dies at 82|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406231214/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-isaac-abella-obit-20161114-story.html|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
