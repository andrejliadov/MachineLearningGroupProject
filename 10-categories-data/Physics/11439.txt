{{short description|Propagation of information or matter faster than the speed of light}}
{{Other uses|Faster than the speed of light (disambiguation)}}'''Faster-than-light''' (also '''superluminal''' or '''FTL''') communications and travel are the conjectural propagation of [[information]] or [[matter]] faster than the [[speed of light]].

The [[special theory of relativity]] implies that only particles with zero [[mass in special relativity|rest mass]] may travel at the speed of light. [[Tachyon]]s, particles whose speed exceeds that of light, have been hypothesized, but their existence would violate [[causality (physics)|causality]], and the consensus of physicists is that they cannot exist. On the other hand, what some physicists refer to as "apparent" or "effective" FTL<ref>

According to the current scientific theories, matter is required to travel at '''slower-than-light''' (also '''subluminal''' or '''STL''') speed with respect to the locally distorted spacetime region. Apparent FTL is not excluded by [[general relativity]]; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the [[Alcubierre drive]] and the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].

==Superluminal travel of non-information==
{{main|Superluminal motion}}

In the context of this article, FTL is the transmission of information or matter faster than ''c'', a constant equal to the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, which is 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s (by definition of the meter<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/17/1/|title=The 17th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) : Definition of the metre|website=bipm.org|accessdate=July 5, 2020}}</ref>) or about 186,282.397 miles per second. This is not quite the same as traveling faster than light, since:
*Some processes propagate faster than ''c'', but cannot carry information (see examples in the sections immediately following).
*In some materials where light travels at speed ''c/n'' (where ''n'' is the [[refractive index]]) other particles can travel faster than ''c/n'' (but still slower than ''c''), leading to [[Cherenkov radiation]] (see [[#Phase_velocities_above_c|phase velocity below]]).
Neither of these phenomena violates [[special relativity]] or creates problems with [[causality]], and thus neither qualifies as ''FTL'' as described here.

In the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.

===Daily sky motion===
For an earth-bound observer, objects in the sky complete one revolution around the Earth in one day. [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star outside the [[Solar System]], is about four [[light-year]]s away.<ref name="A2 Student Book">

Comets may have orbits which take them out to more than 1000 [[astronomical unit|AU]].<ref>

===Closing speeds===
The rate at which two objects in motion in a single frame of reference get closer together is called the mutual or closing speed. This may approach twice the speed of light, as in the case of two particles travelling at close to the speed of light in opposite directions with respect to the reference frame.

Imagine two fast-moving particles approaching each other from opposite sides of a [[particle accelerator]] of the collider type. The closing speed would be the rate at which the distance between the two particles is decreasing. From the point of view of an observer standing at rest relative to the accelerator, this rate will be slightly less than twice the speed of light.

[[Special relativity]] does not prohibit this. It tells us that it is wrong to use [[Galilean relativity]] to compute the velocity of one of the particles, as would be measured by an observer traveling alongside the other particle. That is, special relativity gives the correct [[velocity-addition formula]] for computing such [[relative velocity]].

It is instructive to compute the relative velocity of particles moving at ''v'' and −''v'' in accelerator frame, which corresponds to the closing speed of 2''v''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''c''. Expressing the speeds in units of ''c'', β&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c'':
:<math>\beta_\text{rel} = \frac{\beta + \beta}{1 + \beta ^2} = \frac{2\beta}{1 + \beta^2} \leq 1.</math>

===Proper speeds===
If a spaceship travels to a planet one light-year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a [[proper velocity]]. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth at the same time as the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.

===Possible distance away from Earth===
{{Main|Space travel using constant acceleration}}
Since one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then never be able to reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of [[time dilation]], the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1&nbsp;g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the [[speed of light]] (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase the traveler's lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the [[Solar System]] ⁠— but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If they were then to return to Earth, the traveler would arrive on Earth thousands of years into the future. Their travel speed would not have been observed from Earth as being supraluminal ⁠— neither for that matter would it appear to be so from the traveler's perspective– but the traveler would instead have experienced a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And
{{

the Earth will seem to experience much more time passing than the traveler does. So while the traveler's (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed ''c'', their [[proper velocity|proper speed]], or distance traveled from the Earth's point of reference divided by [[proper time]], can be much greater than ''c''. This is seen in statistical studies of [[muon]]s traveling much further than ''c'' times their [[half-life]] (at rest), if traveling close to ''c''.<ref>

The latter association has been shown to be misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information on the pulse does not come faster than ''c'' without this effect.<ref>

There are many galaxies visible in telescopes with [[red shift]] numbers of 1.4 or higher. All of these are currently traveling away from us at speeds greater than the speed of light. Because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can actually be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually.<ref>See the last two paragraphs in {{cite web

===Quantum mechanics===
Certain phenomena in [[quantum mechanics]], such as [[quantum entanglement]], might give the superficial impression of allowing communication of information faster than light. According to the [[no-communication theorem]] these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. [[Wavefunction collapse]] can be viewed as an [[epiphenomenon]] of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and ''all'' of its environment. Since the underlying behavior does not violate local causality or allow FTL communication, it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real ''or'' apparent.

The [[uncertainty principle]] implies that individual photons may travel for short distances at speeds somewhat faster (or slower) than ''c'', even in vacuum; this possibility must be taken into account when enumerating [[Feynman diagram]]s for a particle interaction.<ref>

}}</ref> In quantum mechanics, [[virtual particle]]s may travel faster than light, and this phenomenon is related to the fact that static field effects (which are mediated by virtual particles in quantum terms) may travel faster than light (see section on static fields above). However, macroscopically these fluctuations average out, so that photons do travel in straight lines over long (i.e., non-quantum) distances, and they do travel at the speed of light on average. Therefore, this does not imply the possibility of superluminal information transmission.

There have been various reports in the popular press of experiments on faster-than-light transmission in optics — most often in the context of a kind of [[quantum tunnelling]] phenomenon. Usually, such reports deal with a [[phase velocity]] or [[group velocity]] faster than the vacuum velocity of light.<ref>

For large gaps between the prisms the tunnelling time approaches a constant and thus the photons appear to have crossed with a superluminal speed.<ref name="nimtz1"/>

====Casimir effect====
{{Main|Casimir effect}}

In physics, the [[Casimir–Polder force]] is a physical force exerted between separate objects due to resonance of [[vacuum energy]] in the intervening space between the objects. This is sometimes described in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, owing to the mathematical form of one possible way of calculating the strength of the effect. Because the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is only measurable when the distance between the objects is extremely small. Because the effect is due to virtual particles mediating a static field effect, it is subject to the comments about static fields discussed above.

====EPR paradox====
{{Main|EPR paradox}}

The EPR paradox refers to a famous [[thought experiment]] of [[Albert Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] that was realized experimentally for the first time by [[Alain Aspect]] in 1981 and 1982 in the [[Aspect experiment]]. In this experiment, the measurement of the state of one of the quantum systems of an [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] pair apparently instantaneously forces the other system (which may be distant) to be measured in the complementary state. However, no information can be transmitted this way; the answer to whether or not the measurement actually affects the other quantum system comes down to which [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] one subscribes to.

An experiment performed in 1997 by [[Nicolas Gisin]] has demonstrated non-local quantum correlations between particles separated by over 10 kilometers.<ref>

}}</ref> But as noted earlier, the non-local correlations seen in entanglement cannot actually be used to transmit classical information faster than light, so that relativistic causality is preserved. The situation is akin to sharing a synchronized coin flip, where the second person to flip their coin will always see the opposite of what the first person sees, but neither has any way of knowing whether they were the first or second flipper, without communicating classically. See [[No-communication theorem]] for further information. A 2008 quantum physics experiment also performed by Nicolas Gisin and his colleagues has determined that in any hypothetical [[hidden-variable theory#Non-local hidden-variable theory|non-local hidden-variable theory]], the speed of the [[quantum non-local connection]] (what Einstein called "spooky action at a distance") is at least 10,000 times the speed of light.<ref>

====Delayed choice quantum eraser====
{{Main|Delayed-choice quantum eraser}}

The [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] is a version of the EPR paradox in which the observation (or not) of interference after the passage of a photon through a [[double slit experiment]] depends on the conditions of observation of a second photon entangled with the first. The characteristic of this experiment is that the observation of the second photon can take place at a later time than the observation of the first photon,<ref>

==Superluminal communication==
{{Main|Faster-than-light communication}}
Faster-than-light communication is, according to relativity, equivalent to [[time travel]]. What we measure as the [[speed of light]] in vacuum (or near vacuum) is actually the fundamental physical constant ''c''. This means that all [[inertial]] and, for the coordinate speed of light, non-inertial observers, regardless of their relative [[velocity]], will always measure zero-mass particles such as [[photon]]s traveling at ''c'' in vacuum. This result means that measurements of time and velocity in different frames are no longer related simply by constant shifts, but are instead related by [[Poincaré transformation]]s. These transformations have important implications:
*The relativistic momentum of a [[mass]]ive particle would increase with speed in such a way that at the speed of light an object would have infinite momentum.
*To accelerate an object of non-zero [[mass in special relativity|rest mass]] to ''c'' would require infinite time with any finite acceleration, or infinite acceleration for a finite amount of time.
*Either way, such acceleration requires infinite energy.
*Some observers with sub-light relative motion will disagree about which occurs first of any two events that are separated by a [[spacetime interval|space-like interval]].<ref>

==Justifications==

===Relative permittivity or permeability less than 1===
The [[speed of light]]
:<math> c =\frac {1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}} \ </math>
is related to the [[vacuum permittivity]] ''ε''<sub>0</sub> and the [[vacuum permeability]] ''μ''<sub>0</sub>. Therefore, not only the [[phase velocity]], [[group velocity]], and [[energy flow velocity]] of electromagnetic waves but also the [[velocity]] of a [[photon]] can be faster than ''c'' in a special material that has a constant [[permittivity]] or [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] whose value is less than that in vacuum.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Z.Y.Wang|title=On Faster than Light Photons in Double-Positive Materials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2018|volume=13|issue=6|pages=2273–2276|doi=10.1007/s11468-018-0749-8|s2cid=125787280}}</ref>

===Casimir vacuum and quantum tunnelling===
[[Special relativity]] postulates that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant in [[inertial frame]]s. That is, it will be the same from any frame of reference moving at a constant speed. The equations do not specify any particular value for the speed of the light, which is an experimentally determined quantity for a fixed unit of length. Since 1983, the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of length (the [[meter]]) has been defined using the [[speed of light]].

The experimental determination has been made in vacuum. However, the vacuum we know is not the only possible vacuum which can exist. The vacuum has energy associated with it, called simply the [[vacuum energy]], which could perhaps be altered in certain cases.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the 'zero-point energy' (or 'vacuum energy') in quantum physics? Is it really possible that we could harness this energy? |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/follow-up-what-is-the-zer/ |magazine=Scientific American |date=1997-08-18 |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> When vacuum energy is lowered, light itself has been predicted to go faster than the standard value ''c''. This is known as the [[Scharnhorst effect]]. Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a [[Casimir effect#Vacuum energy|Casimir vacuum]]. Calculations imply that light will go faster in such a vacuum by a minuscule amount: a photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 10<sup>36</sup>.<ref>{{cite web |author=Scharnhorst, Klaus |title=Secret of the vacuum: Speedier light |date=1990-05-12 |accessdate=2009-05-27 |url= http://www.nat.vu.nl/~scharnh/m16scine.htm}}</ref> Accordingly, there has as yet been no experimental verification of the prediction.

However, with multiple pairs of plates in motion relative to one another the authors noted that they had no arguments that could "guarantee the total absence of causality violations", and invoked Hawking's speculative [[chronology protection conjecture]] which suggests that feedback loops of virtual particles would create "uncontrollable singularities in the renormalized quantum stress-energy" on the boundary of any potential time machine, and thus would require a theory of quantum gravity to fully analyze. Other authors argue that Scharnhorst's original analysis, which seemed to show the possibility of faster-than-''c'' signals, involved approximations which may be incorrect, so that it is not clear whether this effect could actually increase signal speed at all.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Fearn, Heidi |doi=10.1134/S1054660X07050155 |journal=Laser Physics |volume=17 |title=Can Light Signals Travel Faster than ''c'' in Nontrivial Vacuua in Flat space-time?

The physicists [[Günter Nimtz]] and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the [[University of Cologne]], claim to have violated relativity experimentally by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light.<ref name="nimtz1">{{cite arXiv |eprint=0708.0681 |author1=Nimtz, Günter |author2=Stahlhofen, Alfons |title=Macroscopic violation of special relativity |class=quant-ph |year=2007}}</ref> They say they have conducted an experiment in which microwave photons — relatively low-energy packets of light — travelled "instantaneously" between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to {{convert|3|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart. Their experiment involved an optical phenomenon known as [[evanescent wave|"evanescent modes"]], and they claim that since evanescent modes have an imaginary wave number, they represent a "mathematical analogy" to [[quantum tunnelling]].<ref name="nimtz1"/> Nimtz has also claimed that "evanescent modes are not fully describable by the [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell equations]] and quantum mechanics have to be taken into consideration."<ref>{{cite book |last=Nimtz |first=G |year=2001 |chapter=Superluminal Tunneling Devices |arxiv=physics/0204043 |doi=10.1142/9789812704634_0019 |journal=The Physics of Communication|pages=339–355 |isbn=978-981-238-449-2|s2cid=14020467 }}</ref> Other scientists such as [[Herbert G. Winful]] and Robert Helling have argued that in fact there is nothing quantum-mechanical about Nimtz's experiments, and that the results can be fully predicted by the equations of [[classical electromagnetism]] (Maxwell's equations).<ref name="winful">{{cite arXiv |title=Comment on "Macroscopic violation of special relativity" by Nimtz and Stahlhofen |eprint=0709.2736 |author=Winful, Herbert G. |date=2007-09-18 |class=quant-ph}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Helling |first=R. |date=20 September 2005|title=Faster than light or not|url=https://atdotde.blogspot.ca/2005/09/faster-than-light-or-not.html|website=atdotde.blogspot.ca}}</ref>

Nimtz told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine: "For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of." However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars from the tail at each station along the way, so that the center of the ever-shrinking main train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.<ref name="nimtz">{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Light seems to defy its own speed limit |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |volume=195 |issue=2617 |page=10 |date=18–24 August 2007 |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/ns-lst081607.php }}</ref>

Winful argues that the train analogy is a variant of the "reshaping argument" for superluminal tunneling velocities, but he goes on to say that this argument is not actually supported by experiment or simulations, which actually show that the transmitted pulse has the same length and shape as the incident pulse.<ref name="winful"/> Instead, Winful argues that the [[group velocity|group delay]] in tunneling is not actually the transit time for the pulse (whose spatial length must be greater than the barrier length in order for its spectrum to be narrow enough to allow tunneling), but is instead the lifetime of the energy stored in a [[standing wave]] which forms inside the barrier. Since the stored energy in the barrier is less than the energy stored in a barrier-free region of the same length due to destructive interference, the group delay for the energy to escape the barrier region is shorter than it would be in free space, which according to Winful is the explanation for apparently superluminal tunneling.<ref name="WinfulHartman">{{cite journal |last=Winful |first=Herbert G. |title=Tunneling time, the Hartman effect, and superluminality: A proposed resolution of an old paradox |journal=Physics Reports |volume=436 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–69 |date=December 2006 |url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/herbert.winful/files/physics_reports_review_article__2006_.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2006.09.002 |bibcode=2006PhR...436....1W |access-date=2010-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218061131/http://sitemaker.umich.edu/herbert.winful/files/physics_reports_review_article__2006_.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="WinfulArticle">For a summary of Herbert G.

===Give up (absolute) relativity===
Because of the strong empirical support for [[special relativity]], any modifications to it must necessarily be quite subtle and difficult to measure. The best-known attempt is [[doubly special relativity]], which posits that the [[Planck length]] is also the same in all reference frames, and is associated with the work of [[Giovanni Amelino-Camelia]] and [[João Magueijo]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Giovanni|last=Amelino-Camelia|date=1 November 2009|arxiv=1003.3942|volume=9|pages=123–170|doi=10.1142/9789814287333_0006|chapter=Doubly-Special Relativity: Facts, Myths and Some Key Open Issues|title = Recent Developments in Theoretical Physics|series = Statistical Science and Interdisciplinary Research|isbn = 978-981-4287-32-6|s2cid=118855372}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Doubly Special Relativity|first=Giovanni|last=Amelino-Camelia|date=1 July 2002|journal=Nature|volume=418|issue=6893|pages=34–35|doi=10.1038/418034a|arxiv=gr-qc/0207049|bibcode=2002Natur.418...34A|pmid=12097897|s2cid=16844423}}</ref>
There are speculative theories that claim inertia is produced by the combined mass of the universe (e.g., [[Mach's principle]]), which implies that the rest frame of the universe might be ''preferred'' by conventional measurements of natural law. If confirmed, this would imply [[special relativity]] is an approximation to a more general theory, but since the relevant comparison would (by definition) be outside the [[observable universe]], it is difficult to imagine (much less construct) experiments to test this hypothesis. Despite this difficulty, such experiments have been proposed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Donald C.|title=Is there a resting frame in the universe?

===Spacetime distortion===
Although the theory of [[special relativity]] forbids objects to have a relative velocity greater than light speed, and [[general relativity]] reduces to special relativity in a local sense (in small regions of spacetime where curvature is negligible), general relativity does allow the space between distant objects to expand in such a way that they have a "[[recession velocity]]" which exceeds the speed of light, and it is thought that galaxies which are at a distance of more than about 14 billion light-years from us today have a recession velocity which is faster than light.<ref name="misconceptions">{{cite magazine |author1=Lineweaver, Charles H. |author2=Davis, Tamara M. |title=Misconceptions about the Big Bang |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2005 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/misconceptions-about-the-2005-03/}}</ref> [[Miguel Alcubierre]] theorized that it would be possible to create a [[Alcubierre drive|warp drive]], in which a ship would be enclosed in a "warp bubble" where the space at the front of the bubble is rapidly contracting and the space at the back is rapidly expanding, with the result that the bubble can reach a distant destination much faster than a light beam moving outside the bubble, but without objects inside the bubble locally traveling faster than light.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alcubierre |first1=Miguel |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |date=1 May 1994 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=L73–L77 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv=gr-qc/0009013 |citeseerx=10.1.1.338.8690 |bibcode=1994CQGra..11L..73A|s2cid=4797900 }}</ref> However, [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|several objections]] raised against the Alcubierre drive appear to rule out the possibility of actually using it in any practical fashion. Another possibility predicted by general relativity is the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]], which could create a shortcut between arbitrarily distant points in space. As with the Alcubierre drive, travelers moving through the wormhole would not ''locally'' move faster than light travelling through the wormhole alongside them, but they would be able to reach their destination (and return to their starting location) faster than light traveling outside the wormhole.

Gerald Cleaver and Richard Obousy, a professor and student of [[Baylor University]], theorized that manipulating the extra spatial dimensions of [[string theory]] around a spaceship with an extremely large amount of energy would create a "bubble" that could cause the ship to travel faster than the speed of light. To create this bubble, the physicists believe manipulating the 10th spatial dimension would alter the [[dark energy]] in three large spatial dimensions: height, width and length. Cleaver said positive dark energy is currently responsible for speeding up the expansion rate of our universe as time moves on.<ref>[https://www.newswise.com//articles/view/543391/ Traveling Faster Than the Speed of Light: A New Idea That Could Make It Happen] Newswise, retrieved on 24 August 2008.</ref>

===Lorentz symmetry violation===
{{Main|Modern searches for Lorentz violation|Standard-Model Extension}}

The possibility that Lorentz symmetry may be violated has been seriously considered in the last two decades, particularly after the development of a realistic effective field theory that describes this possible violation, the so-called [[Standard-Model Extension]].<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=hep-ph/9703464 |bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.6760C |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.6760 |title=CPT violation and the standard model |year=1997 |last1=Colladay |first1=Don |last2=Kostelecký |first2=V.

The breaking of rotation and boost invariance causes direction dependence in the theory as well as unconventional energy dependence that introduces novel effects, including [[Lorentz-violating neutrino oscillations]] and modifications to the dispersion relations of different particle species, which naturally could make particles move faster than light.

In some models of broken Lorentz symmetry, it is postulated that the symmetry is still built into the most fundamental laws of physics, but that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of Lorentz invariance<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kostelecký |first1=V.

If Lorentz symmetry can cease to be a fundamental symmetry at the Planck scale or at some other fundamental scale, it is conceivable that particles with a critical speed different from the speed of light be the ultimate constituents of matter.

In current models of Lorentz symmetry violation, the phenomenological parameters are expected to be energy-dependent. Therefore, as widely recognized,<ref name="CERNCourrier">{{cite web|last=Mavromatos |first=Nick E. |title=Testing models for quantum gravity |work=CERN Courier |url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28696 |date=15 August 2002}}</ref><ref name="NYT">Overbye, Dennis; [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/31/science/interpreting-the-cosmic-rays.html?n=Top/News/Science/Topics/Space ''Interpreting the Cosmic Rays''], The New York Times, 31 December 2002</ref> existing low-energy bounds cannot be applied to high-energy phenomena; however, many searches for Lorentz violation at high energies have been carried out using the [[Standard-Model Extension]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
Lorentz symmetry violation is expected to become stronger as one gets closer to the fundamental scale.

===Superfluid theories of physical vacuum===

In this approach the physical [[vacuum]] is viewed as a quantum [[superfluid]] which is essentially non-relativistic whereas [[Lorentz symmetry]] is not an exact symmetry of nature but rather the approximate description valid only for the small fluctuations of the superfluid background.<ref name="volovik03">{{cite journal |last1=Volovik |first1=G.

==Tachyons==
{{Main|Tachyon}}
In special relativity, it is impossible to accelerate an object {{em|to}} the speed of light, or for a massive object to move {{em|at}} the speed of light. However, it might be possible for an object to exist which {{em|always}} moves faster than light. The hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s with this property are called tachyons or tachyonic particles. Attempts [[tachyonic field|to quantize them]] failed to produce faster-than-light particles, and instead illustrated that their presence leads to an instability.<ref name="Randall">Randall, Lisa; ''Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe's Hidden Dimensions'', p. 286: "People initially thought of tachyons as particles travelling faster than the speed of light...But we now know that a tachyon indicates an instability in a theory that contains it.

==Exotic matter==

Mechanical equations to describe hypothetical [[exotic matter]] which possesses a [[negative mass]], [[negative momentum]], [[pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], and [[negative kinetic energy]] are<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Z.Y. |title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials |journal=Plasmonics |date=2016 |volume=11 |pages=503–508 |doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7 |issue=2|s2cid=122346519 }}</ref>

:<math>p= {m_0 v\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}<0</math>
:<math>E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4</math>

Considering <math>E=\hbar\omega</math> and <math>p=\hbar k</math>, the [[energy-momentum relation]] of the particle is corresponding to the following [[dispersion relation]]
:<math>\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_p^2</math>,    <math>(E_0=\hbar\omega_p=-m_0c^2>0)</math>

of a wave that can propagate in the [[negative-index metamaterial]]. The pressure of [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is negative<ref name="Veselago1">{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode= 1968SvPhU..10..509V}}</ref> and [[negative refraction]], [[inverse Doppler effect]] and [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] imply that the [[momentum]] is also negative. So the wave in a [[negative-index metamaterial]] can be applied to test the theory of [[exotic matter]] and [[negative mass]]. For example, the velocity equals
:<math>v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}-1}</math>
:<math>\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}<2</math>, <math>v<c</math>
:<math>\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}>2</math>, <math>v>c</math>

That is to say, such a wave can break the [[speed of light|light barrier]] under certain conditions.

==General relativity==
[[General relativity]] was developed after [[special relativity]] to include concepts like [[gravity]]. It maintains the principle that no object can accelerate to the speed of light in the reference frame of any coincident observer.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, it permits distortions in [[spacetime]] that allow an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant observer.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} One such [[distortion]] is the [[Alcubierre drive]], which can be thought of as producing a ripple in [[spacetime]] that carries an object along with it. Another possible system is the [[wormhole]], which connects two distant locations as though by a shortcut. Both distortions would need to create a very strong curvature in a highly localized region of space-time and their gravity fields would be immense. To counteract the unstable nature, and prevent the distortions from collapsing under their own 'weight', one would need to introduce hypothetical [[exotic matter]] or negative energy.

General relativity also recognizes that any means of faster-than-light [[travel]] could also be used for [[time travel]]. This raises problems with [[causality]]. Many physicists believe that the above phenomena are impossible and that future theories of [[gravity]] will prohibit them. One theory states that stable wormholes are possible, but that any attempt to use a network of wormholes to violate causality would result in their decay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In [[string theory]], Eric G. Gimon and [[Petr Hořava (theorist)|Petr Hořava]] have argued<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-th/0405019 |title=Over-rotating black holes, Gödel holography and the hypertube |first=Eric G. |last=Gimon |author2=Hořava, Petr |year=2004}}</ref> that in a [[supersymmetric]] five-dimensional [[Gödel metric|Gödel universe]], quantum corrections to general relativity effectively cut off regions of spacetime with causality-violating closed timelike curves. In particular, in the quantum theory a smeared supertube is present that cuts the spacetime in such a way that, although in the full spacetime a closed timelike curve passed through every point, no complete curves exist on the interior region bounded by the tube.
