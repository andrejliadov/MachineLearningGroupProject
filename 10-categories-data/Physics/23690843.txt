{{short description|Rotation independent of any external reference}}
[[File:ArtificialGravity.gif|thumb|Bouncing ball in a rotating space station: The objective reality of the ball bouncing off the outer hull is confirmed both by a [[rotating frame of reference|rotating]] and by a [[inertial system|non-rotating]] observer, hence the rotation of the space station is an "absolute", objective fact regardless of the chosen frame of reference.]]
In [[physics]], the concept of '''absolute rotation'''—[[rotation]] independent of any external reference—is a topic of debate about [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], [[cosmology]], and the nature of [[physical law]]s.

For the concept of absolute rotation to be scientifically meaningful, it must be measurable. In other words, can an observer distinguish between the rotation of an observed object and their own rotation? Newton suggested two experiments to resolve this problem. One is the effects of [[centrifugal force]] upon the shape of the surface of water rotating in a [[bucket argument|bucket]], equivalent to the phenomenon of [[rotational gravity]] used in proposals for [[human spaceflight]].
The second is the effect of centrifugal force upon the tension in a string joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass.

==Classical mechanics==
===Newton's bucket argument===
{{main|Bucket argument}}
{{see|Rotational gravity}}
[[Image:Parabola shape in rotating layers of fluid.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 1: The interface of two [[Miscibility|immiscible]] liquids of different density (a denser colorless liquid and a lighter orange-colored liquid) rotating around a vertical axis is an upward-opening circular paraboloid.]]

Newton suggested the shape of the surface of the water indicates the presence or absence of absolute rotation relative to [[absolute space]]: rotating water has a curved surface, still water has a flat surface. Because rotating water has a concave surface, if the surface you see is concave, and the water does not seem to you to be rotating, then ''you'' are rotating with the water.

Centrifugal force is needed to explain the concavity of the water in a co-rotating frame of reference (one that rotates with the water) because the water appears stationary in this frame, and so should have a flat surface. Thus, observers looking at the stationary water need the centrifugal force to explain why the water surface is concave and not flat. The centrifugal force pushes the water toward the sides of the bucket, where it piles up deeper and deeper, Pile-up is arrested when any further climb costs as much work against gravity as is the energy gained from the centrifugal force, which is greater  at larger radius.

If you need a centrifugal force to explain what you see, then you are rotating. Newton's conclusion was that rotation is absolute.<ref>{{cite book

Other thinkers suggest that pure logic implies only relative rotation makes sense. For example, [[Bishop Berkeley]] and [[Ernst Mach]] (among others) suggested that it is relative rotation with respect to the [[fixed stars]] that matters, and rotation of the fixed stars relative to an object has the same effect as rotation of the object with respect to the fixed stars.<ref name=Ridley>

</ref>  Newton's arguments do not settle this issue; his arguments may be viewed, however, as establishing centrifugal force as a basis for an [[operational definition]] of what we actually mean by absolute rotation.<ref name=Cohen>

Rather than justifying a causal link between rotation and centrifugal effects, Newton's arguments may be viewed as ''defining'' "absolute rotation" by stating a ''procedure'' for its detection and measurement involving centrifugal force.

===Rotating spheres===
{{See also|Rotating spheres}}
[[Image:Rotating spheres.svg|thumb|180px|Figure 2: Two spheres tied with a string and rotating at an angular rate ω. Because of the rotation, the string tying the spheres together is under tension.]]

Newton also proposed another experiment to measure one's rate of rotation: using the tension in a cord joining two spheres rotating about their center of mass. Non-zero tension in the string indicates rotation of the spheres, whether or not the observer thinks they are rotating. This experiment is simpler than the bucket experiment in principle, because it need not involve gravity.

Beyond a simple "yes or no" answer to rotation, one may actually calculate one's rotation. To do that, one takes one's measured rate of rotation of the spheres and computes the tension appropriate to this observed rate. This calculated tension then is compared to the measured tension. If the two agree, one is in a stationary (non-rotating) frame. If the two do ''not'' agree, to obtain agreement, one must include a centrifugal force in the tension calculation; for example, if the spheres appear to be stationary, but the tension is non-zero, the entire tension is due to centrifugal force. From the necessary centrifugal force, one can determine one's speed of rotation; for example, if the calculated tension is greater than measured, one is rotating in the sense opposite to the spheres, and the larger the discrepancy the faster this rotation.

The tension in the wire is the required centripetal force to sustain the rotation. What is experienced by the physically rotating observer is the centripetal force and the physical effect arising from his own inertia. The effect arising from inertia is referred to as [[reactive centrifugal force]].

Whether or not the effects from inertia are attributed to a fictitious centrifugal force is a matter of choice.

In a similar fashion, if we did not know the Earth rotates about its axis, we could infer this rotation from the centrifugal force needed to account for the bulging observed at its equator.<ref name=Ritchie>

In his ''Principia'', [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] proposed the shape of the rotating Earth was that of a homogeneous ellipsoid formed by an equilibrium between the gravitational force holding it together and the centrifugal force pulling it apart. This effect is more easily seen with the planet [[saturn#Physical characteristics|Saturn]] which has a radius 8.5 to 9.5 times that of Earth but has a rotational period of only 10.57 hours.  The ratios of Saturn's diameters is approximately 11 to 10.

[[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac}}</ref>
A modern measurement of the Earth's oblateness leads to an equatorial radius of 6378.14&nbsp;km and a polar radius of 6356.77&nbsp;km,<ref name=Brown>

</ref> about 0.1% less [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] than Newton's estimate.<ref name=Flatness>
This error is the difference in the estimated ratio of diameters. However, a more demanding measure of oblateness is the ''[[flattening]]'', defined as ''f = (a−b)/a'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are the semimajor and semiminor axes. Using the cited numbers, the flattening of Newton's prediction differs by 23% from that of modern estimates.

In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.<ref>{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

It was only in 1743 that [[Alexis Clairaut]], in ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'', was able to show that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct
Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Clairaut|first1 = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions}}</ref> 
However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide a valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

==Special relativity==
{{main|Sagnac experiment}}
French physicist [[Georges Sagnac]] in 1913 conducted an experiment that was similar to the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], which was intended to observe the effects of rotation. Sagnac set up this experiment to prove the existence of the [[luminiferous aether]] that Einstein's 1905 [[theory of special relativity]] had discarded.

The [[Sagnac experiment]] and later similar experiments showed that a stationary object on the surface of the Earth will rotate once every rotation of the Earth when using stars as a stationary reference point.  Rotation was thus concluded to be absolute rather than relative.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==General relativity==
{{see|Mach's principle|Frame-dragging}}
[[Mach's principle]] is the name given by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to a hypothesis often credited to the [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Ernst Mach]].

The idea is that the local motion of a [[rotating reference frame]] is determined by the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe.  Mach's principle says that there is a physical law that relates the motion of the distant stars to the local inertial frame. If you see all the stars whirling around you, Mach suggests that there is some physical law which would make it so you would feel a [[centrifugal force]]. The principle is often stated in vague ways, like "[[mass]] out there influences [[inertia]] here".

The example considered by Einstein was the rotating elastic sphere. Like a rotating planet bulging at the equator, a rotating sphere deforms into an oblate (squashed) [[spheroid]] depending on its rotation. 

In classical mechanics, an explanation of this deformation requires external causes in a frame of reference in the spheroid it is not rotating, and these external causes may be taken as "absolute 
rotation" in classical physics and special relativity.<ref name="Ferraro">{{citation|title=Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|first1=Rafael|last1=Ferraro|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|date=2007|isbn=9780387699462|chapter=Chapter 8: Inertia and Gravity}}</ref> 
In [[general relativity]], no external causes are invoked. The rotation is relative to the local [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]], and since the local geodesics eventually channel information from the [[Distribution of matter in the universe|distant stars]], there appears to be absolute rotation relative to these stars.<ref>{{citation|title=Mach's Principle II|first1=James G.|last1=Gilson|date=September 1, 2004|arxiv=physics/0409010|bibcode = 2004physics...9010G }}</ref>
