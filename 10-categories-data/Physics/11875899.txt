'''AVS: Science and Technology of Materials, Interfaces, and Processing'''<ref name=aip>[https://www.aip.org/ AIP: A Federation of the Physical Sciences], [[American Institute of Physics]].</ref> (formerly '''American Vacuum Society'''<ref>The old name can still be found in [http://avs.org/AVS/files/b4/b4c2d900-5011-4b15-9f98-2ecf23f9f404.pdf Article I of the AVS constitution.]</ref>) is a [[not-for-profit]] [[learned society]] founded in 1953 focused on disciplines related to materials, interfaces, and processing. AVS has approximately 4500 members worldwide from [[academia]], [[government]]al laboratories and [[Private industry|industry]].

AVS is a member society of the [[American Institute of Physics]].<ref name=aip/>  AVS publishes through the American Institute of Physics the
journals ''[[Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology]]'' (JVST A and B) and ''Biointerphases'', which are devoted to [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles, and ''Surface Science Spectra'' (SSS), which publishes peer-reviewed articles with reference spectra of technological and scientific interest. In 2019  [[American Institute of Physics]] and AVS launched jointly a new journal ''AVS Quantum Science''.

==Organization==

AVS is composed of 10 technical divisions, two technical groups, 16 regional chapters, two international chapters and one international affiliate:

*Advanced Surface Engineering Division
*Applied Surface Science Division
*Biomaterial Interfaces Division
*Electronic Materials/Photonics Division
*Magnetic Interfaces and Nanostructures Division
