In relation to [[biomechanics]], the '''aggregate modulus''' (Ha) is a measurement of the stiffness of a material at equilibrium when fluid has ceased flowing through it. The aggregate modulus can be calculated from [[Young's modulus]] (E) and the [[Poisson ratio]] (v).

:<math>
Ha=E(1-v)/[(1+v)(1-2v)]

The aggregate modulus of a similar specimen is determined from a unidirectional ''deformational'' testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero strain component is E<sub>11</sub>, as opposed to the Young's modulus, which is determined from a unidirectional ''loading'' testing configuration, i.e., the only non-zero stress component is, say, in the '''e<sub>1</sub>''' direction.  In this test, the only non-zero component of the stress tensor is T<sub>11</sub>.
