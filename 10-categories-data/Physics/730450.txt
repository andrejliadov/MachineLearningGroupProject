'''''Deutsche Physik''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə fyˈziːk|lang}}, {{lit.}} "German Physics") or '''Aryan Physics''' ({{lang-de|Arische Physik}})  was a [[nationalist]] movement in the [[Germany|German]] [[physics]] community in the early 1930s. A [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] movement, it nonetheless won the support of many eminent physicists in Germany. The term was taken from the title of a four-volume physics textbook by Nobel Laureate [[Philipp Lenard]] in the 1930s.

''Deutsche Physik'' was opposed to the work of [[Albert Einstein]] and other modern theoretically based physics, which was disparagingly labeled "Jewish physics" ({{lang-de|Jüdische Physik}}).

This movement began as an extension of a [[German nationalism|German nationalistic]] movement in the physics community which went back as far as [[World War I]]. On 25 August 1914, during the [[Rape of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]], German troops used petrol to set fire to the library of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamic Of Destruction, Culture and mass killing in the first world war |last=Kramer|first=Alan |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781846140136}}</ref><ref name=gibson>{{cite journal |last=Gibson |first=Craig |title=The culture of destruction in the First World War |journal=Times Literary Supplement |date=January 30, 2008 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article3277792.ece |access-date=2008-02-18}}</ref><ref>[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905105742/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=5 September 2012 }})</ref><ref>Theodore Wesley Koch.

J. Thomson]]. In 1915, this led to a counter-reaction in the form of an "appeal" formulated by [[Wilhelm Wien]] and addressed to German physicists and scientific publishers, which was signed by sixteen German physicists, including [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] and [[Johannes Stark]]. They claimed that German character had been misinterpreted and that attempts made over many years to reach an understanding between the two countries had obviously failed. Therefore, they opposed the use of the English language by German scientific authors, editors of books, and translators.<ref>For the full German text of Wilhelm Wien's ''appeal'' see: ''[[The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science]]'' ([[J. L. Heilbron]], ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], New York 2003, p.&nbsp;419. The ''appeal'' states:

:"Because of the war the relations of scientific circles to the hostile foreign countries will experience a novel regulation. It will in particular concern our relation to England, after the anti-German declaration formulated without any understanding of German character by English scientists has been signed by eight well-known physicists too (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsey, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

:It is herewith proven that the attempts made over many years to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be taken up again within a foreseeable future. The regards which we have taken in the interest of a greater familiarity of the scientific circles of both peoples are no longer justified. Therefore, it is advisable to remove again the unjustified English influence which has penetrated German physics.

:Of course, the purpose cannot be to reject English scientific ideas and stimulations. But the currently criticized predilection for things foreign has influenced also our science so much that it seems required to point this out.

:After this hint we constrain ourselves above all to propose that all physicists should ensure
:# that the mentioning of literature of the English should not, as has currently been the case, find stronger consideration than that of our fellow countrymen;
:# that German physicists no longer publish their treatises in English journals, with the exception of cases where replies are required;
:# that publishers accept only scientific works and translations written in German, and only then if according to the judgment of scientific experts the work is really outstanding;
:# that public money is not spent in order to sponsor translations.

On the German side it  was suggested to avoid an unnecessary use of English language in scientific texts (concerning, e.g., the renaming of German-discovered phenomena with perceived English-derived names, such as "[[X-ray]]" instead of "[[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]] ray"). It was stressed, however,  that this measure should not be misunderstood as a rejection of British scientific thought, ideas and stimulations.

After the war, the perceived affronts of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] kept some of these nationalistic feelings running high, especially in Lenard, who had already complained about England in a small pamphlet at the beginning of the war.<ref>Philipp Lenard, ''England und Deutschland zur Zeit des großen Krieges'' - Geschrieben Mitte August 1914, publiziert im Winter 1914, Heidelberg.</ref> When, on 26 January 1920, the former naval cadet Oltwig von Hirschfeld tried to assassinate German Finance minister [[Matthias Erzberger]], Lenard sent Hirschfeld a telegram of congratulation.<ref>Heinz Eisgruber: ''Völkische und deutsch-nationale Führer'', 1925.</ref> After the 1922 assassination of politician [[Walther Rathenau]], the government ordered flags flown at half mast on the day of his funeral, but Lenard ignored the order at his institute in Heidelberg.

During the early years of the twentieth century, [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] caused bitter controversy within the worldwide physics community. There were many physicists, especially the "old guard", who were suspicious of the intuitive meanings of Einstein's theories. While the response to Einstein was based in part on his concepts being a radical break from earlier theories, there was also an anti-Jewish element to some of the criticism. The leading theoretician of the ''Deutsche Physik'' type of movement  was [[Rudolf Tomaschek]], who had re-edited the famous physics textbook ''Grimsehl's Lehrbuch der Physik''. In that book, which consists of several volumes, the [[Lorentz transformation]] was accepted, as well as [[Old quantum theory|quantum theory]]. However, Einstein's interpretation of the Lorentz transformation was not mentioned, and Einstein's name was completely ignored. Many [[classical physics|classical physicists]] resented Einstein's dismissal of the notion of a [[luminiferous aether]], which had been a mainstay of their work for the majority of their productive lives. They were not convinced by the [[Tests of general relativity|empirical evidence for relativity]]. They believed that the measurements of the [[perihelion]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and the null result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] might be explained in other ways, and the results of the [[Sir Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] [[eclipse]] experiment were experimentally problematic enough to be dismissed as meaningless by the more devoted doubters. Many of them were very distinguished experimental physicists, and Lenard was himself a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate in physics.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

==Under the Third Reich==
[[File:Johannes Stark.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Johannes Stark]]]]

When the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] entered the political scene, Lenard quickly attempted to ally himself with them, joining the party at an early stage. With another [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics Nobel laureate]], [[Johannes Stark]], Lenard began a core campaign to label Einstein's Relativity as ''Jewish Physics''.

Lenard<ref>Philipp Lenard: Ideelle Kontinentalsperre'', München 1940.</ref> and Stark benefited considerably from this Nazi support. Under the rallying cry that physics should be more "German" and "[[Aryan race|Aryan]]," Lenard and Stark embarked on a Nazi-endorsed plan to replace physicists at German universities with "Aryan Physicists". By 1935, though, this campaign was superseded by the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935.  There were no longer any Jewish physics professors in Germany, since under the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were not allowed to work in universities. Stark in particular also tried to install himself as the national authority on "German" physics under the principle of  ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (literally, "coordination") applied to other professional disciplines. Under this Nazi-era paradigm, academic disciplines and professional fields followed a strictly linear [[hierarchy]] created along ideological lines.

The figureheads of "Aryan Physics" met with moderate success, but the support from the Nazi Party was not as great as Lenard and Stark would have preferred. After a long period of harassment of [[Quantum physics|quantum physicist]] [[Werner Heisenberg]], including getting him labeled a "White Jew" in ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'', they began to fall from influence. Heisenberg was not only a pre-eminent physicist whom the Nazis realized they were better off with than without, however "Jewish" his theory might be in the eyes of Stark and Lenard. In a historic moment, Heisenberg's mother rang Himmler's mother and asked her if she would please tell the SS to give "Werner" a break. After beginning a full character evaluation, which Heisenberg both instigated and passed, Himmler forbade further attack on the physicist. Heisenberg would later employ his "Jewish physics" in the [[German nuclear weapons program|German project to develop nuclear fission]] for the purposes of [[nuclear weapons]] or [[nuclear reactor|nuclear energy]] use.  Himmler promised Heisenberg that after Germany won the war, the SS would finance a physics institute to be directed by Heisenberg.<ref>[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]] (1990), ''Himmler'', New York: Henry Holt</ref>

Lenard began to play less and less of a role, and soon Stark ran into even more difficulty, as other scientists and industrialists known for being exceptionally "Aryan" came to the defense of Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. As historian Mark Walker puts it, "despite his best efforts, in the end his science was not accepted, supported, or used by the Third Reich. Stark spent a great deal of his time during the Third Reich fighting with bureaucrats within the National Socialist state. Most of the National Socialist leadership either never supported Lenard and Stark, or abandoned them in the course of the Third Reich."

==Effect on the German nuclear program==
It is occasionally put forth<ref>Einstein: His Life and Universe. Chapter 21: The Bomb</ref> that there is a great irony in the Nazis' labeling modern physics as "Jewish science", since it was exactly modern physics—and the work of many European exiles—which was used to create the [[atomic bomb]].  Even if the German government had not embraced Lenard and Stark's ideas, the German [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] agenda was enough by itself to destroy the Jewish scientific community in Germany. Furthermore, the [[German nuclear weapons program]] was never pursued with anywhere near the vigor of the [[Manhattan Project]] in the [[United States]], and for that reason would likely not have succeeded in any case.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/germany/nuke.htm German Nuclear Weapons]</ref>  The movement did not actually go as far as preventing the nuclear energy scientists from using quantum mechanics and relativity,<ref>Jeremy Bernstein, ''Hitler's Uranium Club, the Secret Recordings at Farm Hall, 2001, Springer-Verlag''</ref> but the education of young scientists and engineers suffered, not only from the loss of the Jewish scientists but also from political appointments and other interference.  In 1938, Himmler wrote to Heisenberg that he could discuss modern physics but not mention Jewish scientists such as [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and Einstein in connection with it.<ref>Thomas Powers, ''Heisenberg's War'', 1993, Alfred A.
