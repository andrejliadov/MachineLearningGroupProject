Geometrical frustration occurs when a set of [[degrees of freedom]] is incompatible with the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] it occupies.

A purely [[geometry|geometric]] example of this is the impossibility of close-packing [[pentagon]]s in [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]. Another is atomic [[magnetic moment]]s with [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] interactions. These [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] lower their [[interaction energy]] by pointing [[antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] to their neighbors.

In the case of two dimensional space, the [[triangular lattice]] is the simplest example of such frustration. With a triangular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]], the two spins can easily accommodate two sides, but the third spin is frustrated. If this third spin is up, then two arrangements out of the three are compatible, but one is incompatible. This leads to a huge degeneracy in the [[ground state]] with non-zero [[entropy]]. This frustration leads to breaking [[symmetry]], which leads to [[ferroelectricity]].
