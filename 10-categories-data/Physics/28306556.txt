The '''Arctowski Medal''' is awarded by the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]  "for studies in [[solar physics]] and solar-terrestrial relationships." Named in honor of [[Henryk Arctowski]], it was first awarded in 1969.<ref name="nas">{{cite web | url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/arctowski-medal.html | title=Arctowski Medal | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>

* [[Michelle F. Thomsen]] (2019) - For her fundamental contributions to our understanding of the relationships between the sun and its planetary bodies, with a particular emphasis on the physics of collisionless shocks and the dynamics of the planetary magnetospheres of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn.
*[[Mats Carlsson]] and [[Viggo Hansteen]] (2017) - For their investigations in radiative transfer, magneto-hydro-dynamics, and plasma physics that has resulted in major advances in chromospheric diagnostics and our understanding of the physical mechanisms that drive chromospheric and coronal dynamics and energetics through the development and use of the Bifrost numerical model of the sun's atmosphere.
*[[Alexander J. Dessler]] (2015) - For his notable imagination in framing many of space science's most basic conceptions about the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and their interactions with the magnetospheres of Earth and other planets at the beginning of the Space Age.
