{{short description|Historical website}}
'''TIPTOP''' was a [[web site]] operated in collaboration between Kenneth Bodin-Holmlund at [[Umeå University]], Mikko Karttunen at [[McGill University]] and Guenther Nowotny at the [[Technical University of Vienna]] during 1994–1998, and it was originally derived from Physics Around the World (PAW) that was initiated by Karttunen at [[McGill University]].

In a historical perspective, PAW was one of the first web directories, listing various physics related resources. TIPTOP utilized (at the time) new technologies to handle a news system, a job database, a conference database, and an improved [[web directory]] for physics. TIPTOP was the first major site to use [[PHP]] with [[mySQL]], today a highly popular combination. Already in 1995, TIPTOP also had one of the first embryos of a [[wiki]], called the Living Encyclopedia of Physics, that offered community based-editing, an editorial system and peer review, as well as automatic cross linking.
