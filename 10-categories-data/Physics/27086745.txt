'''Frame-dragging''' is an effect on [[spacetime]], predicted by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], that is due to non-static stationary distributions of [[mass–energy]]. A stationary [[Field (physics)|field]] is one that is in a steady state, but the masses causing that field may be non-static ⁠— rotating, for instance. More generally, the subject that deals with the effects caused by mass–energy currents is known as [[gravitomagnetism]], which is analogous to the magnetism of [[classical electromagnetism]].

The first frame-dragging effect was derived in 1918, in the framework of general relativity, by the Austrian physicists [[Josef Lense]] and [[Hans Thirring]], and is also known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |date=1918 |title=Über die Wirkung rotierender ferner Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |page=33 |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19...33T }} [On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |date=1921 |title=Berichtigung zu meiner Arbeit: 'Über die Wirkung rotierender Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie' |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=22 |page=29 |bibcode=1921PhyZ...22...29T }} [Correction to my paper "On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation"]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Lense |first=J. |author2=Thirring, H. |date=1918 |title=Über den Einfluss der Eigenrotation der Zentralkörper auf die Bewegung der Planeten und Monde nach der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |pages=156–163 |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19..156L}} [On the Influence of the Proper Rotation of Central Bodies on the Motions of Planets and Moons According to Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]</ref> They predicted that the rotation of a massive object would distort the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]], making the orbit of a nearby test particle [[precess]]. This does not happen in [[Newtonian mechanics]] for which the [[gravitational field]] of a body depends only on its mass, not on its rotation. The Lense–Thirring effect is very small – about one part in a few trillion. To detect it, it is necessary to examine a very massive object, or build an instrument that is very sensitive.

In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124053|title = General-relativistic rotation laws in rotating fluid bodies|journal = Physical Review D|volume = 91|issue = 12|pages = 124053|year = 2015|last1 = Mach|first1 = Patryk|last2 = Malec|first2 = Edward|bibcode = 2015PhRvD..91l4053M|arxiv = 1501.04539|s2cid = 118605334}}</ref>

==Effects==
'''Rotational frame-dragging''' (the [[Lense–Thirring effect]]) appears in the [[general principle of relativity]] and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects. Under the Lense–Thirring effect, the frame of reference in which a clock ticks the fastest is one which is revolving around the object as viewed by a distant observer. This also means that light traveling in the direction of rotation of the object will move past the massive object faster than light moving against the rotation, as seen by a distant observer. It is now the best known frame-dragging effect, partly thanks to the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of [[electromagnetic induction]].

Also, an inner region is dragged more than an outer region. This produces interesting locally rotating frames. For example, imagine that a north–south-oriented ice skater, in orbit over the equator of a rotating black hole and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be "torqued" spinward due to gravitomagnetic induction ("torqued" is in quotes because gravitational effects are not considered "forces" under [[General relativity|GR]]). Likewise the arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. There exists a particular rotation rate that, should she be initially rotating at that rate when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her rate of rotation will not change. Due to the [[equivalence principle]], gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. This effect is analogous to the [[hyperfine structure]] in atomic spectra due to nuclear spin. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. See [[Mach's principle]].

Another interesting consequence is that, for an object constrained in an equatorial orbit, but not in freefall, it weighs more if orbiting anti-spinward, and less if orbiting spinward. For example, in a suspended equatorial bowling alley, a bowling ball rolled anti-spinward would weigh more than the same ball rolled in a spinward direction. Note, frame dragging will neither accelerate nor slow down the bowling ball in either direction. It is not a "viscosity". Similarly, a stationary [[plumb-bob]] suspended over the rotating object will not list. It will hang vertically. If it starts to fall, induction will push it in the spinward direction.

'''Linear frame dragging''' is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to [[linear momentum]]. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the "rotational" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).<ref>Einstein, A ''[[The Meaning of Relativity]]'' (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures).</ref>

'''Static mass increase''' is a third effect noted by Einstein in the same paper.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Relativity |last=Einstein |first=A. |date=1987 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |pages=95–96 }}</ref> The effect is an increase in [[inertia]] of a body when other masses are placed nearby. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. It is also a tiny effect that is difficult to confirm experimentally.

Limiting the scope to the scenarios involving existing orbiting bodies, the first proposal to use the LAGEOS satellite and the Satellite Laser Ranging ([[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]]) technique to measure the Lense–Thirring effect dates back to 1977–1978.<ref>{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1978A&A....69..321C|title = Relativistic Effects on the Motion of Earth's Artificial Satellites|journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 69|pages = 321|last1 = Cugusi|first1 = L.|last2 = Proverbio|first2 = E.|year = 1978}}</ref> Tests have started to be effectively performed by using the LAGEOS and [[LAGEOS II]] satellites in 1996,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF02731140|title = Measurement of dragging of inertial frames and gravitomagnetic field using laser-ranged satellites|journal = Il Nuovo Cimento A|volume = 109|issue = 5|pages = 575–590|year = 1996|last1 = Ciufolini|first1 = I.|last2 = Lucchesi|first2 = D.|last3 = Vespe|first3 = F.|last4 = Mandiello|first4 = A.|bibcode = 1996NCimA.109..575C|s2cid = 124860519}}</ref> according to a strategy<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF02773551|title = On a new method to measure the gravitomagnetic field using two orbiting satellites|journal = Il Nuovo Cimento A|volume = 109|issue = 12|pages = 1709–1720|year = 1996|last1 = Ciufolini|first1 = I.|bibcode = 1996NCimA.109.1709C|s2cid = 120415056}}</ref> involving the use of a suitable combination of the nodes of both satellites and the perigee of LAGEOS II.

In the case of stars orbiting close to a spinning, supermassive black hole, frame dragging should cause the star's orbital plane to [[Lense–Thirring precession|precess]] about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable within the next few years via [[astrometry|astrometric]] monitoring of stars at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Merritt|first1=D.|last2=Alexander|first2=T.|last3=Mikkola|first3=S.|last4=Will|first4=C.|author-link=David Merritt|title=Testing Properties of the Galactic Center Black Hole Using Stellar Orbits|journal=Physical Review D|volume=81|issue=6|pages=062002|year=2010|bibcode=2010PhRvD..81f2002M|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.062002|arxiv=0911.4718|s2cid=118646069}}</ref>

\left( 1 - \frac{r_{s} r}{\rho^{2}} \right) c^{2} dt^{2}

where ''r''<sub>''s''</sub> is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild radius]]

:<math>
r_{s} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}
</math>

and where the following shorthand variables have been introduced for brevity

:<math>
\alpha = \frac{J}{Mc}
</math>

:<math>
\rho^{2} = r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \cos^{2} \theta\,\!
</math>

:<math>
\Lambda^{2} = r^{2} - r_{s} r + \alpha^{2}\,\!
</math>

In the non-relativistic limit where ''M'' (or, equivalently, ''r''<sub>''s''</sub>) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]]

\left( g_{tt} - \frac{g_{t\phi}^{2}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2}

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius ''r'' and the [[colatitude]] ''θ''

:<math>
\Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_{s} \alpha r c}{\rho^{2} \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \right) + r_{s} \alpha^{2} r \sin^{2}\theta}
</math>

In the plane of the equator this simplifies to:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tartaglia |first=A. |date=2008 |title=Detection of the gravitometric clock effect |journal= Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume= 17|issue= 4|pages= 783–792|arxiv=gr-qc/9909006|bibcode = 2000CQGra..17..783T |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/17/4/304 |s2cid=9356721 }}</ref>

:<math>
\Omega = \frac{r_{s} \alpha c}{r^{3} + \alpha^{2} r + r_{s} \alpha^{2}}
</math>

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is frame-dragging.

An extreme version of frame dragging occurs within the [[ergosphere]] of a rotating [[black hole]]. The Kerr metric has two surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to a spherical [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs at

:<math>
r_\text{inner} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2}}}{2}
</math>

where the purely radial component ''g<sub>rr</sub>'' of the metric goes to infinity. The outer surface can be approximated by an [[oblate spheroid]] with lower spin parameters, and resembles a pumpkin-shape<ref name=visser /><ref name=blundell /> with higher spin parameters. It touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude ''θ'' equals 0 or π; its radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is defined by the formula

:<math>
r_\text{outer} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2} \cos^{2}\theta}}{2}
</math>

where the purely temporal component ''g<sub>tt</sub>'' of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. The space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g<sub>tt</sub>'' is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of Ω. However, as seen above, frame-dragging occurs about every rotating mass and at every radius ''r'' and colatitude ''θ'', not only within the ergosphere.

===Lense–Thirring effect inside a rotating shell===
The [[Lense–Thirring effect]] inside a rotating shell was taken by [[Albert Einstein]] as not just support for, but a vindication of [[Mach's principle]], in a letter he wrote to [[Ernst Mach]] in 1913 (five years before Lense and Thirring's work, and two years before he had attained the final form of [[general relativity]]). A reproduction of the letter can be found in [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, Wheeler]].<ref name=mtw>Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''Gravitation'', Figure 21.5, page 544</ref> The general effect scaled up to cosmological distances, is still used as a support for Mach's principle.<ref name=mtw/>

Inside a rotating spherical shell the acceleration due to the Lense–Thirring effect would be<ref name=phister>{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=Herbert |date=2005 |title=On the history of the so-called Lense–Thirring effect |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1735–1748 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0521-4 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002681/ |bibcode = 2007GReGr..39.1735P |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.4061 |s2cid=22593373 }}</ref>

where the coefficients are

:<math>\begin{align}
d_1 &= \frac{4MG}{3Rc^2} \\
d_2 &= \frac{4MG}{15Rc^2}

for ''MG'' ≪ ''Rc''<sup>2</sup> or more precisely,

: <math>
d_1 = \frac{4 \alpha(2 - \alpha)}{(1 + \alpha)(3- \alpha)}, \qquad \alpha=\frac{MG}{2Rc^2}

The spacetime inside the rotating spherical shell will not be flat. A flat spacetime inside a rotating mass shell is possible if the shell is allowed to deviate from a precisely spherical shape and the mass density inside the shell is allowed to vary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=H. |date=1985 |title=Induction of correct centrifugal force in a rotating mass shell |journal= Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=909–918 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/2/6/015 |bibcode = 1985CQGra...2..909P |display-authors=etal}}</ref>
