'''''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte''''' (''Research Reports in Nuclear Physics'') was an internal publication of the German ''[[German nuclear energy project|Uranverein]]'', which was initiated under the ''[[Heereswaffenamt]]'' (Army Ordnance Office) in 1939; in 1942, supervision of the ''Uranverein'' was turned over to the [[Reichsforschungsrat]] under the [[Reichserziehungsministerium]].  Reports in this publication were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies.  The reports were confiscated under the Allied [[Operation Alsos]] and sent to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] for evaluation.  In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. Many of the reports are available at the [[Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[Niels Bohr]] Library of the [[American Institute of Physics]]. Many of them are reprinted and transcribed in the book 
"''Collected Works / Gesammelte Werke''" listed below which is available in most libraries. There are reports numbered G-1 to G-395.<ref>Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E and Appendix B; see the entries for ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte'' and ''Heereswaffenamt'', respectively.</ref><ref>Walker, 1993, 268.</ref>

Prominent German scientists who published reports in ''Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte'' as members of the ''Uranverein''<ref>Walker, 1993, 268-274 and Reference #40 on p. 262.</ref> can be grouped as follows:
