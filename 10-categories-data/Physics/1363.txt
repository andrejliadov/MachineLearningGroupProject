'''André-Marie Ampère''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɑ̃|p|ɛər|,_|æ|m|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|æ|m|p|ɪər}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ampere "Ampère"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]].''</ref> {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃pɛʁ|lang}}; 20 January 1775{{snd}}10 June 1836)<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofsci001gill|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=United States of America}}</ref> was a [[French people|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who was one of the founders of the science of [[classical electromagnetism]], which he referred to as "electrodynamics". He is also the inventor of numerous applications, such as the [[solenoid]] (a term coined by him) and the [[electrical telegraph]]. An [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]], Ampère was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and professor at the [[École polytechnique]] and the [[Collège de France]].

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of measurement of [[electric current]], the [[ampere]], is named after him. His name is also one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed]] on the [[Eiffel Tower]].

==Early life==
André-Marie Ampère was born on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques Ampère a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desutières-Sarcey Ampère, during the height of the [[French Enlightenment]]. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at [[Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or]] near Lyon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Andre-Marie_Ampere |title=Andre-Marie Ampere |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |access-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> Jean-Jacques Ampère, a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise [[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]) were the basis of Ampère's education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an "education direct from nature." Ampère's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as [[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon|Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon]]'s ''Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière'' (begun in 1749) and [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Ampère's schoolmasters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his [[Latin]] lessons, which enabled him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ampère, André Marie|volume=1|pages=878–879}}</ref>

==French Revolution==
In addition, Ampère used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12. In later life Ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew, but as a [[polymath]], his reading embraced history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences.<ref name="EB1911"/> His mother was a devout woman, so Ampère was also initiated into the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] along with Enlightenment science. The [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that began during his youth was also influential: Ampère's father was called into [[Civil service|public service]] by the new revolutionary government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://simplyknowledge.com/popular/biography/andre-marie-ampere |title=Biography of Andre Marie Ampere|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref> becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near Lyon. When the [[Jacobin]] faction seized control of the Revolutionary government in 1792, his father Jean-Jacques Ampère resisted the new political tides, and he was [[guillotine]]d on 24 November 1793, as part of the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin purges]] of the period.

In 1796 Ampère met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. André-Marie Ampère took his first regular job in 1799 as a [[mathematics]] teacher, which gave him the financial security to marry Carron and father his first child, [[Jean-Jacques Ampère|Jean-Jacques]] (named after his father), the next year. (Jean-Jacques Ampère eventually achieved his own fame as a scholar of languages.) Ampère's maturation corresponded with the transition to the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic regime]] in France, and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new French [[Napoleon|First Consul]]. In 1802 Ampère was appointed a professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at the École Centrale in [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son [[Jean-Jacques Ampère|Jean-Jacques Antoine Ampère]] in Lyon. He used his time in Bourg to research mathematics, producing ''Considérations sur la théorie mathématique de jeu'' (1802; "Considerations on the Mathematical Theory of Games"), a treatise on [[Probability theory|mathematical probability]] that he sent to the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]] in 1803.

==Teaching career==
[[File:Ampère - Essai sur la philosophie des sciences, 1838 - 3912601 323893 1 00011.tif|thumb|''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences'']]
After the death of his wife in July 1803, Ampère moved to [[Paris]], where he began a tutoring post at the new [[École Polytechnique]] in 1804. Despite his lack of formal qualifications, Ampère was appointed a professor of mathematics at the school in 1809. As well as holding positions at this school until 1828, in 1819 and 1820 Ampère offered courses in [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]], respectively, at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1824 he was elected to the prestigious chair in [[experimental physics]] at the [[Collège de France]]. In 1814 Ampère was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new ''Institut Impérial'', the umbrella under which the reformed state Academy of Sciences would sit.

Ampère engaged in a diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy—writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy, which was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day. Ampère claimed that "at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life, his [[First Communion]], the reading of Antoine Leonard Thomas's "Eulogy of Descartes", and the [[Taking of the Bastille]]. On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the [[Psalm]]s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.' In times of duress he would take refuge in the reading of the [[Bible]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]]."<ref>{{cite web | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01437c.htm| access-date = 29 December 2007 }}</ref>

For a time he took into his family the young student [[Frédéric Ozanam]] (1813–1853), one of the founders of the [[Conference of Charity]], later known as the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]]. Through Ampère, Ozanam had contact with leaders of the neo-Catholic movement, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], and [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]]. Ozanam was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1998.

==Work in electromagnetism==

In September 1820, Ampère's friend and eventual eulogist [[François Arago]] showed the members of the French Academy of Sciences the surprising discovery of [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] that a [[Compass|magnetic needle]] is deflected by an adjacent [[electric current]]. Ampère began developing a mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. Furthering Ørsted's experimental work, Ampère showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively - this laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results. The most important of these was the principle that came to be called [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]], which states that the mutual action of two lengths of current-carrying wire is proportional to their lengths and to the intensities of their currents. Ampère also applied this same principle to magnetism, showing the harmony between his law and French physicist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]]'s law of magnetic action. Ampère's devotion to, and skill with, experimental techniques anchored his science within the emerging fields of experimental physics.

Ampère also provided a physical understanding of the electromagnetic relationship, theorizing the existence of an "electrodynamic molecule" (the forerunner of the idea of the [[electron]]) that served as the component element of both electricity and magnetism. Using this physical explanation of electromagnetic motion, Ampère developed a physical account of electromagnetic phenomena that was both empirically demonstrable and mathematically predictive. In 1827 Ampère published his magnum opus, ''Mémoire sur la théorie mathématique des phénomènes électrodynamiques uniquement déduite de l’experience'' (Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience), the work that coined the name of his new science, ''electrodynamics'', and became known ever after as its founding treatise.

In 1827 Ampère was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] and in 1828, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27ampere%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|access-date = 13 March 2012}}</ref>

===Legacy===
In recognition of his contribution to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]] as a standard unit of electrical measurement, along with the [[coulomb]], [[volt]], [[ohm]], and [[watt]], which are named, respectively, after Ampère's contemporaries [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] of France, [[Alessandro Volta]] of [[Italy]], [[Georg Ohm]] of [[Germany]], and [[James Watt]] of [[Scotland]]. Ampère's name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

Several items are named after Ampère; many streets and [[Place Ampère|squares]], [[Collège-lycée Ampère|schools]], a [[List of Lyon Metro stations#Line A|Lyon metro station]], a [[List of mountains on the Moon|mountain on the moon]] and an [[Electric boat#Types|electric ferry]] in Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/batterifergen-har-mattet-sta-over-avganger-na-er-losningen-klar/364633 |title=Batterifergen har måttet stå over avganger.
