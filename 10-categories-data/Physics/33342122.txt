The '''Solar Physics Division''' of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS/SPD) or (AAS-SPD), often referred to as simply the "Solar Physics Division" (SPD), is the primary trade organization of [[solar physicist]]s in the [[United States|U.S.]] It exists for the advancement of the study of the [[Sun]] and to coordinate of such research with other branches of science.  SPD organizes meetings and certain solar-physics-specific prizes, occasionally advocates for solar physics in the political arena, and promotes outreach via formal and informal educational projects.

The SPD awards the [[George Ellery Hale Prize]] for outstanding contributions over an extended period of time to solar astronomy, and the [[Karen Harvey Prize]] for a significant contribution to the study of the Sun early in a scientist's professional career.<ref name="Boswell Service 2013">{{cite web | last=Boswell | first=Evelyn | last2=| first2=| title=Canfield wins major solar physics award | website=[[Montana State University]] |publisher=MSU News Service|date=17 January 2013  | url=http://www.montana.edu/news/11693/canfield-wins-major-solar-physics-award | accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref> The SPD also gives popular writing awards, and holds a student poster contest at its meetings.<!--<ref name="USC News 2014"/>--> Contestants are judged on readability, flow, quality of appearance and proportion of independent work done by the student. Judges also take into account the oral presentation by the student, how well the conclusions line up with the aim or purpose and the overall quality of the work.<ref name="USC News 2014">{{cite web | title=Solar physicistâ€™s Mount Wilson work shines brightly | website=USC News | date=30 July 2014  | url=https://news.usc.edu/66598/solar-physicists-mount-wilson-work-shines-brightly/ | accessdate=8 February 2015|last=Johnson|first=Pamela}}</ref>
