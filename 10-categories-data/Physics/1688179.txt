[[Materials science]] has shaped the development of civilizations since the dawn of mankind. Better materials for tools and weapons has allowed mankind to spread and conquer, and advancements in material processing like steel and aluminum production continue to impact society today. Historians have regarded materials as such an important aspect of civilizations such that entire periods of time have defined by the predominant material used ([[Stone Age]], [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], etc.). For most of recorded history, control of materials had been through alchemy or empirical means at best. The study and development of chemistry and physics assisted the study of materials, and eventually the interdisciplinary study of materials science emerged from the fusion of these studies.<ref name="Book">{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf E.|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-26691-6|edition=2nd}}</ref> The '''history of materials science''' is the study of how different materials were used and developed through the history of Earth and how those materials affected the culture of the peoples of the Earth. The term "[[Silicon Age]]" is sometimes used to refer to the modern period of history during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.

==Prehistory==
[[File:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Flint axe, about 31 cm long.]]

In many cases different cultures leave their materials as the only records which [[anthropologists]] can use to define the existence of such cultures.  The progressive use of more sophisticated materials allows archeologists to characterize and distinguish between peoples.  This is partially due to the major material of use in a culture and to its associated benefits and drawbacks.  [[Stone-Age]] cultures were limited by which rocks they could find locally and by which they could acquire by trading.  The use of [[flint]] around 300,000 BCE is sometimes{{when|date=October 2015}} considered the beginning of the use of [[ceramic]]s. The use of polished [[stone axe]]s marks a significant advance because a much wider variety of rocks could serve as tools.

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|left|150px|A late [[Bronze Age sword]]- or dagger-blade.]]

The innovation of smelting and casting metals in the [[Bronze Age]] started to change the way that cultures developed and interacted with each other.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Starting around 5500 BCE, early [[metalsmith|smith]]s began to re-shape [[native metal]]s of [[copper]] and [[gold]] - without the use of fire - for tools and weapons.  The heating of copper and its shaping with hammers began around 5000 BCE.  Melting and casting started around 4000 BCE.  [[Metallurgy]] had its dawn with the reduction of copper from its ore around 3500 BCE.  The first [[alloy]], [[bronze]] came into use around 3000 BCE.

==Stone Age==
The use of materials begins in the Stone Age. Typically materials such as bone, fibers, feathers, shells, animal skin, and clay were used for weapons, tools, jewelry, and shelter. The earliest tools were in the paleolithic age, called [[Oldowan]]. These were tools created from chipped rocks that would be used for scavenging purpose. As history carried on into the Mesolithic age, tools became more complex and symmetrical in design with sharper edges. Moving into the Neolithic age, agriculture began to develop as new was to form tools for farming were discovered.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Violatti|first1=Christian|title=Stone Age|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia}}</ref> Nearing the end of the Stone Age, humans began using copper, gold, and silver as a material. Due to these metals softness, the general use was for ceremonial purposes and to create ornaments or decorations and did not replace other materials for use in tools. The simplicity of the tools used reflected on the simple understanding of the human species of the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science History, Properties, Applications|date=2005|pages=1–2}}</ref>

==Bronze Age==
The use of copper had become very apparent to civilizations, such as its properties of elasticity and plasticity that allow it to be hammered into useful shapes, along with its ability to be melted and poured into intricate shapes. Although the advantages of copper were many, the material was too soft to find large scale usefulness. Through experimentation or by chance, additions to copper lead to increased hardness of a new metal alloy, called bronze.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hummel|first1=Rolf|title=Understanding Materials Science: History, Properties, Application|page=66}}</ref> Bronze was originally composed of copper and arsenic, forming arsenic bronze.
<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tylecote|first1=R.F|title=History of Metallurgy, Second Edition|publisher=London: Manley Publishing, for the institute of metals}}</ref>

==Iron Age==
[[Iron]]-working came into prominence from about 1200 BCE.

In the 10th century BCE [[glass]] production began in [[ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd century BCE people in [[History of India|ancient India]] developed [[wootz steel]], the first [[crucible steel]]. In the 1st century BCE [[glassblowing]] techniques flourished in [[Phoenicia]]. In the 2nd century CE [[steel]]-making became widespread in [[Han Dynasty]] China. The 4th century CE saw the production of the [[Iron pillar of Delhi]], the oldest surviving example of corrosion-resistant steel.

==Antiquity==

[[Wood]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[earth]] are some of the materials which formed the structures of the [[Roman Empire]]. Certain structures were made possible by the character of the land upon which these structures are built. Romans mixed powdered limestone, volcanic ash found from Mount Vesuvius, and water to make a cement paste.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carter|first=Barry|title=Ceramic Materials|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4614-3523-5|pages=17–34}}</ref> A volcanic peninsula with stone aggregates and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] containing [[crystal]]line material will produce material which weathers differently from soft, sedimentary rock and silt. With the discovery of cement paste, structures could be built with irregular shaped stones and have the binder fill the voids to create a solid structure. The cement gains strength as it [[Hydrate|hydrates]], thus creating a stronger bond over time. With the fall of the west [[Roman Empire]] and the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzans]], this knowledge was mostly lost except to the catholic monks who were among the few who could read Vitruvius’ Latin and make use of the concrete paste.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Idorn|first=G.

The use of [[asbestos]] as a material blossomed in [[Ancient Greece]], especially when the fireproofing qualities of the material came to light. Many scholars believe the word asbestos comes from a Greek term, sasbestos, meaning inextinguishable or unquenchable.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The History of Asbestos - Importing, Exporting & Worldwide Use|url=https://www.asbestos.com/asbestos/history/|website=Mesothelioma Center - Vital Services for Cancer Patients & Families|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>  Clothes for nobles, table clothes and other oven adornments were all furnished with a weave of the fibrous materials, as the materials could be cleansed by throwing them directly into fire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=R|date=June 1990|title=Asbestos: a chronology of its origins and health effects.|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=47|issue=6|pages=361–365|doi=10.1136/oem.47.6.361|issn=0007-1072|pmc=1035183|pmid=2088320}}</ref> The use of this material however was not without its downsides, [[Pliny the Elder]], noted a link between the quick death of slaves to work in the asbestos mine. He recommended that slaves working in this environment use the skin of a blabber as a makeshift [[respirator]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greeks, Romans and Asbestos (a brief history of…)|url=https://rear-view-mirror.com/2013/08/06/greeks-romans-and-asbestos-a-brief-history-of/|date=2013-08-06|website=Rearview Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref>

After the [[thigh]][[bone]] [[dagger]]s of the early [[hunter-gatherer]]s were superseded by wood and stone axes, and then by [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[iron]] implements of the Roman civilization, more precious materials could then be sought, and gathered together. Thus the [[medieval]] goldsmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]] could seek and defend the gold which he had to turn into objects of desire for [[duke]]s and [[pope]]s. ''[[The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini]]'' contains one of the first descriptions of a metallurgical process.

The use of [[Cork (material)|cork]], which has been recently added to the category of materials science, had its first mentions beginning with [[Horace]], Pliny, and [[Plutarch]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Ashby|first=Mike|date=September 2008|title=Materials-A Brief History|journal=Philosophical Magazine Letters|volume=88|issue=9|pages=749–755|doi=10.1080/09500830802047056|bibcode=2008PMagL..88..749A|s2cid=137312591|via=EBSCO Publishing}}</ref> It had many uses in antiquity including in fishing and safety devices because of its buoyancy, an engraving medium, sandal soles to increase stature, container stoppers, and being an insulator.

In the Ancient Roman Era glassblowing became an art involving the additions of decor and tints. They were also able to created complex shapes due to the use of a mold. This technology allowed the to imitate gemstones.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Gnesin|first=G.

Polymeric composites also made an appearance during this time frame in the form of [[wood]]. By 80 BC petrified [[resin]] and [[keratin]] were used in accessories as [[amber]] and tortoise shell respectively.<ref name=":1" />

In Alexandria in the first century BC [[Glassblowing|glass blowing]] was developed in part due to new furnaces that could create higher temperatures by using a clay coated reed pipe.<ref name=":02"/> Plant ash and natron glass, the latter being the primary component, were used in blown pieces. Coastal and semi desert plants worked best due to their low [[magnesium oxide]] and [[potassium oxide]] content.

==Middle Ages==

Proto-porcelain material has been discovered dating back to the Neolithic period, with shards of material found in archaeological sites from the Eastern Han period in China.  These wares are estimated to have been fired from 1260 to 1300&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Li|first1=He|title=Chinese ceramics : the new standard guide|date=1996|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-23727-4}}</ref> In the 8th century, [[porcelain]] was invented in [[Tang Dynasty]] China.

During the Early Middle Ages the technique of creating windows steered more towards glass blowing non-tinted balls that were later flattened but then in the late Middle Ages the methodology returned to that from antiquity with a few minor adjustments which included rolling with metallic rollers.<ref name=":02"/>

In the 9th century, [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]] were invented in [[Iraq]],<ref name=Mason/> and [[lustreware]] appeared in [[Mesopotamia]].<ref>pp. 86–87, ''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}.</ref>

In the 11th century, [[Damascus steel]] is developed in the [[Middle East]]. In the 15th century, [[Johann Gutenberg]] develops [[type metal]] alloy and Angelo Barovier invents [[cristallo]], a clear soda-based glass.

==Early modern period==
In the 16th century, [[Vannoccio Biringuccio]] publishes his Pirotechnia, the first systematic book on [[metallurgy]], [[Georg Agricola]] writes De Re Metallica, an influential book on [[metallurgy]] and [[mining]], and glass [[lens (optics)|lens]] are developed in the [[Netherlands]] and used for the first time in [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s.

In the 17th century, [[Galileo]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' ([[strength of materials]] and [[kinematics]]) includes the first quantitative statements in the science of materials. In the 18th century, [[William Champion (metallurgist)|William Champion]] patents a process for the production of metallic [[zinc]] by [[distillation]] from [[calamine]] and charcoal, [[Bryan Higgins]] was issued a [[patent]] for hydraulic cement ([[stucco]]) for use as an exterior [[plaster]], and [[Alessandro Volta]] makes a copper/zinc [[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]].

In the 19th century, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] invents the [[thermocouple]], Joseph Aspin invents [[Portland cement]], [[Charles Goodyear]] invents [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] invent [[silver]]-based [[photography|photographic]] processes, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrates color photography, and [[Charles Fritts]] makes the first [[solar cell]]s using [[selenium]] waffles.

Before the early 1800s, [[aluminum]] had not been produced as an isolated metal.  It wasn't until 1825 that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] discovered how to create elemental aluminum via the reduction of aluminum chloride.  Since aluminum is a light element with good mechanical properties, it was widely sought to replace heavier less functional metals like silver and gold.  Napoleon III used aluminum plates and utensils for his honored guests, while the rest were given silver.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Tom|title=Aluminum: Common Metal, Uncommon Past|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/aluminum-common-metal-uncommon-past|website=Science History Institute|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en|date=2 June 2016}}</ref>  However, this process was still expensive and was still not able to produce the metal in large quantities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Production of Aluminum: The Hall-Héroult Process|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/aluminumprocess.html|website=American Chemical Society|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>  In 1886, American [[Charles Martin Hall]] and Frenchman [[Paul Héroult]] invented a process completely independent of each other to produce aluminum from aluminum oxide via electrolysis.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=George E.|title=Handbook of aluminum|date=2003|publisher=Dekker|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-8247-0896-2|edition=10. print.}}</ref>  This process would allow aluminum to be manufactured cheaper than ever before, and laid the groundwork for turning the element from a precious metal into an easily obtainable commodity.  Around the same time in 1888, [[Carl Josef Bayer]] was working in St Petersburg, Russia to develop a method to make pure alumina for the textile industry.  This process involved dissolving the aluminum oxide out of the bauxite mineral to produce gibbsite, which can then be purified back into raw alumina.  The [[Bayer process]] and the [[Hall-Héroult process]] are still used today to produce a majority of the world's alumina and aluminum.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bayer's Process for Alumina Production: A Historical Production|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/num17-18/num17-18%20p15-19.pdf|website=scs.illinois.edu|publisher=Fathi Habashi, Laval University|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>

==Material science as a field of study==
Most fields of studies have a founding father, such as Newton in physics and Lavoisier in chemistry. Materials science on the other hand has no central figure that set in motion materials studies.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Bernedetta|title=Materials science and engineering: an artificial discipline about to explode|website=History of Recent Materials Science}}</ref> In the 1940s, wartime collaborations of multiple fields of study to produce technological advances became a structure to the future field of study that would become known as material science and engineering.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olson|first1=Gregory|title=A Materials Science Timeline|website=Materials World Modules}}</ref> During the Cold War in the 1950s, US President Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) made materials a priority when it realized that materials were the limiting factor for advances in space and military technology. The Department of defense signed a contract with 5 universities (Harvard, MIT, Brown, Stanford, and Chicago) providing over $13 million for material research. Several institutions departments changed titles from "metallurgy" to "metallurgy and materials science" in 1960's.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Modern materials science==

In the early part of the 20th century, most engineering schools had a department of [[metallurgy]] and perhaps of [[ceramic]]s as well.  Much effort was expended on consideration of the [[austenite]]-[[martensite]]-[[cementite]] phases found in the iron-carbon [[phase diagram]] that underlies [[steel]] production.  The fundamental understanding of other materials was not sufficiently advanced for them to be considered as academic subjects.  In the post-WWII era, the systematic study of [[polymer]]s advanced particularly rapidly. Rather than create new polymer science departments in engineering schools, administrators and scientists began to conceive of materials science as a new interdisciplinary field in its own right, one that considered all substances of engineering importance from a unified point of view.  [[Northwestern University]] instituted the first materials science department in 1955.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.matsci.northwestern.edu/about/index.html |title = About &#124; Materials Science & Engineering &#124; Northwestern Engineering}}</ref>

Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high temperature materials. He pioneered high temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high temperature materials. His vision for interdisciplinary research played a key role in the creation of the Materials Research Institute. Tressler's contribution to materials science is celebrated with a Penn State lecture named in his honor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183714/http://www.matse.psu.edu/about-us/lectures-and-awards/tressler Richard E. Tressler lecture in Materials Science] from [[Penn State]]</ref>

The Materials Research Society (MRS)<ref>[http://www.mrs.org Materials Research Society]</ref> has been instrumental in creating an identity and cohesion for this young field.  MRS was the brainchild of researchers at [[Penn State University]] and grew out of discussions initiated by Prof. [[Rustum Roy]] in 1970.  The first meeting of MRS was held in 1973.  As of 2006{{Update inline|date=February 2018}}, MRS has grown into an international society that sponsors a large number of annual meetings and has over 13,000 members.  MRS sponsors meetings that are subdivided into symposia on a large variety of topics as opposed to the more focused meetings typically sponsored by organizations like the [[American Physical Society]] or the [[IEEE]].  The fundamentally interdisciplinary nature of MRS meetings has had a strong influence on the direction of science, particularly in the popularity of the study of [[soft materials]], which are in the nexus of biology, chemistry, physics and mechanical and electrical engineering.
Because of the existence of integrative textbooks, [[materials research societies]] and university chairs in all parts of the world, BA, MA and PhD programs and other indicators of discipline formation, it is fair to call materials science (and engineering) a discipline.<ref>See Cahn (2001) and Hentschel (2011) for further references and detailed analysis.</ref>

In 1958, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] created the [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA),<ref>{{cite web|title=DoD Directive Establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency|url=https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/dod-establishes-arpa|website=www.darpa.mil|accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref> referred to as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) since 1996. In 1960, ARPA encouraged the establishment of interdisciplinary laboratories (IDL's) on university campuses, which would be dedicated to the research of materials, as well as to the education of students on how to conduct materials science research.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Advancing Materials Research|last=Psaras|first=Peter A.|publisher=National Academy Press|year=1987|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35–40}}</ref> ARPA offered 4-year IDL contracts to universities, originally to [[Cornell University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Northwestern University]], eventually granting 9 more contracts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/Timeline/index.html|title=A Selected History of DARPA Innovation|website=DARPA|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> Although ARPA is no longer in control of the IDL program (the [[National Science Foundation]] took over the program in 1972<ref name=":0" />), the original establishment of IDL's marked a significant milestone in the [[United States]]' research and development of materials science.

==Silicon Age==
{{See|Silicon Age}}

The field of [[crystallography]], where [[X-rays]] are shone through crystals of a solid material, was founded by [[William Henry Bragg]] and his son [[William Lawrence Bragg]] at the [[Institute of Physics]] during and after [[World War II]]. Materials science became a major established discipline following the onset of the [[Silicon Age]] and [[Information Age]], which began with the invention of the [[MOSFET|metal–oxide–silicon field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) by [[Mohamed M. Atalla]] at [[Bell Labs]] in 1959. This led to the development of modern [[computers]] and then [[mobile phones]], with the need to make them smaller, faster and more powerful leading to materials science developing smaller and lighter materials capable of dealing with more complex calculations. This in turn enabled computers to be used to solve complex crystallographic calculations and automate crystallography experiments, allowing researchers to design more accurate and powerful techniques. Along with computers and crystallography, the development of [[laser]] technology from 1960 onwards led to the development of [[light-emitting diodes]] (used in [[DVD players]] and [[smartphones]]), [[fibre-optic communication]] (used in global [[telecommunications]]), and [[confocal microscopy]], a key tool in materials science.<ref>{{cite web |title=100 incredible years of physics – materials science |url=https://beta.iop.org/100-incredible-years-physics-materials-science |website=[[Institute of Physics]] |date=December 2019 |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>

Mohamed Atalla, at the [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) [[HP Labs|Semiconductor Lab]] in the 1960s, launched a material science investigation program that provided a base technology for [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs), [[gallium arsenide phosphide]] (GaAsP) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) devices. These devices became the core technology used by HP's Microwave Division to develop sweepers and [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analyzers]] that pushed 20{{ndash}}40&nbsp;GHz frequency, giving HP more than 90% of the [[military communications]] market.<ref name="House">{{cite book |last1=House |first1=Charles H. |last2=Price |first2=Raymond L. |title=The HP Phenomenon: Innovation and Business Transformation |date=2009 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=9780804772617 |pages=110–1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsTnDv6d2DwC&pg=PA110}}</ref>
