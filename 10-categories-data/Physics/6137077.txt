'''''Calabi-Yau''''' is a 2001 play written by playwright [[Susanna Speier]] with songs and music by [[Stefan Weisman]], based on physicist [[Brian Greene]]'s national bestseller ''[[The Elegant Universe]]''.

The musical play is a [[multimedia]] sub-subatomic adventure story about a documentarian lost in an inner loop of an abandoned track of the [[New York City Subway|New York Subway]] system.  He encounters [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] workers who are attempting to prove [[string theory]] by building a [[particle accelerator]] in abandoned [[Subway (rail)|subway]] tunnels beneath downtown [[New York City]].  The MTA track workers lead the documentarian to a gatekeeper named Lucy and her grandfather, who is engineering the particle accelerator.  A string explains string theory as a [[Calabi-Yau]] tells the story of [[Alexander the Great]] cutting the [[Gordian knot]].

It premiered as a workshop production at the [[Lincoln Center]] and [[HERE Arts Center]] sponsored American Living Room Festival in 2001.  Calabi-Yau was produced and performed at HERE in 2002.<!-- HOW LONG DID IT RUN?  -->

Eugene Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau, for whom Calabi-Yau manifolds are named, attempted to attend the play but were not let in since no one believed they were who they said they were.<ref>{{cite web |title=Math, String Theory, and Lincoln Center |url=https://omnia.sas.upenn.edu/story/math-string-theory-and-lincoln-center-video |date=2019-12-11|page=Penn Arts & Sciences Omnia}}</ref>
