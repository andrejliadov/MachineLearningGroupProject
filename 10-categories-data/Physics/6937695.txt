'''Band emission''', is the fraction of the total emission from a [[blackbody]] that is in a certain [[wavelength]] interval or band. For a prescribed temperature, T and the spectral interval from 0 to λ, is the ratio of the total emissive power of a black body  from 0 to λ to the total emissive power over the entire spectrum.
:<math>F_{0,\lambda} = \frac{\int_0^\lambda E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda}{\int_0^\infty E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda} =\frac{\int_0^\lambda E_{\lambda,b} d\lambda}{\sigma T ^4} =\int_0^{\lambda T} \frac{E_{\lambda,b}}{\sigma T ^5} d(\lambda T) = f(\lambda T) </math>
