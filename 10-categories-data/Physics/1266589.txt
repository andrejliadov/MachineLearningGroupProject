{{Short description|Mathematical abstraction modeling objects with zero extent, heavily used in physics to understand nature}}

A '''point particle''' ('''ideal particle'''<ref>H. C. Ohanian, J. T. Markert (2007), p. 3.</ref> or '''point-like particle''', often spelled '''pointlike particle''') is an [[idealization (science philosophy)|idealization]] of [[particle]]s heavily used in [[physics]]. Its defining feature is that it lacks spatial [[extension (metaphysics)|extension]]; being [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], it does not take up [[space]].<ref>F. E. Udwadia, R. E. Kalaba (2007), p. 1.</ref> A point particle is an appropriate representation of any object whenever its size, shape, and structure are irrelevant in a given context. For example, from far enough away, any finite-size object will look and behave as a point-like object. A point particle can also be referred in the case of a moving body in terms of physics.

In the theory of [[gravity]], physicists often discuss a '''{{vanchor|point mass|POINT_MASS}}''', meaning a point particle with a nonzero [[mass]] and no other properties or structure. Likewise, in [[electromagnetism]], physicists discuss a '''{{vanchor|point charge|POINT_CHARGE}}''', a point particle with a nonzero [[charge (physics)|charge]].<ref>R. Snieder (2001), pp. 196–198.</ref>

Sometimes, due to specific combinations of properties, extended objects behave as point-like even in their immediate vicinity.  For example, spherical objects interacting in [[3-dimensional space]] whose interactions are described by the [[inverse square law]] behave in such a way as if all their matter were concentrated in their [[center of mass|centers of mass]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} In [[Law of universal gravitation|Newtonian gravitation]] and classical [[electromagnetism]], for example, the respective [[Field (physics)|fields]] outside a spherical object are identical to those of a point particle of equal charge/mass located at the center of the sphere.<ref>I. Newton, I. B Cohen, A. Whitmann (1999), p. 956 (Proposition 75, Theorem 35).</ref><ref name=NewtonMotteMachin1>I. Newton, A. Motte, J. Machin (1729), p. 270–271.</ref>

In [[quantum mechanics]], the concept of a point particle is complicated by the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], because even an [[elementary particle]], with no internal structure, occupies a nonzero volume. For example, the [[atomic orbital|atomic orbit]] of an [[electron]] in the [[hydrogen atom]] occupies a volume of ~10<sup>−30</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. There is nevertheless a distinction between elementary particles such as [[electron]]s or [[quark]]s, which have no known internal structure, versus [[composite particle]]s such as [[proton]]s, which do have internal structure: A proton is made of three quarks.

Elementary particles are sometimes called "point particles", but this is in a different sense than discussed above.

==Property concentrated at a single point==
When a point particle has an additive property, such as mass or charge, concentrated at a single point in space, this can be represented by a [[Dirac delta function]].

==Physical point mass==
[[Image:Example of a point.svg|220px|thumb|right|An example of a point mass graphed on a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]]. The grey mass can be simplified to a point mass (the black [[circle]]). It becomes practical to represent point mass as small [[circle]], or dot, as an actual [[Point (geometry)|point]] is invisible.]]

'''Point mass''' ('''pointlike mass''') is the concept, for example in [[classical physics]], of a physical object (typically [[matter]]) that has nonzero mass, and yet explicitly and specifically is (or is being thought of or modeled as) [[infinitesimal]] (infinitely small) in its volume or [[length|linear dimension]]s.

===Application===

A common use for point mass lies in the analysis of the [[gravitational field]]s. When analyzing the gravitational forces in a system, it becomes impossible to account for every unit of [[mass]] individually. However, a spherically symmetric body affects external objects gravitationally as if all of its mass were concentrated at its center.

==Probability point mass==
A '''point mass''' in [[probability]] and [[statistics]] does not refer to mass in the sense of physics, but rather refers to a finite nonzero probability that is concentrated at a point in the [[probability mass function|probability mass distribution]], where there is a discontinuous segment in a [[probability density function]]. To calculate such a point mass, an [[integral|integration]] is carried out over the entire range of the [[random variable]], on the probability density of the continuous part. After equating this integral to 1, the point mass can be found by further calculation.

==Point charge==
[[File:Scalar potential of a point charge.jpg|left|thumb|Scalar potential of a point charge shortly after exiting a dipole magnet, moving left to right.]]
A '''point charge''' is an idealized model of a particle which has an [[electric charge]]. A point charge is an electric charge at a [[Point (geometry)|mathematical point]] with no dimensions.

The fundamental [[equation]] of [[electrostatics]] is [[Coulomb's law]], which describes the electric force between two point charges.  The [[electric field]] associated with a classical point charge increases to infinity as the distance from the point charge decreases towards [[0 (number)|zero]] making energy (thus mass) of point charge [[Infinity|infinite]].

[[Earnshaw's theorem]] states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in an [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges.

==In quantum mechanics==
[[Image:Proton quark structure.svg|thumb|200px|right|A proton is a combination of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]], held together by [[gluon]]s.]]
{{main|Elementary particle}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], there is a distinction between an [[elementary particle]] (also called "point particle") and a [[composite particle]]. An elementary particle, such as an [[electron]], [[quark]], or [[photon]], is a particle with no internal structure. Whereas a composite particle, such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]], has an internal structure (see figure).
However, neither elementary nor composite particles are spatially localized, because of the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. The particle [[wavepacket]] always occupies a nonzero volume. For example, see [[atomic orbital]]: The electron is an elementary particle, but its quantum states form three-dimensional patterns.

Nevertheless, there is good reason that an elementary particle is often called a point particle. Even if an elementary particle has a delocalized wavepacket, the wavepacket can be represented as a [[quantum superposition]] of [[quantum state]]s wherein the particle is exactly localized. Moreover, the ''interactions'' of the particle can be represented as a superposition of interactions of individual states which are localized.  This is not true for a composite particle, which can never be represented as a superposition of exactly-localized quantum states. It is in this sense that physicists can discuss the intrinsic "size" of a particle: The size of its internal structure, not the size of its wavepacket. The "size" of an elementary particle, in this sense, is exactly zero.

For example, for the electron, experimental evidence shows that the size of an electron is less than 10<sup>−18</sup> m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29724|title=Precision pins down the electron's magnetism}}</ref> This is consistent with the expected value of exactly zero. (This should not be confused with the [[classical electron radius]], which, despite the name, is unrelated to the actual size of an electron.)
