'''The Bogoliubov Prize for young scientists''' is an award offered to young researchers in [[theoretical physics]] by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR), an international intergovernmental organization located in Dubna, Russia. The award is issued in memory of the physicist and mathematician [[Nikolay Bogoliubov]]. 

The prize is awarded to young (up to 33-year-old) researchers for "outstanding contributions in fields of [[theoretical physics]] related to Bogoliubov's scientific interests".<ref>[http://cerncourier.com/main/article/39/3/19 Bogoliubov prize for young scientists] at CERN COURIER</ref> The awardee is one who has demonstrated "early scientific maturity" and whose results are recognized worldwide and peer-reviewed. The laureates generally emulate Bogoliubov's own skill in using sophisticated mathematics to attempt to solve concrete physical problems (mostly in the fields of [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[statistical physics]], [[quantum field theory]] and elementary [[particle physics]]).

==Jury==
The jury is presided by the theoretical physicist [[Dmitry Shirkov]], who co-authored many works with Nikolay Bogoliubov.

==Laureates==
* 1999 Oleg Shvedov ([[Moscow State University]], Russia): for a series of works on asymptotical methods in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
* 2001 Evgenii Ivashkevich  ([[JINR]], Russia): for a series of works on analytical methods in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
* 2005 [[Aur√©lien Barrau]] (the Laboratory of sub-atomic physics and cosmology and [[Joseph Fourier University]], Grenoble, France): for a series of works on astrophysics and cosmology.
