{{hatnote|This article is about the definitions of the SI units prior to the [[2019 redefinition of SI base units]]}}

From 2005 to early 2019, the definitions of the [[SI base units]] were as follows:

|[[metre]]
| style="text-align: center" | m
|[[length]]
|"The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;{{val|299792458}} of a second."<br/>''17th CGPM (1983, Resolution 1, CR, 97)''
|1&nbsp;/&nbsp;{{val|10000000}} of the distance from the [[Earth]]'s equator to the North Pole measured on the circumference through [[Paris]].

|[[kilogram]]
| style="text-align: center" | kg
|[[mass]]
|"The kilogram is the unit of mass; it is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram."<br/>''3rd CGPM (1901, CR, 70)''
|The mass of one [[litre]] of [[water]] at the temperature of melting ice. A litre is one thousandth of a cubic metre.
|style="text-align:center" | M
|-
|[[second]]
| style="text-align: center" | s
|[[time]]
|"The second is the duration of {{val|9192631770}} periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom."<br/>''13th CGPM (1967/68, Resolution 1; CR, 103)''<br />"This definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of 0&nbsp;K."<br />''(Added by CIPM in 1997)''
|The day is divided in 24 hours, each hour divided in 60 minutes, each minute divided in 60 seconds.<br/>A second is 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;(24&nbsp;×&nbsp;60&nbsp;×&nbsp;60) of the [[day]].
|style="text-align:center" | T
|-
|[[ampere]]
| style="text-align: center" | A
|[[electric current]]
|"The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to {{val|2|e=-7}} [[newton (unit)|newton]] per metre of length."<br/>''9th CGPM (1948)''
|The original "International Ampere" was defined electrochemically as the current required to deposit 1.118 milligrams of silver per second from a solution of [[silver nitrate]]. Compared to the SI ampere, the difference is 0.015%.
|style="text-align:center" | I
|-
|[[kelvin]]
| style="text-align: center" | K
|[[thermodynamic temperature]]
|"The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;{{val|273.16}} of the thermodynamic temperature of the [[triple point]] of water."<br/>''13th CGPM (1967/68, Resolution 4; CR, 104)''<br />"This definition refers to water having the isotopic composition defined exactly by the following amount of substance ratios: {{nowrap|0.000 155 76}} mole of <sup>2</sup>H per mole of <sup>1</sup>H, {{nowrap|0.000 379 9}} mole of <sup>17</sup>O per mole of <sup>16</sup>O, and {{nowrap|0.002 005 2}} mole of <sup>18</sup>O per mole of <sup>16</sup>O."<br />''(Added by CIPM in 2005)''
|The [[Celsius scale]]: the Kelvin scale uses the degree Celsius for its unit increment, but is a thermodynamic scale (0&nbsp;K is [[absolute zero]]).
|style="text-align:center" | Θ
|-
|[[Mole (unit)|mole]]
| style="text-align: center" | mol
|[[amount of substance]]
|"1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon 12; its symbol is 'mol'.<br />
2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles."<br/>''14th CGPM (1971, Resolution 3; CR, 78)''<br />"In this definition, it is understood that unbound atoms of carbon 12, at rest and in their ground state, are referred to."<br />''(Added by CIPM in 1980)''
|[[Atomic weight]] or [[molecular weight]] divided by the [[molar mass constant]], 1&nbsp;g/mol.
|style="text-align:center" | N
|-
|[[candela]]
| style="text-align: center" | cd
|[[luminous intensity]]
|"The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency {{val|540|e=12}} hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;683 watt per [[steradian]]."<br/>''16th CGPM (1979, Resolution 3; CR, 100)''
|The [[candlepower]], which is based on the light emitted from a burning candle of standard properties.
