The '''Mediterranean Institute of Fundamental Physics''', commonly known as '''MIFP''', is a [[private university|private]] independent non-governmental institution created in order to unite scientists in different countries around the world working in all fields of physics. MIFP is a non-profit organization whose main goal is to provide efficient and flexible management of international collaboration projects and teaching programmes, to ease and increase the communication between leading researchers in different areas of fundamental and applied physics, and to organize international scientific meetings, workshops, schools and conferences.<ref name="moldova">International news section [http://www.asm.md/index.php?go=noutati_detalii&n=4738&new_language=1] [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]]</ref> It is located in [[Marino, Lazio|Marino]], [[Province of Rome|Rome]], Italy.

Founded in July 2010 by a small group of researchers, by the year of 2012 MIFP numbers over one hundred members. During 2010, 2011 and 2012 MIFP has held, took part in, or partly sponsored more than ten international events in [[Armenia]], Italy, Greece, France, [[Ukraine]], [[Brazil]], [[Thailand]] and Russia.<ref name="armenia">Second [[International School of Nanophotonics and Photovoltaics]] ''ISNP-2010'' [http://plmcn10.phys.soton.ac.uk/nanoschool/]</ref><ref name="ukr">Nano Euro Med 2011 [http://www.nanoeuromed.ferroix.net/] Multifunctional Nanomaterials: ''Mediterranean - East Europe meeting''</ref><ref name="maratea11">[[International School of Nanophotonics and Photovoltaics]] ''ISNP-2011'' [http://www.optolab.uniroma2.it/ISNP-2011/program.htm]</ref><ref name="brazil">[http://www.mifpbrasil.com/index.php ''Latin America Meeting 2012'']</ref><ref name="esf">[[European Science Foundation|ESF]] PESC Exploratory Workshop:

MIFP is financed from the research grants and by private donations.

== History ==
In the year of 2001, the 1st French-Russian Meeting on New trends in Solid State Physics in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France which was sponsored by [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] started a series of annual meetings of world leading experts in [[solid state physics]]. Further meetings have been held in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] on a yearly basis from 2002 to 2006 to be followed by Meetings in [[Rome]] in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 with constantly increasing number of participating scientists. Shortly after the 2010 annual meeting, a group of researchers working in different countries decided to create a private organization which main goal would be bringing together a strong international team providing a stimulating research environment and working atmosphere. Another mission of MIFP was reunification of the Russian scientists who spread all over the world after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. With a support from Dr. Giuseppe Eramo, [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome II Tor Vergata]], MIFP was founded on 1 July 2010, and Prof. [[Alexey Kavokin]], [[University of Southampton]], was appointed its Scientific director.<ref name="kommersant" /> The institute started function within the campus of the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|University of Rome II Tor Vergata]], and moved to Marino, Rome later that year. Starting from the year 2011, the yearly scientific meetings became Annual MIFP March Meetings gathering scientists working not only in Solid state physics but in a great variety of fields.

== Goals ==
The major goal of MIFP is the creation of an environment for fruitful research activities, decreasing the amount of administrative and logistics problems for the members of the Institute, providing flexible management, promotion of fundamental physics in the Mediterranean region, sponsoring the collaboration projects in physics across Europe, although it stays open for any offers from all continents. MIFP promotes the high-school teaching programs in physics. The Institute organizes the International Conferences on Physics of Light-Matter Coupling in Nanostructures and International Schools on Nanophotonics and Photovoltaics. Members can request management assistance from MIFP for grant applications/organization of events or any other collaboration.<ref name="code">[http://www.mifp.eu/mifp/code-conduct-mifp.html MIFP Code of Conduct]</ref>

MIFP strategic goal is to evolve from an essentially virtual private institution with the administrative base of several persons to the full-scale international research centre with developed infrastructure, laboratories, the core of permanent researchers (20-30 positions), PostDocs, PhD students and visiting professors (50-60 positions), and relevant administration and technical team (20-25 persons). MIFP intends attracting the highest international level scientists for permanent or fixed-term research positions with competitive salaries.

== Scientific Council of MIFP ==
The Institute is governed by Scientific Council currently consisting of 6 members which are elected by the Members of MIFP at the March Meetings of the Institute. Each member is elected for a five-year period. At quarterly meetings the members of Scientific Council decide on the general scientific strategy of MIFP and approve the addition of the new members of the Institute according to the requests submitted from the candidates.<ref name="code" />

== MIFP Cocktail ==
Specially for Annual meetings of the Institute as well as other MIFP events, a special cocktail was invented by [[Massimiliano Romano]]. The ingredients are: Martini Rosso, Ice, Fresh Oranges, and Pepper from Szechuan, making the acronym of the MIFP. The cocktail was named "Make It For Pleasure".<ref name="cocktail">[https://www.mifp.eu/mifp-cocktail.html MIFP Cocktail]</ref>

[[Massimiliano Romano]] also invented the ''Balsamic Gin & Tonic''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maxbarbrasserie.co.uk/about/|title=About - Max's Bar & Brasserie}}</ref> at Lainston House Hotel in 1999.
