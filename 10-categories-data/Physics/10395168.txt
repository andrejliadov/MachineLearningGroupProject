The '''American Association of Physicists in Medicine''' ('''AAPM''') is a scientific, educational, and professional organization of [[Medical Physicist]]s.<ref>Physicists: Fear of Diagnostic Radiation Is Overblown, U.S. News & World Report - Jan 17, 2012</ref> In 2011, it absorbed the '''American College of Medical Physics'''<ref>https://history.aip.org/ead/20120415.html</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20130102081931/http://acmp.org/</ref>

Their headquarters are located at 1631 Prince Street,  [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

Publications include two scientific journals ''[[Medical Physics (journal)|Medical Physics]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics (journal)|Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics]]'' (JACMP), as well as technical reports, and symposium proceedings.

The purposes of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine are to promote the application of [[physics]] to [[medicine]] and [[biology]] and to encourage interest and training in [[medical physics]] and related fields. AAPM has established ''[[Medical Physics (journal)|Medical Physics]]'' as its primary scientific and informational journal.

AAPM is a Member of the [[American Institute of Physics]] and has over 8000 members.<ref>{{cite journal|title=AAPM Medical Physics Practice Guideline 1.a: CT Protocol Management and Review Practice Guideline|journal=Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics|volume=14|issue=5|pages=3â€“12|doi=10.1120/jacmp.v14i5.4462|pmid=24036879|pmc=5714562|year=2013|last1=Cody|first1=D.
