The '''Gregori Aminoff Prize''' is an international prize awarded since 1979 by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in the field of [[crystallography]], rewarding "a documented, individual contribution in the field of crystallography, including areas concerned with the dynamics of the formation and dissolution of crystal structures. Some preference should be shown for work evincing elegance in the approach to the problem." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/en/Prizes/Gregori-Aminoff-Prize/|title= Gregori Aminoff Prize|publisher= Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|accessdate= 2 February 2017}}</ref>

The prize, which is named in memory of the Swedish scientist and artist [[Gregori Aminoff]] (1883–1947), Professor of Mineralogy at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]] from 1923, was endowed through a bequest by his widow Birgit Broomé-Aminoff. The prize can be shared by several winners.
