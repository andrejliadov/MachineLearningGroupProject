The '''Bethe–Feynman efficiency formula''', a simple method for calculating the yield of a fission bomb,<ref>http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html</ref> was first derived in 1943 after development in 1942. Aspects of the formula are speculated to be [[Classified information in the United States|secret restricted data]].<ref>[http://www.webofstories.com/play/hans.bethe/92 Meeting and working with Richard Feynman at Los Alamos], Web of Stories, story by Hans Bethe recorded in December 1996, last accessed 2015/04/20.</ref>

*a = internal energy per gram
*b = growth rate
*c = sphere radius

<math>a \approx (bc)^2  f</math>

A numerical coefficient would then be included to create the Bethe–Feynman formula—increasing accuracy more than an order of magnitude.<ref name="Atmospheric electrodynamics">{{cite book|author=Hans Volland |year=1995 |title=Handbook of atmospheric electrodynamics, Volume 2
