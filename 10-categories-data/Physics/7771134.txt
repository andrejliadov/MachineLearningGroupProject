'''''About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-684-81822-1}}), published in 1995,<ref>{{Cite web| title = Nonfiction Book Review: About Time by Paul Davies| work = Publishers Weekly| accessdate = 2017-10-31| url =https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-79964-9|date=27 February 1995}}</ref> is the second [[book]] written by [[Paul Davies]], regarding the subject of [[time]]. His first book on time was his ''The Physics of Time Asymmetry'' (1977)({{ISBN|0-520-02825-2}}). The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics.

''About Time'' explores selected mysteries of [[spacetime]], following on from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which Davies believes does not fully explain time as humans experience it. The author explains {{quote|
Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time".
}}

The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s.
