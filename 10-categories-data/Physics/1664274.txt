There are about 20,000 members, including university professors, researchers as well as educators, and engineers.  The JPS was founded in 1877 as the first society in natural science in [[Japan]].

==Purpose==
The primary purposes of the JPS are to publish research reports of its members and to provide its members with facilities relating to physics.

==Reciprocal agreements==
