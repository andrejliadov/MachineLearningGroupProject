In [[aerodynamics]], '''climb gradient''' is the ratio between distance travelled over the ground and [[altitude]] gained, and is expressed as a percentage. The '''angle of climb''' can be defined as the angle between a horizontal plane representing the Earth's surface and the actual flight path followed by the aircraft during its ascent.

The speed of an [[Type certificate|aircraft type]] at which the angle of climb is largest is called [[v-speed|V<sub>X</sub>]]. It is always slower than V<sub>Y</sub>, the speed for the best [[rate of climb]].
As the latter gives the quickest way for gaining altitude levels, regardless of the distance covered during such a maneuver, it is more relevant to cruising. The maximum angle of climb on the other hand is where the aircraft gains the most altitude in a given distance, regardless of the time needed for the maneuver. This is important for clearing an obstacle, and therefore is the speed a pilot uses when executing a "short field" takeoff.
V<sub>X</sub> increases with altitude and V<sub>Y</sub> decreases with altitude until they converge at the airplane's [[absolute ceiling]].

''' Best [[angle]] of climb (BAOC) ''' airspeed for an airplane is the speed at which the maximum [[excess thrust]] is available. Excess thrust is the difference between the total [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] of the aircraft, and the thrust output of the powerplant. For a jet aircraft, this speed is very close to the speed at which the total minimum drag occurs.
