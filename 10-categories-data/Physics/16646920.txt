'''Koenig's manometric flame apparatus''' was a laboratory  instrument invented in 1862 by the [[Germany|German]] physicist [[Rudolph Koenig]], and  used to visualize [[sound wave]]s. It was the nearest equivalent of the modern [[oscilloscope]] in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

==Description==
The [[manometer|manometric]] flame apparatus consisted of a chamber which acted in the same way as a modern [[microphone]]. Sound from the source to be measured was concentrated by means of a horn or tube into one half of the capsule chamber. The chamber was divided in two by an elastic [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]], usually rubber. The sound caused the diaphragm to vibrate which [[modulated]] a flow of flammable [[Gas lighting|illumination gas]] passing through the other half of the chamber. The illumination gas was passed to a [[Bunsen burner]], the flame of which would then increase or decrease in size at the same frequency as the sound source. <ref name="SciTechAntiques"> Jim & Rhoda Morris  at  SciTechAntiques.</ref><ref name="CaseW">[http://www.phys.cwru.edu/ccpi/Flame_manometer.html Flame manometer] Case Western Reserve University Physics Department</ref>

The change in flame size was too fast to be easily seen with the naked eye and a [[stroboscope]], usually in the form of a rotating many sided mirror was used to view the flame. The frequency of the sound could then be calculated from the apparent distance between the flame images in the mirror and the known speed of its rotation.<ref name="SciTechAntiques"/>

[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used this type of equipment to study the performance of his microphones and demonstrated it in his display at the 1876 
[[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Centenarian Exhibition]]. He replaced the rubber diaphragm with an iron disc which was driven by an  [[electromagnet]] with current fed from a microphone. This apparatus was capable of giving quantitative measures of the performance of his microphones. <ref name="SciTechAntiques"/><ref name="Kenyon1">[http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Acoustics/Manometric/manometric.html Manometric Flame Apparatus] , Kenyon College</ref> 

A type of [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyzer]] can be constructed by connecting a number of  manometric flame capsules each to a [[Helmholtz resonance|Helmholtz resonator]] tuned to either the [[fundamental frequency]] of the sound to be analyzed, or one of its [[harmonic]]s. The flames produced from each capsule are then an indication of the strength of each of the Fourier components of the sound. <ref name="Kenyon2">[http://physics.kenyon.edu/EarlyApparatus/Rudolf_Koenig_Apparatus/Fourier_Analysis/Fourier_Analysis.html Fourier Analysis] Kenyon College.</ref>
