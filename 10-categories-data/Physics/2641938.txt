'''Applied physics''' is the application of [[Applied science|physical theories]] to problem-solving. It is the use of theoretical knowledge of the properties of physical bodies with the intention of achieving a particular technological or practical goal. It is also usually considered to be a bridge or a connection between [[physics]] and [[engineering]].

"Applied" is distinguished from "pure" by a subtle combination of factors, such as the motivation and attitude of researchers and the nature of the relationship to the [[technology]] or [[science]] that may be affected by the work. Applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the [[physical science]]s, but is concerned with the utilization of scientific principles in practical devices and systems, and in the application of physics in other areas of science.<ref>{{cite web |title=General Information on Applied Physics |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |publisher=Stanford Department of Applied Physics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307121331/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/app-physics/general/ |archive-date=7 March 2007}}</ref>  

It usually differs from engineering in that an applied [[physicist]] may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving an engineering problem. This approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. 

In other words, applied physics is rooted in the fundamental truths and basic concepts of the physical sciences but is concerned with the utilization of these scientific principles in practical devices and systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Applied Physics |url=http://www.sci.waseda.ac.jp/research/BELONG/E/02802.html|publisher=Waseda University|accessdate=16 October 2016}}</ref>

Applied [[physicists]] can also be interested in the use of physics for scientific research. For instance, the field of [[accelerator physics]] can contribute to research in theoretical physics by working with engineers enabling design and construction of high-energy [[collider]]s.
