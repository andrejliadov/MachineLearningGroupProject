'''''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds''''' ({{lang-fr|Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes}}) is a [[popular science]] book by French author [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]], published in 1686. It offered an explanation of the [[heliocentric]] model of the Universe, suggested by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his 1543 work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. The book is Fontenelle's most famous work and is considered to be one of the first major works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

==Background==
Unlike many scientific works of its time, ''Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds'' was written not in [[Latin]], but in French and is notable as one of the first books to attempt an explanation of [[science|scientific theories]] in [[Popular science|popular]] language. In the preface, Fontenelle addresses female readers and suggests that the offered explanation should be easily understood even by those without scientific knowledge. A precursor includes [[Giordano Bruno]]'s [[:it:De l'infinito, universo e mondi|''De l'infinito, universo e mondi'']].

==Content==
The book itself is presented as a series of conversations between a gallant [[philosopher]] and a [[marquise]], who walk in the latter's garden at night and gaze at [[star]]s. The philosopher explains the heliocentric model and also muses on the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Fontenelle's work was not cast polemically against the world views of either the [[Catholic Church]] or the Protestant churches, nor did it attract the attention, positive or negative, of theologians or prelates.

==Translations==
The first English translation was compounded by [[John Glanvill]] in 1687, followed by another translation by [[Aphra Behn]] in 1688, under the title ''A Discovery of New Worlds''. [[Antiokh Kantemir]] translated it into [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1730, although the translation was only published in a [[censorship|censored]] edition in 1740, due to objections from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Reception==
The book was very well received both in France and elsewhere, and was regularly published. In 1691, Fontenelle was elected to the [[Académie française]].<ref>"Fontenelle, Bernard Le Bovier, sieur de." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007.
