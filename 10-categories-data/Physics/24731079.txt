In the debate among [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]], the concepts of "observation" and "observer" play central roles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schlosshauer|first1=Maximilian|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|date=2013-08-01|title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222–230|arxiv=1301.1069|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S|s2cid=55537196}}</ref> While the empirical success of quantum mechanics is uncontested, the prominence of seemingly subjective or [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] ideas like "observer" in the early development of the theory has been a continuing source of disquiet and [[philosophy of physics|philosophical]] dispute.<ref>{{cite journal|first=N.

Moreover, the term "observable" has gained a technical meaning, denoting a [[Hermitian operator]] that represents a measurement.<ref>{{Cite book|title-link= Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction |title=Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction|last1=Rieffel|first1=Eleanor G.|last2=Polak|first2=Wolfgang H.|date=2011-03-04|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-01506-6|language=en|author-link=Eleanor Rieffel}}</ref>{{rp|55}} Thus, the quantum mechanical observer does not have to ''necessarily'' present or solve any problems over and above the issue of [[measurement in quantum mechanics]]. The quantum mechanical observer is also intimately tied to the issue of [[Observer effect (physics)#Quantum mechanics|observer effect]].

A number of new-age religious or philosophical views give the observer a more special role, or place constraints on who or what can be an observer. There is no credible peer-reviewed research that backs such claims. As an example of such claims, [[Fritjof Capra]] declared, "The crucial feature of atomic physics is that the human observer is not only necessary to observe the properties of an object, but is necessary even to define these properties."<ref>[[Fritjof Capra]]. ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'', p. 127</ref>
</blockquote> However, mainstream physicists downplay any special role of human observers. For example, [[Werner Heisenberg]] wrote,

<blockquote>Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the "possible" to the "actual," is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.<ref>[[Werner Heisenberg]], ''Physics and Philosophy'', p. 137</ref></blockquote>

Likewise, [[Asher Peres]] stated that "observers" in quantum physics are

<blockquote>similar to the ubiquitous "observers" who send and receive light signals in [[special relativity]]. Obviously, this terminology does not imply the actual presence of human beings. These fictitious physicists may as well be inanimate automata that can perform all the required tasks, if suitably programmed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Asher |last=Peres |title=[[Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods]] |author-link=Asher Peres |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kluwer]] |isbn=0-7923-2549-4 |oclc=28854083}}</ref>{{rp|12}}</blockquote>

Critics of the special role of the observer also point out that observers can themselves be observed, leading to paradoxes such as that of [[Wigner's friend]]; and that it is not clear how much consciousness is required. As [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] inquired, "Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer—with a PhD?"<ref>[[John Stewart Bell]], 1981, "Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists". In C. J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W. Sciama (eds.), ''Quantum Gravity 2: A Second Oxford Symposium''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 611.</ref>
