'''Classical fluids'''<ref>R. Balescu, ''Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics'', (John Wiley, 1975)</ref> are systems of particles which retain a definite volume, and are at sufficiently high temperatures (compared to their [[Fermi Energy|Fermi energy]]) that [[quantum]] effects can be neglected. A system of [[hard spheres]], interacting only by hard collisions (e.g., billiards, marbles), is a model classical fluid. Such a system is well described by the [[Percus–Yevick approximation|Percus–Yevik equation]]. Common liquids, e.g., liquid air, gasoline etc., are essentially mixtures of classical fluids. Electrolytes, molten salts, salts dissolved in water, are classical charged fluids. A classical fluid when cooled undergoes a freezing transition. On heating it undergoes an evaporation transition and becomes a classical gas that obeys [[Boltzmann]] statistics.
 
A system of charged classical particles moving in a uniform positive neutralizing background is known as a one-component plasma (OCP). This is well described by the Hyper-netted chain equation (see [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]]). 
An essentially very accurate way of determining the properties of classical fluids is provided by the method of [[molecular dynamics]].
An [[Free electron model|electron gas confined in a metal]] is ''not'' a classical fluid, whereas a very high-temperature plasma of electrons could behave as a classical fluid. Such non-classical [[Fermi gas|Fermi systems]], i.e., quantum fluids, can be studied using [[quantum Monte Carlo]] methods, Feynman [[path integral formulation|path integral]] equation methods, and  approximately via [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]] integral-equation methods.
