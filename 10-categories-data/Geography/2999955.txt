The '''Alpide belt''' or '''Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt'''<ref name=Storetvedt>K.M. Storetvedt, K.

It is the second most seismically active region in the world, after the circum-Pacific belt (the [[Ring of Fire]]), with 17% of the world's largest earthquakes.<ref name="USGS1">{{cite web |url=http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9831/3342 |title=Where do earthquakes occur? |publisher=USGS |accessdate=8 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805134145/http://www.usgs.gov/faq/categories/9831/3342 |archivedate=5 August 2014 }}</ref>

The Alpide belt is being created by ongoing [[plate tectonics]] such as the [[Alpine orogeny]]. The belt is the result of [[Mesozoic]]-to-[[Cenozoic]]-to-recent closure of the [[Tethys Ocean]] and process of collision between the northward-moving [[African plate|African]], [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian plate]]s with the [[Eurasian plate]].<ref name=Storetvedt/>

==Main ranges (from west to east)==
* [[Cantabrian Mountains]] (incl. the [[Basque Mountains]]), [[Sistema Central]], [[Sistema Ibérico]], [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Balkan Mountains]] (Balkanides), [[Rila]]-[[Rhodope mountains|Rhodope]] [[massif]]s, [[Thracian Sea]] [[Thasos|islands]], [[Crimean Mountains]] - entirely in [[Europe]]
* [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] and [[Rif]] Mountains in [[Northern Africa]], [[Baetic System]] ([[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Apennine Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps]], [[Pindus]] (Hellenides), and [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]];
* [[Caucasus Mountains]] (on the [[Boundaries between the continents of Earth|limits between Asia and Europe]]), [[Kopet Dag|Kopet Mountains]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]], [[Pamir-Alay|Alay]] Mountains, [[Tian Shan]], [[Altai Mountains]], [[Sayan Mountains]];
* [[Pontic Mountains]], [[Armenian Highland]], [[Alborz]], [[Hindu Kush]], [[Kunlun Mountains]], [[Hengduan Mountains]], [[Annamite Range]], [[Titiwangsa Mountains]], [[Barisan Mountains]] - entirely in [[Asia]];
* [[Taurus Mountains]], [[Troodos Mountains]], [[Zagros Mountains]], [[Makran]] Highland, [[Sulaiman Mountains]], [[Karakoram]], [[Himalayas]], [[Transhimalaya]], [[Patkai]], [[Chin Hills]], [[Arakan Mountains]], [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]] - entirely in [[Asia]].

[[Indonesia]] lies between the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] along the northeastern islands adjacent to and including [[New Guinea]] and the Alpide belt along the south and west from [[Sumatra]], [[Java (island)|Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] ([[Bali]], [[Flores]], and [[Timor]]). The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] just off the coast of Sumatra was located within the Alpide belt.
