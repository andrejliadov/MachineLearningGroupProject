The '''acre''' is a [[Unit of measurement|unit]] of land area used in the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and [[United States customary units#Units of area|US customary]] systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one [[Chain (unit)|chain]] by one [[furlong]] (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square chains, {{frac|1|640}} of a square mile, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, or about 40% of a [[hectare]]. Based upon the [[International yard and pound|International yard and pound agreement of 1959]], an acre may be declared as exactly {{gaps|4,046.856|422|4}} square metres. One recognised symbol for the acre is '''ac''',<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Weights, Measures and Units |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofweig0000fenn |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofweig0000fenn/page/4 4]|first=Donald |last=Fenna |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-19-860522-6}}</ref> but the word "acre" is also used as the symbol.<ref name="NIST">National Institute of Standards and Technology [http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf (n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126120208/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Publications/upload/h4402_appenc.pdf |date=26 November 2006 }}.</ref>

The acre is a [[statute measure]] in the [[United States]], in the [[United Kingdom]] and in almost all countries of the former [[British Empire]]: in most it is lawful to "use for trade" if given as supplementary information and is not used for [[land registration]].

In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only two parts per million, see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.

Traditionally, in the [[Middle Ages]], an acre was defined as the area of land that could be [[plough]]ed in one day by a [[yoke]] of [[ox]]en.<ref name=nottingham>{{cite web |url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/researchguidance/weightsandmeasures/measurements.aspx |title=Manuscripts and Special Collections – Measurements |publisher = the [[University of Nottingham]] |access-date= 1 August 2018}}</ref>

==Description==
One acre equals {{frac|1|640}} (0.0015625) square mile, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feet,<ref name="NIST" /> or about {{convert|4047|m2|ha|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=4}} (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends upon the particular yard on which it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a [[selion]] of land sized at forty [[Rod (unit)|perches]] (660&nbsp;ft, or 1&nbsp;[[furlong]]) long and four perches (66&nbsp;ft) wide;<ref name="Klein2012">{{cite book| last=Klein |first=Herbert Arthur |title=The Science of Measurement: A Historical Survey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CrmuSiCFyikC&pg=PA76 |year=2012 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=978-0-486-14497-9 |page=76}}</ref> this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day (a furlong being "a furrow long"). A [[square]] enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57&nbsp;yards, or 208&nbsp;feet 9&nbsp;inches ({{convert|208.71|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=out}}), on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre.

==US survey acres==
In the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959, the United States and five countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metre.<ref name=NBS1959>{{cite web |publisher= National Bureau of Standards |date= 25 June 1959 |url= http://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf |title= Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound |website= noaa.gov |archive-url= https://archive.today/20200305184155/https://geodesy.noaa.gov/PUBS_LIB/FedRegister/FRdoc59-5442.pdf |archive-date= 5 March 2020 |url-status= dead |access-date= 3 December 2006 }}</ref> The US authorities decided that, while the refined definition would apply nationally in all other respects, the [[US survey foot]] (and thus the survey acre) would continue 'until such a time as it becomes desirable and expedient to readjust [it]'.<ref name=NBS1959 /> By inference, an "international acre" may be calculated as exactly {{gaps|4,046.856|422|4}} square metres but it does not have a basis in any international agreement.

Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain {{frac|640}} of a square mile or 4,840 square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see [[Foot (unit)#Survey foot|survey foot]] and [[Yard#Conversions|survey yard]]), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about 4,046.872 square metres; its exact value ({{sfrac|4046|13,525,426|15,499,969}}&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) is based on an inch defined by 1&nbsp;metre = 39.37&nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1922. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.<ref>[[National Geodetic Survey]], (January 1991), [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/Policy/st_plane.html Policy of the National Geodetic Survey Concerning Units of Measure for the State Plane Coordinate System of 1983].</ref>

Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre (0.016 square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8 square inches), is only about a quarter of the size of an [[ISO 216#A series|A4 sheet]] or [[Paper size#North American paper sizes|US letter]], it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.<ref>[http://www.acsm.net/_data/global/images/PDF%20Documents/ACSM/20110223ALTAACSMLandTitleSurveyStandard2011.pdf Minimum Standard Detail Requirements For ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904215328/http://www.acsm.net/_data/global/images/PDF%20Documents/ACSM/20110223ALTAACSMLandTitleSurveyStandard2011.pdf |date=4 September 2013 }}. Federick, MD: American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. 2011. [The standard uses "precision" in a sense more typically used for "accuracy"; the stated maximum allowable "precision" (page 3) is 2&nbsp;cm and 50 parts per million. An instrument consistently measuring 2&nbsp;cm short would measure the area of a one international acre square, 63.614907&nbsp;m on a side, as 4044.3 square metres, 2.6 square metres less than the true value, a far greater discrepancy than the difference between the international and survey acres.]</ref>

In October 2019, [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] and [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] announced their joint intent to end the "temporary" continuance of the US survey foot, mile and acre units (as permitted by their 1959 decision, above), with effect from the end of 2022.<ref>{{cite web |title=NGS and NIST to Retire U.S. Survey Foot after 2022 |url=https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/web/news/us-survey-foot.shtml |publisher=National Geodetic Survey |access-date=4 March 2020 |date=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Survey Foot: Revised Unit Conversion Factors |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/us-surveyfoot/revised-unit-conversion-factors |publisher=NIST |access-date=4 March 2020 |date=16 October 2019}}</ref>

==Equivalence to other units of area==
[[File:Acre superimposed over football fields.svg|frame|The area of one acre (red) superposed on an [[American football]] field (green) and [[Association football]]/soccer pitch (blue).]]
1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:
*0.40468564224 hectare (A square with 100&nbsp;m sides has an area of 1 hectare.)
*4,046.8564224 square metres (or a square with approximately 63.61&nbsp;m sides)

1 United States survey acre is equal to:
*0.404687261 hectare
*4,046.87261 square metres (1 square kilometre is equal to 247.105 acres)

1 acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:
*66 feet × 660 feet (43,560 square feet)
*10 square [[Chain (unit)|chains]] (1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 4 rods = 100 [[link (unit)|links]])
*1 acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)
*4,840 square yards
*43,560 square feet
*160 [[Perch (unit)|perches]]. A perch is equal to a square [[Rod (length)|rod]] (1 square rod is 0.00625 acre)
*4 [[Rood (measurement)|roods]]
*A furlong by a chain (furlong 220 yards, chain 22 yards)
*40 rods by 4 rods, 160 rods<sup>2</sup> (historically fencing was often sold in 40 rod lengths<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1919|title=ed. 842|journal=Farmers' Bulletin|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=24}}</ref>)
*{{frac|1|640}} (0.0015625) square mile (1 square mile is equal to 640 acres)

Perhaps the easiest way for US residents to envision an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88 yards by 55 yards ({{frac|1|10}} of 880 yards by {{frac|1|16}} of 880 yards), about {{frac|9|10}} the size of a standard [[American football field]]. To be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the [[end zone]]). The full field, including the end zones, covers about {{convert|1.32|acres|2|abbr=on}}.

For residents of other countries, the acre might be envisioned as rather more than half of a {{convert|1.76|acres|2|abbr=on}} [[football pitch]].

It may also be remembered as 1% short of 44,000 square feet.

== Historical origin ==
{{Anthropic_Farm_Units}}
The word "acre" is derived from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|æcer}} originally meaning "open field", [[cognate]] with west coast Norwegian {{lang|no|ækre}}, [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] {{lang|is|akur}}, [[Swedish language|Swedish]] {{lang|sv|åker}}, German {{lang|de|Acker}}, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|akker}}, [[Latin]] {{lang|la|ager}}, [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa-Latn|ajr}}, and Greek {{lang|el|αγρός}} ({{lang|el-Latn|agros}}). In English, it was historically spelled ''[[wikt:aker|aker]]''.

According to the [[Act on the Composition of Yards and Perches]], dating from around 1300, an acre is "40 [[perch (unit)|perch]]es <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[rod (unit)|rod]]s] in length and four in breadth",<ref name="BritainRuffhead1765">{{cite book|author1=Great Britain|author2=Owen Ruffhead |authorlink2=Owen Ruffhead |title=Statutes at Large |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Un1RAAAAYAAJ&q=%22quod%20tria%20grana%22&pg=PA421 |access-date=12 February 2012 |year=1765 |publisher=Printed by M.

Before the enactment of the [[metric system]], many countries in Europe used their own official acres. In France, the acre (spelled exactly the same as in English) was used only in [[Normandy]], but its value varied greatly across Normandy, ranging from 3,632 to 9,725 square metres, with 8,172 square metres being the most frequent value. The Normandy ''acre'' was usually divided in 4 ''vergées'' ([[Rood (unit)|roods]]) and 160 square ''perches'', like the English acre.

The Normandy ''acre'' was equal to 1.6 ''[[arpent]]s'', the unit of area more commonly used in Northern France outside of Normandy. In Canada, the Paris ''arpent'' used in [[Quebec]] before the metric system was adopted is sometimes called "French acre" in English, even though the Paris ''arpent'' and the Normandy ''acre'' were two very different units of area in ancient France (the Paris ''arpent'' became the unit of area of French Canada, whereas the Normandy ''acre'' was never used in French Canada).

In Germany there were many variants of the ''Acker'', differing between the German states:

Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently the United Kingdom, by acts of:
*[[Edward I of England|Edward I]]
*[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]
*[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]
*[[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]
*[[Queen Victoria]] – the British [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, [[Rood (measurement)|rood]]s, and [[Perch (unit)|perches]]), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.

The acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of {{frac|1|2}} mile (880 yards) and is {{frac|1|4}} square mile in area, or 160 acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being {{frac|1|4}} mile long, and being {{frac|1|16}} of a square mile in area, or 40 acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase "the back 40" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the [[Canadian Prairie Provinces]] and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.

==Legacy acres==
* Customary acre – The customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in [[carucate]]s, [[virgate]]s, [[Oxgang|bovates]], nooks, and farundels. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.
* Builder's acre – In US construction and real estate development, an area of 40,000 square feet (200 x 200 ft. square). Used to simplify the math and for marketing, it is nearly 10% smaller than a survey acre.
