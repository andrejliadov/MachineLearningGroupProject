The '''geographic centre of Uganda''' is north of [[Lake Kyoga]] in Olyaka village, Olyaka parish in [[Namasale]] sub-county in [[Amolatar]] District, [[Northern Uganda]].<ref>https://lirauni.ac.ug/lango-tourism-conference/ | date=August 22, 2020</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/pkyama1/status/1290393354023440384 | date=August 22, 2020</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2020}}

The point is marked by the '''Amolatar Monument''' which displays the names of all [[List of tribes in Uganda|ethnic tribes in Uganda]]. The Amolatar peninsula offered refuge to different tribes during the [[Karamojong people|Karimojong]] cattle rustling of the 1970s through to the 1980s and early 1990s most of whom ended up settling in the district. Once a year, in September, people from all tribes of the region gather at this place and pray.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
