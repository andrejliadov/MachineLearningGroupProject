A '''GPS watch''' is a device with integrated [[GPS navigation device|GPS receiver]] that is worn as a single unit strapped onto a wrist, in the manner of a [[bracelet]]. The watch can have other features and capabilities depending on its intended purpose and be a [[smartwatch]]. [[GPS]] watches are most often used for sports and fitness purposes. Many can connect to external sensors by the wireless [[ANT+]] protocol, and/or to a computer by [[USB]] to transfer data and configuration. Common sensors used are heart rate monitors and footpods (running cadence and speed sensor). A [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] can be used to supplement or replace GPS data, such as providing treadmill speed and distance for the watch to log and share. [[USB charger|Recharging by USB]] is commonplace.

== Optional features ==
* Display (Illuminated or passive)
* Time display
* Speed/pace display
* Map display
* Routes
* [[GPS tracking unit|Route tracking]]
* [[Heart rate monitor]] compatibility
* Running cadence and speed sensor ([[Inertial footpod|footpod]]) compatibility
* [[Cadence (cycling)|Cycling cadence]] sensor compatibility
* Cycling power meter compatibility
* Weight scale compatibility
* Compatibility with sport transitions (such as [[triathlon]]s)
* Training programs (such as intervals)
* Computer connection for logging, mapping and sharing data
* Hydration/nutrition reminders
* Reminder alarms to alternate between [[running]] and [[walking]]
* Accelerometer for tracking indoor swimming
* Touchscreen
* Larger add-on rechargeable battery for longer events ([[marathon]], etc.)

== Purpose ==
A [[GPS]] watch is commonly a sport watch (a device used for sports and exercise in general rather than just GPS functionally). It may be designed for one particular sport or other purpose, or provide modes and features to suit several.

Examples of common purposes:

* [[Data logger|Data logging]]
* Navigation
* [[Fitness training]] (Many watches can be used for many sports such as running, walking, hiking, cycling or swimming)
* Specific sport assistance (such as [[golf]])
* Locating children and adults with intellectual disabilities that are at risk of wandering or elopement.

==[[Inertial footpod|Accelerometer]]-only==
These devices offer similar functions to GPS watches,
but measure speed and distance using a motion sensor (built-in, or a [[Inertial footpod|footpod]] attached to a shoe), instead of GPS.
Since they do not rely on GPS, they can work indoors, but do not track location data for mapping. Certain models include [[heart rate monitor]]ing, either built-in or through a chest-worn sensor. There are also a wide variety of watches that measure only [[Heart rate monitor|heart rate]] and time.
