A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and [[evolution]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].<ref>{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to the conditions of its environment. [[Temperature]], light, [[humidity]], soil nutrients, etc., all influence the species within an environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long-term modifications along the history of the planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]].

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. 

[[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human-induced effects on the environment. 

[[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes:

* The [[natural environment]]
* [[Built environment]]s
* [[Social environment]]s

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimize and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.
