A '''glacial refugium''' (''plural refugia'') is a geographic region which made possible the survival of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in times of [[ice age]]s and allowed for post-glacial re-colonization.<ref>The encyclopedia of earth, http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155685/</ref> Different types of glacial refugia can be distinguished, namely [[nunatak]], peripheral and lowland refugia.<ref name=":0">Holderegger, R., Thiel-Egenter, C.

== Identification of glacial refugia ==
Traditionally, the identification of glacial refugia have occurred through the assessment of palaeoecological evidence, to determine the origins of modern taxa.<ref name=":1" />  For example, paleoecological approaches, which focus on the study of fossil organisms and their remains, have been used to reconstruct the distributions of pollen in Europe, for the 13,000 years since the last glaciation. Researchers in this case ultimately established the spread of forest trees from the mountainous southern fringe of Europe, which suggests that this area served as a glacial refugia during this time.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Munaut| first=André-V.| date=May 1986| title=An Atlas of past and present pollen maps of Europe: 0–13,000 years ago| journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology| volume=47| issue=3–4| pages=411–412| doi=10.1016/0034-6667(86)90044-8| issn=0034-6667}}</ref>

== Different types of glacial refugia ==
In studies exploring the extent of glacial refugia in mountain species, three distinct types of glacial refugia have been identified.<ref name=":0" />

=== Nunatak glacial refugia ===
A nunatak is a type of glacial refugia that is located on the snow-free, exposed peaks of mountains, which lie above the ice sheet during glaciations.<ref name=":0" />  The identification of ‘diversity hotspots’ in areas, which should have been migration regions during major glacial episodes, is evidence for nunatak glacial refugia.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book| title=Nunataks and peripheral refugia for alpine plants during quaternary glaciation in the middle part of the Alps| last=Stehlik, Ivana| date=2000-06-01| publisher=Birkhäuser| oclc=753524599}}</ref>  For example, the [[Monte Rosa]] mountain ranges, the [[Avers]], and the [[Engadin]]e and the [[Bernina Range| Bernina]] are all floristically rich proposed nunatak regions, which are indicative nunatak glacial survival.<ref name=":2" />

=== Peripheral glacial refugia ===
Peripheral glacial refugia still exists within the mountain system but contrary to nunataks, which exist on the peaks, this type of refugia is located along the borders of mountain systems.<ref name=":0" />  Evidence for this type of mountain refugia can be found along the borders of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], [[Pyrenees]] or [[Alps| European Alps]], all of which were formally glaciated mountain systems. For example, using the [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] (AFLP) technique, researchers have been able to infer the survival of ''[[Phyteuma globulariifolium]]'' in peripheral refugia in the European Alps.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Schönswetter| first1=P.| last2=Tribsch| first2=A.| last3=Barfuss| first3=M.| last4=Niklfeld| first4=H.| date=December 2002| title=Several Pleistocene refugia detected in the high alpine plant Phyteuma globulariifolium Sternb. & Hoppe (Campanulaceae) in the European Alps| journal=Molecular Ecology| volume=11| issue=12| pages=2637–2647| doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.2002.01651.x| pmid=12453246| issn=0962-1083}}</ref>

=== Lowland glacial refugia ===
Lowland glacial refugia, unlike nunatak and peripheral glacial refugia, is a type of refugia that exists outside of the mountain system in the lowlands.<ref name=":0" /> Situated beyond the limits of ice shields, lowland refugia has been identified for a number of plant and animal species. For example, through allozyme analysis, researchers have been able to confirm the continuous distribution of ''[[Zygaena exulans]]'' in the between the foothills of the Pyrenees and the Alps during the last ice age.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1=Schmitt| first1=Thomas| last2=Hewitt| first2=Godfrey M.| date=2004-05-07| title=Molecular biogeography of the arctic-alpine disjunct burnet moth species Zygaena exulans (Zygaenidae, Lepidoptera) in the Pyrenees and Alps| journal=Journal of Biogeography| volume=31| issue=6| pages=885–893| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01079.x| issn=0305-0270}}</ref>
