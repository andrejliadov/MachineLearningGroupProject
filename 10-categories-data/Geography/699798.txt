This page is a '''list of geography topics'''.

'''[[Geography]]''' is the study of the [[world]] and of the distribution of life on the earth, including human life and the effects of human activity. Geography research addresses both the questions of ''where'', as well as ''why'', geographical phenomena occur. Geography is a diverse field that seeks to understand the world and all of its human and natural complexities&mdash;not merely where objects are, but how they came to be, and how they have changed since then.
