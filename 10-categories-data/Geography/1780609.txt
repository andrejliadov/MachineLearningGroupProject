[[File:Oceans and seas boundaries map-en.svg|thumb|400px|Marginal seas as defined by the [[International Maritime Organization]]]]
This is a '''list of seas''' – large divisions of the [[World Ocean]], including areas of water, variously gulfs, bights, bays, and straits.

{{expand list|date=July 2016}}

==Terminology==

* [[Ocean]] – the four to seven largest named bodies of water in the World Ocean, all of which have "Ocean" in the name.  See [[Borders of the oceans]] for details.  
* [[Sea]] has several definitions:{{efn|There is no accepted technical definition of ''sea'' among oceanographers. A rather weak definition is that a sea is a subdivision of an ocean, which means that it must have [[oceanic basin]] crust on its floor. This definition, for example, accepts the [[Caspian Sea]], which was once part of an ancient ocean, as a sea.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tLcin2NyJQgC&pg=PA237 | title = The Italian Yearbook of International Law 2004 | isbn = 9789004150270 | last1 = Conforti | first1 = B | last2 = Bravo | first2 = Luigi Ferrari | date = 2005}}</ref> The ''Introduction to Marine Biology'' defines a sea as a "landlocked" body of water, adding that the term "sea" is only one of convenience, but the book is written by marine biologists, not oceanographers.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0JkKOFIj5pgC&pg=PA47 | title = Introduction to Marine Biology | isbn = 9780495561972 | last1 = Karleskint | first1 = George | last2 = Turner | first2 = Richard L | last3 = Small | first3 = James W | date = 2009}}</ref> ''The Glossary of Mapping Sciences'' similarly states that the boundaries between seas and other bodies of water are arbitrary.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPVxSDzVRP0C&pg=PA365 |title=The Glossary of the Mapping Sciences – Google Books |accessdate=2013-04-19|isbn=9780784475706|year=1994}}</ref>}} 
** A '''marginal sea''' is a division of an ocean, partially enclosed by [[island]]s, [[archipelago]]s, or [[peninsula]]s, adjacent to or widely open to the open ocean at the surface, and/or bounded by [[submarine ridge]]s on the sea floor.<ref name="Mapping 1994">{{cite book|author=American Congress on Surveying and Mapping|title=Glossary of the mapping sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jPVxSDzVRP0C&pg=PA469|access-date=9 December 2010|year=1994|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=978-0-7844-0050-0|page=469}}</ref>
** A division of an ocean, delineated by landforms,<ref name="oceanservice.noaa">{{cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanorsea.html |title=What's the difference between an ocean and a sea? |publisher=Oceanservice.noaa.gov |date=11 January 2013 |access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref>  currents (e.g. [[Sargasso Sea]]), or specific latitude or longitude boundaries.  This includes but is not limited to marginal seas, and this is the definition used for inclusion in this list.
** The World Ocean. For example, the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] states that all of the World Ocean is "sea",<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sbqBvQy04XwC&pg=PA271 | title = The Law of the Sea: Selected Writings | isbn = 9789004138636 | last1 = Vukas | first1 = B | year = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5zpbN8I2ZR4C&pg=PA57 | title = Indian Ocean Region: Maritime Regimes for Regional Cooperation | isbn = 9781441959898 | last1 = Gupta | first1 = Manoj | year = 2010}}</ref><ref name="geography.about">{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/waterandice/a/sevenseas.htm |title= Discover The Seven Seas of the Earth |publisher=Geography.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>{{efn|According to this definition, the Caspian would be excluded as it is legally an "international lake".<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uxmInSrE9vQC&pg=PA74 | title = The Politics of Caspian Oil | isbn = 9780333739730 | last1 = Gokay | first1 = Bulent | date = 2001}}</ref>}} and this is also common usage for "the sea".
** Any large body of water with "Sea" in the name, including lakes.
* [[River]] - A small strip of water that flows inland
* [[Tributary]] - A small river that flows into a larger one
* [[Estuary]] - The piece of a river that flows into the sea or ocean
* [[Strait]] - a narrow area of water connecting two wider areas of water, also sometimes known as a passage
*[[Channel (geography)|Channel]] - Usually wider than a strait
*Passage - Connects waters between islands, also sometimes known as a strait
*[[Canal]] - Man-made channel
*[[Fjard]] - A large open water between groups of islands

There are several terms used for bulges of ocean that result from indentations of land, which overlap in definition, and which are not consistently differentiated:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/gulf-coastal-feature|title=gulf – coastal feature|publisher=}}</ref>

* [[Bay]] – generic term; though most features with "Bay" in the name are small, some are very large
* [[wikt:gulf|Gulf]] – a very large bay, often a top-level division of an ocean or sea
* [[Fjord]] – a long bay with steep sides, typically formed by a [[glacier]]
* [[Bight (geography)|Bight]] – a bay that is typically shallower than a sound
* [[Sound (geography)|Sound]] – a large, wide bay which is typically deeper than a bight, or a strait
* [[Cove]] – a very small, typically sheltered bay
* [[Inlet]] – A skinny bay that are like peninsulas but for the sea
*[[Polynya]]  – Least used out of all, Patch of water surrounded by ice

Many features could be considered to be more than one of these, and all of these terms are used in [[Toponymy|place names]] inconsistently; especially bays, gulfs, and bights, which can be very large or very small. This list includes large areas of water no matter the term used in the name.

== Marginal seas ==

Seas may be considered marginal between ocean and land, or between oceans in which case they may be treated as marginal parts of either.  There is no single ultimate authority on the matter.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wang|first=James C.
