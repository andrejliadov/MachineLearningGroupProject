'''Border irregularities of the United States''', particularly [[panhandles]] and highway incursions into other jurisdictions, are shown here. Often they are a result of borders which do not conform to geological features.

== International ==

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Canada–United States border#Boundary divisions}}There are several exclaves between the United States and Canada, including the entire state of [[Alaska]] (though the state can still be accessed by sea from the United States, except the small settlement [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] which is only accessible by road from [[British Columbia]]). Other exclaves include [[Akwesasne]], the [[Northwest Angle]], and [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]]. 

The status of the waters around [[Dixon Entrance|Nunez Rocks]] is disputed. Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation ("bare at half-tide"<ref>{{cite web|title=NOAA Shoreline Data Explorer|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/NSDE/|author=U.S. National Geodetic Survey|accessdate=2015-04-10}}</ref>) area (LTE) that is south of a line known as the "A-B" Line,<ref name="IBRU">{{cite web|url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb5-3_gray.pdf |title=Canada's Unresolved Maritime Boundaries|page=61|last=Gray|first=David H.| work= IBRU Boundary and Security Bulletin|year=Autumn 1997|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref> which was defined in a 1903 arbitration decision on the [[Alaska boundary dispute|Alaska–Canada boundary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/coordinates/PortlandCanal.htm |title= International Boundary Commission definition of the Canada/US boundary in the NAD83 CSRS reference frame |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref> The court specified the initial boundary point (Point "A") at the northern end of Dixon Entrance<ref name="White">{{cite book|title=Boundary Disputes and Treaties|url=https://archive.org/details/boundarydisputes00whit|first=James|last=White|publisher=Glasgow, Brook & Company|location=Toronto|year=1914|pages=[https://archive.org/details/boundarydisputes00whit/page/936 936]–958}}</ref> and Point "B" {{convert|72|nmi|mi km}} to the east.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite book|title=The Alaska Boundary|url=https://archive.org/details/alaskaboundary00davigoog|last=Davidson|first=George|publisher=Alaska Packers Association|location=San Francisco|year=1903|pages=[https://archive.org/details/alaskaboundary00davigoog/page/n87 79]–81, 129–134, 177–179, 229}}</ref> Canada relies on the "A-B" Line as rendering nearly all of Dixon Entrance as Canadian internal waters. The U.S. does not recognize the "A-B" Line as an official boundary, instead regarding it as allocating sovereignty over the land masses within the Dixon Entrance,<ref name="IBRU"/> with Canada's land south of the line. The U.S. regards the waters as subject to international marine law, and in 1977 it defined an equidistant territorial sea throughout Dixon Entrance.<ref name="IBRU"/> This territory, which surrounds Nunez Rocks, extends south of the "A-B" line for the most part.<ref name="IBRU"/> The United States has not ratified the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea Treaty]], although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Another disputed area is the Grey Zone, including [[Machias Seal Island]], in the Gulf of Maine.

The [[Aroostook Valley Country Club]] is a [[golf course]] which straddles the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]], between the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maine]] and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[New Brunswick]]. The club, located near [[Perth-Andover]], New Brunswick and [[Fort Fairfield, Maine]], has its course (except part of the tee area for the ninth hole, and possibly part of a sand trap on the first hole) and clubhouse on the Canadian side of the border and its parking lot and pro shop on the American side.<ref name="clui">{{Cite web |url=http://www.clui.org/section/united-divide-a-linear-portrait-usacanada-border-0 |title=Chapter 1: Eastern Maine |website=United Divide: A Linear Portrait of the USA/Canada Border |publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation |publication-date=Winter 2015}}</ref>

=== Mexico ===
In [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]], shifts in the course of the lower Rio Grande have created numerous [[Enclave and exclave|pene-exclave]]s. Under the [[Boundary Treaty of 1970]] and earlier treaties, the United States and Mexico have maintained the actual course of the river as the international boundary, but both must approve proposed changes. From 1989 to 2009, there were 128 locations where the river changed course, causing land that had been on one side of the river to then occupy the opposite bank. Until the boundary is officially changed, there are 60 small pene-exclaves of the state of [[Texas]] now lying on the southern side of the river, as well as 68 such pene-exclaves of Mexico on the northern side of the river.

=== Russia ===
The legal status of the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement|U.S.-Russian border]] is unclear. The United States Senate ratified a treaty setting the boundary with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. However, shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the [[Russian parliament]] never voted on the treaty.

==States and territories==

=== Separated by the water ===

*[[Rosecrans Memorial Airport]], though lying within the city limits of [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], is inaccessible by land from Missouri due to a change in the course of the [[Missouri River]] following the [[Great Flood of 1951]]. It is accessible only by crossing the river, then turning north through [[Elwood, Kansas]].
*[[Delaware]] has two [[exclaves]] of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of the [[Delaware Bay]] northwest of [[Fort Mott (New Jersey)|Fort Mott State Park]] and [[Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge]]: [[Finns Point]] and [[Artificial Island, Delaware]] near the [[Salem Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. At that point, the border runs along New Jersey's mean [[Low-tide elevation|low-tide mark]]. Thus when the spoils from the navigational [[dredging]] of the bay were dumped alongside Fort Mott and the Salem plant excavations nearby, both sites became part of [[New Castle County, Delaware]].
*Iowa's city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa|Carter Lake]] on the Nebraska side of the Missouri River.
*Several small areas of western Kentucky lie north of the [[Ohio River]] on what is otherwise the Indiana side, including one area south of [[Evansville, Indiana]] that accommodates [[Ellis Park Race Course|a horse racing track]].
*Several portions of Nebraska lie east of the [[Missouri River]], mainly due to flooding and changes in the river's path:
**[[DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge]] near Blair, which borders Iowa. A portion of Iowa is also on the Nebraska side in the same area.
**[[McKissick Island]] near Peru, which borders Missouri.
**A section of land that borders Iowa, [[Sloan, Iowa|Sloan]].
**Onawa Materials Yard Wildlife Area and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Management Area near [[Onawa, Iowa]].
*The mainland portion of [[Newport County, Rhode Island]] is separated from the rest of the state by the delta of the [[Taunton River]]. The only land connection is through [[Massachusetts]], but it is possible to access these communities by bridge without leaving Rhode Island.
*The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is separated by the Chesapeake Bay from the rest of the Commonwealth.
*Divided coastal islands:
** Rhode Island and Connecticut share [[Sandy Point Island]] in [[Little Narragansett Bay]].
** New Jersey and New York share [[Shooter's Island]], a bird sanctuary located in the south end of [[Newark Bay]] off the north shore of [[Staten Island]]. (The small portion in New Jersey is further divided between two counties.)
** Delaware and Maryland share [[Fenwick Island (Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]].
** Maryland and Virginia share [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]] in [[Chesapeake Bay]], as well as [[Assateague Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Virginia and North Carolina share [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]], [[Mon Island, North Carolina|Mon Island]] and [[Simon Island, Virginia|Simon Island]], separated from the Atlantic by an intracoastal waterway.
** North Carolina and South Carolina share [[Bird Island, North Carolina|Bird Island]] on the Atlantic coast.
** Florida and Alabama share [[Perdido Key]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share [[South Rigolets Island]] in the Gulf of Mexico.
** Alabama and Mississippi share an island between [[Bayou Heron]] and [[Mattie Clark Bayou]] on the Gulf Coast.
** Minnesota and Wisconsin share [[Interstate Island]] State Wildlife Management Area in [[Saint Louis River (Lake Superior tributary)|Saint Louis Bay]] between Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin.
** Michigan and Ohio share [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]] in Lake Erie.
** At the mouth of the [[Columbia River]], Oregon and Washington share [[Sand Island (Oregon)|Sand Island Dike]] and [[Rice Island (Oregon)|Rice Island]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/WA/jbh-lc/Draft%20CCP%20EIS/2%20Chapter%202%20Alternatives%20Goals%20Objectives%20and%20Strategies.pdf|title=Lewis and Clark and Julia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuges Draft CCP/EIS Chapter 2.

==== Separated by the Mississippi River ====
These border irregularities were caused by changes in the [[Mississippi River]] during the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]] or other river changes:

*Over a period of about 24 hours on 7 March 1876, the Mississippi River abandoned its former channel that defined the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Tennessee's [[Reverie, Tennessee|Reverie]] and [[Corona, Tennessee|Corona]], located in [[Tipton County, Tennessee|Tipton County]] north-northwest of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | title = Tipton | work = Tennessee History for Kids | date = 2010-01-18 | publisher = Tennessee History for Kids | location = [[Nashville, Tennessee]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706152404/http://www.tnhistoryforkids.org/local/tipton | archivedate = 2010-07-06 }}</ref>

Other irregularities involving the [[Mississippi River]]: 
*Arkansas has territory at {{coord|35.65|N|89.87|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} across the Mississippi River on the northwest edge of Tennessee's [[Fort Pillow State Park]], north of the Corona/Reverie, Tennessee irregularity (mentioned in the previous section).
*Illinois's [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], Missouri's [[Grand Tower Island]] and other Illinois and Missouri territory on each other's side of the Mississippi River.
*The [[Kentucky Bend]] between Missouri and Tennessee.
*The state of [[Mississippi]] controls at least 11 exclaves on the west bank of the Mississippi River in [[Louisiana]], while Louisiana owns 8 exclaves on Mississippi's side.
*Louisiana and Mississippi also share 3 islands, at 31.754078 degrees north, 91.376270 west; 31.885015 north, 91.228315 west; as well as [[Middle Ground Island]], Togo Island, Davis Island at {{coord|32.13|N|91.05|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, an island at {{coord|32.371|N|90.889|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Stack Island at {{coord|32.824|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, Cottonwood Island at {{coord|32.651|N|91.157|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, and an island at {{coord|32.674|N|91.147|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas share an island at their tri-point at {{coord|33.006|N|91.169|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*Mississippi also owns 14 exclaves on the bank in [[Arkansas]], while Arkansas has 15 of its own on Mississippi's side.
*Arkansas and Mississippi share islands at {{coord|34.895|N|90.268|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.229|N|90.847|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.829|N|90.431|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.177|N|90.885|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.732|N|91.142|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.142|N|91.092|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.129|N|91.136|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.235|N|91.098|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.358|N|91.118|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.393|N|91.106|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.408|N|91.124|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.498|N|91.176|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.569|N|91.171|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|33.757|N|91.117|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.247|N|90.922|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.297|N|90.743|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.679|N|90.566|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.847|N|90.388|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|34.888|N|90.284|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.025|N|90.252|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}, {{coord|35.039|N|90.208|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}} and {{coord|33.382|N|91.116|W|type:isle_region:US-AR_dim:4600|display=inline}}.
*There are also many irregularities along the river between Arkansas/Tennessee, Missouri/Tennessee, and Missouri/Kentucky.

=== Other irregularities ===

*[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] is surrounded by the states of [[Virginia]] (on its southwest side) and [[Maryland]] (on its southeast, northeast, and northwest sides); it interrupts those states' common border, which is the south shore of the [[Potomac River]] both upstream and downstream from the District. The portion of the Potomac River that passes Washington is virtually entirely within the District's border, as the District extends to the south bank.
*[[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] remains legally part of the borough of [[Manhattan]], even though it was separated from the island of Manhattan by construction of the Harlem Ship Canal in 1895 and then connected to the mainland and the [[Bronx]] in 1914.
*The [[Wedge (border)|Delaware Wedge]] adjacent to Maryland and Pennsylvania<ref>.{{cite web | url = http://chriswhong.com/mdbounds/ | title = The Boundary Disputes of Colonial Maryland | first = Christopher M. | last = Whong | date = 2000-12-11 | location = [[Baltimore, Maryland]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20 }}</ref>
*The [[Erie Triangle]].
*Michigan's [[Lost Peninsula]] Marina and neighboring [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Washington Township, Lucas County, Ohio]]; resulting from [[Monroe County, Michigan#Border disputes|Toledo War border realignment]].
*Massachusetts's [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick Jog]].
*Missouri's [[Missouri Bootheel|Bootheel]].
*The above-water portion of [[Liberty Island]] is part of [[New York State]], but being located in [[New York Bay]], is entirely surrounded by the waters of [[New Jersey]]. Ellis Island is also in the waters of New Jersey, but the naturally formed part of the island belongs to New York, while the artificial infill portion surrounding it belongs to New Jersey. The original land area of Ellis Island is a true exclave of New York State.
*[[Cupsogue Beach County Park]] on [[Long Island]] in New York is part of the town of [[Brookhaven, NY|Brookhaven]] but can only be accessed by road by going through [[Westhampton Beach]] in the town of [[Southampton, NY|Southampton]] due to the barrier island being cut in a Nor'easter in 1931, creating [[Moriches Inlet]].
*[[Kure Atoll]] in [[Hawaii]] is an exclave of Hawaii — it is separated from the rest of Hawaii because of [[Midway Atoll]] (Midway Atoll is politically part of the [[U.S. Minor Outlying Islands]], not the state of Hawaii).<ref>http://www.arrl.org/news/dx-group-seeks-reconsideration-of-kure-atoll-dxpedition-permit-application arrl.org.

* [[Twelve-Mile Circle|Parts of Delaware exist within NJ]] - Delaware and New Jersey are largely divided by the Delaware River and Delaware Bay. However, the two states also share two land borders. For example, in Pennsville NJ, a section of land that is mainly marsh area, (approximately {{convert|1.7|mi|km|disp=or|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|0.6|mi|km|disp=or|sp=us}} wide) is actually owned by Delaware.  <ref>https://www.nj.com/news/g66l-2019/02/8d5d160f2b5307/a-little-piece-of-delaware-is-actually-hidden-in-nj-how-did-that-happen.html#:~:text=The%20Land%20in%20question,states%20share%20two%20land%20borders.</ref>

==Highway system irregularities==
*[[Oklahoma State Highway 20]] forms a concurrency with [[Arkansas Highway 43]] between [[Maysville, Arkansas]] and the [[Missouri]] state line, where AR-43 becomes [[Missouri Highway 43]].
*[[Interstate 24]] briefly enters [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a few miles but comes back into [[Tennessee]], and retains Tennessee exit numbers, but not Tennessee mile markers.
*[[Minnesota State Highway 23]] enters [[Wisconsin]] near [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] for {{convert|1/2|mi|km|spell=in}}.
*[[Interstate 684]], otherwise in New York, takes a shortcut across the northwest corner of the [[Connecticut Panhandle]] without any exits or signage save a standard Connecticut sign welcoming travelers to [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].
*[[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]], formerly [[New York State Route 17|NY 17]], drops just south of the [[New York-Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] for approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} between [[Waverly, Tioga County, New York|Waverly]] and [[Sayre, Pennsylvania|Sayre]]. The crossing is indicated by signs in both directions, but the New York signage and exit numbering remain (prior to being converted to an interstate, Route 17's sequential exit numbering began at its Pennsylvania terminus and continued into New York, one of the few highways in the U.S. where this was so; however, it is not uncommon for state highways to retain their route numbers when they change state highway shields at the border).
*[[New York State Route 120A]] runs along the Connecticut state line for much of its length, apart from {{convert|3.6|mi|km}} that enter the state, yet retains its New York signage and is still maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]].
*Montana State Highway 43 runs for approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} inside Idaho, between [[Chief Joseph Pass]] and [[Lost Trail Pass]]. It crosses into Montana again just yards from its junction with [[US 93]].
*The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carries [[I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|I-495]] (the Capital Beltway) across the [[Potomac River]] south of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. It connects [[Maryland]] on the east shore of the river with [[Virginia]] on the west shore. However, a few hundred feet of roadway close to the Virginia side crosses the southernmost point of the District of Columbia and thus is in neither Maryland nor Virginia.
*{{convert|13|mi|km}} of [[Pennsylvania Route 426]] goes through [[New York (state)|New York]], though unlike other state highways on the list that briefly enter other states with their normal symbols, this one is badged as [[New York State Route 426]] between both borders of [[Pennsylvania]].
*Highways [[U.S. Route 2|US-2]] and [[U.S. Route 141|US-141]] run in the state of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] twice nonconsecutively.
*[[New Jersey Route 440]] enters [[New York (state)|New York]] at [[Outerbridge Crossing]], becomes [[New York State Route 440]] for {{convert|13|mi|km}}, and then re-enters [[New Jersey]] at [[Bayonne Bridge]] and becomes again New Jersey Route 440.
*Near [[Williamson, West Virginia]], [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 52]] crosses the [[West Virginia]]/[[Kentucky]] border (the [[Tug Fork River]]) 4 times, entering [[Pike County, Kentucky]] twice, and both times re-entering [[Mingo County, West Virginia]] within {{convert|1|mi|km}}. 
*[[U.S. Route 62]] starts at the Mexican border in [[El Paso, Texas]], enters [[New Mexico]] near [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]], travels through New Mexico for {{convert|110|mi|km}}, and then re-enters Texas near [[Hobbs, New Mexico]].  (Also, U.S. Route 62 is the only east-west (even-numbered) [[U.S. highway]] that travels from Mexico to Canada, ending in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] within {{convert|1|mi|km}} of the Canadian border.)
*[[U.S. Route 72]] starts in [[Tennessee]] (in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]), travels through [[Mississippi]] for {{convert|90|mi|km}}, travels through [[Alabama]] for {{convert|167|mi|km}}, and then re-enters Tennessee (and ends in [[Chattanooga]]).
*Highway [[U.S. Route 395|US 395]]  crosses from [[California]] into [[Nevada]] at Topaz Lake and {{convert|85|mi|km}} later re-enters California.
*[[U.S. Route 95]] starts in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] at the Mexican border in [[Arizona]].  It crosses the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Pacific Time Zone]] and California.  In [[Oregon]] it re-enters the Mountain Time Zone.  In [[Idaho]] it crosses the Pacific/Mountain time zone boundary 3 more times in [[Idaho County]], ending at the Canadian border in the Pacific Time Zone. 
*In [[Indiana]], [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|I-64]] crosses the Central/Eastern time zone boundary 5 times between mileposts 60 and 80.
*[[Interstate 65|I-65]] begins in the [[Central Time Zone]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], crosses into the [[Eastern Time Zone]] in [[Kentucky]], and {{convert|260|mi|km}} later re-enters the Central Time Zone in northwestern [[Indiana]].
*A straight section of [[Texas State Highway 115]] travels through four counties ([[Andrews County, Texas|Andrews]], [[Martin County, Texas|Martin]], [[Gaines County, Texas|Gaines]], and [[Dawson County, Texas|Dawson]]) in a distance of less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}.

===Highway exclaves===
Some highways are not connected to the rest of their nominal highway systems:
*In addition to Alaska and Hawaii being separated from the [[Contiguous United States|Lower 48]], each has discontinuous road systems that are internally isolated. [[Alaska Route 7]] and the other roads near [[Juneau, Alaska]] remain separated by [[ferry]] from other road systems.  [[Alaska Route 7]] has four separate, disconnected segments, running through (listed from south to north) [[Ketchikan]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Juneau]], and [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]].
*[[Abbott Drive|Iowa Highway 165]] in [[Carter Lake, Iowa]], is the only state highway in Iowa to be entirely west of the [[Missouri River]]. The highway is the middle span of the [[Omaha, Nebraska]] road named [[Abbott Drive]], and is not directly connected to any other street. The rest of Carter Lake is a separate street system exclave accessible only from Locust Street or Avenue H in Omaha.
*In [[Atchison County, Missouri]], [[Missouri supplemental route]] V is separated from the rest of Missouri's highway system. It connects only to roads in [[Fremont County, Iowa]]. This is due to lying northwest of the [[Nishnabotna River]].
*[[New York State Route 171]], near [[Utica, New York|Utica]], does not intersect any other state highways (it once did, with [[New York State Route 5S|NY 5S]], but a realignment of that route took it away from the one intersection that NY 171 had).
*[[New Jersey Route 324]] is an isolated route in [[Logan Township, New Jersey]] that connects to the former docks of a ferry on the [[Delaware River]] carrying [[US Route 322]] to [[Chester, Pennsylvania]].
