== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.<ref>{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}</ref>
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archive-date = 1 September 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}</ref>

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation & life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.<ref name="AAG"/>

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.<ref>Martiny JBH et al.

* [[Climatology]] &ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].<ref>{{cite web|website =National Weather Service: Climate Prediction Center|url = http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C |title= Climate Glossary|publisher = NOAA|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208233912/http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml|archive-date = 8 February 2007}}</ref>
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &ndash; study of soils in their natural environment<ref>{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |access-date = 2006-06-08}}</ref> that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6&nbsp;million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.<ref>Wu, J. 2006.

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.<ref name="AAG">{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |access-date=October 9, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=October 6, 2006}}</ref>

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 }}</ref>
** [[Children's geographies]] &ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of foci within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,<ref>Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.</ref>
**# [[Linguistic geography]] &ndash; deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.<ref>{{cite book|last = Pei|first = Mario |date =1966|title = Glossary of linguistic terminology|location= New York|publisher = Columbia University Press|isbn = 9780231030120}}</ref><ref>Trudgill, P.

* [[Development geography]] &ndash; study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).
* [[Economic geography]] &ndash; study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.<ref name= "qr10">[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010</ref> It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

::''1.'' [[Africa]] &nbsp; ([[Outline of Africa|outline]]) &ndash;
::''2.'' [[Antarctica]] &ndash;
::''3.'' [[Australia]] &nbsp; ([[Outline of Australia|outline]]) &ndash;
: The Americas:
::''4.'' [[North America]] &nbsp; ([[Outline of North America|outline]]) &ndash;

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Biogeographic realm|Realm]] &ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than a realm that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.
** {{annotated link|Village}} &ndash; clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet with the population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand (sometimes tens of thousands).
** {{annotated link|Town}} &ndash; human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size a settlement must be in order to be called a "town" varies considerably in different parts of the world, so that, for example, many American "small towns" seem to British people to be no more than villages, while many British "small towns" would qualify as cities in the United States.
*** {{annotated link|Urban hierarchy}} &ndash; ranks the structure of towns within an area.
**** {{annotated link|1st-order towns}} &ndash; bare minimum of essential services, such as bread and milk.
**** {{annotated link|2nd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|3rd-order towns}}
**** {{annotated link|4th-order towns}}
** {{annotated link|City}} &ndash; relatively large and permanent settlement. In many regions, a city is distinguished from a town by attainment of designation according to law, for instance being required to obtain articles of incorporation or a royal charter.
*** {{annotated link|Financial centre}}
*** {{annotated link|Primate city}} &ndash; the leading city in its country or region, disproportionately larger than any others in the urban hierarchy.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolis}} &ndash; very large city or urban area which is a significant economic, political and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections and communications.
*** {{annotated link|Metropolitan area}} &ndash; region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing.<ref>Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, & Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002)</ref>
*** {{annotated link|Global city}} &ndash; city that is deemed to be an important node in the global economic system. Globalization is largely created, facilitated and enacted in strategic geographic locales (including global cities) according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.
*** {{annotated link|Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis}} &ndash; chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas. An example is the huge metropolitan area along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. extending from Boston, Massachusetts through New York City; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland and ending in Washington, D.C..
*** {{annotated link|Eperopolis}} &ndash; theoretical "continent city". The world does not have one yet. Will Europe become the first one?
*** {{annotated link|Ecumenopolis}} &ndash; theoretical "world city". Will the world ever become so urbanized as to be called this?

** {{annotated link|Building}} &ndash; closed structure with walls and a roof.
** {{annotated link|Canal}} &ndash; artificial waterway, often connecting one body of water with another.
** {{annotated link|Causeway}}
** {{annotated link|Dam}} &ndash; structure placed across a flowing body of water to stop the flow, usually to use the water for irrigation or to generate electricity.
*** {{annotated link|Dike (construction)|Dike}} &ndash; barrier of stone or earth used to hold back water and prevent flooding.

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.

== Nature of geography ==

=== Geography is  ===

* an [[academic discipline]] &ndash; a body of knowledge given to − or received by − a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks to understand the Earth and all of its human and natural complexities − not merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. Geography has been called 'the world discipline'.<ref>{{cite book|last = Bonnett|first= Alastair |title =  What is Geography?|location= London|publisher = Sage|date = 2008|isbn =9781412918688}}</ref>
* a [[fields of science|field of science]] &ndash; widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many geography-related scientific journals.
** a [[natural science]] &ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of natural environment (physical geography).
** a [[social science]] &ndash; field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society (human geography).
* an [[interdisciplinary field]] &ndash; a field that crosses traditional boundaries between academic disciplines or schools of thought, as new needs and professions have emerged. Many of the branches of physical geography are also branches of Earth science.

== Branches of geography ==

As "the bridge between the human and physical sciences," geography is divided into two main branches:
*human geography
*physical geography<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|title = Geography: The Mother of Sciences|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901102227/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf|archive-date = 1 September 2003}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html |title=Elements of Geography|last= Pidwirny|first= M.|date=2006|work = Fundamentals of Physical Geography|edition = 2nd |publisher=Physicalgeography.net}}</ref>

Other branches include:
*integrated geography
*geomatics
*regional geography

All the branches are further described below...

=== Physical geography ===

* [[Physical geography]] &ndash; examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation & life, soil, water, and landforms are produced and interact.<ref name="AAG"/>

==== Fields of physical geography ====

* [[Geomorphology]] &ndash; study of landforms and the processes that them, and more broadly, of the processes controlling the topography of any planet. Seeks to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics, and to predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling.
* [[Hydrology]] &ndash; study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth, including the hydrologic cycle, water resources and environmental watershed sustainability.
** [[Glaciology]] &ndash; study of glaciers, or more generally ice and natural phenomena that involve ice.
** [[Oceanography]] &ndash; studies a wide range of topics pertaining to oceans, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries.
* [[Biogeography]] &ndash; study of the distribution of species spatially and temporally. Over areal [[ecology|ecological]] changes, it is also tied to the concepts of species and their past, or present living '[[refugium (population biology)|refugium]]', their survival locales, or their interim living sites. It aims to reveal where organisms live, and at what abundance.<ref>Martiny JBH et al.

* [[Climatology]] &ndash; study of [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a period of [[time]].<ref>{{cite web|website =National Weather Service: Climate Prediction Center|url = http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml#C |title= Climate Glossary|publisher = NOAA|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208233912/http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/outreach/glossary.shtml|archive-date = 8 February 2007}}</ref>
* [[Meteorology]] is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology).
* [[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]] &ndash; study of soils in their natural environment<ref>{{cite web |url = http://natres.psu.ac.th/Link/SoilCongress/bdd/symp45/75-t.pdf | title = Soil Preservation and the Future of Pedology | author = Ronald Amundsen |access-date = 2006-06-08}}</ref> that deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], and [[soil classification]].
* [[Palaeogeography]] &ndash; study of what the geography was in times past, most often concerning the physical landscape, but also the human or cultural environment.
* [[Coastal geography]] &ndash; study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology and oceanography) and the human geography (sociology and history) of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal weathering processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weather, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast.
* [[Quaternary science]] &ndash; focuses on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6&nbsp;million years, including the last ice age and the Holocene period.
* [[Landscape ecology]] &ndash; the relationship between spatial patterns of urban development and ecological processes on a multitude of landscape scales and organizational levels.<ref>Wu, J. 2006.

==== Approaches of physical geography ====

* [[Quantitative geography]] &ndash; [[Quantitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography. See also the [[quantitative revolution]].
* [[Systems approach]] &ndash;

=== Human geography ===

* [[Human geography]] &ndash; one of the two main subfields of geography, it is the study of human use and understanding of the world and the processes which have affected it. Human geography broadly differs from physical geography in that it focuses on the [[built environment]] and how space is created, viewed, and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy.<ref name="AAG">{{Cite web|title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=Association of American Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |access-date=October 9, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=October 6, 2006}}</ref>

==== Fields of human geography ====

* [[Cultural geography]] &ndash; study of cultural products and norms and their variations across and relations to spaces and places. It focuses on describing and analyzing the ways language, religion, economy, government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant, from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Jordan-Bychkov, Terry G. |author2=Domosh, Mona |author3=Rowntree, Lester | title=The human mosaic: a thematic introduction to cultural geography | year=1994 | publisher=HarperCollinsCollegePublishers | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-06-500731-2 }}</ref>
** [[Children's geographies]] &ndash; study of places and spaces of children's lives, characterized experientially, politically and ethically. Children's geographies rests on the idea that children as a social group share certain characteristics which are experientially, politically and ethically significant and which are worthy of study. The pluralisation in the title is intended to imply that children's lives will be markedly different in differing times and places and in differing circumstances such as gender, family, and class. The range of foci within children's geographies include:
*** Children and the city
*** Children and the countryside
*** Children and technology
*** Children and nature,
*** Children and globalization
*** Methodologies of researching children's worlds
*** Ethics of researching children's worlds
*** [[Otherness of childhood]]
** [[Animal geographies]] &ndash; studies the spaces and places occupied by animals in human culture, because social life and space is heavily populated by animals of many differing kinds and in many differing ways (e.g. farm animals, pets, wild animals in the city). Another impetus that has influenced the development of the field are ecofeminist and other environmentalist viewpoints on nature-society relations (including questions of animal welfare and rights).
** [[Language geography]] &ndash; studies the geographic distribution of language or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language:
**# Geography of languages &ndash; deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,<ref>Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.</ref>
**# [[Linguistic geography]] &ndash; deals with regional linguistic variations within languages.<ref>{{cite book|last = Pei|first = Mario |date =1966|title = Glossary of linguistic terminology|location= New York|publisher = Columbia University Press|isbn = 9780231030120}}</ref><ref>Trudgill, P.

* [[Development geography]] &ndash; study of the Earth's geography with reference to the standard of living and quality of life of its human inhabitants. Measures development by looking at economic, political and social factors, and seeks to understand both the geographical causes and consequences of varying development, in part by comparing More Economically Developed Countries (MEDCs) with Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs).
* [[Economic geography]] &ndash; study of the location, distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the world. Subjects of interest include but are not limited to the location of industries, economies of agglomeration (also known as "linkages"), transportation, international trade and development, real estate, gentrification, ethnic economies, gendered economies, core-periphery theory, the economics of urban form, the relationship between the environment and the economy (tying into a long history of geographers studying culture-environment interaction), and globalization.
** [[Marketing geography]] &ndash; a discipline within marketing analysis which uses geolocation (geographic information) in the process of planning and implementation of marketing activities.<ref name= "qr10">[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dq209/publications/recommending10quercia.pdf "Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data"], Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010</ref> It can be used in any aspect of the marketing mix – the product, price, promotion, or place (geo targeting).
** [[Transportation geography]] &ndash; branch of economic geography that investigates spatial interactions between people, freight and information. It studies humans and their use of vehicles or other modes of traveling as well as how markets are serviced by flows of finished goods and raw materials.
* [[Health geography]] &ndash; application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of health, disease, and health care, to provide a spatial understanding of a population's health, the distribution of disease in an area, and the environment's effect on health and disease. It also deals with accessibility to health care and spatial distribution of health care providers.
** [[Time geography]] &ndash; study of the temporal factor on spatial human activities within the following constraints:
# Authority - limits of accessibility to certain places or domains placed on individuals by owners or authorities
# Capability - limitations on the movement of individuals, based on their nature. For example, movement is restricted by biological factors, such as the need for food, drink, and sleep
# Coupling - restraint of an individual, anchoring him or her to a location while interacting with other individuals in order to complete a task
* [[Historical geography]] &ndash; study of the human, physical, fictional, theoretical, and "real" geographies of the past, and seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved, by understanding how a place or region changes through time, including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape.
* [[Political geography]] &ndash; study of the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Basically, the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.
** [[Electoral geography]] &ndash; study of the relationship between election results and the regions they affect (such as the environmental impact of voting decisions), and of the effects of regional factors upon voting behavior.
** [[Geopolitics]] &ndash; analysis of geography, history and social science with reference to spatial politics and patterns at various scales, ranging from the level of the state to international.
** [[Strategic geography]] &ndash; concerned with the control of, or access to, spatial areas that affect the security and prosperity of nations.
** [[Military geography]] &ndash; the application of geographic tools, information, and techniques to solve military problems in peacetime or war.
* [[Population geography]] &ndash; study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places.
* [[Tourism geography]] &ndash; study of travel and tourism, as an industry and as a social and cultural activity, and their effect on places, including the [[environmental impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.
* [[Urban geography]] &ndash; the study of urban areas, in terms of concentration, infrastructure, economy, and environmental impacts.

* [[Qualitative geography]] &ndash; [[qualitative research]] tools and methods applied to geography.

=== Integrated geography ===

* [[Integrated geography]] &ndash; branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. It requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, ecology, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment.

=== Geomatics ===

* [[Geomatics]] &ndash; branch of geography and the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information. It is a widespread interdisciplinary field that includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems, photogrammetry, and related forms of earth mapping.

=== Regional geography ===

[[Regional geography]] &ndash; study of world regions. Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural elements, human elements, and regionalization which covers the techniques of delineating space into regions. Regional geography breaks down into the study of specific regions.

[[Region]] &ndash; an area, defined by physical characteristics, human characteristics, or functional characteristics. The term is used in various ways among the different branches of geography. A region can be seen as a collection of smaller units, such as a country and its political divisions, or as one part of a larger whole, as in a country on a continent.

==== Continents ====

[[Continent]] &ndash; one of several large [[landmass]]es on [[Earth]]. They are generally identified by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] rather than any specific criteria, but seven areas are commonly regarded as continents. They are:

::''1.'' [[Africa]] &nbsp; ([[Outline of Africa|outline]]) &ndash;
::''2.'' [[Antarctica]] &ndash;
::''3.'' [[Australia]] &nbsp; ([[Outline of Australia|outline]]) &ndash;
: The Americas:

==== Natural geographic features ====

Natural geographic feature &ndash; an ecosystem or natural landform.

===== Ecosystems =====

[[Ecosystem]] &ndash; community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. 
* {{Annotated link|Biodiversity hotspot}}
* [[Biogeographic realm|Realm]] &ndash; broadest biogeographic division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. 
** [[Ecoprovince]] &ndash; biogeographic unit smaller than a realm that contains one or more ecoregions.

{{See also|List of landforms}}

[[Landform|Natural landform]] &ndash; terrain or body of water. Landforms are topographical elements, and are defined by their surface form and location in the landscape. Landforms are categorized by traits such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. Some landforms are artificial, such as certain islands, but most landforms are natural.

==== Artificial geographic features ====
Artificial geographic feature &ndash; a thing that was made by humans that may be indicated on a map. It may be physical and exist in the real world (like a bridge or city), or it may be abstract and exist only on maps (such as the Equator, which has a defined location, but cannot be seen where it lies).

* {{annotated link|Human settlement|Settlement}}
** {{annotated link|Hamlet (place)}} &ndash; rural settlement which is too small to be considered a village. Historically, when a hamlet became large enough to justify building a church, it was then classified as a village. One example of a hamlet is a small cluster of houses surrounding a mill.

== Persons influential in geography ==
{{Main|Geographer|List of geographers|List of Graeco-Roman geographers}}

A [[geographer]] is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Earth]]'s physical [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[human]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Geographers are historically known for making [[map]]s, the subdiscipline of geography known as [[cartography]]. They study the physical details of the environment and also its effect on human and [[wildlife]] [[ecology|ecologies]], [[weather]] and [[climate]] patterns, [[economics]], and [[culture]]. Geographers focus on the spatial relationships between these elements.
