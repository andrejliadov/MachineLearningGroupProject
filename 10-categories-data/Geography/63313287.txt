A '''Geo-fence warrant''' (also known as a '''geofence warrant''') is a [[search warrant]] issued by a court to allow [[law enforcement]] to search a database to find all active [[mobile devices]] within a particular [[geo-fence]] area.  Courts have granted law enforcement geofence warrants to obtain information from databases such as [[Google]]'s [[Sensorvault]] which collect users' historical [[geo-location]] data via [[GPS]] records.<ref>Valentino-DeVries, Jennifer (2019-04-13).
