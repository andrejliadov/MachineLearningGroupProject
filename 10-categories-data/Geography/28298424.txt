'''Aethiopian''', '''Æthiopian''',<ref>[http://ethiopia.limbo13.com/index.php/mapping_africa/ Road to Ethiopia]</ref> '''Æthiopic''' or '''Ethiopian Sea''' or '''Ocean''' ({{lang-la|Æthiopicum Mare}} or ''Oceanus Æthiopicus''; {{lang-ar|البحر الأثيوبي}}) was the name given to the southern half of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in classical geographical works. The name appeared in maps from ancient times up to the turn of the 19th century.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rennel_map_1799.png 1799] [[James Rennell]] map with the Aethiopian Sea in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] area.</ref>

==Geography==
{{see also|Aethiopia}}
The originally Greek term Okeanos Aithiopos is an old name for what is now called the South Atlantic Ocean. It is separated from the North Atlantic Ocean by a narrow region between [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal, Brazil]] and [[Monrovia, Liberia]]. The term Ethiopian Ocean appeared until the mid-19th century, for example on the map ''Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta'', engraved by [[Johann Baptist Homann]] and [[Frederick de Wit]] and published by [[Jacob von Sandrart]] in [[Nürnberg]] in 1702.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Accuratissima_Totius_Africae_in_Lucem_Producta,_by_Jacob_Sandrart,_Nurnberg,_1702,_engraved_by_Johann_Baptist_Homann_Sr._and_Frederick_de_Wit_-_Maps_of_Africa_-_Robert_C._Williams_Paper_Museum_-_DSC00605.JPG ''Accuratissima Totius Africae in Lucem Producta'' 1702 map]</ref>

The name Aethiopian was related to the fact that, historically, [[Africa]] west and south of Egypt was known as [[Aethiopia]]. Nowadays the classical use of the term has become obsolete. Also the nation of [[Ethiopia]], then known as Abyssinia, is located nowhere near its namesake body of water but in the opposite eastern end of Africa which is much closer to Indian Ocean and its subset the [[Red Sea]].<ref>[http://www.geocurrents.info/historical-geography/the-migration-of-place-names-africa-libya-ethiopia-eritrea-and-sudan The Migration of Place Names: Africa, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan]</ref>

[[Ancient Greek]] historians [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mentioned that the [[Gorgons]] lived in the [[Gorgades (Islands)|Gorgades]], islands in the Aethiopian Sea. The main island was called Cerna and, according to [[Henry T. Riley]], these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]].<ref>Ovid, ''The Metamorphoses'', commented by Henry T. Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref>
[[File:Iberian_mare_clausum_claims.svg|thumb|left|300px|Portugal claimed the Aethiopian Sea as its ''[[mare clausum]]'' during the [[Age of Discovery]].]]
On 16th century maps, the name of the Northern Atlantic Ocean was ''Sinus Occidentalis'', while the central Atlantic, southwest of present-day [[Liberia]], appeared as ''Sinus Atlanticus'' and the Southern Atlantic as ''Mare Aethiopicum''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/.../handbuchderozean01bogu_djvu.txt Georg Heinrich von Boguslawski, ''Handbuch der Ozeanographie'', 1907.]</ref> 

By the 17th century [[John Seller]] divided the Atlantic Ocean in two parts by means of the [[equator]]. He named the northern portion of the Atlantic "Mar del Nort" and the southern part "Oceanus Æthiopicus" in his ''Atlas Maritimus'' published in 1672.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/atlasmaritimusor00sell Seller, John, fl. 1658-1698, ''Atlas maritimus, or A book of charts : Describeing the sea coasts capes headlands sands shoals rocks and dangers the bayes roads harbors rivers and ports, in most of the knowne parts of the world. With the true courses and distances, from one place to another : Gathered from the latest and best discoveryes, that have bin made by divers able and experienced navigators of our English nation : Accommodated with an hydrographicall description of the whole world.'']</ref> [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] did not label the North Atlantic at all but called the portion south of the [[equator]] the "Aethiopian Sea" in a map that was published posthumously in 1683.<ref>[http://jcb.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet/detail/JCBMAPS~1~1~1568~101920002:A-New-Mapp-of-the-World-According-t A New Mapp of the World According to Mr. Edward Wright Commonly called Mercator's-Projection.]</ref> [[John Thornton (cartographer)|John Thornton]] used the term in "A New Map of the World" from 1703.<ref>Ian K. Steele, ''The English Atlantic, 1675-1740: An Exploration of Communication and Community'', Oxford, {{ISBN|978-0-19-503968-9}}</ref>

Decades after the terms Ethiopian Ocean or Ethiopian Sea had fallen into disuse to refer to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, botanist [[William Albert Setchell]] (1864–1943) used the term for the sea around certain islands close to [[Antarctica]].<ref> Setchell, W. A. 1932. ''Macrocystis and its holdfasts.'' Univ. California Publ. Bot. 16: 445-492, in [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2436539 George F. Papenfuss, ''Studies of South African Phaeophyceae. I. Ecklonia maxima, Laminaria pallida, Macrocystis pyrifera'', American Journal of Botany, Vol. 29, No. 1 (Jan., 1942), pp. 15-24]</ref>
