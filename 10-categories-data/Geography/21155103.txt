'''Armenia Time''' ('''AMT''') is a [[time zone]] used in [[Armenia]]. Armenia Time is four hours ahead of [[UTC]] at [[UTC+04:00]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Nautical Almanac Office (U S )|title=The Nautical Almanac for the Year 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi3A8_DCvAcC&pg=PA262|date=17 May 2013|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-091756-1|page=262}}</ref>

Clock time is about one hour later than [[solar noon]] in Armenia, as presented on the top map. Consequently, population activity hours are similar to those in [[Paris]] or [[Barcelona]], which have about the same shift to solar time (soft pink on the above-mentioned map). They are about one hour later compared to those in [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] (white on the map), and are two hours later than those in [[Warsaw]] and [[New York City|New York]] (soft blue on the map).

==Daylight saving time==
Armenia does not utilize [[Daylight saving time]]. The [[Government of Armenia]] issued a decree that cancelled the observance of daylight saving time, otherwise known as Armenia Summer Time ('''AMST''') in 2012.<ref>[https://www.timetemperature.com/asia/armenia_time_zone.shtml]</ref>
