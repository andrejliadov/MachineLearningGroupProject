'''Susanna Rowson''', née '''Haswell''' (1762 – 2 March 1824) was a British-American novelist, poet, playwright, [[Religious writings|religious writer]], stage actress, and educator,  considered the first woman geographer and supporter of female education. She also wrote against slavery.
Rowson was the author of the 1791 novel ''[[Charlotte Temple]]'', the most popular best-seller in [[American literature]] until [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' was published serially in 1851-1852 and authored the first human geography textbook ''Rowson's Abridgement of Universal Geography'' in 1805.

===Childhood===
[[File:1804 Rowson Gilbert Dean Boston.png|thumb|right|Rowson's poems, published in 1804 by [[Gilbert & Dean]], Boston]]

Susanna Haswell was born in 1762 in [[Portsmouth]], England to [[Royal Navy]] [[Lieutenant (Royal Navy)|Lieutenant]] William Haswell and his first wife, Susanna Musgrave,<ref>Papers of Susanna Rowson, Accession #7379, -a, -b, -c, Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature, Special Collections, [[University of Virginia Library]], [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia|Va.]] [http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu02087.xml University of Virginia]</ref> who died within days of Susanna's birth. While stationed in [[Boston]] her father remarried to Rachel Woodward and started a second family, and after his ship returned to Portsmouth and was decommissioned, he obtained an appointment as a Boston customs officer, bringing his daughter and a servant with him to [[Massachusetts]]. On arrival in January 1767, their ship grounded on [[Lovells Island]] in [[Port of Boston|Boston Harbor]], the crew and passengers being rescued from the wreck days later. They lived at [[Nantasket]] (now [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]]),<ref>{{cite book|title=Pattie Cowell. Introduction.

At the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]], Lieutenant Haswell was placed under [[house arrest]], and subsequently the family was moved inland, to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] and [[Abington, Massachusetts]]. In 1778, his failing health led to a [[prisoner exchange]], and the family was sent via [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia to England, eventually settling near [[Kingston upon Hull]]. Their American property was confiscated and they lived in relative poverty, being forced to sell the Portsmouth property left Susanna by her grandfather in order to support the family., a

===Pen and stage===
It was as a [[governess]] living in [[Westminster]] that she wrote her first work, ''Victoria'', dedicated to the [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Devonshire]] and published in 1786.  On 17 October of the same year, she married William Rowson, a hardware merchant who came from a theatrical family<ref>William's father, originally a gunsmith, supplied firearms to the Covent Garden theatre in the 1770s, and would later play minor theatrical roles at [[Haymarket Theatre]].  His daughters Elizabeth Rowson and Jane Rowson, later Mrs. Crow, danced at Covent Garden, as briefly did a daughter-in-law, Charlotte (Beverley) Rowson.  She and her husband John Baker Rowson would later perform with circuses and theatre companies at Philadelphia, New York, Richmond, Virginia and Augusta, among other locales.  Usually billed simply as Mr., Mrs. or Miss Rowson, these performers are frequently confused. Todd A. Farmerie, "The Rowsons of Marylebone, a Thespian Family in England and America", ''American Ancestors Journal'', supplement to ''The New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', 2014, 168:352-368.</ref> as well as reportedly being a [[Royal Horse Guards]] trumpeter. In 1791 in London, as 'Mrs. Rowson', she published the novel for which she is best known, ''Charlotte: A Tale of Truth'', later reissued in America as ''Charlotte Temple'', where it became the new nation's first best-selling novel.<ref>Watts, Emily Stipes. ''The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945''. [[Austin]], [[Texas]]: [[University of Texas Press]], 1978: 56. {{ISBN|0-292-76450-2}}</ref> This popular story of seduction and remorse has gone through more than 200 editions.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web|title=Susanna Rowson|url=http://britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref> The novel sparked much controversy, both over its content and whether it could actually be considered a novel due to its minimal number of pages.

After William's hardware business failed and his father died in 1791, Susanna and William took in his orphaned sister Charlotte Rowson and they all turned to acting, William appearing as a member of the company of the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], while Susanna joined the [[Theatre Royal, Edinburgh]].<ref>Rowson, Susanna. ''Charlotte Temple'' (ed. Clara M. and Rudolf Kirk). [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]: [[Twayne Publishers]], 1964: 13, Farmerie, "The Rowsons of Marylebone".</ref> In 1793, the three Rowsons were recruited for the [[Philadelphia]] theatre company of [[Thomas Wignell]], also performing with them in [[Baltimore]].

Over the next three years in Philadelphia, she wrote a novel, an opera, a musical [[farce]] about the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] (''The Volunteers''), a poetical address to the American troops, and several songs for the company in addition to performing 57 roles on the stage in two seasons. Rowson's work as a playwright and actor encouraged the growth of performing art in the United States.<ref name="Britannica"/> In response to her seemingly new-found republicanism and the liberal [[gender roles]] in her work, ''[[Slaves in Algiers]]'', she was attacked by [[William Cobbett]], who referred to her as "our American [[Sappho]]" (she returned fire, calling him a "loathsome reptile" in her introduction to ''Trials of the Human Heart'').<ref>Cobbett, in the character of [[Peter Porcupine]], would write of her works, "A liquorish page from ''Fille de Chambre'' serves me by way of a [[wikt:philtre|philtre]]; the ''Inquisitor'' is my [[opium]], and I have ever found the ''Slaves of Algiers'' a most excellent [[emetic]]." (Nason, ''A Memoir . . .'', p. 85)</ref>

===Later years===

In 1796, Susanna reestablished contact with her old Edinburgh director, John Brown Williamson. He had taken over the [[Federal Street Theatre]] in Boston, and the Rowson trio relocated there in part to be closer to the more familiar residence of her youth and her core American literary fan-base. The bankruptcy and major restructuring of the Boston theatre in 1797 would have sent Susanna and William to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], but rather than head south they abandoned the stage after a few summer performances in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  William clerked for a Boston merchant who went bankrupt, and having co-signed bonds, he was briefly imprisoned for his employer's debt.  He was then hired at the [[Boston Custom House]] and there was employed for almost four decades.<ref>Farmerie, "The Rowsons of Marylebone"</ref>  On leaving the stage, Susanna opened the first "female academy" in Boston in 1797 "Mrs Rowson's Academy for Young Ladies.  The earliest American map samplers (1779,1780) were by students [[Lydia Withington]] and Sally Dodge who were educated there and cover detailed images of Boston harbour and islands and detailed street plan.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Threads of life : a history of the world through the eye of a needle|last=Hunter|first=Clare|publisher=Spectre (Hodder & Stoughton)|year=2019|isbn=9781473687912|location=London|pages=190–191|oclc=1079199690}}</ref> Desiring a more rural setting, Rowson would move her school to [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], then to [[Newton, Massachusetts]], before returning it to Boston in 1809. She was a leader on female education and also the first woman geographer, publishing the first American education book on geography  ''Rowson's Abridgement of Universal Geography'' in 1805, a textbook focussing on human geography not maps and including information on the position of women, the cultural, religious, financial and social structure of different continents and in particular the impact of the 'barbarous, degrading traffic' of slavery. She also published ''Youth's First Steps in Geography'' in 1811.<ref name=":0" />   She managed her school until 1822 and trained hundreds of girls overall. 

Rowson also continued her writings, producing several novels, an additional work for the stage, a dictionary as well as the two geographies and as a contributor to the ''[[Boston Weekly Magazine]]'' (1802–1805). Her educational and literary work helped provide support for a growing household. Having no children of their own, they took in her husband's [[Illegitimate child|illegitimate]] son William, two adopted daughters, Frances Maria Mills, the orphaned daughter of an actor, and Susanna Rowson Johnston, her niece, who was daughter of Charlotte Rowson, and sister of artist [[David Claypoole Johnston]], plus she hosted the widow and daughters of her [[half-brother]], [[Robert Haswell]], who had been lost at sea in 1801. (One of these nieces, Rebecca Haswell, who would marry Roxbury mayor [[John Jones Clarke]], becoming great-grandmother of poet [[E. E. Cummings]].) Susanna also headed a charity for widows and the fatherless. She retired from her school in 1822, passing its operation to her adopted daughters, and she died in Boston two years later, 2 March 1824. She was buried in the family vault of friend [[Gottlieb Graupner]] at St. Matthew's Church, South Boston. When this church was demolished in 1866, the indistinguishable remains in the vault were all moved together to the [[Mount Hope Cemetery (Boston, Massachusetts)|Mount Hope Cemetery]]. A [[cenotaph]] was later erected for Susanna Haswell Rowson and her brothers Robert and John Montresor Haswell at [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in Boston's [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood, where she is memorialized as the author of ''[[Charlotte Temple]]''.
