A '''world clock''' is a [[clock]] which displays the [[time]] for various cities around the [[world]]. 
The display can take various forms:
*The [[clock face]] can incorporate multiple round [[analog clock|analogue]] clocks with moving hands or multiple [[Digital data|digital]] clocks with numeric readouts, with each clock being labelled with the name of a major city or time zone in the world.  
*It could also be a picture [[map]] of the world with embedded analog or digital time-displays.
*A moving circular map of the world, rotating inside a stationary 24-hour dial ring. Alternatively, the disc can be stationary and the ring moving.
*Light projection onto a map representing daytime, used in the [[Geochron]], a brand of a particular form of world clock.
There are also worldtime [[watch]]es, both [[wrist watch]]es and [[pocket watch]]es.  Sometime manufacturers of timekeepers erroneously apply the worldtime label to instruments that merely indicate time for two or a few [[time zone]]s, but the term should be used only for timepieces that indicate time for all major [[time zone]]s of the globe.
