A '''geopark''' is a unified area that advances the protection and use of geological heritage in a sustainable way, and promotes the economic well-being of the people who live there.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas_Zouros/publication/258100065_Geoparks_Celebrating_earth_heritage_sustaining_local_communities/links/0deec5272cb8fee05e000000.pdf Patrick J.

A UNESCO definition of ''global geopark'' is a unified area with a geological heritage of international significance.<ref name="globalgeopark">{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/earth-sciences/global-geoparks/some-questions-about-geoparks/what-is-a-global-geopark/ |title=What is a Global Geopark? &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2015-08-16}}</ref> Geoparks use that heritage to promote awareness of key issues facing society in the context of our dynamic planet. Many geoparks promote awareness of geological [[hazard]]s, including [[volcano]]es, [[earthquake]]s and [[tsunami]]s and many help prepare [[disaster]] mitigation strategies with [[Local community|local communities]]. Geoparks embody records of past climate changes and are indicators of current [[climate change]]s as well as demonstrating a "best practise" approach to using renewable energy and employing the best standards of "[[green tourism]]". [[Tourism]] industry promotion in geoparks, as a geographically sustainable and applicable tourism model, aims to sustain, and even enhance, the geographical character of a place.

Geoparks also inform about the sustainable use and need for [[natural resource]]s, whether they are mined, quarried or harnessed from the surrounding [[Natural environment|environment]] while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the [[landscape]]. Geoparks are not a legislative designation though the key heritage sites within a geopark are often protected under local, regional or national legislation.<ref name="globalgeopark" /> The multidisciplinary nature of the concept of geopark and tourism promotion in geoparks differentiates itself from other models of [[sustainable tourism]]. In fact, sustainable tourism promotion within geoparks encompasses many of the features of sustainable tourism including geo-tourism (geo-site tourism: as a basic factor), community-based tourism and integrated rural tourism (as a vital need), [[ecotourism]], and [[cultural heritage]] tourism.

==Global Network and UNESCO==
The [[Global Geoparks Network]] (GGN) is supported by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO). Many national geoparks and other local geoparks projects also exist which are not included in the Global Geoparks Network.

The geoparks initiative was launched by UNESCO in response to the perceived need for an international initiative that recognizes sites representing an [[earth science]] interest.<ref name="UNESCO Geopark About">{{cite web|title=About—UNESCO's role in geopark initiative |url=http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |publisher=Geopark Iskar Panega |year=2007 |work=Geopark Iskar Panega website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025602/http://geopark-bg.com/e_8.html |archivedate=2014-03-19 }}</ref> Global Geoparks Network  aims at enhancing the value of such sites while at the same time creating [[employment]] and promoting regional [[economic development]].<ref name="UNESCO Geopark About"/>
