The '''American Cordillera''' is a chain of [[mountain range]]s ([[cordillera]]s) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of [[mountain range]]s that form the western "backbone" of [[North America]], [[South America]] and  [[Central America]].<ref name="cw">{{cite web|title=Historical Geology Notes - The Breakup of Pangea and Deformation in the Western Cordillera|url=http://myweb.cwpost.liu.edu/vdivener/notes/west_cord.htm|website=Long Island University, C.W.

==Description==
===North America===
{{main|North American Cordillera}}
The ranges of the Cordillera from Mexico northwards are collectively called the [[North American Cordillera]].

From north to south, this sequence of overlapping and parallel ranges begins with the [[Alaska Range]] and the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]] and runs through the [[Yukon]] into [[British Columbia]]. The main belt of the [[Rocky Mountains]] along with the parallel [[Columbia Mountains]] and [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and [[Vancouver Island]]. In the [[United States]], the Cordillera branches include the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], the [[Sierra Nevadas (US)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], and various small [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Pacific coastal ranges]]. In [[Mexico]], the Cordillera continues through the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], as well as the backbone mountains of the [[Baja California peninsula]].

===South America===
The Cordillera continues on through the mountain ranges of [[Central America]] in [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Panama]], and becomes the [[Andes Mountains]] of [[South America]]. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of [[Chile]] continue through [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] to the southernmost tip of South America at [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The Cordillera continues along the [[Scotia Arc]] before reaching the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of//1998/of98-140/|title=The North American Cordillera:  A Color Shaded-Relief Map in Oblique Mercator Projection About the Pacific-North America Pole of Rotation, Scale Circa 1:5,000,000|website=pubs.usgs.gov|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>
