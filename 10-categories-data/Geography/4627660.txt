The '''Albertine Rift''' is the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], covering parts of [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Tanzania]].
It extends from the northern end of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] to the southern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]].
The geographical term includes the valley and the surrounding mountains.{{sfn|Owiunji|Plumptre|2011|p=164}}

==Geology==
[[File:Map of Great Rift Valley.svg|thumb|left|Map of the region showing the Albertine Rift to the west]]
The Albertine Rift and the mountains are the result of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic movements]] that are gradually splitting the [[Somali Plate]] away from the rest of the African continent. The mountains surrounding the rift are composed of uplifted [[Pre-Cambrian]] [[basement rock]]s, overlaid in parts by recent [[volcanic rock]]s.

==Lakes and rivers==
The northern part of the rift is crossed by two large mountain ranges, the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] between Lake Albert and [[Lake Rutanzige]] (formerly Lake Edward) and the [[Virunga Mountains]] between Lake Rutanziga and [[Lake Kivu]]. The Virungas form a barrier between the Nile Basin to the north and east and the Congo Basin to the west and south. Lake Rutenzige is fed by several large rivers, the [[Rutshuru River]] being one, and drains to the north through the [[Semliki River]] into Lake Albert. The Victoria Nile flows from [[Lake Victoria]] into the northern end of Lake Albert and exits as the [[White Nile]] from a point slightly to the west, flowing north to the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Erfurt-Cooper|Cooper|2010|p=35-36}}

South of the Virungu, Lake Kivu drains to the south into Lake Tanganyika through the [[Ruzizi River]]. Lake Tanganyika then drains into the [[Congo River]] via the [[Lukuga River]].{{sfn|Erfurt-Cooper|Cooper|2010|p=35-36}}
It seems likely that the present hydrological system was established quite recently when the Virunga volcanoes erupted and blocked the northward flow of water from [[Lake Kivu]] into [[Lake Edward]], causing it instead to discharge southward into Lake Tanganyika. Before that Lake Tanganyika, or separate sub-basins in what is now the lake, may have had no outlet other than evaporation.{{sfn|Clark|1969|p=35}}
The Lukuga has formed relatively recently, providing a route through which aquatic species of the Congo Basin could colonize Lake Tanganyika, which formerly had distinct fauna.{{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=562}}

==Mountains==
[[File:Mount Stanley.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Mount Stanley]] in the Rwenzori range. With an elevation of 5,109 m (16,763&nbsp;ft), it is the tallest mountain in the Albertine Rift and the third tallest in Africa. ]]
From north to south the mountains include the [[Lendu Plateau]], [[Rwenzori Mountains]], [[Virunga Mountains]] and [[Itombwe Mountains]].{{sfn|WWF}}
The Ruwenzori mountains have been identified with Ptolemy's "Mountains of the Moon". The range covers an area {{convert|120|km|mi}} long by {{convert|65|km|mi}} wide.
This range includes [[Mount Stanley]] {{convert|5119|m|ft}}, [[Mount Speke]] {{convert|4890|m|ft}} and [[Mount Baker (Uganda)|Mount Baker]]  {{convert|4843|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Erfurt-Cooper|Cooper|2010|p=37}}
The Virunga Massif along the border between Rwanda and the DRC consists of eight volcanoes.
Two of these, [[Nyamuragira]] and [[Nyiragongo]], are still highly active.{{sfn|Erfurt-Cooper|Cooper|2010|p=36}}

Isolated mountain blocks further to the south include [[Mount Bururi]] in southern Burundi, the [[Kungwe-Mahale Mountains]] in western Tanzania, and [[Mount Kabobo]] and the [[Marungu Mountains]] in the DRC on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]].{{sfn|WWF}} 
Most of the massifs rise to between {{convert|2000|m|ft}} and {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.{{sfn|Birdlife}}

==Ecology==

The [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] are important eco-regions.{{sfn|WWF}}
Transitional forests, intermediate between lowland and montane forest, are found at elevations from around {{convert|1000|m|ft}} to {{convert|1750|m|ft}}. Montane forest covers the slopes from around {{convert|1600|m|ft}} to {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.
Above {{convert|2400|m|ft}} there are areas of bamboo and elfin forest. Heather and grasses predominate above {{convert|3500|m|ft}}.
The ecology is threatened by deforestation as a growing population seeks new farmland.
Illegal timber extraction is another problem, and artisanal gold mining causes some local damage.{{sfn|Birdlife}}
