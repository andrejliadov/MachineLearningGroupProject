{{Short description|Term applied to an isolationist country, especially Korea}}

The term '''hermit kingdom''' is used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world. The [[East Asia|East Asian]] country of [[North Korea]] is commonly regarded as a prime example of a hermit kingdom, and the term is contemporarily used to describe that country.

Korea in the age of [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]] was the subject of the first use of the term, in [[William Elliot Griffis]]'s 1882 book ''Corea: The Hermit Nation'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David H.|title=Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical Thought}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Myoung Chung|title=Korean Government Publications: An Introductory Guide. Lantham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2000.}}</ref> and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/07/28/104992374.pdf The Obliteration of the Kingdom of Korea] by [[Stephen Bonsal]], ''The New York Times'', July 28, 1907</ref>

Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>http://beta.mytelus.com/telusen/portal/NewsChannel.aspx?CatID=World&ArticleID=news/capfeed/world/w022017A.xml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
