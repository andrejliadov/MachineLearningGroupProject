In [[computing]], '''GeoServer''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] server written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that allows users to share, process and edit [[Geographic information system|geospatial data]]. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using [[open standard]]s.  GeoServer has evolved to become an easy method of connecting existing information to [[virtual globe]]s such as [[Google Earth]] and [[NASA World Wind]] as well as to web-based maps such as [[OpenLayers]], [[Leaflet (software)|Leaflet]], [[Google Maps]] and [[Bing Maps]].  GeoServer functions as the [[reference implementation]] of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] [[Web Feature Service]] standard, and also implements the [[Web Map Service]], [[Web Coverage Service]] and [[Web Processing Service]] specifications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>

== Goals ==
GeoServer aims to operate as a node within a free and open [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]].  Just as the [[Apache HTTP Server]] has offered a free and open web server to publish [[HTML]], GeoServer aims to do the same for geospatial data.

== Features ==
GeoServer reads a variety of data formats,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/release/stable/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref> including:

* [[PostGIS]]
* [[Oracle Spatial]]
* [[ArcSDE]]
* [[IBM DB2|DB2]]
* [[MySQL]]
* [[MongoDB]]
* [[Apache Solr]]
* [[Shapefile]]s
* [[GeoTIFF]]
* [[GTOPO30]]
* [[ECW (file format)|ECW]], [[MrSID]]
* [[JPEG2000]]

Through standard protocols it produces [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[Geography Markup Language|GML]], Shapefile, [[GeoRSS]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[GeoJSON]], [[JPEG]], [[GIF]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and more. In addition, one can edit data via the [[Web Feature Service#Transactions|WFS transactional profile]] (WFS-T).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html|title=WFS reference — GeoServer 2.14.x User Manual|website=docs.geoserver.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>  GeoServer includes an integrated [[OpenLayers]] client for previewing data layers.

GeoServer additionally supports efficient publishing of geospatial data to [[Google Earth]] through the use of network links, using KML.  Advanced features for Google Earth output include templates for customized pop-ups, time and height visualizations, and "super-overlays".

GeoServer relies on [[GeoTools]], a [[geographic information system|GIS]] library.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/about/|title=About - GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}</ref>

== Usage ==
* [[MassGIS]] (Massachusetts state GIS) 
* [[MACRIS Maps]] (Massachusetts Historical Commission)
* [[TriMet]]  (Transit agency for Portland, Oregon)
* [[Ordnance Survey]] (National Mapping Agency of the UK)
* [[Institut Géographique National]] (National Mapping Agency of France)
* [[GBIF]] (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
* [[World Bank]]
* [[Global Earthquake Model]]
* GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System)
* [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)
* [[New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications]]
* TeamSurv
* ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

== Architecture ==
GeoServer uses the [[Spring Framework]], providing a request dispatch architecture for modules implementing OGC services. The web administration application uses wicket, allowing extensions to contribute additional configuration screens. The application provides a REST API implemented using the [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].

GeoServer is a web application, supporting any common [[Java Servlet#Servlet containers|servlet container]] (a standalone distribution is available with the [[Jetty (web server)]] as an embedded server). [[GeoWebCache]], a Java-based caching component similar to [[TileCache]], is bundled with GeoServer, but available separately.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geowebcache.org/trac |title=GeoWebCache |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405124130/http://geowebcache.org/trac |archivedate=2010-04-05 }}</ref> Similarly, GeoServer packages GeoTools as a Java library, but it is also available separately.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geotools.org/|title=GeoTools}}</ref>

GeoServer is a longstanding application and has undergone several architectural changes. GeoServer 1.0 was built around the STRUTS framework, with the migration to Spring and Wicket taking place for GeoServer 2.0. Early versions of the REST API used restlet before migration to [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].
