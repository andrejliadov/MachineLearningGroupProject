The '''UTC offset''' is the difference in hours and minutes from [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) for a particular place and date.  It is generally shown in the format ±[hh]:[mm], ±[hh][mm], or ±[hh].  So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in Berlin during the winter), the UTC offset would be "+01:00", "+0100", or simply "+01".

Every inhabited place in the world has a UTC offset that is a multiple of 15 minutes, and the majority of offsets (as well as all [[nautical time]] zones) are measured in whole hours. There are many cases where the national [[civil time]] (ignoring Daylight Saving) uses a UTC offset (time zone) that differs from the theoretical one appropriate to its longitude.

==Time zones and time offsets==
[[File:World Time Zones Map.png|thumb|upright=2.0|World map of current time zones]]
A ''[[time zone]]'' is a geographical [[region]] in which residents observe the same [[standard time]].

A ''[[time offset]]'' is an amount of time subtracted from or added to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) time to get the current [[civil time]], whether it is standard time or [[daylight saving time]] (DST).

In any particular time zone, residents either observe standard time all year round (as in [[Russia]] or [[South Africa]]), or observe standard time during winter and daylight time during summer (as in most of the United States and Europe).

== Daylight saving time ==
Several regions in North America, Europe and Australia use [[daylight saving time]] (DST). The UTC offset during observation of DST is typically obtained by adding one hour to standard time. [[Central European Time]] [[UTC+01:00]] is replaced by [[Central European Summer Time]] [[UTC+02:00]], and Pacific Standard Time [[UTC−08:00]] is replaced by Pacific Daylight Time [[UTC−07:00]].
