{{main|UN-OHRLLS}}

The [[United Nations]] has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries.<ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005">UN-OHRLLS. 2005.</ref> In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance.<ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/> It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate{{clarify|date=March 2017}} themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries.<ref name="UN-OHRLLS. 2005"/> One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts.<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47">Faye et al. 2004, p. 47.</ref> Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in [[Mombasa]], furthering delivery contract delays.<ref>Faye et al. 2004, p. 48.</ref> Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.

==Dependency problems==
Although [[Adam Smith]] and traditional thought hold that geography and transportation are the culprits for keeping LLDCs from realizing development gains, Faye, Sachs and Snow hold the argument that no matter the advancement of infrastructure or lack of geographic distance to a port, landlocked nations are still dependent on their neighbouring transit nations.<ref>Faye et al. 2004, p. 32.</ref> Outlying this specific relationship of dependency, Faye et al. insist that though LLDCs vary across the board in terms of HDI index scores, LLDCs almost uniformly straddle at the bottom of HDI rankings in terms of region, suggesting a correlated dependency relationship of development for landlocked countries with their respective regions.<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39">Faye et al. 2004, p. 39.</ref> In fact, HDI levels decrease as one moves inland along the major transit route that runs from the coast of Kenya, across the country before going through Uganda, [[Rwanda]] and then finally [[Burundi]].<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 39"/> Just recently, it has been economically modeled that if the economic size of a transit country is increased by just 1%, a subsequent increase of at least 2% is experienced by the landlocked country, which shows that there is hope for LLDCs if the conditions of their transit neighbours are addressed.<ref>Paudel. 2012, p. 17.</ref> In fact, some LLDCs are seeing the brighter side of such a relationship, with the Central Asian nations geographic location between three [[BRIC]] nations (China, [[Russia]] and [[India]]) hungry for the region's oil and mineral wealth serving to boost economic development.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76">Fara. 2012, p. 76.</ref> The three major factors that LLDCs are dependent on their transit neighbours are dependence on transit infrastructure, dependence on political relations with neighbours, and dependence on internal peace and stability within transit neighbours.<ref>Faye et al. 2004, p. 40.</ref>

===Burundi===
[[File:Map displaying landlocked Burundi's strife with finding a suitable export route.png|thumb|400px| Burundi is shown in blue. Its possible export routes were:

* dependent on infrastructure of transit neighbour Tanzania (yellow), or

<br>* dependent on political relations with transit neighbour Kenya (orange), or 
* dependent on internal stability of transit neighbour Mozambique (red).
When all three routes were unavailable, Burundi had to rely on the port of Durban in South Africa (brown).]]
Burundi has relatively good internal road networks, but it cannot export its goods using the most direct route to the sea since the inland infrastructure of [[Tanzania]] is poorly connected to the port of [[Dar es Salaam]].<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44">Faye et al. 2004, p. 44.</ref> Thus Burundi relies on Kenya's port of Mombasa for export; but this route was severed briefly in the 1990s when political relations with Kenya deteriorated.<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/> Further, Burundi's exports could not pass through [[Mozambique]] around the same time due to violent civil conflict.<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 47"/> Thus, Burundi had to export its goods using a 4500&nbsp;km route, crossing several borders and changing transport modes, to reach the port of [[Durban]] in [[South Africa]].<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/>

===Other African countries===

* [[Mali]] had problems exporting goods in the 1990s as nearly all its transit neighbours ([[Algeria]], [[Togo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]) were engaged in civil war around the same time.<ref>Faye et al. 2004, p. 46-47.</ref> The lone exception was Ghana, which was under military rule but did not have an active civil war at the time.
* The [[Central African Republic]]'s export routes are seasonal: in the rainy season Cameroon's roads are too poor to use; and during the dry season the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s [[Oubangui River]] water levels are too low for river travel.<ref name="Faye et al. 2004, p. 44"/>

===Central Asia===

The mineral resource-rich countries of [[Central Asia]] and [[Mongolia]] offer a unique set of landlocked cases to explore in more depth, as these are nations where economic growth has grown exceptionally in recent years.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/> In Central Asia, oil and coal deposits have influenced development: [[Kazakhstan]]’s GDI per capita in purchasing power parity was five times greater than [[Kyrgyzstan]]'s in 2009.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 76"/> Despite substantial development growth, these nations are not on a stable and destined path to being well developed, as the exploitation of their natural resources translates into an overall low average income and disparity of income, and because their limited deposits of resources allow growth only in the short term, and most importantly because dependence on unprocessed materials increases the risk of shocks due to variations in market prices.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77">Fara. 2012, p. 77.</ref> And though it is widely conceived that free trade can permit faster economic growth,<ref>Paudel. 2012, p. 11.</ref> Mongolia is now subjected to a new geopolitical game about the traffic on its railway lines between China and Russia.<ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100">Bulag. 2009, p. 100.</ref> [[Russian Railways]] now effectively owns 50% of Mongolia's rail infrastructure, which could mean more efficient modernization and the laying of new rail lines, but in reality also translates into powerful leverage to pressure the government of Mongolia to concede unfair terms for license grants of coal, copper, and gold mines.<ref>Bulag. 2009, p. 101.</ref> Thus, it can be argued that these nations with extraordinary mineral wealth should pursue economic diversification.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/> All of these nations possess education qualifications, as they are inheritors of the [[Soviet Union]]'s social education system. This implies that it is due to poor economic policies that more than 40% of the labour force is bogged down in the agricultural sector instead of being diverted into secondary or tertiary economic activity.<ref name="Fara. 2012, p. 77"/> Yet, it cannot be ignored that Mongolia benefits exceptionally from its proximity to two giant BRIC nations, resulting in a rapid development of railway ports along its borders, especially along the Chinese border, as the Chinese seek to direct coking coal from Mongolia to China's northwestern industrial core as well as for transportation to [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], resulting in revenue generation through the port of [[Tianjin]].<ref name="Bulag. 2009, p. 100"/>

===Nepal===
[[Nepal]] is another landlocked country with extreme dependency on its transit neighbour India. India does not have poor relations with Nepal, nor does it lack relevant transport infrastructure or internal stability. However, there have been two cases of economic blockades imposed by the [[government of India]] on Nepal - the official 1989 blockade<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/11/world/nepal-s-economy-is-gasping-as-india-a-huge-neighbor-squeezes-it-hard.html|title=Nepal's Economy Is Gasping as India, a Huge Neighbor, Squeezes It Hard|date=11 April 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Crossette|first1=Barbara}}</ref> and the unofficial [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 blockade]] - both of which left the nation in severe economic crisis. In the 1970s, Nepal suffered from large commodity concentration and a high geographic centralization in its export trade: over 98% of its exports were to India, and 90% of its imports came from India.<ref name="Shrestha 1976">Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1114.</ref> As a result of all this, Nepal had a poor trade bargaining position.<ref name="Shrestha 1976"/> In the 1950s, Nepal was forced to comply with India's external tariffs as well as the prices of India's exports.<ref name="Shrestha 1976"/> This was problematic since the two countries have different levels of development, resulting in greater gains for India which was larger, more advanced and with more resources.<ref name="Shrestha 1976"/> It was feared that a parasitic relationship might emerge, since India had a head start in industrialization, and dominated Nepal in manufacturing, which could reduce Nepal to being just a supplier of raw materials.<ref>Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1116-7.</ref> Because of these problems, and Nepal's inability to develop its own infant industries (as it could not compete with Indian manufactures)<ref>Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1117.</ref> treaties were drafted in 1960 and 1971, with amendments to the equal tariffs conditions, and terms of trade have since progressed.<ref>Jayaraman and Shrestha. 1976, p. 1118.</ref>

==Almaty Ministerial Conference==
In August, 2003, the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries on Transit Transport Cooperation (Almaty Ministerial Conference) was held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, setting the necessities of LLDCs in a universal document whereas there were no coordinated efforts on the global scale to serve the unique needs of LLDCs in the past.<ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/> Other than acknowledging the main forms of dependency that must be addressed, it also acknowledged the additional dependency issue where neighbouring transit countries are often observed to export the same products as their landlocked neighbours.<ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/> One result of the conference was a direct call for donor countries to step in to direct aid into setting up suitable infrastructure of transit countries to alleviate the burden of supporting LLDCs in regions of poor development in general.<ref name="Hagen. 2003, p. 13"/> The general objectives of the Almaty Program of Action is as follows:
*Reduce customs processes and fees to minimize costs and transport delays
*Improve infrastructure with respect to existing preferences of local transport modes, where road should be focused in Africa and rail in South Asia
*Implement preferences for landlocked countries’ commodities to boost their competitiveness in the international market
*To establish relationships between donor countries with landlocked and transit countries for technical, financial and policy improvements<ref>UN-OHRLLS. 2003.</ref>
