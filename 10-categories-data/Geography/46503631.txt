The '''Geography of Middle-earth''' encompasses the physical, political, and moral geography of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], strictly a continent on the planet of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]] but widely taken to mean [[Arda (Middle-earth)|the physical world]], and ''[[Eä]]'', all of creation, as well as all of his writings about it.<ref name="Garbowski 2013">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Garbowski |first=Christopher |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.

R. R. Tolkien)|Aman]], which became the home of the godlike [[Valar]], as well as Middle-earth. At the end of the [[First Age]], the Western part of Middle-earth, [[Beleriand]], was drowned in the War of Wrath. In the Second Age, a large island, [[Númenor]], was created in the Great Sea, [[Belegaer]], between Aman and Middle-earth; it was destroyed in a cataclysm at the end of the [[Second Age]], in which Arda was remade as a spherical world, and Aman was removed so that Men could not reach it.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Middle-earth at the end of the [[Third Age]] is described as having free peoples, namely [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Hobbit|Hobbits]] and [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], in the West, opposed to peoples under the control of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] in the East. Some commentators have seen this as implying a moral geography of Middle-earth.

{{further|Cosmology of Tolkien's legendarium}}

Tolkien's Middle-earth was part of his created world of [[Arda (Tolkien)|Arda]]. It was a flat world surrounded by ocean. It included the [[Aman (Tolkien)|Undying Lands of Aman]] and [[Eressëa]], which were all part of the wider creation, [[Eä]]. Aman and Middle-earth were separated from each other by the Great Sea [[Belegaer]], analogous to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The western continent, Aman, was the home of the [[Vala (Middle-earth) |Valar]], and the Elves called the [[Eldalië |Eldar]].<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', p. 31</ref><ref name="Garbowski 2013"/>

Initially, the western part of Middle-earth was the subcontinent [[Beleriand]]; it was engulfed by the ocean at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name="Garbowski 2013"/>

After the destruction of [[Númenor]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], Arda was remade as a round world, and the Undying Lands were removed from Arda so that [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]] could not reach them. The [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] could go there only by the [[Straight Road]] and in ships capable of passing out of the sphere of the earth. Tolkien then equated Arda, consisting of both Middle-earth's planet and the heavenly Aman, with the [[Solar System]], the Sun and Moon being celestial objects in their own right, no longer orbiting the Earth.<ref name="Garbowski 2013"/><ref>{{cite journal |first=Kristine |last=Larsen |title=A Little Earth of His Own: Tolkien's Lunar Creation Myths |journal=In The Ring Goes Ever On: Proceedings of the Tolkien 2005 Conference |volume=2 |editor=Sarah Wells |publisher=The Tolkien Society |pages=394–403 |year=2008}}</ref>

[[File:Sketch Map of Middle-earth.svg|Sketch map of the north-west of [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]]]

The events of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' take place in the north-west of the continent of Middle-earth. Both [[quest]]s begin in [[The Shire]], travel east through the wilds of Eriador to [[Rivendell]] and then across the [[Misty Mountains]], involve further travels in the lands of [[Rhovanion]] or Wilderland to the east of those mountains, and return home to The Shire. 

===Beleriand, Lindon===

The extreme west of Middle-earth in the First Age was [[Beleriand]]. It was largely destroyed in the cataclysm of the [[War of Wrath]], leaving only a remnant coastal plain, Lindon, just to the west of the Ered Luin (also called Ered Lindon or Blue Mountains). The cataclysm divided Ered Luin and Lindon by the newly-created Gulf of Lune; the northern part was Forlindon, the southern Harlindon.

===Eriador===
{{anchor|Weathertop|Amon Sul|Hollin|Eregion|Evendim}}

In the northwest of Middle-earth, Eriador was the region between the Ered Luin and the Misty Mountains. In the Second Age, the northern kingdom of Arnor founded by [[Elendil]] occupied much of the region. After its collapse, much of Eriador became wild. In the Third Age, a small part of the region was occupied by hobbits to form the Shire. To the northwest lay Lake Evendim, once called Nenuial by the Elves. A remnant of the ancient forest of Eriador survived throughout the Third Age just to the east of the Shire as the [[Old Forest]], the domain of [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref name="Old Forest" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 6 "The Old Forest"</ref> Northeast of there is [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], the only place where hobbits and Men live in the same villages. Further east from there is the hill of Weathertop, the hill with the ancient fortress of Amon Sul, and then [[Rivendell]], the home of [[Elrond]]. South from there is the ancient land of Hollin, once the elvish land of Eregion where the Rings of Power were forged. 
At the Grey Havens (Mithlond), on the Gulf of Lune, [[Cirdan]] built the ships in which the Elves departed from Middle-earth to Valinor.<ref>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 9 "The Grey Havens", and Appendix B</ref>

===Misty Mountains===

The Misty Mountains were thrown up by the Dark Lord [[Melkor]] in the [[First Age]] to impede Oromë, one of the [[Valar]] who often rode across Middle-earth hunting.<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ch. 3 "Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor"</ref> The [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]-realm of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] was built in the First Age beneath the midpoint of the mountain range. The two major passes across the mountains were the High Pass or Pass of Imladris near [[Rivendell]], with a higher and a lower route,<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', pp. 271, 281</ref><ref group=T>''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'', p. 105</ref> and the all-year Redhorn Pass further south near Moria.<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2 ch. 3</ref>

===Rhovanion===

East of the Misty Mountains, Anduin or the Great River flows southwards, with the forest of [[Mirkwood]] to its east. On its west bank opposite the southern end of Mirkwood is the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|elvish]] land of [[Lothlorien]]. Further south, backing on to the Misty Mountains, lies the forest of [[Fangorn]], home of the tree-giants, the [[ent]]s. In a valley at the southern end of the Misty Mountains is [[Isengard]], home to the [[wizard (Middle-earth)|wizard]] [[Saruman]]. 

===Lands to the South===
[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2|Sketch map of [[Gondor]] in the Third Age, bordered by [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and [[Mordor]]]]
{{anchor|Argonath|Emyn Muil|Sarn Gebir|Falls of Rauros}}

Just to the South of both Fangorn and Isengard is the wide grassy land of the [[Riders of Rohan]], who provide [[cavalry]] to its southerly neighbour, [[Gondor]]. The River Anduin passes the hills of Emyn Muil and the enormous rock statues of the Argonath, flows through the dangerous rapids of Sarn Gebir, and over the Falls of Rauros into Gondor. Gondor's border with Rohan is the Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains, which run east-west from the sea to a point near the Anduin; at that point is Gondor's capital city, [[Minas Tirith]]. 

Across the river to the East is the land of [[Mordor]]. It is bordered to the north by the Ered Lithui, the Ash Mountains; to the west by the Ephel Duath, the Mountains of Shadow. Between those two ranges, at Mordor's northwest tip, are the Black Gates of the [[Morannon]]. In the angle between the two ranges is the volcanic Plateau of Gorgoroth, with the tall volcano of Orodruin or [[Mount Doom]], where the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] forged the [[One Ring]], at its centre. To the mountain's east is Sauron's Dark Tower, [[Barad-dur]]. 

{{anchor|Khand}}
To the south of Gondor and Mordor lie [[Harad]] and Khand.

===Lands to the East===

To the East of Rhovanion and to the North of Mordor lies the Sea of Rhûn, home to the Easterlings. North of that lie the Iron Hills of [[Dáin II Ironfoot|Dain]]'s [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|dwarves]]; between those and Mirkwood is [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor, the Lonely Mountain]], once home to [[Smaug]] the [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], and afterwards to [[Thorin Oakenshield|Thorin]]'s dwarves. 

The large lands to the east of Rhûn and to the south and east of Harad are not described in the stories, which take place in the North-western part of Middle-earth.<ref name="Magoun South 2013">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Magoun |first=John F.G. |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.C. |editor-link=Michael D.

== Political geography ==
[[File:Sketch Map of The Shire.svg|thumb|upright=2|Sketch map of [[the Shire]], with political division into four Farthings]]
{{further|Gondor|Rohan (Middle-earth)|Mordor|Harad|The Shire}}

At the end of the [[Third Age]], much of the northwest of Middle-earth is wild, with traces here and there of ruined cities and fortresses from earlier civilisations among the mountains, rivers, forests, hills, plains and marshes. The major nations that appear in ''The Lord of the Rings'' are Rohan and Gondor on the side of the Free Peoples, and Mordor and its ally Harad on the side of the Dark Lord. Gondor, once extremely powerful, is by that time much reduced in its reach, and has lost control of Ithilien (bordering Mordor) and South Gondor (bordering Harad). 

The Easterlings from the region of Rhûn, barely described, contribute a substantial army to Mordor's side. 

Forgotten by most of the rest of the world is [[the Shire]], a small region in the northwest of Middle-earth inhabited by hobbits amidst the abandoned lands of Eriador.

== Moral geography ==
[[File:Tolkien's Moral Geography of Middle-Earth.svg|thumb|upright=2|Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, according to John Magoun<ref name="Magoun"/>|alt=Tolkien's moral geography of Middle-earth, good in the west, evil in the east, simple in the north, sophisticated in the south. The Shire is in the northwest (simple/good) quadrant, Gondor in the southwest, and Mordor in the southeast.]]

With his "Southrons" from Harad, Tolkien had – in the view of John Magoun, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' – constructed a "fully expressed moral geography",<ref name="Magoun">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Magoun |first=John F. G. |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D. C. |editor-link=Michael D. C. Drout |title=South, The |work=[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia|J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]] |year=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=1-135-88034-4 |pages=622–623}}</ref> from the hobbits' home in the Northwest, evil in the East, and "imperial sophistication and decadence" in the South. Magoun explains that Gondor is both virtuous, being West, and has problems, being South; Mordor in the Southeast is hellish, while Harad in the extreme South "regresses into hot savagery".<ref name="Magoun"/>

Other scholars such as Walter Scheps and Isabel G. MacCaffrey have noted Middle-earth's "spatial cum moral dimensions",<ref name="Scheps 1975">{{cite book |last=Scheps |first=Walter |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=The Interlace Structure of 'The Lord of the Rings' |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |pages=44-45}}</ref><ref name="MacCaffrey 1959">{{cite book |last1=MacCaffrey |first1=Isabel G. |title=Paradise Lost as Myth |url=https://archive.org/details/paradiselostasmy0000macc |url-access=registration |date=1959 |publisher=Harvard University Press |oclc=1041902253 |page=[https://archive.org/details/paradiselostasmy0000macc/page/55 55]}}</ref> though not identically with Magoun's interpretation. In their view, North and West are generally good, South and East evil. That places the Shire and the elves' [[Grey Havens]] in the Northwest as certainly good, and Mordor in the Southeast as certainly Evil; Gondor in the Southwest is in their view morally ambivalent, matching the characters of both [[Boromir]] and [[Denethor]]. They observe further that the Shire's four quadrants or "Farthings" serve as a "microcosm" of the moral geography of Middle-earth as a whole: thus, the evil [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] appear first in the Eastfarthing, while the once good but corrupted [[Saruman]]'s men arrive in the Southfarthing.<ref name="Scheps 1975"/>

{{further|Mirkwood|Númenor}}

Some features of Middle-earth can be traced to literary sources or real-world places. The Misty Mountains derive from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', where the protagonist in the ''[[Skírnismál]]'' notes that his quest will involve misty mountains peopled with orcs and giants,<ref name="Shippey 2005">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |orig-year=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=80-81, 114}}</ref> while the character of the mountains were partly inspired by Tolkien's travels in the [[Swiss Alps]] in 1911.<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J.
