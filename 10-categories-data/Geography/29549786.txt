A '''designed landscape''' is an area of land which has been modified by people for primarily [[aesthetic]] effect. The term is used by historians to denote various types of site, such as [[garden]]s, [[park]]s, [[cemetery|cemeteries]], and [[estate (land)|estates]]. Such sites are often protected for their historic or artistic value. A designed landscape may comprise [[landform]], [[water body|water]], [[building|built structures]], [[tree]]s and [[plant]]s, all of which may be naturally occurring or introduced. 

Many designed landscapes take advantage of existing geographical features, emphasising them through the planting of woodlands, or the creation of artificial lakes. For example, the parklands created by [[landscape gardener]]s such as [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown]], are designed landscapes. 

They may also be more subtle, resulting from the enclosure of land, and the planting of functional woodlands such as [[shelter belt]]s. Patterns of such features may be of use to historians in identifying the extent of country estates, and in dating agricultural improvements.
