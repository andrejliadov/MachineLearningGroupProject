'''''A Field Guide to the Birds of Hawaii and the Tropical Pacific''''' is a 1987 book by [[Harold Douglas Pratt, Jr.]], [[Phillip L. Bruner]] and [[Delwyn G. Berrett]] (with illustrations by Pratt). It is published by [[Princeton University Press]] and is produced as both hardback ({{ISBN|978-0-691-08402-2}}) and softback ({{ISBN|978-0-691-02399-1}}) editions. The book is primarily a [[field guide]] to birds found in the [[Hawaiian islands]], [[Micronesia]], [[Fiji]] and tropical [[Polynesia]] (plus some northern subtropical Polynesian islands), including some distribution and status data. It was the first identification work to cover the birds of the whole of this region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conant|first=Sheila|date=1987-07-01|title=A field guide to the birds of Hawaii and the tropical Pacific: by H.
