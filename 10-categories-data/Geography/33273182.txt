The '''Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers''' (CLAG) was formed in 1970 to foster geographic education and research on Latin America.<ref>[William M. Denevan, "Traditional Versus New Directions: The First Meeting of the Conference of Latin Americanist Geographers, 1970," ''Journal of Latin American Geography'' 7 (2008):155-62. {{DOI|10.1353/lag.0.0013}}</ref> A Board of Directors governs CLAG. CLAG publishes a Newsletter and the [http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/journals/journals.html ''Journal of Latin American Geography'']. It also operates CLAGNET, an electronic [[Listserv]] for members.

The [http://archives.syr.edu Syracuse University Archives] preserve documents and photographs related to the history of the organization because the long-standing Executive Director, David J. Robinson, is a professor at that university.

CLAG also makes awards to graduate students to support research and conference travel.
