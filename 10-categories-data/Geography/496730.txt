'''Alpine climate''' is the typical [[weather]] ([[climate]]) for the regions above the [[tree line]]. This climate is also referred to as a '''mountain climate''' or '''highland climate'''.

==Definition==

There are multiple definitions of alpine climate.

One simple definition is the climate which causes trees to fail to grow due to cold.

In the [[Köppen climate classification]], the alpine and mountain climates are part of group ''E'', along with the [[polar climate]], where no month has a mean [[temperature]] higher than {{convert|10|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite book | last1=McKnight | first1=Tom L | last2=Hess | first2=Darrel | year=2000 | chapter=Climate Zones and Types: The Köppen System | title=Physical Geography: A Landscape Appreciation | pages=[https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/235 235–7] | location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-020263-5 | chapter-url-access=registration | chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn | url=https://archive.org/details/physicalgeographmckn/page/235 }}</ref>

According to the [[Holdridge life zone]] system, there are two mountain climates which prevent tree growth :

a) the alpine climate proper which occurs when the mean [[biotemperature]] of a location is between {{convert|1.5|and|3|C|F}}. The alpine climate in Holdridge system is roughly equivalent to the warmest [[tundra]] climates (ET) in the Köppen system.

b) the alvar climate, the coldest mountain climate since the biotemperature is between 0&nbsp;°C and 1.5&nbsp;°C (biotemperature can never be below 0&nbsp;°C). It corresponds more or less to the coldest tundra climates and to the [[ice cap climate]]s (EF) as well.

Holdrige reasoned that plants net primary productivity ceases with plants becoming dormant at temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} and above {{convert|30|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lugo|first1=A. E.|title=The Holdridge life zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=1999|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1025–1038|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227649905|access-date=27 May 2015|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x}}</ref> Therefore, he defined biotemperature as the mean of all temperatures but with all temperatures below freezing and above 30&nbsp;°C adjusted to 0&nbsp;°C; that is, the sum of temperatures not adjusted is divided by the number of all temperatures (including both adjusted and non-adjusted ones).

==Cause==
The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. Sunlight in the [[visible spectrum]] hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If [[radiation]] were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the [[greenhouse effect]] of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly {{convert|333|K|C F}}, and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.<ref name=goodywilson>{{cite book|first1=Richard M.|last1=Goody|first2=James C.G.|last2=Walker|title=Atmospheres|chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures|chapter-url=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1972}}</ref>

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of [[convection]]. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an [[adiabatic process]], which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the [[adiabatic lapse rate]], which is approximately 9.8&nbsp;°C per kilometer (or 5.4&nbsp;°F per 1000&nbsp;feet) of altitude.<ref name=goodywilson/>

The presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent [[heat of vaporization]]. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes [[Dew point|saturated]] and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming [[cloud]]s), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the [[dry adiabatic lapse rate]] to the [[moist adiabatic lapse rate]] (5.5&nbsp;°C per kilometre or 3&nbsp;°F per 1000&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |title=Dry Adiabatic Lapse Rate |publisher=tpub.com |access-date=2016-05-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603041448/http://meteorologytraining.tpub.com/14312/css/14312_47.htm |archive-date=2016-06-03 }}</ref> The actual lapse rate, called the [[environmental lapse rate]], is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a normal lapse rate is 5.5&nbsp;°C per 1,000&nbsp;m (3.57&nbsp;°F per 1,000&nbsp;ft).<ref>{{cite book

The temperature continues to drop until the [[tropopause]], at {{convert|11000|m|ft}}, where it does not decrease further. This is higher than the highest [[summit]].

==Distribution==
Although this climate classification only covers a small portion of the Earth's surface, alpine climates are widely distributed. They are present in the [[Himalayas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau]], [[Gansu]], [[Qinghai]], the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]], the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] and the [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[Eurasia]], the [[Andes]] in [[South America]], the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Cascade Mountains]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Trans-Mexican volcanic belt]] in [[North America]], the [[Southern Alps]] in [[New Zealand]], the [[Snowy Mountains]] in [[Australia]], high elevations in the [[Atlas Mountains]] and the [[Eastern Highlands]] of [[Africa]], and the central parts of [[Borneo]] and [[New Guinea]] and the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] in the [[Pacific]].

The lowest altitude of alpine climate varies dramatically by latitude. If alpine climate is defined by the tree line, then it occurs as low as {{convert|650|m|ft}} at 68°N in Sweden,<ref name=korner>{{cite journal|last1= Körner|first1=Ch|year=1998|title=A re-assessment of high elevation treeline positions and their explanation|journal=Oecologia|volume=115|pages=445–459|doi=10.1007/s004420050540|pmid=28308263|issue=4|url=http://culter.colorado.edu/~kittel/TreelineLat_Koerner98.pdf|bibcode=1998Oecol.115..445K|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8501|s2cid=8647814}}</ref> while on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, the tree line is at {{convert|3950|m}}.<ref name=korner/>

==Monthly variability==

The variability of the alpine climate throughout the year depends on the latitude of the location. For tropical oceanic locations, such as the summit of [[Mauna Loa]], elev. {{convert|13679|ft|abbr=on}}, the temperature is roughly constant throughout the year:
