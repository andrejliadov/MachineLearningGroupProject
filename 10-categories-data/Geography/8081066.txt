The '''fundamental plane''' in a [[spherical coordinate system]] is a [[plane of reference]] that divides the [[sphere]] into two [[Sphere|hemisphere]]s. The [[geocentric latitude]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] is then the [[angle]] between the fundamental plane and the line joining the point to the centre of the sphere.<ref>{{citation|title=It's ONLY Rocket Science: An Introduction in Plain English|first=Lucy|last=Rogers|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9780387753782|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTFGAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136}}.</ref>

For a [[geographic coordinate system]] of the Earth, the fundamental plane is the [[Equator]]. [[Celestial coordinate system]]s have varying fundamental planes:<ref>{{cite book |title=A Compendium of Spherical Astronomy with Its Applications to the Determination and Reduction of Positions of the Fixed Stars |first=Simon |last=Newcomb |publisher=Macmillan |year=1906 |page=[https://archive.org/details/acompendiumsphe00newcgoog/page/n116 92] |url=https://archive.org/details/acompendiumsphe00newcgoog}}.</ref>
* The [[horizontal coordinate system]] uses the observer's [[horizon]].
* The Besselian coordinate system uses Earth's [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (day/night boundary).{{cn|date=January 2020}} This is a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'').
* The [[equatorial coordinate system]] uses the [[celestial equator]].
* The [[ecliptic coordinate system]] uses the [[ecliptic]].
* The [[galactic coordinate system]] uses the [[Milky Way]]'s galactic equator.
