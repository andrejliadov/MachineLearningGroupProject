'''Badwater Basin''' is an [[endorheic basin]] in [[Death Valley National Park]], [[Death Valley]], [[Inyo County, California]], noted as the lowest point in [[North America]] and the [[United States]], with a [[Altitude, height, and depth|depth]] of {{convert|282|ft|abbr=on}} below [[sea level]].<ref name=NED/>  [[Mount Whitney]], the highest point in the [[contiguous 48 states|contiguous 48 United States]], is only {{convert|84.6|mi|km|sigfig=3}} to the northwest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/distance.html|title=Find Distance and Azimuths Between 2 Sets of Coordinates (Badwater 36-15-01-N, 116-49-33-W and Mount Whitney 36-34-43-N, 118-17-31-W) |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |access-date=August 13, 2010}}</ref>

The site itself consists of a small [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool of "bad water" next to the road in a [[sink (geography)|sink]]; the accumulated [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of the surrounding basin make it undrinkable, thus giving it the name.  The pool does have [[fauna (animals)|animal]] and [[flora (plants)|plant life]], including [[Salicornia|pickleweed]], [[aquatic insect]]s, and the [[Badwater snail]].

Adjacent to the pool, where water is not always present at the surface, repeated freeze–thaw and evaporation cycles gradually push the thin salt crust into hexagonal honeycomb shapes.

The pool is not the lowest point of the basin: the lowest point (which is only slightly lower) is several miles to the west and varies in position, depending on rainfall and evaporation patterns.  The [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] are hazardous to traverse (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), and so the sign marking the low point is at the pool instead.  The basin was considered the [[Extremes on Earth|lowest elevation in the Western Hemisphere]] until the discovery of [[Laguna del Carbón]] in [[Argentina]] at {{convert|−344|ft|abbr=on|0}}.

At Badwater Basin, significant rainstorms flood the valley bottom periodically, covering the [[Dry lake|salt pan]] with a thin sheet of standing water. Newly formed lakes do not last long though, because the {{convert|1.9|in|abbr=on}} of average rainfall is overwhelmed by a {{convert|150|in|abbr=on}} annual [[evaporation]] rate. This is the greatest evaporation potential in the United States, meaning that a {{convert|3.8|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} lake could dry up in a single year. When the basin is flooded, some of the salt is dissolved; it is redeposited as clean crystals when the water evaporates.<ref name="USGS01">{{cite web | author=United States Geological Survey | title=Badwater | url=http://geology.wr.usgs.gov/parks/deva/ftbad2.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224063142/http://geology.wr.usgs.gov/parks/deva/ftbad2.html | work=Death Valley Geology Field Trip | publisher=US Department of the Interior | date=January 13, 2004 | archive-date=December 24, 2007| access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>

==History==
The current best understanding of the area's geological history is that the entire region between the [[Colorado River]] in the east and [[Baja California]] in the southwest (and bordered by various uplifts and mountains around the west-northwest-northern perimeters) has seen numerous cycles since at least the start of the [[Pleistocene]] (and perhaps up to 3&nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]) of [[Pluvial lake|pluvial]] lakes of varying size<ref>{{Cite web|title = Our Dynamic Desert|url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html|website = pubs.usgs.gov|access-date = 2015-06-20}}</ref> in a complex cycle mainly tied to changing climate patterns (particularly, glaciation during the numerous [[Timeline of glaciation#Land-based chronology of Quaternary glacial cycles|recent Ice Age cycles]]), but also influenced by the progressive depositing of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[River delta|deltas]] by the Colorado River (cf. [[Salton Sea]]),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = The Salton Sea:  California’s Overlooked Treasure - Chapter 1|url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/salton/PeriscopeSaltonSeaCh1-4.html|website = www.sci.sdsu.edu|access-date = 2015-06-20}}</ref> alternating with periodic water body breakthroughs and rearrangements due to [[erosion]] and the proximity of the [[San Andreas Fault]]. This has resulted in a high number of evaporating and reforming [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] lakes throughout the [[Quaternary Period]] in the area, with an intertwined history of various larger bodies of water subsuming smaller ones during water table maxima and the subsequent splitting and disappearance thereof during the evaporative part of the cycles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/bulletin118/basindescriptions/6-18.pdf|title=Death Valley Groundwater Basin|website=www.water.ca.gov|access-date=2015-06-20}}</ref>  Although these local cycles are now somewhat modified by human presence,<ref name=":0" /> their legacy persists; despite appearances much to the contrary, Death Valley actually sits atop one of the largest [[aquifer]]s in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Life in Death Valley ~ Little Fish, Big Splash {{!}} Nature {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/life-in-death-valley-little-fish-big-splash/5055/|access-date = 2015-06-20}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title = Death Valley Geology Field Trip: Shoreline Butte|url = http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/usgsnps/deva/ftsho1.html|website = www.nature.nps.gov|access-date = 2015-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Oasis near Death Valley fed by ancient aquifer under Nevada Test Site, study shows|url = http://news.byu.edu/archive10-jun-ashmeadows.aspx|website = news.byu.edu|access-date = 2015-06-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620231045/http://news.byu.edu/archive10-jun-ashmeadows.aspx|archive-date = June 20, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref>

Throughout the Quaternary's wetter spans, streams running from nearby mountains filled Death Valley, creating [[Lake Manly]], which during its greatest extents was approximately 80&nbsp;mi (130&nbsp;km) long and up to 600&nbsp;ft (180 m) deep.<ref name=":1" /><ref name="stoffer">{{cite journal | author=Philip Stoffer | title=Changing Climates and Ancient Lakes | work=Desert Landforms and Surface Processes in the Mojave National Preserve and Vicinity | version=Open-File Report 2004-1007 | publisher=USGS, US Department of the Interior | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html | date=January 14, 2004 | access-date=September 12, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091023192229/http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html| archive-date= October 23, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Numerous evaporation cycles and a lack of outflow caused an increasing [[Hypersaline lake|hypersalinity]], typical for endorheic bodies of water.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Saline Lake Ecosystems of the World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NOdvPFm6SyoC|publisher = Springer Science & Business Media|date = 1986-04-30|isbn = 9789061935353|first = U. T.|last = Hammer}}</ref>  Over time, this hypersalinization, combined with sporadic rainfall and occasional aquifer intrusion, has resulted in periods of "briny soup", or salty pools, on the lowest parts of Death Valley's floor. Salts (95% table salt – [[NaCl]]) began to crystallize, coating the surface with the thick crust, ranging from {{convert|3|to|60|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}, now observable at the basin floor.<ref name="USGS01" />

The [[Timbisha]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], formerly known as the Panamint Shoshone, were the original inhabitants of the Badwater Basin area. They have inhabited the valley for at least the past millennium.
