A unit of [[real estate]] or [[immovable property]] is limited by a legal '''boundary''' (sometimes also referred to as a '''property line''' or a '''lot line'''). The boundary (in Latin: ''limes'') may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a [[social construct]], adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of [[property rights]].

A [[cadastral map]] displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of [[ownership]]. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or [[jurisdiction]] is conceived of in terms more complex than a [[tessellation]]. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.<ref>Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, ''et al'', 2007.</ref>

A 'Western' version of the [[operationalization]] might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a [[Chartered Surveyor|chartered surveyor]], supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the [[cadastre]] as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as [[Songlines|song]] and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.<ref>Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., & Roe P.

Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional [[surveying|surveyor]] using a [[theodolite|transit]] and or modern [[Global Positioning System|Global Positioning System (GPS)]] technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a "plot plan" or "[[plat]]" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable "point of beginning". The [[metes and bounds]] method is also used to provide a legal description of a property.

On maps, the line may be marked with {{unichar|214a|PROPERTY LINE|size=200%|html=}}.

The â…Š symbol may also be used in architectural drawings and CAD design to show plates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Text Symbols and Special Characters Reference|url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/AutoCAD-Core/files/GUID-518E1A9D-398C-4A8A-AC32-2D85590CDBE1-htm.html|website=AutoDesk Knowledge Network|publisher=AutoDesk AutoCAD|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>
