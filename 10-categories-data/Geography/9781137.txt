A '''disease cluster''' is an unusually large aggregation of a relatively uncommon [[medical condition]] or event within a particular geographical location or period.<ref name=Portia2008>{{cite book |editor=Miquel Porta |title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Dr8dyuzvTkC |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-971815-3 |pages=42-43 |quote=Aggregations of relatively uncommon events or diseases in space and/or time in amounts that are believed or perceived to be greater than could be expected by chance. Putative disease clusters are often perceived to exist on the basis of anecdotal evidence, and much effort may be expended by epidemiologists and biostatisticians in assessing whether a true cluster of disease exists.}}</ref> Recognition of a cluster depends on its size being seen as greater than would be expected by the [[Randomness|play of chance]].<ref name=Portia2008/> Identification of a suspected disease cluster may initially depend on [[anecdotal evidence]].<ref name=Portia2008/> [[Epidemiologist]]s and [[biostatistician]]s need to assess whether the suspected cluster corresponds to an actual increase of disease in the area.<ref name=Portia2008/> Typically, when clusters are recognized, they are reported to [[public health]] departments in the local area. If clusters are of sufficient size and importance, they may be re-evaluated as [[outbreak]]s. 

[[John Snow]]'s pioneering investigation of the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|1854 cholera outbreak]] in [[Soho, London]], is seen as a classic example of the study of such a cluster.
