'''Exploration''' is the act of searching for the purpose of [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of [[information]] or resources. Exploration occurs in all [[Sessility (motility)|non-sessile]] animal species, including humans. In human [[history]], its most dramatic rise was during the [[Age of Discovery]] when [[European peoples|European]] explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, [[major explorations after the Age of Discovery]] have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.

==Notable periods of human exploration==

===Phoenician galley sailings===
The [[Phoenicia]]ns (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Asia Minor]] though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. According to [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] was a Phoenician from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] who sailed to [[North Africa]] and founded the city of [[Carthage]].

====Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa====
[[Hanno the Navigator]] (500 BC), a [[Carthage|Carthaginean]] navigator who explored the Western Coast of [[Africa]].

===Greek & Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule===
* The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] explorer from [[Marseille]], [[Pytheas]] (380 – ''c.'' 310 BC) was the first to circumnavigate [[Great Britain]], explore [[Germany]], and reach ''[[Thule]]'' (most commonly thought to be the [[Shetland Islands]] or [[Iceland]]).
* [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] -under [[Augustus]] emperor- reached and explored all the [[Baltic Sea]]

=== Roman explorations ===
;Africa Exploration
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the [[Sahara]] desert with five different routes:

*through the western Sahara, toward the [[Niger River|Niger river]] and actual [[Timbuktu]]. 
*through the [[Tibesti mountains]], toward [[Lake Chad]] and actual [[Nigeria]] 
*through the [[Nile]] river, toward actual [[Uganda]]. 
*though the western coast of Africa, toward the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands. 
*through the [[Red Sea]], toward actual [[Somalia]] and perhaps [[Tanzania]].

All these expeditions were supported by [[Legionary|legionaries]] and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor [[Nero]] seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of [[Ethiopia]] or [[Nubia]]: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.

One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.<ref>Roth, Jonathan 2002. ''The Roman Army in Tripolitana and Gold Trade with Sub-Saharan Africa''. APA Annual Convention. New Orleans.</ref>

The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the [[Indian Ocean]]).
The Romans also organized several explorations into [[Northern Europe]], and explored as far as [[China]] in [[Asia]].

;30 BC-640 AD: With the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, [[Roman trade with India|The Romans begin trading with India]]. The Empire now has a direct connection to the [[Spice trade]] Egypt had established beginning in 118 BC.

;100 AD-166 AD: [[Romano-Chinese relations]] begin. [[Ptolemy]] [[Geography (Ptolemy)|writes]] of the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]) and the trade port of [[Kattigara]], now identified as [[Óc Eo]] in northern [[Vietnam]], then part of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]], a province of the Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]]. The [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese historical texts]] describe Roman embassies, from a land they called ''[[Daqin]]''.

;2nd century: Roman traders reach [[Siam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Java]].

;161: An embassy from Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or his successor [[Marcus Aurelius]] reaches Chinese [[Emperor Huan of Han]] at [[Luoyang]].

;226: A Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits [[Nanjing]], China and the court of [[Sun Quan]], ruler of [[Eastern Wu]]

===Chinese exploration of Central Asia===
During the 2nd century BC, the [[Han dynasty]] explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]] (the Yuezhi had been evicted from [[Gansu]] by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the [[Hellenistic civilization|remnants of the conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336–323 BC).{{sfnm|di Cosmo|2002|1pp=247–249|Yü|1986|2p=407|Torday|1997|3p=104|4a1=Morton|4a2=Lewis|4y=2005|4pp=54–55}} When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi).{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=105–106}} Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the [[Indus River]] valley of [[Northwestern India]]) and Anxi ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories) further west.{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=108–112}}

===Viking Age===
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking settlements and voyages]]
From about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the [[Vikings]] explored Europe and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Viking]] explorer, [[Erik the Red]] (950–1003), sailed to and settled in [[Greenland]] after being expelled from [[Iceland]], while his son, the [[Iceland]]ic explorer [[Leif Ericson]] (980–1020), reached [[Newfoundland]] and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first [[Europe]]an to land in [[North America]].

===Polynesian Age===
[[File:Chronological dispersal of Austronesian people across the Pacific (per Benton et al, 2012, adapted from Bellwood, 2011).png|thumb|[[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion map]]
[[Polynesians]] were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and [[Oceania|south Pacific]] for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered [[New Zealand]]. The key invention to their exploration was the [[outrigger canoe]], which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at [[Wairau Bar]] in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the [[Society Islands]]. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly [[trade winds]] to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between [[Cook Islanders]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Maori]]. Early Maori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Maori settlement in New Zealand.

Mathematical modelling based on DNA [[Identity by descent|genome studies]], using [[state-of-the-art]] techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100–200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280. [[Otago University]] studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the [[Society Islands]].<ref>Otago University. Wairau Bar Studies 2011.Dr L. Matisoo-Smith.2011.</ref>

===Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean===
The Chinese explorer, [[Wang Dayuan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1311–1350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328–1333, he sailed along the [[South China Sea]] and visited many places in [[Southeast Asia]] and reached as far as [[South Asia]], landing in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]], and he even went to [[Australia]]. Then in 1334–1339, he visited [[North Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. Later, the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433) made [[Ming treasure voyages|seven voyages]] to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].

===European Age of Discovery===
[[File:Viajes_de_colon_en.svg|thumb|300px|The Transatlantic [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]]]]
The [[Age of Discovery]], also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. [[Portuguese empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish empire|Spain]] dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as [[British empire|England]], [[Dutch empire|Netherlands]], and [[French colonial empire|France]].

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|300px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India run]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]

Important explorations during this period went to a number of continents and regions around the globe. In Africa, important explorers of this period include [[Diogo Cão]] (c.1452 –c.1486) who discovered and ascended the [[Congo River]] and reached the coasts of the present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (c. 1450–1500), who was the first European to reach the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and other parts of the [[South Africa]]n coast.

Explorers of routes from Europe towards Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean, include [[Vasco da Gama]] (1460–1524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the [[East]]; [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]] (c. 1467/68–c.1520) who, following the path of Gama, claimed [[Brazil]] and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; [[Diogo Dias]], who discovered the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]] and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]] and [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (1470–1555), among others, who discovered and mapped the [[Mascarene Islands]] and other archipelagos.

[[António de Abreu]] (c.1480–c.1514) and [[Francisco Serrão]] (14?–1521) led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges), through the [[Sunda Islands]], reaching the [[Moluccas]]. [[Andres de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568) discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas.

In the Pacific Ocean, [[Jorge de Menezes]] (c. 1498–?), discovered [[Papua New Guinea]]. [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] (1490–1526), discovered the [[Marshall Islands]].

;Discovery of America

Explorations of the Americas began with the initial discovery of America by [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506), who led a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ([[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]) expedition across the Atlantic, [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovering America]]. After the discovery of America by Columbus, a number of important expeditions were sent out to explore the Western Hemisphere. This included [[Juan Ponce de León]] (1474–1521), who discovered and mapped the coast of [[Florida]]; [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] (c. 1475–1519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]]) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; [[Aleixo Garcia]] (14?–1527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], crossing the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reaching the [[Andes]] (near [[Sucre]]).

[[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] (1490–1558) discovered the [[Mississippi River]] and was the first European to sail the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and cross [[Texas]]. [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557) drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] (1510–1554) discovered the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Colorado River]]; [[Francisco de Orellana]] (1511–1546) was the first European to navigate the length of the [[Amazon River]].

;Further explorations

[[Ferdinand Magellan]] (1480–1521), was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the [[Strait of Magellan]], the [[Tuamotus]] and [[Mariana Islands]], and achieving a nearly complete [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time. [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] (1476–1526), completed the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|global circumnavigation]].

In the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century exploration of Asia and the Pacific Ocean continued with explorers such as [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] (1565–1614), who discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] and the [[Vanuatu]] archipelago; [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] (1542–1595), who discovered the [[Tuvalu]] archipelago, the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Wake Island]].

Explorers of Australia included [[Willem Janszoon]] (1570–1630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez]], who discovered and reached eastern and northern [[New Guinea]]; [[Luis Váez de Torres]] (1565–1613), who discovered the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]; [[Abel Tasman]] (1603–1659), who explored North Australia, discovered [[Tasmania]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tongatapu]].

In North America, major explorers included [[Henry Hudson]] (156?–1611), who explored the [[Hudson Bay]] in Canada; [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1574–1635), who explored [[St. Lawrence River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (in Canada and northern United States); and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643–1687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.

===The Modern Age===
{{also|Deep-sea exploration}}
[[File:Carte Lewis-Clark Expedition-en.png|thumb|Route of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]]]
Long after the golden age of discovery, other explorers ''completed'' the world map, such as various [[Russian Empire|Russians]] explorers, reaching the [[Siberia]]n Pacific coast and the [[Bering Strait]], at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); [[Vitus Bering]] (1681–1741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], the North American coast of [[Alaska]], and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and [[James Cook]], who explored the east coast of Australia, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and circumnavigated the Antarctic continent.

There were still significant explorations which occurred well into the modern age. This includes the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]] (1804-1806), an overland expedition dispatched by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to explore the newly-acquired Louisiana Purchase and to find an interior aquatic route to the Pacific Ocean, along with other objectives to examine the flora and fauna of the continent. In 1818, the British researcher [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching [[jellyfish]] and [[worm]]s in about {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} depth with a special device. The [[United States Exploring Expedition]] (1838-1842) was an expedition sent by President [[Andrew Jackson]], in order to survey the Pacific Ocean and surrounding lands.

The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure them. In the 20th century, deep-sea exploration advanced considerably through a series of technological inventions, ranging from the [[sonar]] system, which can detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound, to manned [[Deep-submergence vehicle|deep-diving submersibles]]. In 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Don Walsh|Donald Walsh]] descended in the [[bathyscaphe]] [[Bathyscaphe Trieste|''Trieste'']] into the deepest part of the world's oceans, the [[Mariana Trench]].<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-piccard-oceanographer-and-pioneer-of-deepsea-exploration-992032.html |title=Jacques Piccard: Oceanographer and pioneer of deep-sea exploration - Obituaries, News |publisher=The Independent |date= 2008-11-05|access-date=2010-09-17 | location=London}}</ref> In 2018, {{ship||DSV Limiting Factor}}, piloted by [[Victor Vescovo]], completed the first mission to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, diving {{Convert|8,375|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the ocean surface to the base of the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/22/wall-street-trader-reaches-bottom-of-atlantic-in-bid-to-conquer-five-oceans|title=Wall Street trader reaches bottom of Atlantic in bid to conquer five oceans|last=Neate|first=Rupert|date=2018-12-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> With the advent of satellite imagery and aviation, exploration of the surface of [[Earth]] has largely ceased, however the culture of many disconnected tribes still remain undocumented and left to be explored. Urban exploration is the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment.

===Space exploration===
[[Space exploration]] started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric [[rocket]]s.  This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the [[Moon]], and to send robotic explorers to other [[planet]]s and far beyond.

Both of the [[Voyager probes]] have left the [[Solar System]], bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.

==Behavioral trait==
{{see|Individual mobility}}
A 2015 study, performed on mobile phone data and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in [[Italy]], demonstrated that individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits, dubbed "returners" and "explorers".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|display-authors=etal|volume=6|pages=8166|pmc=4569739|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6.8166P}}</ref>
