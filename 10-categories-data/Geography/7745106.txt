In 2003 the institute received part of a $4.2 million [[National Science Foundation]] grant for a study of pollution in the [[Hudson River]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Researchers to track Hudson River pollution into Atlantic |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2003-05-12-hudson-pollute_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2003-12-05 |accessdate=2008-03-07 | first1=Todd B. | last1=Bates | agency=[[Asbury Park Press]]}}</ref>

In the Fall of 2006, FERI spun off a for profit project focused on the development of an online mapping portal called [[WeoGeo]].
