'''Honorius Augustodunensis''' (c. 1080–1154), commonly known as '''Honorius of Autun''', was a very popular 12th-century [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology|theologian]] who wrote prolifically on many subjects. He wrote in a non-scholastic manner, with a lively style, and his works were approachable for the lay community in general. He was, therefore, something of a popularizer of clerical learning.

==Life==
Very little is known of his life. He says that he is ''Honorius Augustodunensis ecclesiae presbyter et scholasticus'', but nothing else is known. "Augustodunensis" was taken to mean [[Autun]] (''Augustodunum''), but that identification is now generally rejected. However, there is no solid reasoning for any other identification (such as [[Augst]]/''Augustodunensem praesulem'' near Basle, [[Augsburg]]/''Augusta Vindelicorum'' in [[Swabia]], or ''Augustinensis'', from [[St Augustine's Abbey]] at [[Canterbury]]), so his by-name has stuck. It is certain that he was a [[monk]] and that he traveled to [[Kingdom of England|England]] and was a student of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s for some time. Toward the end of his life, he was in the [[Scots Monastery, Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]], probably living as a recluse.

==Works==

Among Honorius's works are:
*''[[Elucidarium]]'': a survey of Christian beliefs (written in England). It was translated frequently into vernacular.
*''Sigillum sanctae Mariae'': a set of lessons for how to celebrate the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]], together with a commentary on ''[[The Song of Songs]]'', which he sees as being principally about [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].
*''Gemma animae'': An allegorical view of the liturgy and its practices.
* A commentary on ''The Song of Songs,'' (preserved in a manuscript from c. 1170).<ref>{{Cite web

*A long commentary on the [[Psalms]].
*''Clavis physicae'', the first part (1-315) is a summary of the first four books of [[Johannes Scotus Erigena]] ''Periphyseon'' ([[De divisione naturae]]), the second part (316-529) is a reproduction of the fifth book.
*''De luminaribus ecclesiae'': a bibliography of Christian authors, which ends with a list of twenty-one of his own works.

His most important work was the ''Imago mundi'', an encyclopedia of popular [[cosmology]] and geography combined with a chronicle of world history. It was translated into many different [[vernacular]] languages and was popular throughout the medieval period. It contained, among other things, a scheme for the operation of [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]]s.

A major scholar of Honorius is [[Valerie Flint]], whose essays on him are collected in ''Ideas in the Medieval West: Texts and their Contexts'' (London, 1988). See also her study of Honorius in Constant J. Mews and Valerie I. J. Flint, ''Peter Abelard; Honorius of Regensburg'' (Aldershot, 1995).
