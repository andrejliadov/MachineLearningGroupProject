{{short description|Point or an area on the Earth's surface or elsewhere}}
In [[geography]], '''location''' or '''place''' are used to denote a [[region (geometry)|region]] (point, line, or area) on the [[earth]]'s surface or elsewhere. The term ''location'' generally implies a higher degree of certainty than ''place'', the latter often indicating an entity with an ambiguous boundary, relying more on human or social attributes of [[place identity]] and [[sense of place]] than on geometry.

==Types==

===Locality===
A [[locality (settlement)|locality]], settlement, or populated place is likely to have a well-defined name but a boundary that is not well defined varies by context. [[London]], for instance, has a legal boundary, but this is unlikely to completely match with general usage. An area within a town, such as [[Covent Garden]] in London, also almost always has some ambiguity as to its extent. In geography, location is considered to be more precise than "place".

===Relative location===
A relative location, or situation, is described as a displacement from another site. An example is "3 miles northwest of [[Seattle]]".

===Absolute location===
An absolute location is designated using a specific pairing of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] grid — for example, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] or an ellipsoid-based system such as the [[World Geodetic System]] — or similar methods. For instance, the position of [[Lake Maracaibo]] in Venezuela can be expressed using the coordinate system as the location 9.80°N (latitude), 71.56°W (longitude). It is, however, just one way. There are several alternative ways.{{clarify|what are the alternatives|date=June 2020}}

Absolute locations are also relative locations, since even absolute locations are expressed relative to something else. For example, longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Prime Meridian]], a line arbitrarily chosen to pass through [[Greenwich|Greenwich, England]]. Similarly, latitude is the number of degrees north or south of the [[Equator]]. Because latitude and longitude are expressed ''relative'' to these lines, a position expressed in latitude and longitude is also a relative location.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gersmehl |first=Philip |date=2008 |title=Teaching Geography |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachinggeograph0000gers_t3i9/page/60 60] |isbn=978-1-59385-715-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/teachinggeograph0000gers_t3i9/page/60 }}</ref>
