'''Easting''' and '''northing''' are [[Geography|geographic]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] for a point. Easting is the [[east]]ward-measured distance (or the ''x''-[[coordinate]]) and northing is the [[north]]ward-measured distance (or the ''y''-coordinate). When using common projections such as the [[transverse Mercator projection]], these are distances [[Map projection|projected]] on an imaginary surface similar to a bent sheet of paper, and are not the same as distances measured on the [[Figure of the Earth|curved surface of the Earth]].

Easting and northing coordinates are commonly measured in metres from the axes of some [[datum (geodesy)#Horizontal datum|horizontal datum]]. However, other units (e.g., [[survey foot|survey feet]]) are also used. The coordinates are most commonly associated with the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system#Locating a position using UTM coordinates|Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM), which has unique zones that cover the Earth to provide detailed referencing.

==Notation and conventions==
Locations can be found using easting/northing (or '' x'', ''y'') pairs. The pair is usually represented conventionally with easting first, northing second.

For example, the peak of [[Mount Assiniboine]] (at {{coord|50|52|10|N|115|39|03|W}}) in UTM Zone 11 is represented by <code>11U 594934 5636174</code>. Other conventions can also be used, such as a truncated grid reference,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bivouac.com/PgxPg.asp?PgxId=155 |title=Truncated Grid References |publisher=Bivouac.com – Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia|date=2006-11-17}}</ref> which would shorten the example coordinates to <code>949-361</code>.

Negative northing and easting values indicate a position due south and west of the origin, respectively.

{{anchor|False origin}}{{anchor|Natural origin}}Usually associated with a map projection is a ''natural origin'', e.g., at which the ellipsoid and flat map surfaces coincide.<ref name=OGP7_2>{{cite web|title=Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2 Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas|url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)|accessdate=5 March 2014|pages=9–10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014}}</ref> To ensure that the northing and easting coordinates on a map are not negative, map projections may set up a ''false origin'', specified in terms of ''false northing'' and ''false easting'' values, that offset the true origin.
