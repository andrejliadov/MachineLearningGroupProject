The '''Australian Geography Competition''' is an Australia-wide competition run by the [[Royal Geographic Society of Queensland]] and the [[Australian Geography Teachers Association]] and sponsored by the [[National Geographic Channel]]. It tests the geographic knowledge of high school students from years 8-12. It starts with a written multiple choice test in early March. In the under 16 competition the winners from each state & the territories (Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, Cocos Islands) are taken as well as a runner up who has the highest score after these winners. These people are flown to Sydney at the start of June for a weekend of sightseeing followed by the national final. The winners go on to the [[National Geographic World Championship]] to represent Australia. The competition is also used to select the members of the Australian team for the [[International Geography Olympiad]].
