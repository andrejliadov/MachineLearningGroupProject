'''Antichthones''', in [[geography]], are those peoples who inhabit the [[antipodes]], regions on opposite sides of the [[Earth]]. The word is compounded of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ὰντὶ'' ("opposed") and ''χθών'' ("earth").

[[Classical Europe|Classical]] and [[Medieval Europe]] considered the Earth to be divided by the [[equator]] into two [[Sphere|hemispheres]], the northern and southern; those who inhabited one of these hemispheres were said to be antichthones to those of the other. This idea was expounded by [[Pomponius Mela|Mela]] and other Classical authors, though Christian writers, who believed that all people on earth must be descended from Adam, denied the possibility that any southern land, if it existed, could be inhabited by humans. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], arguing from a position of scriptural [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], wrote in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' "it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man."<ref name="CITYO'GOD">{{cite book|last1=Dods |first1=Marcus (translator) |authorlink1=Philip Schaff |last2=St. Augustine |authorlink2=Augustine of Hippo |title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine |chapter=Book XVI, Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes. |volume=2 |editor1=Philip Schaff |work=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |year=1890 |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702022213/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archivedate=July 2, 2003 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 24, 2016 }}</ref>
