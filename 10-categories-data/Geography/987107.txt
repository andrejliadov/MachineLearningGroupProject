The non-existent '''Buenaventura River''', alternatively '''San Buenaventura River''', '''Río Buenaventura''', etc. was once believed to run from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] through the [[Great Basin]] region of what is now the western [[United States]]. The river was chronologically the last of several imagined incarnations of an imagined [[Great River of the West]] which would be for [[North America]] west of the Rockies what the [[Mississippi River]] was east of the Rockies. The hopes were to find a waterway from coast to coast, sparing the traveling around [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of [[South America]].<ref name=Harvey>[[Miles Harvey]], ''The Island of Lost Maps: A True Story of Cartographic Crime'', p.&nbsp;208&ndash;215.

==Dominguez, Vélez de Escalante and Miera==
In 1776, two Franciscan missionaries Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante sought to find a land route between [[Santa Fe (New Mexico)|Santa Fe]] in [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] to [[Monterey (California)|Monterey]] in [[Alta California]].{{efn |Both of these territories were then provinces of [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]].}} They were part of what has become known as the [[Dominguez–Escalante Expedition]], a ten-man expedition including [[Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco]] (Miera) acting as the cartographer.{{efn|They were joined en route by two Native American guides.<ref name=Moody>{{cite book |last=Moody |first= Ralph| title=The Old Trails West|publisher=Thomas Y. Cromwell Company|location= New York|year= 1963 |page= 157ff|url=https://archive.org/details/oldtrailswest00mood_0|url-access=registration }}</ref>}} On September 13, they encountered what is now called the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], a southward-flowing [[tributary]] of the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado]] and named it ''San Buenaventura'' after  the catholic saint [[Bonaventure]].

[[Image:Miera map 1778.jpg|thumb|300px|Map by Barnardo de Miera, 1778, depicting the Buenaventura River as a faulty combination of [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] and [[Sevier River]].  The depiction of "Lake Timpanogos" with a narrow strait in the middle is probably a misunderstanding of the indigenes' description of the large lake to the north (the [[Great Salt Lake]]) as directly connected to Utah Lake rather than connected by the 50 mile long [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]].  "Laguna de Miera" is the [[Sevier Lake]], again drawn from descriptions by the indigenes.]]

At that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante's journal<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |title=The Diary and Itinerary of Fathers Domínguez and Escalante -- English Translation |work=Early Americas Digital Archive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928071254/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/gateway/diario/diary.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 }}</ref> correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today's White River? – which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south.<ref>Escalante Journal, September 17</ref> So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name.

The lake to the north, just west of the city of [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], is [[Utah Lake]].  The south tip of the Great Salt Lake can be seen at the top of the map.]]
After establishing contact with a branch of the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called [[Lake Timpanogos]] (various spellings), now called "[[Utah Lake]]," the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the [[Sevier River]]) flowing from the south-southeast, and turned toward the west at the point where they encountered it. Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream--the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake ([[Sevier Lake]]) and beyond.  The Sevier Lake has no outlet, so the indigenes may have been referring to the west-flowing [[Humboldt River]], which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Dale L. |title=Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the American West |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NuoINGBjQIC |publisher=Bison Book University of Nebraska Books |location= Lincoln, London |origyear=1953|year=1964 |isbn=0-8032-5138-6|edition=paperback|page=182}}</ref>

Despite Dominguez and Vélez de Escalante's doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depict the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake{{efn|Why Meira disregarded the evidence the two rivers were not the same is a mystery.

The error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalanté expedition to prepare his maps in 1804<ref>{{cite web|last=von Humboldt|first=Alexander|website= Library of Congress| title=General chart of the kingdom of New Spain betn. parallels of 16 & 380 N. from materials in Mexico at commencement of year of 1804 |date=1804|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2001622416/}}</ref> and 1809.<ref>{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=von Humboldt |first=Alexander |title=Carte Generale Du Royaume De La Nouvelle Espagne |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~1866~170004 |date=1809|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}</ref>  [[Zebulon Pike]] used Humboldt's maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810.<ref>{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Pike |first=Zebulon Montgomery |title=Map of The Internal Provinces of New Spain |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~930~60171 |date=1810|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}</ref> [[Aaron Arrowsmith]] in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to "Lac Sale".<ref>{{cite web|last=Arrowsmith|first=Aaron |website= Library of Congress| title=A map exhibiting all the new discoveries in the interior parts of North America. |date=1814|accessdate=December 26, 2015|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3300.ct001203//}}</ref>  These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante.

==Extending the Buenaventura West to the Pacific==

[[File:San Joaquin River watershed.png|thumb|Watershed map of the San Joaquin River, depicting its head in the Sierra Nevada]]
There had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage.{{efn|A map by [[Robert Sayer]] (1750?)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3300.np000059 |title = A new map of North America, with the British, French, Spanish, Dutch & Danish dominions on that great continent; and the West India Islands}}</ref> shows the Great River of the West flowing from Lake Winnipeg}}  When [[Francisco Garcés]] drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and he drew the "San Felipe" or [[San Joaquin River]] originating beyond the Sierras in the [[Great Basin]] and flowing to the Pacific Ocean, in or near [[San Francisco Bay]]. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]  (1784), they extended the "San Felipe" almost to the Sevier Lake.<ref>Cline, op. cit. pp. 52-3</ref>  A similar map was published in 1820 by [[Sidney Edwards Morse|Sidney E.

Other cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and "Lac Salado" to the Pacific Ocean.  [[Henry Schenck Tanner|Henry S. Tanner]]'s influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay.<ref>{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=North America...S.W.

In 1825, [[William Henry Ashley|William H.

Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL.  The next spring his partner, [[Jedediah Smith]], explored areas the north and west of the GSL, but found no rivers flowing from it.  He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were also unsuccessful in finding the "Los Mongos R." and "R. Timpanogos". However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the "R. Timpanogos" as "R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos".<ref>{{cite web|website=David Rumsey Map Collection |last=Tanner |first=Henry S. |title=Mexico & Guatemala |url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~567~60205 |date=1836|accessdate=December 26, 2015}}</ref> So, when, in 1841, [[John Bidwell]] embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bidwell |first=John|website=longcamp.com|editor=Bob Graham |url=http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |date=1890|title=Quotes from Frèmont et. al. on His Search for the Buenaventura}} from {{cite journal |journal=The Century; A Popular Quarterly|title=Gold Hunters of California.

After Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura.  In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake.  Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further.

In the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer.  He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet.

The Buenaventura River's existence or non-existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when [[John Charles Frémont]], with Thomas Fitzpatrick and [[Kit Carson]] as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the [[Columbia River]] to [[Sacramento, California]] via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at [[Walker River (Nevada)|Walker River]], he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist.<ref name=Harvey/><ref>[http://www.longcamp.com/buenaventura.html Excerpts] from Frémont's journals.

After Frémont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, [[James K. Polk|President Polk]] was reluctant to accept his conclusion.<ref>Frémont, op, cit.</ref> However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Frémont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], directed their ambitions to a [[transcontinental railway]], which was completed in 1869, after the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48 and the [[American Civil War]].
