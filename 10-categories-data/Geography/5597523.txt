'''Desert exploration''' is the deliberate and scientific [[exploration]] of [[desert]]s, the [[arid]] regions of the [[earth]]. It is only incidentally concerned with the culture and livelihood of native desert dwellers. People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. [[Nomad]]s have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available, and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. Many, such as the [[Bushmen]] in the [[Kalahari]], the [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Australia and various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], were originally [[hunter-gatherer]]s.  Many [[trade route]]s have been forged across deserts, especially across the [[Sahara Desert]], and traditionally were used by [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] of [[camel]]s carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of [[slave]]s were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Today, some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts, and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of [[solar energy]].

Many people think of deserts as consisting of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is the way they are often depicted on TV and in films,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/education/ask/?quid=121 |title=Misconceptions surround desert terrain, vegetation |date=2001-07-11 |work=Ask a Scientist |publisher=Cornell Center for Materials Research |accessdate=2013-09-24}}</ref> but deserts do not always look like this.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/habitats/Deserts_and_xeric_shrublands | title=Habitats: Desert | publisher=BBC Nature | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref> Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia.<ref name="USGS-DF">{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/features/ | title=Desert Features | publisher=United States Geological Survey | date=1997-10-29 | accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref> Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of [[dune]]s.<ref name="USGS-DF"/> The following sections list deserts around the world, and their explorers.

**The Romans organized expeditions to cross the [[Sahara]] desert with five different routes. All these expeditions were supported by [[Legionary|legionaries]] and had mainly a commercial purpose.One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.:<ref>Roth, Jonathan 2002. ''The Roman Army in Tripolitana and Gold Trade with Sub-Saharan Africa''. APA Annual Convention. New Orleans.</ref>
***through the western Sahara, toward the [[Niger River|Niger river]] and present day [[Timbuktu]]. 
***through the [[Tibesti mountains]], toward [[Lake Chad]] and present day [[Nigeria]] 
***through the [[Nile]] river, toward present day [[Uganda]]. 
***though the western coast of Africa, toward the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands. 
***through the [[Red Sea]], toward present day [[Somalia]] and perhaps [[Tanzania]].
**[[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]] & [[Mariantonietta Peru]] – made the first recorded crossing of the Sahara from west to east, by camel and on foot, from Nouakchott, Mauretania, to Abu Simbel, Egypt,  1986–87, a distance of 4500 miles  [[Ref: The Modern Explorers. Thames & Hudson. London 2013]] Michael Asher lived for 3 years with the Kababish nomads in the Sudan.

==Asia==
* [[Arabian Desert]] has been populated since prehistory. [[Rub' al Khali]] or the ''Empty Quarter'' in its remote center is one of the largest continuous bodies of [[sand]] in the world. It was recently explored by Europeans: 
**[[Bertram Thomas]] in 1931 and 
**[[St. John Philby]] in 1932: first documented journeys by Westerners 
**[[Wilfred Thesiger]] in 1946–50 crossed it several times and mapped large parts of it
**In June 1950, a [[US Air Force]] expedition crossed the Rub' al Khali from [[Dhahran]], Saudi Arabia, to central Yemen and back<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zianet.com/tmorris/june1950expedition-1.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image|website=Zianet.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}</ref> in trucks to collect specimens for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and to test desert survival procedures.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ted A.

* [[Gobi Desert]] has a long history of human habitation, mostly by nomadic peoples.  The Gobi Desert as a whole was known only very imperfectly to outsiders, as information was confined to observations by individual travelers engaging in their respective itineraries across the desert.

==North America==
{{main|List of North American deserts}}
Before the European exploration of North America, tribes of Native Americans, such as the [[Mohave people|Mohave]] (in the Mojave desert), the [[Chemehuevi]] (in the Great Basin desert), and the [[Quechan]] (in the Colorado desert) were [[hunter-gatherer]]s living in the California deserts.<ref name=MojaveNPS>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/moja/historyculture/index.htm|title=History & Culture|work=Mojave National Preserve|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref> European explorers started exploring the deserts beginning in the 18th century. [[Francisco Garcés]], a [[Franciscan]] friar, was the first explorer of the Colorado and Mojave deserts in 1776.<ref name=MojaveNet>{{cite web|url=http://mojavedesert.net/people/garces.html|title=Fr. Francisco Garces|work=Profiles in Mojave Desert History|publisher=Digital-Desert}}</ref> Garcés recorded information about the original inhabitants of the deserts.

Later, as American interests expanded into California, American explorers started probing the California deserts. [[Jedediah Smith]] travelled through the Great Basin and Mojave deserts in 1826, finally reaching the [[San Gabriel Mission]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Bil|last=Gilbert|title=The Trailblazers|url=https://archive.org/details/trailblazers00time|url-access=registration|publisher=Time-Life Books|year=1973|pages=[https://archive.org/details/trailblazers00time/page/96 96]–100, 107}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Alson J.|last=Smith|title=Men Against the Mountains: Jedediah Smith and the South West Expedition of 1826–1829|url=https://archive.org/details/menagainstmounta00smit|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=John Day Co.|year=1965}}</ref> [[John C.
