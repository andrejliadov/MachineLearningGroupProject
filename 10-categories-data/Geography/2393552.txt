The terms "[[Old World]]" vs. "New World" are meaningful in historical context and for the purpose of distinguishing the world's major [[biogeographic realm]]s, and to classify plant and animal species that originated therein.

One can speak of the "New World" in a [[history|historical]] context, e.g., when discussing the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]], the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] and other events of the [[European colonization of the Americas|colonial]] period. For lack of alternatives, the term is also still useful to those discussing issues that concern the Americas and the nearby [[Island#Oceanic islands|oceanic islands]], such as [[Bermuda]] and [[Clipperton Island]], collectively.

The term "New World" is used in a [[biology|biological]] context, when one speaks of Old World ([[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]], [[Afrotropical realm|Afrotropic]]) and New World species ([[Nearctic realm|Nearctic]], [[Neotropical realm|Neotropic]]). Biological [[Biological classification|taxonomists]] often attach the "New World" label to groups of species that are found exclusively in the Americas, to distinguish them from their counterparts in the "Old World" (Europe, Africa and Asia), e.g. [[New World monkey]]s, [[New World vulture]]s, [[New World warbler]]s.

The label is also often used in agriculture. Asia, Africa, and Europe share a common agricultural history stemming from the [[Neolithic Revolution]], and the same domesticated plants and animals spread through these three continents thousands of years ago, making them largely indistinct and useful to classify together as "Old World". Common Old World crops (e.g., [[barley]], [[lentil]]s, [[oats]], [[pea]]s, [[rye]], [[wheat]]), and domesticated animals (e.g., [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[goat]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pig]]s, [[sheep]]) did not exist in the Americas until they were introduced by post-[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbian contact]] in the 1490s (see "[[Columbian Exchange]]"). Conversely, many common [[crops]] were originally domesticated in the Americas before they spread worldwide after Columbian contact, and are still often referred to as "[[New World crops]]"; [[common bean]]s (''phaseolus''), [[maize]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]] – the "[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]" – as well as the [[avocado]], [[tomato]], and wide varieties of [[capsicum]] ([[bell pepper]], [[chili pepper]], etc.), and the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] were originally domesticated by [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in [[Mesoamerica]], while agriculturalists in the [[Andean]] region of South America brought forth the [[cassava]], [[peanut]], [[potato]], [[quinoa]] and domesticated animals like the [[alpaca]], [[guinea pig]] and [[llama]]. Other famous New World crops include the [[cashew]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rubber]], [[sunflower]], [[tobacco]], and [[vanilla]], and fruits like the [[guava]], [[papaya]] and [[pineapple]]. There are rare instances of overlap, e.g., the [[calabash]] (bottle-gourd), [[cotton]], and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], and the [[dog]], are believed to have been domesticated separately in both the [[Old World|Old]] and New World, their early forms possibly brought along by [[Paleo-Indians]] from Asia during the [[last glacial period]].

In [[glossary of wine terms|wine terminology]], "New World" has a different definition. "[[New World wine]]s" include not only North American and South American wines, but also those from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and all other locations outside the traditional wine-growing regions of Europe, North Africa and the [[Near East]].<ref name="Wine Folly">{{cite web|url=http://winefolly.com/review/new-world-vs-old-world-wine/|title=Real Differences: New World vs Old World Wine |website=[[Wine Folly]] |date=21 August 2012}}</ref>

==Origin of term==

[[File:Stradanus America.jpg|thumb|Allegory of the New World: ''[[Amerigo Vespucci]] awakens the sleeping America'']]
The term "New World" ("Mundus Novus") was first coined by the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], in a letter written to his friend and former patron [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463–1503)|Lorenzo di Pier Francesco de' Medici]] in the Spring of 1503, and published (in [[Latin]]) in 1503–04 under the title ''Mundus Novus''. Vespucci's letter contains arguably the first explicit articulation in print of the hypothesis that the lands discovered by European navigators to the west were not the edges of Asia, as asserted by [[Christopher Columbus]], but rather an entirely different continent, a "New World".<ref name="M.H.Davidson 1997 p.417"/>

According to ''Mundus Novus'', Vespucci realized that he was in a "New World" on 17 August 1501<ref>The letter says 17 August 1501, although translators variously rendered it also as 7 August 1501, 10 August 1501, or 1 August 1501. {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDYSAAAAYAAJ&q=amerigo+vespucci+17+agosto&pg=PA158 |title=Viaggi di Amerigo Vespucci |last=Canovai |first=Stanislao |year=1832 |page=158}} {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ci4LAwAAQBAJ&q=amerigo+vespucci+17+agosto&pg=PA222 |title=Amerigo Vespucci |last=Bonari |first=Bruno |date=July 2013 |page=222|isbn=9788890695681 }}</ref> as he arrived in Brazil and compared the nature and people of the place with what Portuguese sailors told him about Asia. In fact, a famous chance meeting between two different expeditions had occurred at the watering stop of "Bezeguiche" (the Bay of [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]) – Vespucci's own outgoing expedition, on its way to chart the coast of newly discovered [[Brazil]], and the vanguard ships of the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second Portuguese India armada]] of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], returning home from India. Having already visited the Americas in prior years, Vespucci probably found it difficult to reconcile what he had already seen in the [[West Indies]], with what the returning sailors told him of the [[East Indies]]. Vespucci wrote a preliminary letter to Lorenzo, while anchored at Bezeguiche, which he sent back with the Portuguese fleet – at this point only expressing a certain puzzlement about his conversations.<ref>This preliminary letter from Bezeguiche was not published, but remained in manuscript form. It is reproduced in F.A. de Varnhagen ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA78 |title=Amerígo Vespucci, son caractère, ses écrits ... sa vie et ses navigations ... |last=de Varnhagen |first=Francisco Adolfo |year=1865 |pages=78–82 |via=Google Books}}).</ref> Vespucci was finally convinced when he proceeded on his mapping expedition through 1501–02, covering the huge stretch of coast of eastern Brazil. After returning from Brazil, in the Spring of 1503, Amerigo Vespucci composed the ''Mundus Novus'' letter in Lisbon to Lorenzo in Florence, with its famous opening paragraph:<ref>English translation of ''Mundus Novus'' as found in Markham ({{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wAuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA42  |title=The Letters of Amerigo Vespucci and Other Documents Illustrative of His Career |last=Vespucci |first=Amerigo |translator-last=Markham |translator-first=Clements |translator-link=Clements Markham |year=1894 |pages=42–52 |via=Google Books}})</ref>

{{quote|In passed days I wrote very fully to you of my return from new countries, which have been found and explored with the ships, at the cost and by the command of this Most Serene King of Portugal; and it is lawful to call it a new world, because none of these countries were known to our ancestors and to all who hear about them they will be entirely new. For the opinion of the ancients was, that the greater part of the world beyond the equinoctial line to the south was not land, but only sea, which they have called the Atlantic; and even if they have affirmed that any continent is there, they have given many reasons for denying it is inhabited. But this opinion is false, and entirely opposed to the truth. My last voyage has proved it, for I have found a continent in that southern part; full of animals and more populous than our Europe, or Asia, or Africa, and even more temperate and pleasant than any other region known to us.|}}

Vespucci's letter was a publishing sensation in Europe, immediately (and repeatedly) reprinted in several other countries.<ref>Varnhagen, ''Amerígo Vespucci'' (1865:  [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 13–26]) provides side-by-side reproductions of both the 1503 Latin version ''Mundus Novus'', and the 1507 Italian re-translation "El Nuovo Mondo de Lengue Spagnole interpretato in Idioma Ro. Libro Quinto" (from ''Paesi Nuovamente retrovati''). The Latin version of ''Mundus Novus'' was reprinted many times (see Varnhagen, 1865: [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9QOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 9] for a list of early reprints).</ref>

=== Prior usage ===

While Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term "New World" (''Mundus Novus'') for the Americas in his 1503 letter, certainly giving it its popular cachet, similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.

The [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] had used the term "un altro mundo" ("another world") to refer to [[sub-Saharan Africa]], which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.<ref>Cadamosto ''Navigationi'', c. 1470, as reprinted in Giovanni Ramusio (1554: [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_iZ5TZHXOnYcC/page/n215 p. 106]). See also M. Zamora ''Reading Columbus'', (1993: p. 121)</ref> However, this was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new "fourth" part of the world. Cadamosto was quite aware sub-Saharan Africa was firmly part of the African continent.

The [[Italy|Italian]]-born Spanish chronicler [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]] often shares credit with Vespucci for designating the Americas as a new world.<ref>{{cite book| last= de Madariaga | first= Salvador | author-link= Salvador de Madariaga | year=1952 | publisher= Editorial Hermes | location= Mexico | edition= 5th | title= Vida del muy magnífico señor Don Cristóbal Colón | page= 363 | quote= "nuevo mundo", [...] designación que Pedro Mártyr será el primero en usar | language= es}}</ref> Peter Martyr used the term ''Orbe Novo'' (literally, "New Globe", but often translated as "New World") in the title of his history of the discovery of the Americas as a whole, which began to appear in 1511 (cosmologically, "orbis" as used here refers to the whole hemisphere, while "mundus" refers to the land within it).<ref>J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: p. 268)</ref> Peter Martyr had been writing and circulating private letters commenting on Columbus's discoveries since 1493 and, from the start, doubted Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia ("the Indies"), and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.<ref>E.G. Bourne ''Spain in America, 1450–580'' New York: Harper (1904: p. 30)</ref> Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Peter Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the "western antipodes" ("antipodibus occiduis", letter of 14 May 1493),<ref>Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 130 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 72])</ref> the "new hemisphere of the earth" ("novo terrarum hemisphaerio", 13 September 1493),<ref>Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 133, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA73#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 73]</ref> and in a letter dated 1 November 1493, refers to Columbus as the "discoverer of the new globe" ("Colonus ille novi orbis repertor").<ref>Peter Martyr, ''Opus Epistolarum'' (Letter 138, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 76])</ref> A year later (20 October 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe ("Novo Orbe") and the "Western hemisphere."("ab occidente hemisphero").<ref>Peter Martyr ''Opus Epistolarum'', Letter 156 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmFEAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 88]</ref>

[[Christopher Columbus]] touched the continent of South America in his 1498 [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third voyage]]. In his own 1499 letter to the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain, reporting the results of his third voyage, Columbus relates how the massive waters of the [[Orinoco]] delta rushing into the [[Gulf of Paria]] implied that a previously unknown continent must lie behind it.<ref>"if the river mentioned does not proceed from the terrestrial paradise, it comes from an immense tract of land situated in the south, of which no knowledge has been hitherto obtained" (Columbus 1499 letter on the third voyage, as reproduced in R.H. Major, ''Select Letters of Christopher Columbus'', 1870: [https://archive.org/details/selectlettersch00changoog/page/n316 p. 147])</ref> However, bowing to the classical tripartite division of the world, Columbus discards that hypothesis and proposes instead that the South American landmass is not a "fourth" continent, but rather the [[terrestrial paradise]] of Biblical tradition, not a previously unknown "new" part of the world, but a land already "known" (but location undiscovered) by [[Christendom]].<ref>J.Z. Smith, ''Relating Religion'', Chicago (2004: pp. 266–67)</ref> In another letter (to the nurse of Prince John, written 1500), Columbus refers to having reached a "new heavens and world" ("nuevo cielo é mundo")<ref>Columbus 1500 letter to the nurse (in Major, 1870: [https://archive.org/details/selectlettersch00changoog/page/n323 p. 154])</ref> and that he had placed "another world" ("otro mundo") under the dominion of the Kings of Spain.<ref>Columbus's 1500 letter to the nurse(Major, 1870: [https://archive.org/details/selectlettersch00changoog/page/n339 p. 170])</ref>

[[File:Front of the Da Vinci Globe.jpg|thumb|''Mundus Novus'' depicted on the [[Da Vinci Globe]] (1504)]]
The Vespucci passage above applied the "New World" label to merely the continental landmass of [[South America]].<ref>F.A. Ober ''Amerigo Vespucci'' New York: Harper (1907: pp. 239, 244)</ref> At the time, most of the continent of [[North America]] was not yet discovered, and Vespucci's comments did not eliminate the possibility that the islands of the [[Antilles]] discovered earlier by [[Christopher Columbus]] might still be the eastern edges of Asia, as Columbus continued to insist until his death in 1506.<ref>S.E.

Amerigo Vespucci attended both conferences, and seems to have had an outsized influence on them—at Burgos, he ended up being appointed the first ''piloto mayor'', the chief of the navigation of Spain.<ref>For an account of Vespucci at Toro and Burgos, see Navarette ''Colección de los viages y descubrimientos que hicieron por mar los españoles desde fines del siglo XV''(1829: v.iii, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ESYW_1DUELoC/page/n341 pp. 320–23])</ref> Although the proceedings of the Toro-Burgos conferences are missing, it is almost certain that Vespucci articulated his recent 'New World' thesis to his fellow navigators there. It was during these conferences when Spanish officials seem to have finally accepted that the Antilles and the known stretch of Central America were not the Indies they had originally sought (while Columbus insisted that they were) and set out the new goal for Spanish explorers: to find a sea passage or [[strait]] through the Americas which would permit them to sail to Asia proper.<ref>C.O.

[[File:Map Diego Ribero 1529.jpg|thumb|The World Map by Portuguese [[Diogo Ribeiro]] (1529) labels the [[Americas]] as ''MUNDUS NOVUS''. It traces most of South America and the east coast of North America.]]
While it became generally accepted after Vespucci that Columbus's discoveries were not Asia but a "New World", the geographic relationship between the two continents was still unclear.<ref name = parry>J.H. Parry, ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974: p. 227)</ref> That there must be a large ocean between Asia and the Americas was implied by the known existence of vast continuous sea along the coasts of [[East Asia]]. Given the size of the Earth as calculated by [[Eratosthenes]] this left a large space between Asia and the newly discovered lands.

Even prior to Vespucci, several maps, e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 and the [[Canerio map]] of 1504, placed a large open ocean between China on the east side of the map, and the inchoate largely water-surrounded North American and South American discoveries on the western side of map. However, out of uncertainty, they depicted a finger of the Asian land mass stretching across the top to the eastern edge of the map, suggesting it carried over into the western hemisphere (e.g. the Cantino Planisphere denotes [[Greenland]] as "Punta d'Asia" – "edge of Asia"). Some maps, e.g. the 1506 [[Contarini–Rosselli map]] and the 1508 [[Johannes Ruysch]] map, bowing to Ptolemaic authority and Columbus's assertions, have the northern Asian landmass stretching well into the western hemisphere and merging with known North America (Labrador, Newfoundland, etc.). These maps place the island of Japan near Cuba and leave the South American continent – Vespucci's "New World" proper – detached and floating below by itself.<ref name = parry/> The [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507, which accompanied the famous ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'' volume (which includes reprints of Vespucci's letters) comes closest to modernity by placing a completely open sea (with no stretching land fingers) between Asia on the eastern side and the New World (being represented two times in the same map in a different way: with and without a sea passage in the middle of what is now named Central America) on the western side – which (on what is now named South America) that same map famously labels simply "''[[Naming of America|America]]''". However, [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s map of 1516 retreats considerably from his earlier map and back to classical authority, with the Asian land mass merging into North America (which he now calls ''Terra de Cuba Asie partis''), and quietly drops the "America" label from South America, calling it merely ''[[Terra incognita]]''.<ref name = parry/>

The western coast of the New World – the [[Pacific Ocean]] – was only discovered in 1513 by [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]. But it would take a few more years until another [[Portugal|Portuguese]] – [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of 1519–22 – determined that the Pacific definitely formed a single large body of water separating Asia from the Americas. It would be several more years before the Pacific Coast of North America was mapped, dispelling lingering doubts. Until the discovery of the [[Bering Strait]]s in the 17th century, there was no absolute confirmation that Asia and North America were not connected, and some European maps of the 16th century still continued to hopefully depict North America connected by a land bridge to Asia (e.g. the 1533 [[Johannes Schöner globe]]).<ref name = parry/>

In 1524, the term was used by [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] in a record of his voyage that year along the Atlantic coast of [[North America]], land that is now part of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].<ref>Verrazzano, Giovanni da (1524).[http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm "The Written Record of the Voyage of 1524 of Giovanni da Verrazzano as recorded in a letter to Francis I, King of France, July 8th, 1524"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908085440/http://bc.barnard.columbia.edu/~lgordis/earlyAC/documents/verrazan.htm |date=8 September 2006 }}.
