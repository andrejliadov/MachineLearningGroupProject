[[Duder Regional Park]] is on the headland immediately to the east.

The land was purchased in 1866 from the original Maori owners [[Ngāi Tai]] by [[Thomas Duder]].  Today the beach is divided between the "[[public beach]]" and a private beach owned above the [[high tide]] mark by his descendants.

Duders Beach has traditionally been a good source of seafood, notably shellfish, but stocks have been depleted in recent times.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10518781">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid=10518781&ref=rss |title=Maori want cockle harvesting suspended so stocks can recover |author=Gregory, Angela |date=28 June 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>
