The '''Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing''' ('''CSTARS''') is a [[ground station]] that receives [[imagery]] data from a variety of [[remote sensing]] [[satellites]].  CSTARS is owned and operated by the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], a college within the [[University of Miami]].

==Overview==
CSTARS is a state-of-the-art real-time satellite reception and analysis facility located in southern [[Miami-Dade county, Florida]]. Its mission is collect [[satellite imagery]] for environmental monitoring of [[hurricanes]], [[volcanoes]], [[landslides]] and other natural or man made [[disasters]].<ref>[http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 "CSTARS yields new perspectives on Earth" Miami Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013213304/http://www6.miami.edu/miami-magazine/spring03/journal.html#ujstory6 |date=October 13, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2000, the University of Miami purchased the [[United States Naval Observatory]] Secondary National Time Standard Facility. The purchase included {{convert|78|acre|m2}} of land with several buildings and a 20-meter [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] once used for [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf |title="Research Notes" eVeritas |access-date=2008-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907025637/http://www6.miami.edu/research/10oct2002.pdf |archive-date=2006-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This large antenna is currently used to support scientific communications with the [[Antarctic]] (on behalf of the [[National Science Foundation]]). Two 11 meter [[X-band]] antennas were added to create a high bandwidth data reception capability for the [[downlink]] of satellite image data. Scientists and staff perform research and analysis activities on-site as well.<ref>[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars About CSTARS ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043628/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/about-cstars |date=2009-07-08 }}</ref>

The station mask covers a very large area stretching from [[Hudson Bay]] in northeastern Canada down to northern [[South America]] in the south.  The mask includes [[Central America]], the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], the [[Caribbean Basin]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and much of the Eastern US including [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]].<ref>[http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects CSTARS Coverage Area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708042258/http://www.cstars.miami.edu/technical-aspects |date=2009-07-08 }}</ref>  CSTARS provides a [[VoIP]] communication system for the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]].<ref name=dhs/>

==Projects==
=== Hurricane Katrina Damage Assessment and Disaster Relief ===
CSTARS played a vital role in the damage assessment and relief efforts of [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ Soundings Sep. 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004074650/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2005/09/ |date=October 4, 2008 }}</ref> The first remote sensing images illustrating the extent of the [[flooding]] in New Orleans were collected at CSTARS.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php |title=SPOT Imagery of New Orleans, Aug. 2005 |access-date=2008-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123121759/http://www.spotimage.fr/web/en/910-new-orleans-usa.php |archive-date=2008-11-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Project with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ===
The United States [[Department of Homeland Security]] has included CSTARS as one of its "Centers of Excellence" so that CSTARS will work with the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] to research [[port]] security and maritime [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] issues.<ref name=dhs>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|title=University of Miami’s CSTARS To Form Part of U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Center of Excellence for Maritime Security|work=Press Release|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723232908/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/pressreleases/20080304-cstars.html|archive-date=July 23, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf CSTARS: PROTECTING OUR PORTS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003309/http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/soundings/2008/09/soundings_09-08.pdf |date=July 25, 2010 }}</ref>

== Admiral James G. Stavridis on CSTARS ==
Admiral [[James Stavridis]], former commanding officer of [[United States Southern Command]], writes about CSTARS in his book [https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083952/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis.html ''Partnership for the Americas'']. In chapter 7 entitled "Innovation", he describes how CSTARS aided SOUTHCOM in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts during his tenure in the SOUTHCOM AOR (i.e., in Latin America and the Caribbean):

{{quotation|Another success story can be found in an academia innovation partnership formed with the University of Miami’s Center for Southeastern Tropical Advanced Remote Sensing (CSTARS). The concept of using CSTARS was to determine how well access to a constellation of unclassified commercial satellites could support traditional Southern Command missions. Initial demonstrations were conducted with promising results. Subsequent letters of endorsements and demand signals for future use of CSTARS were published and promulgated to various centers of excellence and a funding mechanism was established within Southern Command. Within a year of the initial CSTARS demonstrations, hurricanes ravaged Haiti in 2008 and Southern Command responded with assistance, including an impromptu emergency redeployment of USS Kearsarge from its previously scheduled mission. Assessment of inland damage caused by the hurricanes was a critical need to the humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) efforts, and CSTARS provided vital imagery to those operations to quickly determine areas of highest damage and evaluation of inland infrastructure. Unclassified CSTARS imagery and information were then rapidly broadcast and distributed to both DOD and interagency responders via unclassified email. This response was only possible due to the groundwork laid during the initial CSTARS demonstration and a long-term vision for follow-on support made possible by CSTARS to Southern Command.<ref>[http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html ''Partnership for the Americas''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917043652/http://www.ndu.edu/press/stavridis-ch7.html |date=September 17, 2012 }}</ref>}}
