[[File:Primemeridian.jpg|thumb|300px|The division of [[Earth]] by the [[Equator]] and the [[prime meridian]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[cartography]], the '''hemispheres of Earth''' refer to any division of [[Earth|the globe]] into two [[Sphere#Plane sections|hemispheres]] (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡμισφαίριον}} {{lang|grc-Latn|hēmisphairion}}, meaning "half of a sphere").

The most common such divisions are by [[latitude|latitudinal]] or [[longitude|longitudinal]] markers:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hemisphere/ | title=Hemisphere| date=2011-03-22}}</ref>

* North–South
** [[Northern Hemisphere]], the half that lies north of the [[Equator]]
** [[Southern Hemisphere]], the half that lies south of the Equator

* East–West
** [[Eastern Hemisphere]], the half that lies east of the [[prime meridian]] and west of the [[180th meridian]]
** [[Western Hemisphere]], the half that lies west of the prime meridian and east of the 180th meridian

The East–West division can also be seen in a cultural and religious sense, as a division into two [[East–West dichotomy|cultural and religious hemispheres]].

However, other schemes have sought to divide the planet in a way that maximizes the preponderance of one geographic feature or another in each division:

Earth may also be split into hemispheres of [[daytime|day]] and [[night]] by the terrestrial [[terminator (solar)|terminator]].
