== History ==

The Department of Economic And Social Geography of Russia is the oldest department of the [[MSU Faculty of Geography|geographical faculty]] in [[Moscow State University]]. It was founded in 1929 by [[Nikolay Baranskiy]] as a chair of [[economic geography]] on geographical branch of the [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics|mehaniko-mathematical faculty]]. In 1933 it was a part of the soil-geographical faculty as a Chair of Economic Geography of the [[USSR]]. After foundation of the [[MSU Faculty of Geography|geographical faculty]] in [[Moscow State University]] in 1938, the department became a constant division in its structure. Since 1992 it has been called the department of [[economic geography|economic]] and [[Human geography|social geography]] of [[Russia]].

The first head of the department was its founder, [[Nikolay Baranskiy|N. Baranskiy]], professor of the faculty and [[academician|member-correspondent]] in [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. Throughout its 80-year history the department has been headed by professor P. Stepanov (1941–1943; 1946–1949), Julian G. Saushkin (1349–1381), A. T. Khruschev (1981–2000), Vladimir E. Shuvalov (2000-2012) and [[Vyacheslav Baburin|V. Baburin]] (since July 2012).

Scientists of the chair have created a school of thought known as the ''Soviet Regional (Rayon) school of economic geography''. Its theoretical bases have been made by professors [[Nikolay Baranskiy]] and [[Nikolay Kolosovskiy]] and were developed by J. Saushkin's works. Many professors of the department brought the big contributions to the formation and development of the theory and methodology of social and economic geography, especially geography of industry, agriculture, transport, non-productive sphere, geography of the population, geourbanistics, and methods of economic-geographical researches.
