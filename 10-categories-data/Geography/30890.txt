[[File:World Time Zones Map.png|thumb|right|400px|2020 time zone map]]

A '''time zone''' is a designated area of the globe that observes a uniform [[standard time]] for [[legal]], [[Commerce|commercial]] and [[social]] purposes. Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of [[Country|countries]] and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude because it is convenient for areas in close commercial or other communication to keep the same time. [[France]], including its overseas territories, has the most time zones of any country, with a total of 12.

Most of the time zones on land are offset from [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) by a whole number of hours ([[UTC−12:00]] to [[UTC+14:00]]), but a few zones are offset by 30 or 45 minutes (e.g. [[Newfoundland Time Zone|Newfoundland Standard Time]] is [[UTC−03:30]], [[Nepal Time|Nepal Standard Time]] is [[UTC+05:45]], [[Indian Standard Time]] is [[UTC+05:30]] and [[Myanmar Standard Time]] is [[UTC+06:30]]).

Some higher latitude and [[temperate]] zone countries use [[daylight saving time]] for part of the year, typically by adjusting local clock time by an hour. Many land time zones are skewed toward the west of the corresponding [[nautical time zones]]. This also creates  permanent daylight saving time effect.

== History ==

When well-regulated mechanical clocks became widespread in the early 19th century,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783642293078|url-access=subscription|title=The Mechanics of Mechanical Watches and Clocks|first1=Ruxu|last1=Du|last2=Xie|first2=Longhan|language=en|isbn=978-3-642-29307-8|publisher=Springer|year=2013|series=History of Mechanism and Machine Science|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-29308-5}}</ref><!-- is that the right date?--> each city began to use local [[mean solar time]]. Apparent and mean solar time can differ by up to around 15 minutes (as described by the [[equation of time]]) because of the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun ([[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]) and the tilt of the Earth's axis ([[Axial tilt|obliquity]]). Mean solar time has days of equal length, and the accumulated difference between the two sums to zero after a year.

[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was established in 1675, when the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] was built, as an aid to mariners to determine [[longitude]] at sea, providing a standard reference time while each city in England kept a different local time.

=== Railway time ===
{{main|Railway time}}
[[File:Time zone chicago.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating the Railway General Time Convention of 1883 in North America]]
Local solar time became increasingly inconvenient as rail transport and telecommunications improved, because clocks differed between places by amounts corresponding to the differences in their geographical longitudes, which varied by four minutes of time for every degree of longitude. For example, [[Bristol]], England is about 2.5 degrees west of [[Greenwich]] (East [[London]]), so when it is solar noon in Bristol, it is about 10 minutes past solar noon in London.<ref>{{cite web |title=Latitude and Longitude of World Cities |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001769.html |work=InfoPlease.com}}</ref> The use of time zones accumulates these differences into longer units, usually hours, so that nearby places can share a common standard for timekeeping.

The first adoption of a standard time was in November 1840, in Great Britain by [[History of rail transport in Great Britain|railway companies]] using GMT kept by portable [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. The first of these companies to adopt standard time was the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) in November 1840. This quickly became known as [[Railway time|Railway Time]]. About {{nowrap|August 23, 1852}}, time signals were first transmitted by [[telegraph]] from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Even though 98% of Great Britain's public clocks were using GMT by 1855, it was not made Britain's legal time until {{nowrap|August 2, 1880}}. Some British clocks from this period have two minute hands—one for the local time, one for GMT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/bristol-time.htm |title=Bristol Time |work=GreenwichMeanTime.com |access-date=December 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628151049/http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/info/bristol-time.htm |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Improvements in worldwide communication further increased the need for interacting parties to communicate mutually comprehensible time references to one another. The problem of differing local times could be solved across larger areas by synchronizing clocks worldwide, but in many places that adopted time would then differ markedly from the solar time to which people were accustomed.

On November 2, 1868, the then British colony of New Zealand officially adopted a standard time to be observed throughout the colony, and was the first country to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telegraph line laid across Cook Strait.|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/submarine-telegraph-line-laid-across-cook-strait|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> It was based on the longitude {{nowrap|172°30′}} East of [[Greenwich]], that is 11 hours 30 minutes ahead of GMT. This standard was known as [[Time in New Zealand|New Zealand Mean Time]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Time. How we got it. New Zealand's Method.

Timekeeping on the American railroads in the mid-19th century was somewhat confused. Each railroad used its own standard time, usually based on the local time of its headquarters or most important terminus, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some junctions served by several railroads had a clock for each railroad, each showing a different time.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/11/1118railroad-time-zones/ |title=Nov. 18, 1883: Railroad Time Goes Coast to Coast |last=Alfred |first=Randy |date=November 18, 2010 |journal=Wired |language=en-US |access-date=July 30, 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Time zone map of the United States 1913 (colorized).png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|1913 time zone map of the United States, showing boundaries very different from today]]
[[Charles F. Dowd]] proposed a system of one-hour standard time zones for American railroads about 1863, although he published nothing on the matter at that time and did not consult railroad officials until 1869. In 1870 he proposed four ideal time zones (having north–south borders), the first centered on [[Washington, D.C.]], but by 1872 the first was centered on the meridian [[75th meridian west|75° W of Greenwich]], with geographic borders (for example, sections of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]). Dowd's system was never accepted by American railroads. Instead, U.S. and Canadian railroads implemented a version proposed by William F. Allen, the editor of the ''Traveler's Official Railway Guide''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/mawhite/Papers/TimeZones.pdf |title= Economics of Time Zones |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120514014456/http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/mawhite/Papers/TimeZones.pdf |archive-date= May 14, 2012 }} &nbsp;{{small|(1.89&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> The borders of its time zones ran through railroad stations, often in major cities. For example, the border between its Eastern and Central time zones ran through [[Detroit]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. It was inaugurated on Sunday, {{nowrap|November 18, 1883}}, also called "The Day of Two Noons",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5748 |title=The ''Times'' Reports on "the Day of Two Noons" |work=History Matters |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> when each railroad station clock was reset as standard-time noon was reached within each time zone.

The zones were named Intercolonial, Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific. Within a year 85% of all cities with populations over 10,000, about 200 cities, were using standard time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.il.us/departments/archives/from_the_ashes/doc24.html |title=Resolution concerning new standard time by Chicago |publisher=Sos.state.il.us |access-date=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005050317/http://www.sos.state.il.us/departments/archives/from_the_ashes/doc24.html |archive-date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> A notable exception was Detroit (which is about halfway between the meridians of eastern time and central time) which kept local time until 1900, then tried Central Standard Time, [[local mean time]], and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] before a May 1915 ordinance settled on EST and was ratified by popular vote in August 1916. The confusion of times came to an end when Standard zone time was formally adopted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] in the [[Standard Time Act]] of March 19, 1918.

=== Worldwide time zones ===
The first known person to conceive of a worldwide system of time zones was the Italian mathematician [[Quirico Filopanti]]. He introduced the idea in his book ''Miranda!'' published in 1858. He proposed 24 hourly time zones, which he called "longitudinal days", the first centred on the meridian of Rome. He also proposed a universal time to be used in astronomy and telegraphy. But his book attracted no attention until long after his death.<ref>[http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/english/scientists/filopanti-1.html Quirico Filopanti] from scienzagiovane, Bologna University, Italy. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117011106/http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/english/scientists/filopanti-1.html |date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref><ref>Gianluigi Parmeggiani (Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna),

Scottish-born Canadian Sir [[Sandford Fleming]] proposed a worldwide system of time zones in 1879. He advocated his system at several international conferences, and is credited with "the initial effort that led to the adoption of the present time meridians".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/d.html |title=History & info – Standard time began with the railroads|website=www.webexhibits.org|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> In 1876, his first proposal was for a global 24-hour clock, conceptually located at the centre of the Earth and not linked to any surface meridian. In 1879 he specified that his universal day would begin at the anti-meridian of Greenwich ([[180th meridian]]), while conceding that hourly time zones might have some limited local use. He also proposed his system at the [[International Meridian Conference]] in October 1884, but it did not adopt his time zones because they were not within its purview. The conference did adopt a universal day of 24 hours beginning at Greenwich midnight, but specified that it "shall not interfere with the use of local or standard time where desirable".<ref name=imc>{{citation |title=International conference held at Washington for the Purpose of Fixing a Prime Meridian and a Universal Day.

C.}}</ref>

By about 1900, almost all inhabited places on Earth had adopted one or other standard time zone; but only some of these used an hourly offset from GMT. Many applied the time at a local astronomical observatory to an entire country, without any reference to GMT. It took many decades before all time zones were based on some "standard offset" from GMT/UTC. By 1929, the majority of countries had adopted hourly time zones, though a number of countries from [[Iran]] to [[South Australia|Australia]] had time zones with a 30-minute offset. [[Nepal]] was the last country to adopt a standard offset, shifting slightly to UTC+5:45 in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Time Zone & Clock Changes in Kathmandu, Nepal|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/nepal/kathmandu|access-date=2020-12-01|website=www.timeanddate.com|language=en}}</ref>

Today, all nations use standard time zones for secular purposes, but they do not all apply the concept as originally conceived. [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], India, Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], as well as parts of Australia use half-hour deviations from standard time, and some nations, such as Nepal, and some provinces, such as the [[Chatham Islands]] of New Zealand, use quarter-hour deviations. Some countries, such as China and India, use a single time zone even though the extent of their territory far exceeds 15° of longitude, which causes problems as some places in China, like Xinjiang (westernmost province of China), uses local time and when planning to meet with the Chinese living in Beijing, a very eastern city, they will have trouble understanding each other as they are two hours apart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/china-only-has-one-time-zone-and-thats-a-problem/281136/|title=China Only Has One Time Zone—and That's a Problem|last=Schiavenza|first=Matt|date=November 5, 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=August 22, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Time in Russia|Russia is traditionally divided]] into 11 time zones, but in 2010 the number was reduced to nine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/russia-reduces-time-zones.html|title=Russia Reduces Number of Time Zones |date=23 March 2010 |work=TimeAndDate.com}}</ref> Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] said at the time that he would like to see even fewer in place.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Time: Huge country, nine time zones|date=March 22, 2011|access-date=February 12, 2019|format=Video|website=[[BBC]]|language=en|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-12809230/about-time-huge-country-nine-time-zones}}</ref> In 2014, the two removed time zones were reinstated, making the number of time zones 11 again. <ref>{{cite web |title=Russian clocks to retreat again in winter, 11 time zones return |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-russia-time/russian-clocks-to-retreat-again-in-winter-11-time-zones-return-idUSKBN0F64YB20140701 |website=Reuters |access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref>

== Notation of time ==

=== ISO 8601 ===
{{Main|ISO 8601}}
ISO 8601 is an [[International Organization for Standardization|international standard]] that defines methods of representing dates and times in textual form, including specifications for representing time zones.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/map-mondays-wtf-is-wrong-with-canada-s-time|title=In Canada, You Can Just Write the Date Whichever Way You Want|date=June 8, 2015|work=Atlas Obscura|access-date=August 22, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

=== UTC ===
If a time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), a "Z" is added directly after the time without a separating space. "Z" is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. "09:30&nbsp;UTC" is therefore represented as "09:30Z" or "0930Z". Likewise, "14:45:15&nbsp;UTC" is written as "14:45:15Z" or "144515Z".<ref name="ZuluTime">{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/z|title=Z – Zulu Time Zone (Time Zone Abbreviation)|website=TimeAndDate.com|language=en|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref>

UTC time is also known as "Zulu" time, since "Zulu" is a [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] code word for the letter "Z".<ref name="ZuluTime"/>

==== Offsets from UTC ====
[[UTC offset|Offsets from UTC]] are written in the format ±[hh]:[mm], ±[hh][mm], or ±[hh] (either hours ahead or behind UTC). For example, if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC (such as the time in [[Berlin]] during the winter), the zone designator would be "[[UTC+01:00|+01:00]]", "+0100", or simply "+01". This numeric representation of time zones is appended to local times in the same way that alphabetic time zone abbreviations (or "Z", as above) are appended. The offset from UTC changes with [[daylight saving time]], e.g. a time offset in [[Chicago]], which is in the [[Central Time Zone (North America)|North American Central Time Zone]], is "[[UTC−06:00|−06:00]]" for the winter (Central Standard Time) and "[[UTC−05:00|−05:00]]" for the summer (Central Daylight Time).<ref name>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboututc.shtml|title=What is UTC or GMT Time?|website=www.nhc.noaa.gov|access-date=August 22, 2018}}</ref>

=== Abbreviations ===
{{Main|List of time zone abbreviations}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2020}}
Time zones are often represented by alphabetic abbreviations such as "EST", "WST", and "CST", but these are not part of the international time and date standard [[ISO 8601#Time zone designators|ISO 8601]] and their use as sole designator for a time zone is discouraged. Such designations can be ambiguous; for example, "CST" can mean [[China Standard Time]] (UTC+8), [[Cuba Standard Time]] (UTC−5) and (North American) [[Central Standard Time]] (UTC−6). It is also a widely used variant of ACST ([[Australian Central Standard Time]], UTC+9:30).

== List of UTC offsets ==
{{Main|List of UTC time offsets}}
These examples give the local time at various locations around the world when daylight saving time is ''not'' in effect:
<!-- If a country has just one time zone list the country, not its capital.
If a state or province has just one time zone list the state or province, not its largest city.
This is not the place to write every single location that lies in a particular zone. This is just for a few examples. Please, do not fill said table with more locations. -->

Where the adjustment for time zones results in a time at the other side of midnight from UTC, then the date at the location is one day later or earlier.

Some examples when UTC is 23:00 on Monday when or where daylight saving time is not in effect:
* [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]: [[UTC+02]]; 01:00 on Tuesday
* [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]: [[UTC+12]]; 11:00 on Tuesday

Some examples when UTC is 02:00 on Tuesday when or where daylight saving time is not in effect:
* Honolulu, Hawaii, United States: [[UTC−10]]; 16:00 on Monday
* Toronto, Ontario, Canada: UTC−05; 21:00 on Monday

The time-zone adjustment for a specific location may vary because of daylight saving time. For example, New Zealand, which is usually [[UTC+12]], observes a one-hour daylight saving time adjustment during the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer, resulting in a local time of [[UTC+13]].

Conversion between time zones obeys the relationship
:"time in zone A" − "UTC offset for zone A" = "time in zone B" − "UTC offset for zone B",
in which each side of the equation is equivalent to UTC. (The more familiar term "UTC offset" is used here rather than the term "zone designator" used by the standard.)

The conversion equation can be rearranged to
:"time in zone B" = "time in zone A" − "UTC offset for zone A" + "UTC offset for zone B".

For example, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opens at 09:30 ([[Eastern time zone|EST]], UTC offset=−05:00). In Los Angeles ([[Pacific time zone|PST]], UTC offset= −08:00) and Delhi ([[Indian standard time|IST]], UTC offset= +05:30), the New York Stock Exchange opens at
:time in Los Angeles = 09:30 − (−05:00) + (−08:00) = 06:30.
:time in Delhi = 09:30 − (−05:00) + (+05:30) = 20:00.

These calculations become more complicated near a daylight saving boundary (because the UTC offset for zone X is a function of the UTC time).

The table "Time of day by zone" gives an overview on the time relations between different zones.

== Nautical type ==
{{Main|Nautical time}}
Since the 1920s a [[nautical time|nautical standard time]] system has been in operation for ships on the [[international waters|high seas]]. Nautical time zones are an ideal form of the terrestrial time zone system. Under the system, a time change of one hour is required for each change of longitude by 15°. The 15° [[gore (segment)|gore]] that is offset from GMT or UT1 (not [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours. A nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the 180th meridian except where it is interrupted by [[territorial waters]] adjacent to land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line.<ref>Bowditch, Nathaniel. ''American Practical Navigator''. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1925, 1939, 1975.</ref><ref>Hill, John C., Thomas F. Utegaard, Gerard Riordan. ''Dutton's Navigation and Piloting''. Annapolis: United States Naval Institute, 1958.</ref><ref>Howse, Derek. ''Greenwich Time and the Discovery of the Longitude''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-215948-8}}.</ref>

A ship within the territorial waters of any nation would use that nation's standard time, but would revert to nautical standard time upon leaving its territorial waters. The captain is permitted to change the ship's clocks at a time of the captain's choice following the ship's entry into another time zone. The captain often chooses midnight. Ships going in shuttle traffic over a time zone border often keep the same time zone all the time, to avoid confusion about work, meal, and shop opening hours. Still the time table for port calls must follow the land time zone.

Ideal time zones, such as nautical time zones, are based on the mean solar time of a particular meridian located in the middle of that zone with boundaries located 7.5 degrees east and west of the meridian. In practice, zone boundaries are often drawn much farther to the west with often irregular boundaries, and some locations base their time on meridians located far to the east.

For example, even though the Prime Meridian (0°) passes through [[Spain]] and [[France]], they use the mean solar time of 15 degrees east ([[Central European Time]]) rather than 0 degrees (Greenwich Mean Time). France previously used GMT, but was switched to CET (Central European Time) during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]] of the country during World War II and did not switch back after the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poulle|first=Yvonne|title=La France à l'heure allemande|journal=Bibliothèque de l'École des Chartes|year=1999|volume=157|issue=2|pages=493–502|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989/article_bec_0373-6237_1999_num_157_2_450989.pdf|access-date=January 11, 2012|doi=10.3406/bec.1999.450989}}</ref> Similarly, prior to World War II, the Netherlands observed "Amsterdam Time", which was twenty minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. They were obliged to follow German time during the war, and kept it thereafter. In the mid 1970s the Netherlands, as with other European states, began observing daylight saving (summer) time.

In the Northern hemisphere, there is a tendency to draw time zone boundaries far to the west of their meridians. A reason is that it can allow the more efficient use of sunlight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pep.com.cn/200503/ca692073.htm|title=法定时与北京时间|publisher=人民教育出版社|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114120456/http://www.pep.com.cn/200503/ca692073.htm|archive-date=November 14, 2006}}</ref> {{citation needed span|date=June 2016|text=|reason=The entire section sounds very speculative – many other historical reasons may be possible, please provide evidence for this explanation.}} Another reason for this is that similar working day schedules around the world have led to people rising on average at 07:00 clock time and going to bed at 23:00 clock time. This means that the middle of the period that people are awake ("''awake time noon''") occurs at 15:00 (= [7 + 23]/2) clock time, whereas – if using as clock time the time of the nautical time zone to which the location concerned geographically belongs – solar noon occurs at 12:00 (+/- 30 min) clock time. To make solar noon coincide more with ''awake time noon'' (i.e. make the sun reach its highest point closer to 15:00 clock time rather than 12:00 clock time), the time of one or even two nautical time zones to the east is chosen. Many of these locations also use [[Daylight saving time|DST]], adding yet another nautical time zone to the east. As a result,{{refn|group=note|Spain may have chosen its time zone for other reasons, such as synchronising with trading partners, and adopting CET as a major member of the EU}} in summer, solar noon in the Spanish town of [[Muxía]] occurs at 14:37 clock time, indeed very close to ''awake time noon'' (15:00). This westernmost area of continental Spain never experiences sunset before 18:00 clock time, even in midwinter, despite its lying more than 40 degrees [[Latitude|north]] of the equator. Near the summer [[solstice]], Muxía has sunset times (after 22:00) similar to those of [[Stockholm]], which is in the same time zone and 16 degrees farther north. Stockholm has much earlier sunrises, though.

A more extreme example is [[Nome, Alaska]], which is at 165°24′W longitude—just west of center of the idealized [[Samoa Time Zone]] ([[165th meridian west|165°W]]). Nevertheless, Nome observes [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska Time]] ([[135th meridian west|135°W]]) with DST so it is slightly more than two hours ahead of the sun in winter and over three in summer.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Hara|first=Doug|title=Alaska: daylight stealing time|work=Far North Science|url=http://www.farnorthscience.com/2007/03/11/news-from-alaska/alaska-daylight-stealing-time/|date=March 11, 2007|access-date=May 11, 2007}}</ref>
[[Kotzebue, Alaska]], also near the same meridian but north of the Arctic Circle, has an annual event on August 9 to celebrate ''two'' sunsets in the same 24-hour day, one shortly after midnight at the start of the day, and the other shortly before midnight at the end of the day.

{{Citation needed span|text=Also, [[China]] [[List of extreme points of China|extends as far west as 73°E]], but all parts of it use [[UTC+08:00]] ([[120th meridian east|120°E]]), so solar "noon" can occur as late as 15:00 in western portions of China such as [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]].|date=December 2020}} The [[Afghanistan-China border]] marks the greatest terrestrial time zone difference on Earth, with a 3.5 hour difference between Afghanistan's UTC+4:30 and China's [[Time in China|UTC+08:00]].

== Daylight saving time ==
{{Main|Daylight saving time}}

Many countries, and sometimes just certain regions of countries, adopt daylight saving time (also known as "Summer Time") during part of the year. This typically involves advancing [[clock]]s by an [[hour]] near the start of [[spring (season)|spring]] and adjusting back in [[autumn]] ("spring forward", "fall back"). Modern DST was first proposed in 1907 and was in widespread use in 1916 as a [[World War I|wartime]] measure aimed at [[Energy conservation|conserving coal]]. Despite [[Daylight saving time#Dispute over benefits and drawbacks|controversy]], many countries have used it off and on since then; [[Daylight saving time by country|details vary by location]] and change occasionally. Most countries around the equator do not observe daylight saving time, since the seasonal difference in sunlight is minimal.

== Computer systems and the Internet ==
Many computer [[operating system]]s include the necessary support for working with all (or almost all) possible local times based on the various time zones. Internally, operating systems typically use [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] as their basic [[system time|time-keeping standard]], while providing services for converting local times to and from UTC, and also the ability to automatically change local time conversions at the start and end of daylight saving time in the various time zones. (See the article on [[Daylight saving time#Computing|daylight saving time]] for more details on this aspect).

Web servers presenting web pages primarily for an audience in a single time zone or a limited range of time zones typically show times as a local time, perhaps with UTC time in brackets. More internationally oriented websites may show times in UTC only or using an arbitrary time zone. For example, the international English-language version of CNN includes GMT and Hong Kong Time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com |title=International CNN |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> whereas the US version shows [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com |title=United States CNN |publisher=Cnn.com |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> US Eastern Time and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] are also used fairly commonly on many US-based English-language websites with global readership. The format is typically based in the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] Note "datetime".

[[Email]] systems and other messaging systems ([[Internet Relay Chat|IRC chat]], etc.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BuildingCommunity/BookingUbuntuMeetingChannel|title=Guidelines for Ubuntu IRC Meetings|date=August 6, 2008<!-- 15:53:34-->|publisher=[[Canonical Ltd.]]}}</ref> time-stamp messages using UTC, or else include the sender's time zone as part of the message, allowing the receiving program to display the message's date and time of sending in the recipient's local time.

[[Database]] records that include a time stamp typically use UTC, especially when the database is part of a system that spans multiple time zones. The use of local time for time-stamping records is not recommended for time zones that implement daylight saving time because once a year there is a one-hour period when local times are ambiguous.

[[Calendaring software|Calendar systems]] nowadays usually tie their time stamps to UTC, and show them differently on computers that are in different time zones. That works when having telephone or internet meetings. It works less well when travelling, because the calendar events are assumed to take place in the time zone the computer or smartphone was on when creating the event. The event can be shown at the wrong time. For example, if a New Yorker plans to meet someone in Los Angeles at 9 AM, and makes a calendar entry at 9 AM (which the computer assumes is New York time), the calendar entry will be at 6 AM if taking the computer's time zone. There is also an option in newer versions of [[Microsoft Outlook]] to enter the time zone in which an event will happen, but often not in other calendar systems. Calendaring software must also deal with [[daylight saving time]] (DST). If, for political reasons, the begin and end dates of daylight saving time are changed, calendar entries should stay the same in local time, even though they may shift in UTC time. In Microsoft Outlook, time stamps are therefore stored and communicated without DST offsets.<ref>[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2642044 How time zone normalization works in Microsoft Outlook]. Microsoft (2015).</ref> Hence, an appointment in London at noon in the summer will be represented as 12:00 (UTC+00:00) even though the event will actually take place at 13:00 UTC. In [[Google Calendar]], calendar events are stored in UTC (although shown in local time) and might be changed by a time-zone changes,<ref>[https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37064?hl=en&rd=1 Use Google Calendar in different time zones]. Google Calendar Help (as of Oct. 2015)</ref> although normal daylight saving start and end are compensated for (similar to much other calendar software).

=== Operating systems ===
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2015}}

==== Unix ====
{{Main|Unix time}}
Most [[Unix-like]] systems, including [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]], keep system time in time_t format, representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) on Thursday, January 1, 1970.<ref name="single-unix-spec-4.16">{{cite web|url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16|title=The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, section 4.16 Seconds Since the Epoch|publisher=[[The Open Group]]|access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref> By default the external representation is as UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), though individual processes can specify time zones using the ''TZ'' [[environment variable]].<ref name="tzset(3)">{{cite web|url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tzset&manpath=FreeBSD+12.1-RELEASE|title=tzset(3) man page from FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE|language=en|website=freebsd.org|publisher=The FreeBSD project}}</ref> This allows users in multiple time zones to use the same computer, with their respective local times displayed correctly to each user. Time zone information most commonly comes from the [[IANA time zone database]]. In fact, many systems, including anything using the [[GNU C Library]], can make use of this database.

==== Microsoft Windows ====
[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based computer systems prior to [[Windows 2000]] used local time, but Windows 2000 and later can use UTC as the basic system time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724390(v=vs.85).aspx|title=GetSystemTime function (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref> The [[Windows Registry|system registry]] contains time zone information that includes the offset from UTC and rules that indicate the start and end dates for daylight saving in each zone. Interaction with the user normally uses local time, and application software is able to calculate the time in various zones. [[Remote Desktop Services|Terminal Servers]] allow remote computers to redirect their time zone settings to the Terminal Server so that users see the correct time for their time zone in their desktop/application sessions. Terminal Services uses the server base time on the Terminal Server and the client time zone information to calculate the time in the session.

=== Programming languages ===

==== Java ====
While most application software will use the underlying operating system for time zone information, [[Java (programming language)|the Java Platform]], from version 1.3.1, has maintained its own time zone database. This database is updated whenever time zone rules change. [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] provides an updater tool for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tzupdater-readme-136440.html |title=Timezone Updater Tool |publisher=Java.sun.com |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref>

As an alternative to the time zone information bundled with the Java Platform, programmers may choose to use the Joda-Time library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/ |title=Joda-Time |publisher=Joda-time.sourceforge.net |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> This library includes its own time zone data based on the IANA time zone database.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm |title=tz database |publisher=Twinsun.com |date=December 26, 2007 |access-date=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623013511/http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm |archive-date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref>

As of Java 8 there is a new date and time API that can help with converting time zones.
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/ Java 8 Date Time]

==== JavaScript ====
Traditionally, there was very little in the way of time zone support for [[JavaScript]]. Essentially the programmer had to extract the UTC offset by instantiating a time object, getting a GMT time from it, and differencing the two. This does not provide a solution for more complex daylight saving variations, such as divergent DST directions between northern and southern hemispheres.

ECMA-402, the standard on Internationalization API for JavaScript, provides ways of formatting Time Zones.<ref>{{Cite web

==== Perl ====
The DateTime object in [[Perl]] supports all time zones in the [[Tz database|Olson DB]] and includes the ability to get, set and convert between time zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime |title=DateTime |publisher=METACPAN |access-date=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

==== PHP ====
The DateTime objects and related functions have been compiled into the [[PHP]] core since 5.2. This includes the ability to get and set the default script time zone, and DateTime is aware of its own time zone internally. PHP.net provides extensive documentation on this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.datetime.php |title=DateTime |publisher=Php.net |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> As noted there, the most current time zone database can be implemented via the [[PEAR#PECL|PECL]] timezonedb.

==== Python ====
The standard module datetime included with [[Python (programming language)|Python]] stores and operates on the time zone information class tzinfo. The third party pytz module provides access to the full IANA time zone database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pytz.sourceforge.net/ |title=pytz module |publisher=Pytz.sourceforge.net |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> Negated time zone offset in seconds is stored time.timezone and time.altzone attributes.

==== Smalltalk ====
Each [[Smalltalk]] dialect comes with its own built-in classes for dates, times and timestamps, only a few of which implement the DateAndTime and Duration classes as specified by the ANSI Smalltalk Standard. [[VisualWorks]] provides a TimeZone class that supports up to two annually recurring offset transitions, which are assumed to apply to all years (same behavior as Windows time zones). [[Squeak]] provides a Timezone class that does not support any offset transitions. [[Dolphin Smalltalk]] does not support time zones at all.

For full support of the tz database (zoneinfo) in a Smalltalk application (including support for any number of annually recurring offset transitions, and support for different intra-year offset transition rules in different years) the third-party, open-source, ANSI-Smalltalk-compliant Chronos Date/Time Library is available for use with any of the following Smalltalk dialects: VisualWorks, Squeak, Gemstone, or Dolphin.<ref>[http://www.chronos-st.org/ Chronos Date/Time Library] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405043602/http://www.chronos-st.org/ |date=April 5, 2014 }}</ref>

== Time zones in outer space ==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2015}}
Orbiting spacecraft typically experience many sunrises and sunsets in a 24-hour period, or in the case of [[Apollo program]] astronauts travelling to the moon, none. Thus it is not possible to calibrate time zones with respect to the sun, and still respect a 24-hour sleep/wake cycle. A common practice for [[space exploration]] is to use the Earth-based time zone of the launch site or mission control. This keeps the sleeping cycles of the crew and controllers in sync. The [[International Space Station]] normally uses Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask the Crew: STS-111|url=http://www.spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/crew/sts-111/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Day in the Life|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp7/luletters/lu_letter9.html|last=Lu|first=Ed}}</ref>

[[Timekeeping on Mars]] can be more complex, since the planet has a solar day of approximately 24 hours and 39 minutes, known as a [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sol]]. Earth controllers for some Mars missions have synchronized their sleep/wake cycles with the Martian day,<ref>Megan Gannon, 2008, [http://www.space.com/17815-mars-rover-jet-lag.html New Tricks Could Help Mars Rover Team Live on Mars Time], ''space.com''</ref> because solar-powered rover activity on the surface was tied to periods of light and dark. The difference in day length caused the sleep/wake cycles to slowly drift with respect to the day/night cycles on Earth, repeating approximately once every 36 days.
