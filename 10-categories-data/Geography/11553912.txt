'''Deep-sea exploration''' is the investigation of physical, [[chemical]], and [[biological]] conditions on the [[sea bed]], for [[scientific]] or [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes. [[Deep sea|Deep-sea]] [[exploration]] is considered a relatively recent human activity compared to the other areas of [[geophysical]] research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent years. The ocean depths still remain a largely unexplored part of the [[Earth|planet]], and form a relatively undiscovered domain.

In general, modern scientific deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when [[France|French]] scientist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] investigated the average depth of the [[Atlantic ocean]] by observing tidal motions registered on [[Brazil]]ian and [[Africa]]n coasts. He calculated the depth to be {{convert|3,962|m|ft|0}}, a value later proven quite accurate by [[Echo sounding|echo-sounding]] measurement techniques.<ref name="enotes2003">Deep Sea Exploration." World of Earth Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. Gale Cengage, 2003. eNotes.com. 2006. 7 Dec, 2009 <http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/deep-sea-exploration></ref> Later on, due to increasing demand for the installment of [[submarine cable]]s, accurate measurements of the sea floor depth were required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were undertaken. The first deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when [[Michael Sars|Norwegian]] [[Georg Ossian Sars|researchers]] obtained a sample of a stalked [[crinoid]] at a depth of {{convert|3,109|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Life of the Bottom of the Ocean|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150129-life-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=22 June 2020|website=BBC Earth}}</ref> 

From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS ''Challenger'', a sailing vessel that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] covered {{convert|127,653|km|nmi}}, and shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples and hydrographic measurements, discovering more than 4,700 new [[species]] of [[marine life]], including deep-sea organisms.<ref name="enotes2003" /><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|title=A Brief History|url=http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005020142/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/deepsea/level-2/tools/history.html|archivedate=2010-10-05|accessdate=2010-09-17|publisher=Ceoe.udel.edu}}</ref> They are also credited with providing the first real view of major seafloor features such as the deep [[Oceanic basin|ocean basins.]]

In the 20th century, deep-sea exploration advanced considerably through a series of technological inventions, ranging from the [[sonar]] system, which can detect the presence of objects underwater through the use of sound, to manned [[Deep-submergence vehicle|deep-diving submersibles]]. In 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[United States Navy]] Lieutenant [[Don Walsh|Donald Walsh]] descended in the [[bathyscaphe]] {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}} into the deepest part of the world's oceans, the [[Mariana Trench]].<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-piccard-oceanographer-and-pioneer-of-deepsea-exploration-992032.html |title=Jacques Piccard: Oceanographer and pioneer of deep-sea exploration - Obituaries, News |publisher=The Independent |date= 2008-11-05|accessdate=2010-09-17 | location=London}}</ref>  On 25 March 2012, filmmaker [[James Cameron]] descended into the Mariana Trench in {{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}, and, for the first time, is expected to have filmed and sampled the bottom.<ref name="NGS-20120325">{{cite web |last=Than |first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-20120325">{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html |date=25 March 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="MSNBC-20120325">{{cite web |author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46850002 |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-03/08/2012">{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Miles Under the Pacific, a Director Will Take On His Most Risky Project |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/science/earth/james-cameron-prepares-to-dive-into-mariana-trench.html |date=8 March 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=8 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="NGS-Deepseachallenge">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=DEEPSEA CHALLENGE – National Geographic Explorer James Cameron's Expedition |url=http://deepseachallenge.com/ |date=7 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=8 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625050833/http://deepseachallenge.com/ |archivedate=25 June 2014 }}</ref>

Despite these advances in deep-sea exploration, the voyage to the ocean bottom is still a challenging experience. Scientists are working to find ways to study this extreme environment from the shipboard. With more sophisticated use of [[fiber optics]], [[satellite]]s, and remote-control robots, scientists hope to, one day, explore the deep sea from a computer screen on the deck rather than out of a porthole.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

== Milestones of deep sea exploration ==
The extreme conditions in the deep sea require elaborate methods and technologies to endure, which has been the main reason why its exploration has had a comparatively short history.
Some important milestones of deep sea exploration are listed below:

*1521: [[Ferdinand Magellan]] tried to measure the depth of the Pacific Ocean with a weighted line, but did not find the bottom.
*1818: The British researcher [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|Sir John Ross]] was the first to find that the deep sea is inhabited by life when catching [[jellyfish]] and [[worm]]s in about {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} depth with a special device. 
*1843: Nevertheless, [[Edward Forbes]] claimed that diversity of life in the deep sea is little and decreases with increasing depth. He stated that there could be no life in waters deeper than {{convert|550|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, the so-called [[Abyssus theory]].
*1850: Near the [[Lofoten]], [[Michael Sars]] found a rich variety of deep sea fauna in a depth of {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, thereby refuting the Abyssus Theory.<ref>Ludwig Darmstaedter (Hrsg.): ''[http://www.digitalis.uni-koeln.de/Darmstaedter/darmstaedter_index.html Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik]'', Springer, Berlin 1908, S. 521</ref>
*1872–1876: The first systematic deep sea exploration was conducted by the [[Challenger Expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]] on board the ship {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} led by [[Charles Wyville Thomson]]. This expedition revealed that the deep sea harbours a diverse, specialized biota.
*1890–1898: First Austrian-Hungarian deep sea expedition on board the ship {{SMS|Pola}} led by [[Franz Steindachner]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]].
*1898–1899: First German deep sea expedition on board the ship ''Valdivia'' led by [[Carl Chun]]; found many new species from depths greater than {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
*1930: [[William Beebe]] and [[Otis Barton]] were the first humans to reach the Deep Sea when diving in the so-called [[Bathysphere]], made from steel. They reached a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, where they observed jellyfish and [[shrimp]].
*1934: The Bathysphere reached a depth of {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1948: Otis Barton set out for a new record, reaching a depth of {{convert|1370|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.
*1960: [[Jacques Piccard]] and [[Don Walsh]] reached the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], descending to a depth of {{convert|10,740|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in their deep sea vessel {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, where they observed fish and other deep sea organisms.
*2012: The vessel {{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}, piloted by [[James Cameron]], completed the second manned voyage and first solo mission to the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]].
*2018: {{ship||DSV Limiting Factor}}, piloted by [[Victor Vescovo]], completed the first mission to the deepest point of the Atlantic Ocean, diving {{Convert|8,375|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the ocean surface to the base of the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/22/wall-street-trader-reaches-bottom-of-atlantic-in-bid-to-conquer-five-oceans|title=Wall Street trader reaches bottom of Atlantic in bid to conquer five oceans|last=Neate|first=Rupert|date=2018-12-22|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-06-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==Oceanographic instrumentation<ref name="history1"/>==
[[File:PSM V76 D201 Deep sea exploration apparatus.png|thumbnail|Deep sea exploration apparatus,1910]]
The sounding weight, one of the first instruments used for the sea bottom investigation, was designed as a tube on the base which forced the seabed in when it hit the bottom of the ocean. British explorer Sir [[James Clark Ross]] fully employed this instrument to reach a depth of {{convert|3,700|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1840.<ref name="history1"/><ref name="autogenerated2005">Deep-Sea Exploration: Earth's Final Frontier Only a Portion of the Potential of the Oceans Has Been Tapped, but It Is Clear That Exploring and Improving Our Understanding of the Ocean and Its Influence on Global Events Are among Our Most Important Challenges Today Journal article by Stephen L. Baird; The Technology Teacher, Vol. 65, 2005.</ref>

Sounding weights used on {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} were the slightly more advanced "Baillie sounding machine". The British researchers used wire-line soundings to investigate sea depths and collected hundreds of biological samples from all oceans except the [[Arctic]]. Also used on HMS ''Challenger'' were dredges and scoops, suspended on ropes, with which samples of the sediment and biological specimens of the seabed could be obtained.<ref name="history1"/>

A more advanced version of the sounding weight is the gravity corer. The gravity corer allows researchers to sample and study sediment layers at the bottom of oceans. The corer consists of an open-ended tube with a lead weight and a trigger mechanism that releases the corer from its suspension cable when the corer is lowered over the seabed and a small weight touches the ground. The corer falls into the seabed and penetrates it to a depth of up to {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. By lifting the corer, a long, cylindrical sample is extracted in which the structure of the seabed’s layers of sediment is preserved. Recovering sediment cores allows scientists to see the presence or absence of specific fossils in the mud that may indicate climate patterns at times in the past, such as during the ice ages. Samples of deeper layers can be obtained with a corer mounted in a drill. The drilling vessel [[JOIDES Resolution]] is equipped to extract cores from depths of as much as {{convert|1,500|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} below the ocean bottom. (See [[Ocean Drilling Program]])<ref name="ecnext1">{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/5246/article-1G1-140513262/deepsea-exploration-earth-final-frontier-only-portion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108152709/http://business.highbeam.com/5246/article-1G1-140513262/deepsea-exploration-earth-final-frontier-only-portion |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-01-08 |title=Deep-sea exploration: Earth's final frontier: only a portion of the potential of the oceans has been tapped, but it is clear that exploring and improving our understanding of the ocean and its influence on global events are among our most important challenges today. &#124; Goliath Business News |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=1079 |title=WHOI : Instruments : Gravity Corer |publisher=Whoi.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref>

[[Echo sounding|Echo-sounding]] instruments have also been widely used to determine the depth of the sea bottom since [[World War II]]. This instrument is used primarily for determining the depth of water by means of an acoustic echo. A pulse of sound sent from the ship is reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship, the interval of time between transmission and reception being proportional to the depth of the water. By registering the time lapses between outgoing and returning signals continuously on paper tape, a continuous [[seafloor mapping|mapping of the seabed]] is obtained. The majority of the ocean floor has been mapped in this way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/echo-sounder |title=echo sounder: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref>

In addition, high-resolution television cameras, [[thermometer]]s, pressure meters, and [[seismograph]]s are other notable instruments for deep-sea exploration invented by the technological advance. These instruments are either lowered to the sea bottom by long cables or directly attached to submersible [[buoy]]s. Deep-sea currents can be studied by floats carrying an ultrasonic sound device so that their movements can be tracked from aboard the research vessel. Such vessels themselves are equipped with state -of-art navigational instruments, such as [[satellite]] navigation systems, and [[global positioning system]]s that keep the vessel in a live position relative to a sonar beacon on the bottom of the ocean.<ref name="history1"/>

==Oceanographic submersibles==
Because of the high pressure, the depth to which a diver can descend without special equipment is limited. The deepest recorded descent made by a skin diver is {{convert|127|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  Revolutionary new diving suits, such as the "[[JIM suit]]," allow divers to reach depths up to approximately {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=Office of Communications and Marketing |url=http://www.expeditions.udel.edu/extreme08/tools/discovery.php |title=Depths of Discovery |publisher=Expeditions.udel.edu |date=2004-10-30 |accessdate=2010-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108075748/http://www.expeditions.udel.edu/extreme08/tools/discovery.php |archive-date=2010-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some additional suits feature [[Marine propulsion|thruster]] packs that can boost a diver to different locations underwater.<ref>[http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093811/http://www.deepseasystems.com/thl404-8d.htm |date=April 17, 2009 }}</ref>

To explore even deeper depths, deep-sea explorers must rely on specially constructed steel chambers to protect them. The American explorer [[William Beebe]], also a naturalist from [[Columbia University]] in New York, working with fellow engineer [[Otis Barton]] of [[Harvard University]], designed the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths that could not be reached by a diver.<ref name="jrank1">{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7100/Underwater-Exploration.html |title=Underwater Exploration - History, Oceanography, Instrumentation, Diving Tools And Techniques, Deep-sea Submersible Vessels, Key Findings In Underwater Exploration - Deep-sea pioneers |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1960-01-23 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/769/Bathysphere.html |title=Bathysphere - Air, Sea, Exploration, Diving, Bell, and Scientists |publisher=Science.jrank.org |date=1930-06-06 |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of {{convert|435|m|ft|abbr=on|0}},  and {{convert|923|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface.<ref name="autogenerated2005"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.productivitydevelopment.com/26%20Deep%20Sea%20Explore.pdf|title=Deep Sea Explore|publisher=Productivitydevelopment.com|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref>

In 1948, Swiss physicist [[Auguste Piccard]] tested a much deeper-diving vessel he invented called the [[bathyscaphe]], a navigable deep-sea vessel with its gasoline-filled float and suspended chamber or gondola of spherical steel.<ref name="jrank1"/> On an experimental dive in the [[Cape Verde Islands]], his bathyscaphe successfully withstood the pressure on it at {{convert|1,402|m|abbr=on|0}}, but its body was severely damaged by heavy waves after the dive. In 1954, with this bathyscaphe, Piccard reached a depth of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="jrank1"/> In 1953, his son [[Jacques Piccard]] joined in building a new and improved bathyscaphe {{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}, which dived to {{convert|3,139|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}  in field trials.<ref name="jrank1"/> The [[United States Navy]] acquired ''Trieste'' in 1958 and equipped it with a new cabin to enable it to reach deep ocean trenches.<ref name="independent1"/> In 1960, Jacques Piccard and United States Navy Lieutenant Donald Walsh descended in ''Trieste'' to the deepest known point on Earth - the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]], successfully making the deepest dive in history: {{convert|10,915|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="independent1"/>
 
An increasing number of occupied submersibles are now employed around the world. For example, the American-built {{ship|DSV|Alvin}}, operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], is a three-person submarine that can dive to about {{convert|3,600|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} and is equipped with a mechanical manipulator to collect bottom samples. Operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], ''Alvin'' is designed to carry a crew of three people to depths of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The submarine is equipped with lights, cameras, computers, and highly maneuverable robotic arms for collecting samples in the darkness of the ocean's depths.<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Human Occupied Vehicle Alvin : Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8422|accessdate=2010-09-17|publisher=Whoi.edu}}</ref><ref name="sciencebase1">{{cite web|author=TechTalk |url=http://www.sciencebase.com/deep_sea_exploration.html |title=Deep sea exploration and marine science aboard Alvin et al - 11/04 |publisher=Sciencebase.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> ''Alvin'' made its first test dive in 1964, and has performed more than 3,000 dives to average depths of {{convert|1,829|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. ''Alvin'' has also been involved in a wide variety of research projects, such as one where [[giant tube worm]]s were discovered on the [[Pacific Ocean]] floor near the [[Galápagos Islands]].<ref name="sciencebase1"/>

===Unmanned submersibles===
[[File:Autonomous landers, Observing the deepest places on Earth.WebM|thumb|left|240px|Describing the operation and use of autonomous landers in deep sea research.]]
One of the first unmanned deep sea vehicles was developed by the University of California with a grant from the Allan Hancock Foundation in the early 1950s to develop a more economical method of taking photos miles under the sea with an unmanned steel high-pressure {{convert|3,000|lb|abbr=on|0}} sphere called a '''benthograph,''' which contained a camera and strobe light.  The original benthograph built by USC was very successful in taking a series of underwater photos until it became wedged between some rocks and could not be retrieved.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zdwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=true#v=onepage&q=true&f=true "Deep Sea Photographers."] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1953, p. 105.</ref>

[[Remote operated vehicle]]s (ROVs) are also seeing increasing use in underwater exploration. These submersibles are piloted through a cable which connects to the surface ship, and can reach depths of up to {{convert|6,000|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. New developments in robotics have also led to the creation of AUVs, or [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s. The robotic submarines are programmed in advance, and receive no instruction from the surface. A Hybrid ROV (HROV) combines features of both ROVs and AUV, operating independently or with a cable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-science/deep-ocean-exploration/tools-and-technology/|title=The Deep Sea|author=The Ocean Portal Team|date=24 July 2012|work=Smithsonian Ocean Portal|access-date=1 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330001447/http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-science/deep-ocean-exploration/tools-and-technology/|archive-date=30 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="enchantedlearning1">{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/explorers/page/b/ballard.shtml |title=Robert Ballard: Undersea Explorers |publisher=EnchantedLearning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-17}}</ref> {{ship||Argo|ROV|2}} was employed in 1985 to locate the wreck of the {{RMS|Titanic}}; the smaller {{ship||Jason|ROV|2}} was also used to explore the shipwreck.<ref name="enchantedlearning1"/>

==Scientific results==
In 1974, ''Alvin'' (operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] and the Deep Sea Place Research Center), the French bathyscaphe ''[[Archimède]]'', and the French diving saucer ''CYANA'', assisted by support ships and {{ship||Glomar Challenger}}, explored the great rift valley of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], southwest of the [[Azores]]. About 5,200 photographs of the region were taken, and samples of relatively young solidified [[magma]] were found on each side of the central fissure of the rift valley, giving additional proof that the seafloor spreads at this site at a rate of about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1}} per year (see [[plate tectonics]],).<ref name="history2">[http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208003634/http://www.history.com/content/deepseadetectives/history-of-deep-sea-exploration |date=February 8, 2010 }}</ref>

In a series of dives conducted between 1979–1980 into the [[Galápagos]] [[rift]], off the coast of [[Ecuador]], French, Italian, Mexican, and U.S. scientists found vents, nearly {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} high and about {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} across, discharging a mixture of hot water (up to {{convert|300|C|F|disp=comma}}) and dissolved metals in dark, smoke-like plumes (see [[hydrothermal vent]],). These hot springs play an important role in the formation of deposits that are enriched in [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], and [[uranium]].<ref name="history2"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridasmart.com/subjects/ocean/deepsea.htm |title=Deep Sea Exploration: Submarine Volcanoes and Hydrothermal Vents |publisher=Floridasmart.com |accessdate=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215223336/http://www.floridasmart.com/subjects/ocean/deepsea.htm |archivedate=2011-02-15 }}</ref>
