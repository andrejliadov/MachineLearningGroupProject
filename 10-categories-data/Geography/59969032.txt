==History==
The River Styles Framework was developed by Gary Brierley and Kirstie Fryirs at [[Macquarie University]]. The first [[peer review]]ed paper on River Styles was published in 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brierley |first1=Gary J. |last2=Fryirs |first2=Kirstie |title=River Styles, a Geomorphic Approach to Catchment Characterization: Implications for River Rehabilitation in Bega Catchment, New South Wales, Australia |journal=Environmental Management |date=31 May 2000 |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=661–679 |doi=10.1007/s002670010052|pmid=10790530 |s2cid=12932311 }}</ref> Initial research that helped to develop the River Styles Framework was funded by [[Land & Water Australia]] and New South Wales Department of Land and Water Conservation.<ref name=":0" />

== Stages of the River Styles Framework ==
The River Styles Framework has four stages of analysis, which provide a framework to '''describe''' river character, '''explain''' how the river behaves and '''predict''' how a river may adjust its form in the future. The following overview of the stages is sourced from the book,''"Geomorphology and River Management: Application of the River Styles Framework"''.<ref name=":0" />

=== Stage 1 ===
Stage 1 provides a baseline survey of a [[river]]'s character and behaviour. Steps in Stage 1 include:

# Analysis of the [[catchment]] setting and controls on river morphology
# Mapping River Styles across the [[catchment]]
# Interpretation of the controls on river character and behaviour and the downstream pattern of River Styles in a [[catchment]].

=== Stage 2 ===
Stage 2 assesses and explains [[Geomorphology|geomorphic]] river condition throughout a [[catchment]]. River condition is a determination of [[environmental quality]] pertaining to a river's [[geomorphology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brierley|first1=Gary|last2=Reid|first2=Helen|last3=Fryirs|first3=Kirstie|last4=Trahan|first4=Nadine|date=2010|title=What are we monitoring and why? Using geomorphic principles to frame eco-hydrological assessments of river condition|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=408|issue=9|pages=2025–2033|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.01.038|pmid=20170940|bibcode=2010ScTEn.408.2025B}}</ref> Steps in Stage 2 include:

# Determination of a River Style's ability to adjust its [[geomorphology]]
# Assessment of the River Style's evolutionary history in order to identify if a river has changed irreversibly
# Determination and explanation of the geomorphic condition of the section of river being assessed.

=== Stage 3 ===
Stage 3 determines the potential for a river to 'recover', or improve in condition. Steps in Stage 3 include:

# Determination of the trajectory of a river's geomorphic adjustment (how it has adjusted in the past and how it might change in the future)
# Assessment of the potential for a river to recover and assessment of factors limiting recovery.

=== Stage 4 ===
Stage 4 uses information from Stages 1 to 3 to identify 'target conditions' for a River Style as a goal toward which river rehabilitation (or [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]) can work. Steps in Stage 4 include:

# Identification of target conditions for river rehabilitation and level of intervention required to reach target conditions
# Prioritisation of river management efforts based on geomorphic river condition and potential for the river to recover
# Monitoring and auditing of adjustments to geomorphic river condition.

== Applications and uses of the River Styles Framework ==
The River Styles Framework has been used to support river management in [[Australia]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.industry.nsw.gov.au/water/science/surface-water/monitoring/river-health/river-styles |title=River Styles in NSW |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=<!--Not stated--> |website=Water in New South Wales |publisher=NSW Department of Industry |access-date=February 15, 2019 |quote=}}</ref> [[New Zealand]],<ref name="ReidGregory2013">{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=H.

In the United States, The River Styles Framework formed part of the protocol for the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program (CHaMP) developed for the [[Columbia River Basin]]. The CHaMP protocol used River Styles to help with comparing river types, predicting fish [[habitat]] suitability and prioritising river conservation and rehabilitation activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wheaton|first1=Joseph M.|last2=Bouwes|first2=Nicolaas|last3=Mchugh|first3=Peter|last4=Saunders|first4=Carl|last5=Bangen|first5=Sara|last6=Bailey|first6=Phillip|last7=Nahorniak|first7=Matt|last8=Wall|first8=Eric|last9=Jordan|first9=Chris|date=2018|title=Upscaling site-scale ecohydraulic models to inform salmonid population-level life cycle modeling and restoration actions - Lessons from the Columbia River Basin: Upscaling Ecohydraulic models|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=21–44|doi=10.1002/esp.4137|s2cid=132558458}}</ref>

A [[cost-benefit analysis]] completed by [[Land & Water Australia]] found that the River Styles Framework had a benefit-to-cost ratio of 28:1 and had contributed a net value of $40 million ([[AUD]]) in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lwa.gov.au/node/3777 |title=Measuring return on 20 years of investment in natural resource management research & development |last1=Pearson |first1=Stuart |last2=Chudleigh |first2=Peter |last3=Simpson |first3=Sarah |last4=Schofield |first4=Nick |date=June 2010 |website=Land & Water Australia}}</ref>

== Training and accreditation ==
An accreditation framework has been developed for use of the River Styles Framework to ensure quality control. There are two levels of accreditation: 'Provisional' and 'Accredited'. 'Provisional' practitioners have undertaken a River Styles Short Course and have passed the associated assessment tasks. 'Provisional' practitioners may undertake assessments of River Styles under the supervision of a fully accredited practitioner. Full accreditation is gained following successful completion of a River Styles Short Course and completion of a satisfactory River Styles Report. 'Accredited' practitioners may undertake River Styles assessments unsupervised and may also supervise 'Provisional' practitioners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://riverstyles.com/courses/|title=Courses|website=River Styles|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>
