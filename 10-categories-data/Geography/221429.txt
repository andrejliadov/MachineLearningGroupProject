In [[navigation]], '''bearing''' is the horizontal angle between the direction of an object and another object, or between it and that of true north.

* ''Absolute bearing'' refers to the angle between the [[North Magnetic Pole|magnetic north]] (magnetic bearing) or [[true north]] (true bearing) and an object. For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees. 
* ''[[Relative bearing]]'' refers to the angle between the craft's forward direction and the location of another object. For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead; an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind.<ref>Rutstrum, Carl, ''The Wilderness Route Finder'', University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194</ref> Bearings can be measured in [[Angular mil|mils]] or degrees.

==Some specific usages==
A Bearing was used to determine one's path when at sea.
===US Army definition===
The US Army defines the ''bearing'' from Point A to Point B as the angle between a [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] in the direction of north or south, whose origin is Point A, and Ray AB, the ray whose origin is Point A and which contains Point B. The bearing consists of 2 characters and 1 number:  first, the character is either N or S. Next is the angle value. Third, the character representing the direction of the angle away from the reference ray - thus,  either E, or W. The angle value will always be less than 90 degrees.<ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25" />  For example, if Point B is located exactly southeast of Point A, the bearing from Point A to Point B is S 45° E.<ref name="U.S. Army 1956 pp. 69-70">U.S. Army, Map Reading and Land Navigation, FM 21-26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, pp. 69-70</ref>

The US Army defines the ''[[azimuth]]'' between Point A and Point B as the angle, measured in the clockwise direction, between the north reference ray and Ray AB.  For example, if the bearing between Point A and Point B is S 45° E, the azimuth between Point A and Point B is 135°.<ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25"/><ref name="U.S. Army 1956 pp. 69-70"/> The angle value in a bearing can be specified in the units of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[Angular mil|mils]], or [[grad (angle)|grad]].  An azimuth is specified in the same angle units.<ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25">U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24-25</ref>

==General examples==
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}

===Piloting===
A bearing can be taken on another vessel to aid piloting. If the two vessels are travelling towards each other and the relative bearing remains the same over time, there is likelihood of collision and action needs to be taken by one or both vessels to prevent this from happening.

===Warfare===
A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles. This is mainly used by ground troops when planning on using an air-strike on the target.

===Search and rescue===
A bearing can be taken to a person or vessel in distress in order to go to their aid.

==Other terminology sometimes used==
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}
Types of bearings include:
* compass bearings
* grid bearings
* magnetic bearings
* relative bearings
* true bearings

A ''true bearing'' is measured in relation to the fixed horizontal reference plane of [[true north]], that is, using the direction toward the [[geographic north pole]] as a reference point, while a ''magnetic bearing'' is measured in relation to [[magnetic north]], that is in relation to the north direction of the Earth's magnetic field lines at the given location. The latter is not the same as the direction toward the [[magnetic north pole]] due to [[magnetic anomalies]].

A ''[[grid north|grid bearing]]'' is measured in relation to the fixed horizontal reference plane of [[grid north]], that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the [[map projection]] as a reference point, while a ''compass bearing'', as in vehicle or marine navigation, is measured in relation to the [[magnetic compass]] of the navigator's vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic bearing and a compass bearing is the [[magnetic deviation|deviation]] caused to the compass by [[ferrous]] metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.)

A ''relative bearing'' is one in which the reference direction is straight ahead, where the bearing is measured relative to the direction the navigator is facing (on land) or in relation to the vessel's bow (aboard ship).

==Bearing measurement==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The bearing between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projections in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
There are several methods used to measure navigation bearings including:
#In land navigation, a 'bearing' is ordinarily calculated in a [[clockwise]] direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees.<ref name="Keay, pp. 133-134">Keay, pp. 133-134</ref>  Measured in this way, a bearing is referred to as an ''[[azimuth]]'' by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing.<ref>U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21-26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2</ref>  If the reference direction is north (either [[true north]], [[magnetic north]], or [[grid north]]), the bearing is termed an ''absolute bearing''.  In a contemporary land navigation context, true, magnetic, and grid bearings are always measured in this way, with true north, magnetic north, or grid north being 0° in a 360-degree system.<ref name="Keay, pp. 133-134" />
#In aircraft navigation, an angle is normally measured from the aircraft's track or heading, in a clockwise direction. If the aircraft encounters a target that is not ahead of the aircraft and not on an identical track, then the angular bearing to that target is called a ''relative bearing''.{{clarify|date=May 2016|Track and heading are not usually the same number due to wind}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
#In marine navigation, [[starboard]] bearings are 'green' and [[Port (nautical)|port]] bearings are 'red'. Thus, in ship navigation, a target directly off the starboard side would be 'Green090' or 'G090'.<ref>This method is used by the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] in accordance with the ''Admiralty Manual of Navigation'', BR45.</ref>  This method is only used for a ''relative bearing''.  A navigator on watch does not always have a corrected compass available with which to give an accurate bearing. If available, the bearing might not be numerate. Therefore, every forty-five degrees of direction from north on the compass was divided into four 'points'. Thus, 32 points of 11.25° each makes a circle of 360°. An object at 022.5° relative would be 'two points off the starboard bow', an object at 101.25° relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.75° relative would be 'three points on the port quarter'. This method is only used for a ''relative bearing''.
#An informal method of measuring a ''relative bearing'' is by using the '[[clock position|clock method]]'. In this method, the direction a vessel, aircraft or object is measured as if a clock face is laid over the vessel or aircraft, with the number twelve pointing forward. Something straight ahead is at 'twelve o'clock', while something directly off to the right is at 'three o'clock'. This method is only used for a relative bearing.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
#In land [[surveying]], a '''bearing''' is the clockwise or counterclockwise angle between north or south and a direction. For example, bearings are recorded as N57°E, S51°E, S21°W, N87°W, or N15°W. In surveying, bearings can be referenced to true north, magnetic north, grid north (the Y axis of a map projection), or a previous map, which is often a historical magnetic north.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Usage===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}
If navigating by [[gyrocompass]], the reference direction is [[true north]], in which case the terms ''[[true bearing]]'' and '' [[geodetic bearing]]'' are used.  In [[stellar navigation]], the reference direction is that of the [[North Star]], [[Polaris]]. Generalizing this to two angular dimensions, a '''bearing''' is the combination of antenna [[azimuth]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] required to point (aim) an antenna in a given direction. The bearing for [[geostationary satellite]]s is constant. The bearing for polar-orbiting satellites varies continuously.
[[File:Polar bear bearing.svg|thumb|upright|'''A''' and '''B''' are near the North Pole and facing each other. Though '''A''' is facing east, '''B''' is ''not'' facing west. If '''B''' were to face west, her direction (dashed arrow) would be tangential to her latitude circle (dashed circle). Only on the equator is it true that if '''A''' faces east and '''B''' faces west that they can face each other.]]
Moving from A to B along a [[great circle]] can be considered as always going in the same direction (the direction of B), but not in the sense of keeping the same bearing, which applies when following a [[rhumb line]].  Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B). For example, assume A and B in the northern hemisphere have the same latitude, and at A the direction to B is east-northeast. Then going from A to B, one arrives at B with the direction east-southeast, and conversely, the direction at B of A is west-northwest.

Bearings can also be transmitted in to NNE-North North East NNNE-North North North east and ENNE-East North North East.
