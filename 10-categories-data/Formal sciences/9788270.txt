'''Automated species identification''' is a method of making the expertise of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] available to ecologists, [[parataxonomy|parataxonomists]] and others via digital technology and [[artificial intelligence]]. Today, most automated identification systems rely on images depicting the species for the identification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wäldchen|first1=Jana|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|date=November 2018|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Natalie|title=Machine learning for image based species identification|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2216–2225|doi=10.1111/2041-210X.13075}}</ref> Based on precisely identified images of a species, a [[Classifier system|classifier]] is trained. Once exposed to a sufficient amount of training data, this classifier can then identify the trained species on previously unseen images. Accurate species identification is the basis for all aspects of taxonomic research and is an essential component of workflows in biological research.

== Introduction ==
The '''automated identification''' of biological objects such as [[insects]] (individuals) and/or groups (e.g., [[species]], guilds, characters) has been a dream among [[systematics|systematists]] for centuries. The goal of some of the first [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] [[biometric]] methods was to address the perennial problem of [[group discrimination]] and inter-group characterization. Despite much preliminary work in the 1950s and '60s, progress in designing and implementing practical systems for fully automated object biological [[identification (biology)|identification]] has proven frustratingly slow. As recently as 2004 [[Daniel Janzen|Dan Janzen]]

On the next sweep it says ‘''Quercus oleoides—Homo sapiens—Spondias mombin—Solanum nigrum—Crotalus durissus—Morpho peleides''—serpentine’. This has been in my head since reading science fiction in ninth grade half a century ago.{{clarify|reason=how is this relevant?|date=January 2017}}</blockquote>

Janzen's preferred solution to this classic problem involved building machines to identify species from their [[DNA]]. His predicted budget and proposed research team is “US$1 million and five bright people.” However, recent developments in computer architectures, as well as innovations in software design, have placed the tools needed to realize Janzen's vision in the hands of the [[systematics]] and [[computer science]] community not in several years hence, but now; and not just for creating [[DNA barcode]]s, but also for identification based on [[digital images]].

The authors found that "a small but growing number of studies sought to develop automated species identification systems based on morphological characters". An overview of 20 studies analyzing species’ structures, such as cells, pollen, wings, and genitalia, shows identification success rates between 40% and 100% on training sets with 1 to 72 species. However, they also identified four fundamental problems with these systems: (1) training sets—were too small (5-10 specimens per species) and their extension especially for rare species may be difficult, (2) errors in identification—are not sufficiently studied to handle them and to find systematics, (3) scaling—studies consider only small numbers of species (<200 species), and (4) novel species — systems are restricted to the species they have been trained for and will classify any novel observation as one of the known species.

These studies propose a wealth of [[computer vision]] approaches, i.e., [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] reducing the high-dimensionality of the pixel-based image data while preserving the characteristic information as well as classification methods.  The vast majority of these studies analyzes [[Leaf|leaves]] for identification, while only 13 studies propose methods for [[flower]]-based identification. The reasons being that leaves can easier be collected and imaged and are available for most of the year. Proposed [[Feature (computer vision)|features]] capture generic object characteristic, i.e., [[shape]], texture, and [[color]] as well as leaf-specific characteristics, i.e., [[Leaf#Venation|venation]] and margin. The majority of studies still used datasets for evaluation that contained no more than 250 [[species]].

These developments could not have come at a better time. As the [[Alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] community already knows, the world is running out of specialists who can identify the very [[biodiversity]] whose preservation has become a global concern.

<blockquote>“… we are running out of systematic palaeontologists who have anything approaching synoptic knowledge of a major group of organisms … Palaeontologists of the next century are unlikely to have the luxury of dealing at length with taxonomic problems … Palaeontology will have to sustain its level of excitement without the aid of systematists, who have contributed so much to its success.”</blockquote>This expertise deficiency cuts as deeply into those commercial industries that rely on accurate identifications (e.g., [[agriculture]], [[biostratigraphy]]) as it does into a wide range of pure and applied research programmes (e.g., [[Conservation biology|conservation]], biological [[oceanography]], [[climatology]], [[ecology]]). It is also commonly, though informally, acknowledged that the technical, taxonomic literature of all organismal groups is littered with examples of inconsistent and incorrect identifications. This is due to a variety of factors, including taxonomists being insufficiently trained and skilled in making identifications (e.g., using different rules-of-thumb in recognizing the boundaries between similar groups), insufficiently detailed original group descriptions and/or illustrations, inadequate access to current monographs and well-curated collections and, of course, taxonomists having different opinions regarding group concepts. Peer review only weeds out the most obvious errors of commission or omission in this area, and then only when an author provides adequate representations (e.g., illustrations, recordings, and gene sequences) of the specimens in question.

[[Systematics]] too has much to gain, both practically and theoretically, from the further development and use of automated identification systems. It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” <ref>{{cite journal

Many have identified use of the [[Internet]]— especially via the [[World Wide Web]] — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, [[GenBank]]-like system for accessing [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the [[taxonomic impediment]] or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of qualitative criteria must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.

Properly designed, flexible, and robust, automated identification systems, organized around distributed computing architectures and referenced to authoritatively identified collections of training set data (e.g., images, and [[gene sequence]]s) can, in principle, provide all systematists with access to the electronic data archives and the necessary analytic tools to handle routine identifications of common taxa. Properly designed systems can also recognize when their algorithms cannot make a reliable identification and refer that image to a specialist (whose address can be accessed from another database). Such systems can also include elements of artificial intelligence and so improve their performance the more they are used. Most tantalizingly, once morphological (or molecular) models of a species have been developed and demonstrated to be accurate, these models can be queried to determine which aspects of the observed patterns of variation and variation limits are being used to achieve the identification, thus opening the way for the discovery of new and (potentially) more reliable taxonomic characters.
