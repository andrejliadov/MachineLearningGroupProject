[[Information]] is that which reduces uncertainty, wholly or in part.
Similarly, anti-information is that which increases uncertainty.
It is negative information.

[[Noise_(signal_processing)|Noise]] on a [[Noisy-channel coding theorem|noisy communication channel]] is an example of anti-information.
According to [[Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem|Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem]]
the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the noise must be subtracted to obtain the [[channel capacity]]
that remains available for reliable communication.

The [[gambling]] industry has made a business out of selling anti-information.
People are willing to pay for anti-information.
The increase in uncertainty enables them to savor the information that they subsequently receive
when the uncertainty is finally resolved.

The term anti-information was introduced by [[Jacobus Verhoeff|Koos Verhoeff]] in the 1970s
while teaching [[informatics]] at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]].
