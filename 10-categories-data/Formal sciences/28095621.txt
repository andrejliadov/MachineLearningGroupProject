The '''methodology of econometrics''' is the study of the range of differing approaches to undertaking [[Econometrics|econometric analysis]].<ref>Jennifer Castle and Neil Shephard (Eds) (2009) ''The Methodology and Practice of Econometrics  -  A Festschrift in Honour of David F. Hendry'' {{ISBN|978-0-19-923719-7}}</ref>

Commonly distinguished differing approaches that have been identified and studied include:
* the [[Cowles Commission]] approach<ref>Christ, Carl F. 1994. “The Cowles Commission Contributions to Econometrics at Chicago: 1939–1955” ''Journal of Economic Literature''.  Vol. 32.</ref>
* the [[vector autoregression]] approach<ref>[[Christopher A. Sims|Sims, Christopher]] (1980) Macroeconomics and Reality, ''Econometrica'', January, pp. 1-48.</ref>
* the [[LSE approach to econometrics]] - originated with [[Denis Sargan]] now associated with [[David Forbes Hendry|David Hendry]] (and his general-to-specific modeling). Also associated this approach is the work on integrated and cointegrated systems originating on the work of [[Robert F. Engle|Engle]] and [[Clive Granger|Granger]] and [[Søren Johansen|Johansen]] and [[Katarina Juselius|Juselius]] (Juselius 1999)
* the use of calibration - [[Finn E. Kydland|Finn Kydland]] and [[Edward C. Prescott|Edward Prescott]]<ref>Kydland, Finn E & Prescott, Edward C, 1991. " The Econometrics of the General Equilibrium Approach to Business Cycles," ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'', Blackwell Publishing, 93 (2), 161–178.</ref>
* the ''[[Experimentalist approach to econometrics|experimentalist]]'' or [[difference in differences]] approach - [[Joshua Angrist]] and [[Jörn-Steffen Pischke]].<ref>Angrist, J. D., & Pischke, J.-S. (2009). ''Mostly harmless econometrics: An empiricist's companion''. Princeton: Princeton University Press.</ref>

In addition to these more clearly defined approaches, [[Kevin Hoover|Hoover]]<ref>Hoover, Kevin D. (2006). Chapter 2, "The Methodology of Econometrics." in T. C. Mills and K. Patterson, ed., ''Palgrave Handbook of Econometrics'', v. 1, ''Econometric Theory'', pp. 61-87.</ref> identifies a range of ''heterogeneous'' or ''textbook approaches'' that those less, or even un-, concerned with methodology, tend to follow.

==Methods==
Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].<ref name=Introductory_econometrics>{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}</ref> In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although [[exploratory data analysis]] may by useful for generating new hypotheses.<ref>[[Herman Wold|Herman O. Wold]] (1969). "Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building," ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.</ref> Economics often analyzes systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].<ref>For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].</ref> Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.<ref>Edward E. Leamer (2008). "specification problems in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&edition=current&q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref>

===Experimental economics===
In recent decades, econometricians have increasingly turned to use of [[experimental economics|experiments]] to evaluate the often-contradictory conclusions of observational studies. Here, controlled and randomized experiments provide statistical inferences that may yield better empirical performance than do purely observational studies.<ref>• H. Wold 1954. "Causality and Econometrics," ''[[Econometrica]]'', 22(2), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1907540 p. 162]-177.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Kevin D. Hoover (2008).

===Data===
[[Data set]]s to which econometric analyses are applied can be classified as [[time-series data]], [[cross-sectional data]], [[panel data]], and [[multidimensional panel data]].  Time-series data sets contain observations over time; for example, inflation over the course of several years. Cross-sectional data sets contain observations at a single point in time; for example, many individuals' incomes in a given year.  Panel data sets contain both time-series and cross-sectional observations. Multi-dimensional panel data sets contain observations across time, cross-sectionally, and across some third dimension. For example, the [[Survey of Professional Forecasters]] contains forecasts for many forecasters (cross-sectional observations), at many points in time (time series observations), and at multiple forecast horizons (a third dimension).<ref>Davies, A., 2006. A framework for decomposing shocks and measuring volatilities derived from multi-dimensional panel data of survey forecasts. International Journal of Forecasting, 22(2): 373-393.</ref>

===Instrumental variables===
In many econometric contexts, the commonly used [[ordinary least squares]] method may not recover the theoretical relation desired or may produce estimates with poor statistical properties, because the assumptions for valid use of the method are violated. One widely used remedy is the method of [[instrumental variable]]s (IV). For an economic model described by more than one equation, [[Simultaneous equations model|simultaneous-equation methods]] may be used to remedy similar problems, including two IV variants, Two-Stage Least Squares ([[2SLS]]), and Three-Stage Least Squares ([[3SLS]]).<ref>[[Peter Kennedy (economist)]] (2003).

===Computational methods===
[[Computational economics|Computational concerns]] are important for evaluating econometric methods and for use in decision making.<ref>• Keisuke Hirano (2008). "decision theory in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000251&edition=&field=keyword&q=statistical%20decision%20theory&topicid=&result_number=1 Abstract.]</ref> Such concerns include [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[well-posed problem|well-posedness]]: the [[existence]], [[uniqueness]], and [[stability theory|stability]] of any solutions to econometric equations. Another concern is the numerical efficiency and accuracy of software.<ref>B. D. McCullough and H. D. Vinod (1999). "The Numerical Reliability of Econometric Software," ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 37(2), pp. [http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/jel.pdf 633-665].</ref> A third concern is also the usability of [[econometric software]].<ref>• Vassilis A. Hajivassiliou (2008). "computational methods in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

===Structural econometrics===
{{further|Structural estimation}}

Structural econometrics extends the ability of researchers to analyze data by using [[economic model]]s as the lens through which to view the data. The benefit of this approach is that, provided that counter-factual analyses take an agent's re-optimization into account, any policy recommendations will not be subject to the [[Lucas critique]]. Structural econometric analyses begin with an economic model that captures the salient features of the agents under investigation. The researcher then searches for parameters of the model that match the outputs of the model to the data.

One example is [[dynamic discrete choice]], where there are two common ways of doing this. The first requires the researcher to completely solve the model and then use [[maximum likelihood]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rust |first=John |title=Optimal Replacement of GMC Bus Engines: An Empirical Model of Harold Zurcher |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |year=1987 |pages=999–1033 |jstor=1911259 |doi=10.2307/1911259 }}</ref> The second bypasses the full solution of the model and estimates models in two stages, allowing the researcher to consider more complicated models with strategic interactions and multiple equilibria.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hotz |first=V. Joseph |last2=Miller |first2=Robert A. |title=Conditional Choice Probabilities and the Estimation of Dynamic Models |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=497–529 |jstor=2298122 |doi=10.2307/2298122 }}</ref>

Another example of structural econometrics is in the estimation of [[first-price sealed-bid auction]]s with independent private values.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guerre|first=E.|last2=Perrigne|first2=I.|last3=Vuong|first3=Q.|title=Optimal Nonparametric Estimation of First Price Auctions|journal=[[Econometrica]]|volume=68|issue=3|year=2000|pages=525–574|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00123 }}</ref> The key difficulty with bidding data from these auctions is that bids only partially reveal information on the underlying valuations, bids shade the underlying valuations. One would like to estimate these valuations in order to understand the magnitude of profits each bidder makes. More importantly, it is necessary to have the valuation distribution in hand to engage in [[mechanism design]]. In a first price sealed bid auction the expected payoff of a bidder is given by:

:<math> (v-b)\Pr(b\ \textrm{wins}) </math>
where v is the bidder valuation, b is the bid. The optimal bid <math>b^*</math> solves a first order condition:
:<math> (v-b^*)\frac{\partial \Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})}{\partial b}-\Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})=0 </math>
which can be re-arranged to yield the following equation for <math>v</math>
:<math> v=b^*+\frac{\Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})}{\partial \Pr(b^*\ \textrm{wins})/\partial b} </math>

Notice that the probability that a bid wins an auction can be estimated from a data set of completed auctions, where all bids are observed. This can be done using simple [[nonparametric estimator]]s, such as [[kernel regression]]. If all bids are observed, it is then possible to use the above relation and the estimated probability function and its derivative to point wise estimate the underlying valuation. This will then allow the investigator to estimate the valuation distribution.
