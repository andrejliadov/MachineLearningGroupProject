'''GeoModeller''' (old names include 3DWEG, Geomodeller3D) is a methodology and associated software tool for 3D [[geologic modelling]] developed by [[Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières]] and [[Intrepid Geophysics]] over the last 20 years. The software is written using [[Open CASCADE]] in [[C++]] for the engine (geometry, topology, viewers, data management, ...), [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for the [[GUI]] and data are stored in extensible mark-up language [[XML]]. GeoModeller has started to revolutionise the working practices, data standards and products of a [[geological survey]] as a whole. The software takes into account all [[structural geology]] data such as dip, dip directions, strike, hingelines and axialtrace to build the geometry of geological units.

== Methodology ==
GeoModeller utilizes a Digital Terrain Model, surface geological linework, cross-sections, geophysical interpretation and drillhole [[borehole]] data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections, or 3D models. 3D [[Geostatistics|Geostatistical]] interpolation (co-kriging) using all the data (location of interface, dip, direction, ...) produces a 3D [[implicit function]] representing a solid model. The model build may take in account if necessary a network of [[geologic faults]]. The model could be represented by [[triangulated]] objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present. Geologists can draw the model in their sections to obtain a fence diagram. The geologist can use their knowledge to add information in the 3D space until he obtain a 'right' model.

== Inversion of the 3D model ==
In geological and mining or oil exploration applications, [[Seismic wave|seismic]] profiles as well as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] data are often available. Interpreted seismic cross-sections directly provide data that can be processed directly as geometric constraints for 3D modelling. On the other hand, gravity and magnetic data provide indirect constraints. Presently, a 3D geological model is considered as the initial state of a constrained [[Inverse problem|inverse]] modelling of this data. That inversion is based on an iterative method, which is applied to a discrete version of the domain under study. This inversion formulation allows separate inversion of either gravity or magnetic data or simultaneous inversion of both datasets and [[tensor]] components of [[gravity]] and [[magnetic field]] . The final result is a probabilistic 3D geological model.
