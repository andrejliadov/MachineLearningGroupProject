==Usage==
As a rhetorical device, apophasis can serve several purposes.

It can be employed to raise an ''[[ad hominem]]'' or otherwise controversial attack while disclaiming responsibility for it, as in, "I refuse to discuss the rumor that my opponent is a drunk." This can make it a favored tactic in politics.

Apophasis can be used [[passive aggression|passive-aggressively]], as in, "I forgive you for your jealousy, so I won't even mention what a betrayal it was."

In [[Cicero]]'s "[[Pro Caelio]]" speech, he says to a prosecutor, "{{lang|la|Obliviscor iam iniurias tuas, Clodia, depono memoriam doloris mei}}" ("I now forget your wrongs, Clodia, I set aside the memory of my pain [that you caused].")<ref>[[Cicero]], "[[Pro Caelio]]", Chapter 50</ref>

Apophasis can be used to discuss a taboo subject, as in, "We are all fully loyal to the emperor, so we wouldn't dare to claim that his [[The Emperor's New Clothes|new clothes]] are a transparent hoax."

As a rhetorical device, it can serve various purposes, often dependent on the relationship of the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase "needless to say" invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that it is not necessary to say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation ("needless to say, ''because you are responsible''"). If the addressee does not actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance. Conversely, it could be a sincere and polite way to share necessary information that the addressee may or may not know ''without'' implying that the addressee is ignorant.

Apophasis can serve to politely avoid the suggestion of ignorance on the part of an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', where the character fills in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Name of the Rose |last= Eco |first=Umberto |authorlink=Umberto Eco |year= 1984 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |page=39 |translator=William Weaver |chapter=Postscript to the Name of the Rose}} Eco and Weaver use the spelling paralepsis or "passing over" for the phenomenon.</ref> Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance.

Another diplomatic use would be to raise a criticism indirectly, as in, "It would be out of line for me to say that this action would be unwise and unaffordable, sir, as I only care about your best interests."

==Examples==

When apophasis is taken to its extreme, the speaker provides full details, stating or drawing attention to something in the very act of pretending to pass it over: "I will not stoop to mentioning the occasion last winter when our esteemed opponent was found asleep in an alleyway with an empty bottle of vodka still pressed to his lips."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paralipsis.htm |title=paralipsis |last1=Burton |first1=Gideon O |work=Silva Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=1 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525140036/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paralipsis.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
