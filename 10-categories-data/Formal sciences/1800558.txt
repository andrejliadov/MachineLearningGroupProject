{{short description|Index used to classify folk narratives}}
The '''Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index''' ('''ATU Index''') is a [[Cataloguing|catalogue]] of [[Folklore|folktale]] types used in [[folklore studies]]. The ATU Index is the product of a series of revisions and expansions by an international group of scholars: Originally composed in German by Finnish folklorist [[Antti Aarne]] (1910); the index was translated into English, revised, and expanded by American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] (1928, 1961); and later further revised and expanded by German folklorist [[Hans-Jörg Uther]] (2004). The ATU Index, along with Thompson's ''[[Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' (1932)  (with which it is used in tandem) is an essential tool for folklorists.<ref name=jstor3814885>{{cite journal |last1=Dundes |first1=Alan |title=The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique |journal=Journal of Folklore Research |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=195–202 |jstor=3814885 }}</ref>

==Definition of ''tale type''==
In ''The Folktale'', Thompson defines a ''tale type'' as follows:
<blockquote>
:A type is a traditional tale that has an independent existence. It may be told as a complete narrative and does not depend for its meaning on any other tale. It may indeed happen to be told with another tale, but the fact that it may be told alone attests its independence. It may consist of only one motif or of many.<ref name="THOMPSON-415">Thompson (1977: 415).</ref>
</blockquote>

== Predecessors ==
Austrian consul [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] devised a preliminary analysis of some forty-four tale "formulae" as introduction to his book of Greek and Albanian folktales, published in 1864.<ref>Hahn, Johann Georg von.

Putnam's sons. 1916. pp. 215-216.</ref>

Reverend [[Sabine Baring-Gould]], in 1866, translated von Hahn's list and expanded to fifty-two tale types, which he called "Story Radicals".<ref>Baring-Gould, Sabine. "Appendix".

Before the edition of [[Antti Aarne]]'s first folktale classification, Astrid Lunding translated [[Svend Grundtvig]]'s system of folktale classification. This catalogue consisted of 134 types, mostly based on [[Denmark|Danish]] folktale compilations in comparison to international collections available at the time by other folklorists, such as [[Brothers Grimm]]'s and [[Emmanuel Cosquin]]'s.<ref>Lunding, Astrid. "The System of Tales in the Folklore Collection of Copenhagen". In: ''Folklore Fellows Communications'' (FFC) nº 2. 1910.

== History ==
[[Antti Aarne]] was a student of [[Julius Krohn]] and his son [[Kaarle Krohn]]. Aarne developed the [[historic-geographic method]] of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for [[Morphology (folkloristics)|classifying folktales]], first published in 1910 as ''Verzeichnis der Märchentypen''.<ref name="AARNE-1910">Antti Aarne, ''Verzeichnis der Märchentypen'', FF Communications, 3 (Helsinki, 1910).</ref> The system was based on identifying [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] and the repeated narrative ideas that can be seen as the building-blocks of traditional narrative; its scope was European.<ref name="UTHER-2004">Uther, Hans-Jörg. 2004. ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the system of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson''. FF Communications no. 284–286. Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia. Three volumes. I: 7.</ref>

The American folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] revised Aarne's classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope, while also translating it from German into English.<ref name="THOMPSON-1928">''The Types of the Folk-Tale: A Classification and Bibliography. Antti Aarne's Verzeichnis der Märchentypen'', translated and enlarged by Stith Thompson (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1928).</ref> In doing so, he created the "AT number system" (also referred to as "AaTh system") which remained in use through the second half of the century. Another edition with further revisions by Thompson followed in 1961. According to [[D. L. Ashliman]], "The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales".<ref name="ASHLIMAN-1987">[[D. L. Ashliman|Ashliman, D. L.]] 1987. ''A Guide to Folktales in the English Language: Based on the Aarne–Thompson Classification System.'' New York, Greenwood Press.</ref>

The AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography'' by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many "irregular types" are in fact old and widespread, and that "emphasis on oral tradition" often obscured "older, written versions of the tale types". To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification (ATU) system and included more tales from [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[southern Europe]] as well as "smaller narrative forms" in this expanded listing. He also put the emphasis of the collection more explicitly on international folktales, removing examples whose attestation was limited to one ethnic group.<ref name="UTHER-2004"/><ref name="HAASE-2008">''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales'', Donald Haase, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, p. xxi.</ref>

==System==
The Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index divides tales into sections with an AT number for each entry. The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The name does not have to be strictly literal for every folktale. For example, ''The Cat as Helper'' (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance ''The Quest for a Lost Bride'' (400) or the ''Animal Bride'' (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: tale 510, ''Persecuted Heroine'' (renamed in Uther's revision as ''Cinderella and Peau d'Âne''), has subtypes 510A, ''[[Cinderella]]'', and 510B, ''[[Catskin]]'' (renamed in Uther's revision as ''Peau d'Asne''). {{crossref|printworthy=y|1=(See other examples of tale types in the [[#Online resources and examples of tale types|online resource links]] at the end of this article.)}}

As an example, the entry for 510A in the ATU index (with cross-references to motifs in Thompson's ''Motif-Index of Folk Literature'' in square brackets, and variants in parentheses) reads:
<blockquote>'''510A ''Cinderella''.''' (Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a supernatural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2].
The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cinderella, who had first been hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her.

'''Combinations:''' This type is usually combined with episodes of one or more other types, esp. 327A, 403, 480, 510B, and also 408, 409, 431, 450, 511, 511A, 707, and 923.
'''Remarks:''' Documented by Basile, ''Pentamerone'' (I,6) in the 17th century.</blockquote>
The entry concludes, like others in the catalogue, with a long list of references to secondary literature on the tale, and variants of it.<ref name="UTHER-2004-284-286">Uther, Hans-Jörg. 2004. ''The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography. Based on the system of Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson''. FF Communications no. 284–286. Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia. Three volumes. I: 293-94.</ref>

==Critical response==
In his essay "The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique", [[Alan Dundes]] explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the "most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis".<ref name=jstor3814885/>

The tale type index was criticized by [[Vladimir Propp]] of the [[Russian Formalism|Formalist]] school of the 1920s for ignoring the {{em|functions}} of the [[Motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a "macro-level" analysis means that the stories that share [[motif (folkloristics)|motifs]] might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient.<ref name="PROPP-DUNDES">Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale''. Similarly, Alan Dundes points out that "Aarne’s mistake was not classifying tales on the basis of narrative plot rather than [on characters]" because "the same tale can be told with either animal or human characters" (197). "Introduction". Theory and History of Folklore. Ed. Anatoly Liberman. University of Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 1984. p. ix.</ref>  He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify "[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]" as an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.<ref name="PROPP-5">Propp, ''Morphology of the Folktale'', p. 5 f.</ref>

In describing the motivation for his work,<ref name="UTHER-FF">{{cite web |first=Hans-Jörg |last=Uther |url=http://www.folklorefellows.fi/?page_id=915 |title=Classifying folktales: The Third Revision of the Aarne–Thompson Tale Type Index (FFC 184) |publisher=folklorefellow.fi}}</ref> Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called ''The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples''.<ref name="UTHER-FF"/> However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e.&nbsp;g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p.&nbsp;198),<ref name=jstor3814885/> "they represent the keystones for the comparative method in [[folkloristics]], a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics" (p.&nbsp;200).<ref name=jstor3814885/>

According to writer and illustrator Pete Jordi Wood, Thompson intentionally omitted stories with [[LGBTQ]] characters from the catalogue, since he perceived homosexuality as "perverse" and "unnatural". He did, however, include stories where "queers got bashed up, imprisoned, sent to hell or murdered. Or worse, that they were predatory and evil."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wareham |first=Jamie |date=2020-08-21 |title=Why This Charming Gay Fairytale Has Been Lost For 200 Years |language=en |work=Forbes |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2020/08/21/why-this-charming-gay-fairytale-has-been-lost-for-200-years-stith-thompson/ |access-date=2020-08-22}}</ref>

In regards to the geographical criticism, it has been said that the ATU folktype index seems to concentrate on Europe and North Africa,<ref name="Berezkin & Duvakin 2016">{{cite journal |last1=Berezkin |first1=Yuri |last2=Duvakin |first2=Evgeny |title=The Captive Khan and the Clever Daughter-in-Law |journal=Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore |date=June 2016 |volume=64 |pages=33–56 |doi=10.7592/FEJF2016.64.khan |doi-access=free }}</ref> or overrepresent Eurasia and North America.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thuillard |first1=Marc |last2=Le Quellec |first2=Jean-Loïc |last3=d'Huy |first3=Julien |last4=Berezkin |first4=Yuri |title=A Large-Scale Study of World Myths |journal=Trames |date=2018 |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=A1–A44 |doi=10.3176/tr.2018.4.06 }}</ref> The catalogue appears to ignore or underrepresent, for example, Central Asia, a region from where, some scholars propose, may emerge new folktale types, previously not contemplated by the original catalogue, such as Yuri Berezkin's ''The Captive Khan and the Clever Daughter-in-Law'' (and variants)<ref name="Berezkin & Duvakin 2016"/> and ''The travelling girl and her helpful siblings'',<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berezkin |first1=Yuri |title=The Travelling Girl and Her Helpful Siblings: An Unnoticed Boreal Tale and the ATU Index |journal=Folklore: Electronic Journal of Folklore |date=2019 |volume=75 |pages=71–90 |doi=10.7592/FEJF2019.75.berezkin |doi-access=free }}</ref> or ''Woman's Magical Horse'', as named by researcher Veronica Mushkeli of University of Washington.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Mushkeli |first1=Veronica |title=The Fate of Magically Strong Heroines in Central Asian Folktales |conference=REECAS NW 2013.

In regards to the typological classification, it has been called into question that some folklorists and tale comparativists acknowledged singular tale types that, due to its own characteristics, would merit its own type. However, such tales have not been listed in the international folktale system, yet they exist in regional or national classifications.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Christine |title=The Blind Girl, a Misplaced Folktale |journal=Western Folklore |date=1996 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=187–212 |doi=10.2307/1500481 |jstor=1500481 }}</ref>

A [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] study, published by [[folklorist]] Sara Graça da Silva and [[anthropologist]] Jamshid J.

**The original version of the "Dance Among the Thorns" tale-type comes from 15th century Europe, and features a monk who was forced to dance in a thorn bush, by a boy with a magic flute or fiddle. It reflected the anticlerical sentiment of many folk tales at the time, and implies that the monk deserves this punishment. 
**Grimms' ''[[The Jew Among Thorns]]'' (KHM 110) is an example of this type of tale. An American version of this tale, told to folklorist  Marie Campbell in 1958 in Kentucky, included this apology from the informant: "Seems like all the tales about Jews gives the Jews a bad name—greedy, grabbing for cash money, cheating their work hands out of their wages—I don't know what all. I never did know a Jew, never even met up with one."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC&q=ATU+592&pg=PA786 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales [3 Volumes&#93; - Donald Haase - Google Books |date=2007-12-30 |accessdate=2018-07-12|isbn=9780313049477 |last1=Haase |first1=Donald }}</ref>
