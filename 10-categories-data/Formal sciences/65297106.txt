In an '''adaptive design''' of a [[clinical trial]], the parameters and conduct of the trial for a candidate [[approved drug|drug]] or [[vaccine]] may be changed based on an [[interim analysis]].<ref name="pallmann">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pallmann P, Bedding AW, Choodari-Oskooei B, Dimairo M, Flight L, Hampson LV, Holmes J, Mander AP, Odondi L, Sydes MR, Villar SS, Wason JM, Weir CJ, Wheeler GM, Yap C, Jaki T | display-authors = 6 | title = Adaptive designs in clinical trials: why use them, and how to run and report them | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 29 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29490655 | pmc = 5830330 | doi = 10.1186/s12916-018-1017-7 }}</ref><ref name="fda-adaptive">{{cite web |title=Adaptive designs for clinical trials of drugs and biologics: Guidance for industry |url=https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |publisher=U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |access-date=3 April 2020 |date=1 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213234438/https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |archive-date=13 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Adaptive design typically involves advanced [[statistics]] to interpret a clinical trial [[clinical endpoint|endpoint]].<ref name=pallmann/>

==Characteristics==

Traditionally, clinical trials are conducted in three steps:<ref name=pallmann/>
#The trial is designed.
#The trial is conducted as prescribed by the design.
#Once the data are ready, they are analysed according to a pre-specified analysis plan.

The adaptive design method developed mainly in the early [[21st century]].<ref name=pallmann/> In November 2019, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] provided guidelines for using adaptive designs in clinical trials.<ref name=fda-adaptive/>

In April 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] published an "R&D Blueprint (for the) [[COVID-19 vaccine|novel Coronavirus]]" (Blueprint). The Blueprint documented a "large, international, multi-site, individually randomized controlled clinical trial" to allow "the concurrent evaluation of the benefits and risks of each promising candidate vaccine within 3-6 months of it being made available for the trial." The Blueprint listed a ''Global Target Product Profile'' (TPP) for COVID‑19, identifying favorable attributes of safe and effective vaccines under two broad categories: "vaccines for the long-term protection of people at higher risk of COVID‑19, such as healthcare workers", and other vaccines to provide rapid-response immunity for new outbreaks.<ref name="who-accel">{{Cite web|title=Update on WHO Solidarity Trial – Accelerating a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine|url=https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-trial-accelerating-a-safe-and-effective-covid-19-vaccine|publisher=World Health Organization|date=2020-04-27|access-date=2020-05-02|quote=It is vital that we evaluate as many vaccines as possible as we cannot predict how many will turn out to be viable.
