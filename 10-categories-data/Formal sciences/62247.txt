{{short description|One of the two main notation techniques for context-free grammars in computer science}}
{{Distinguish|Boyce–Codd normal form}}

In [[computer science]], '''Backus–Naur form''' or '''Backus normal form''' ('''BNF''') is a [[metasyntax]] notation for [[context-free grammar]]s, often used to describe the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of [[Formal language#Programming languages|languages]] used in computing, such as computer [[programming language]]s, [[document format]]s, [[instruction set]]s and [[communication protocol]]s. They are applied wherever exact descriptions of languages are needed: for instance, in official language specifications, in manuals, and in textbooks on programming language theory.

Many extensions and variants of the original Backus–Naur notation are used; some are exactly defined, including [[extended Backus–Naur form]] (EBNF) and [[augmented Backus–Naur form]] (ABNF).

==History==
The idea of describing the structure of language using [[Rewrite_rule|rewriting rules]] can be traced back to at least the work of [[Pāṇini]], an ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian and a revered scholar in Hinduism who lived sometime between the 6th and 4th century [[BCE]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Panini.html |title=Panini biography |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ingerman |first=Peter Zilahy |date=March 1967 |title="Pāṇini-Backus Form" Suggested |journal=Communications of the ACM |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |volume=10 |issue=3 |page=137 |doi=10.1145/363162.363165 |s2cid=52817672 }} Ingerman suggests that the Backus Normal Form be renamed to the [[Pāṇini]]-Backus Form, to give due credit to Pāṇini as the earliest independent inventor.</ref> His notation to describe [[Sanskrit]] word structure is equivalent in power to that of Backus and has many similar properties.

In Western society, grammar was long regarded as a subject for teaching, rather than scientific study; descriptions were informal and targeted at practical usage.  In the first half of the 20th century, [[linguistics|linguists]] such as [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Zellig Harris]] started attempts to formalize the description of language, including phrase structure.

Meanwhile, [[Semi-Thue_system|string rewriting rules]] as [[formal logical systems]] were introduced and studied by mathematicians such as [[Axel Thue]] (in 1914), [[Emil Post]] (1920s–40s) and [[Alan Turing]] (1936).  [[Noam Chomsky]], teaching linguistics to students of [[information theory]] at [[MIT]], combined linguistics and mathematics by taking what is essentially Thue's formalism as the basis for the description of the syntax of [[natural language]]. He also introduced a clear distinction between generative rules (those of [[context-free grammar]]s) and transformation rules (1956).<ref>{{cite journal

[[John Backus]], a programming language designer at [[IBM]], proposed a [[metalanguage]] of "metalinguistic formulas"<ref name=class>The meaning of syntactic formula may be further explained by saying that words enclosed in the brackets <code>&lt; &gt;</code>, like <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>, denote classes whose members are sequences of basic symbols.

As proposed by Backus, the formula defined "classes" whose names are enclosed in angle brackets.  For example, <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>.  Each of these names denotes a class of basic symbols.<ref name=class/>

Further development of [[ALGOL]] led to [[ALGOL 60]]. In the committee's 1963 report, [[Peter Naur]] called Backus's notation ''Backus normal form''. [[Donald Knuth]] argued that BNF should rather be read as ''Backus–Naur form'', as it is "not a [[normal form (term rewriting)|normal form]] in the conventional sense",<ref>

unlike, for instance, [[Chomsky normal form]].  The name ''Pāṇini Backus form'' was also once suggested in view of the fact that the expansion ''Backus normal form'' may not be accurate, and that [[Pāṇini]] had independently developed a similar notation earlier.<ref>

BNF is described by Peter Naur in the ALGOL 60 report as ''metalinguistic formula'':<ref name=ALGOL60RPT>Revised ALGOL 60 report section. 1.1.{{cite web|url=http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm|title=ALGOL 60|accessdate=April 18, 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|Sequences of characters enclosed in the brackets <> represent metalinguistic variables whose values are sequences of symbols. The marks "::{{=}}" and "{{pipe}}" (the latter with the meaning of "or") are metalinguistic connectives. Any mark in a formula, which is not a variable or a connective, denotes itself. Juxtaposition of marks or variables in a formula signifies juxtaposition of the sequence denoted.}}

Another example from the ALGOL 60 report illustrates a major difference between the BNF metalanguage and a Chomsky context-free grammar. Metalinguistic variables do not require a rule defining their formation. Their formation may simply be described in natural language within the <> brackets. The following ALGOL 60 report section 2.3 comments specification, exemplifies how this works:
<blockquote>
For the purpose of including text among the symbols of a program the following "comment" conventions hold:

{|class="wikitable" 
| The sequence of basic symbols:
| is equivalent to
|----
| ''';''' '''comment''' &lt;any sequence not containing ';'&gt;;
| ''';'''
|----
| '''begin''' '''comment''' &lt;any sequence not containing ';'&gt;;
| '''begin'''
|----
| '''end''' &lt;any sequence not containing 'end' or ';' or 'else'&gt;
| '''end'''
|----
|}

Equivalence here means that any of the three structures shown in the left column may be replaced, in any occurrence outside of strings, by the symbol shown in the same line in the right column without any effect on the action of the program.
</blockquote>

Naur changed two of Backus's symbols to commonly available characters. The <code>::=</code> symbol was originally a <code>:≡</code>. The <code>|</code> symbol was originally the word "{{overline|or}}" (with a bar over it).<ref name="Backus.1969"/>{{rp|14}}

{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Working for IBM, Backus would have had a non-disclosure agreement and could not have talked about his source if it came from an IBM proprietary project.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

BNF is very similar to [[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical-form]] [[boolean algebra]] equations that are, and were at the time, used in logic-circuit design. Backus was a mathematician and the designer of the FORTRAN programming language. Studies of boolean algebra is commonly part of a mathematics. What we do know is that neither Backus nor Naur described the names enclosed in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> as non-terminals. Chomsky's terminology was not originally used in describing BNF. Naur later described them as classes in ALGOL course materials.<ref name=class/> In the ALGOL 60 report they were called metalinguistic variables. Anything other than the metasymbols <code>::=</code>, <code>|</code>, and class names enclosed in <code>&lt; &gt;</code> are symbols of the language being defined. The metasymbols <code>::=</code> is to be interpreted as "is defined as". The <code>|</code> is used to separate alternative definitions and is interpreted as "or". The metasymbols <code>&lt; &gt;</code> are delimiters enclosing a class name. BNF is described as a [[metalanguage]] for talking about ALGOL by Peter Naur and [[Saul Rosen]].<ref name=class/>

In 1947 [[Saul Rosen]] became involved in the activities of the fledgling [[Association for Computing Machinery]], first on the languages committee that became the IAL group and eventually led to ALGOL. He was the first managing editor of the Communications of the ACM.{{clarify|reason=The ACM was founded in 1947. ACM SIGPLAN wasn't founded earlier.|date=May 2015}} What we do know is that BNF was first used as a metalanguage to talk about the ALGOL language in the ALGOL 60 report. That is how it is explained in ALGOL programming course material developed by Peter Naur in 1962.<ref name=class/> Early ALGOL manuals by IBM, Honeywell, Burroughs and Digital Equipment Corporation followed the ALGOL 60 report using it as a metalanguage. Saul Rosen in his book<ref>{{cite book | author=Saul Rosen | authorlink=Saul Rosen| title=Programming Systems and Languages | location=New York/NY | publisher=McGraw Hill | series=McGraw Hill Computer Science Series |date=Jan 1967 | isbn=978-0070537088 }}</ref> describes BNF as a metalanguage for talking about ALGOL. An example of its use as a metalanguage would be in defining an arithmetic expression:

{{block indent|1=<syntaxhighlight lang="bnf">
<expr> ::= <term>|<expr><addop><term>
</syntaxhighlight>}}

The first symbol of an alternative may be the class being defined, the repetition, as explained by Naur, having the function of specifying that the alternative sequence can recursively begin with a previous alternative and can be repeated any number of times.<ref name=class/> For example, above <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> is defined as a <code>&lt;term&gt;</code> followed by any number of <code>&lt;addop&gt; &lt;term&gt;</code>.

In some later metalanguages, such as Schorre's [[META II]], the BNF recursive repeat construct is replaced by a sequence operator and target language symbols defined using quoted strings. The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> brackets were removed. Parentheses <code>(</code><code>)</code> for mathematical grouping were added. The <code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> rule would appear in META II as

{{block indent|1=<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
EXPR = TERM $('+' TERM .OUT('ADD') | '-' TERM .OUT('SUB'));
</syntaxhighlight>}}

These changes enabled META II and its derivative programming languages to define and extend their own metalanguage, at the cost of the ability to use a natural language description, metalinguistic variable, language construct description. Many spin-off metalanguages were inspired by BNF.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} See [[META II]], [[TREE-META]], and [[Metacompiler]].

A BNF class describes a language construct formation, with formation defined as a pattern or the action of forming the pattern. The class name expr is described in a natural language as a <code>&lt;term&gt;</code> followed by a sequence <code>&lt;addop&gt; &lt;term&gt;</code>. A class is an abstraction; we can talk about it independent of its formation. We can talk about term, independent of its definition, as being added or subtracted in expr. We can talk about a term being a specific data type and how an expr is to be evaluated having specific combinations of data types. Or even reordering an expression to group data types and evaluation results of mixed types. The natural-language supplement provided specific details of the language class semantics to be used by a compiler implementation and a programmer writing an ALGOL program. Natural-language description further supplemented the syntax as well. The integer rule is a good example of natural and metalanguage used to describe syntax:

{{block indent|<syntaxhighlight lang="bnf">
<integer> ::= <digit>|<integer><digit>
</syntaxhighlight>}}

There are no specifics on white space in the above. As far as the rule states, we could have space between the digits. In the natural language we complement the BNF metalanguage by explaining that the digit sequence can have no white space between the digits. English is only one of the possible natural languages. Translations of the ALGOL reports were available in many natural languages.

The origin of BNF is not as important as its impact on programming language development.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} During the period immediately following the publication of the ALGOL 60 report BNF was the basis of many [[compiler-compiler]] systems. 

Some, like "A Syntax Directed Compiler for ALGOL 60" developed by [[Edgar T. Irons]] and "A Compiler Building System" Developed by Brooker and Morris, directly used BNF. Others, like the [[Schorre Metacompilers]], made it into a programming language with only a few changes. <code>&lt;class name&gt;</code> became symbol identifiers, dropping the enclosing <,> and using quoted strings for symbols of the target language. Arithmetic-like grouping provided a simplification that removed using classes where grouping was its only value. The META II arithmetic expression rule shows grouping use. Output expressions placed in a META II rule are used to output code and labels in an assembly language. Rules in META II are equivalent to a class definitions in BNF. The Unix utility [[yacc]] is based on BNF with code production similar to META II. yacc is most commonly used as a [[parser generator]], and its roots are obviously BNF. 

BNF today is one of the oldest computer-related languages still in use.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Introduction==
A BNF specification is a set of derivation rules, written as
<syntaxhighlight lang="bnf">
 <symbol> ::= __expression__
</syntaxhighlight>

where <[[symbol]]><ref name=class/> is a ''[[nonterminal]]'', and the [[expression (mathematics)|__expression__]] consists of one or more sequences of symbols; more sequences are separated by the [[vertical bar]] "|", indicating a [[alternation (formal language theory)|choice]], the whole being a possible substitution for the symbol on the left. Symbols that never appear on a left side are ''[[Terminal symbol|terminal]]s''. On the other hand, symbols that appear on a left side are ''[[nonterminal symbol|non-terminal]]s'' and are always enclosed between the pair <>.<ref name=class/>

The "::=" means that the symbol on the left must be replaced with the expression on the right.

==Example==
As an example, consider this possible BNF for a U.S. [[address (geography)|postal address]]:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bnf">
 <postal-address> ::= <name-part> <street-address> <zip-part>

      <name-part> ::= <personal-part> <last-name> <opt-suffix-part> <EOL> | <personal-part> <name-part>

  <personal-part> ::= <initial> "." | <first-name>

 <street-address> ::= <house-num> <street-name> <opt-apt-num> <EOL>

       <zip-part> ::= <town-name> "," <state-code> <ZIP-code> <EOL>

<opt-suffix-part> ::= "Sr." | "Jr." | <roman-numeral> | ""
    <opt-apt-num> ::= <apt-num> | ""
</syntaxhighlight> 
This translates into English as: 
* A postal address consists of a name-part, followed by a [[street name|street-address]] part, followed by a [[ZIP Code|zip-code]] part.
* A name-part consists of either: a personal-part followed by a [[last name]] followed by an optional [[Suffix (name)|suffix]] (Jr., Sr., or dynastic number) and [[end-of-line]], or a personal part followed by a name part (this rule illustrates the use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] in BNFs, covering the case of people who use multiple first and middle names and initials).
* A personal-part consists of either a [[first name]] or an [[initial]] followed by a dot.
* A street address consists of a house number, followed by a street name, followed by an optional [[apartment]] specifier, followed by an end-of-line.
* A zip-part consists of a [[town]]-name, followed by a comma, followed by a [[U.S. postal abbreviations|state code]], followed by a ZIP-code followed by an end-of-line.
* An opt-suffix-part consists of a suffix, such as "Sr.", "Jr." or a [[Roman numerals|roman-numeral]], or an empty string (i.e. nothing).
* An opt-apt-num consists of an apartment number or an empty string (i.e. nothing).

Note that many things (such as the format of a first-name, apartment specifier, ZIP-code, and Roman numeral) are left unspecified here. If necessary, they may be described using additional BNF rules.

==Further examples==
BNF's syntax itself may be represented with a BNF like the following:
<syntaxhighlight lang="bnf">
 <syntax>         ::= <rule> | <rule> <syntax>
 <rule>           ::= <opt-whitespace> "<" <rule-name> ">" <opt-whitespace> "::=" <opt-whitespace> <expression> <line-end>
 <opt-whitespace> ::= " " <opt-whitespace> | ""
 <expression>     ::= <list> | <list> <opt-whitespace> "|" <opt-whitespace> <expression>
 <line-end>       ::= <opt-whitespace> <EOL> | <line-end> <line-end>
 <list>           ::= <term> | <term> <opt-whitespace> <list>
 <term>           ::= <literal> | "<" <rule-name> ">"
 <literal>        ::= '"' <text1> '"' | "'" <text2> "'"
 <text1>          ::= "" | <character1> <text1>
 <text2>          ::= '' | <character2> <text2>
 <character>      ::= <letter> | <digit> | <symbol>
 <letter>         ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
 <digit>          ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
 <symbol>         ::=  "|" | " " | "!" | "#" | "$" | "%" | "&" | "(" | ")" | "*" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "/" | ":" | ";" | ">" | "=" | "<" | "?" | "@" | "[" | "\" | "]" | "^" | "_" | "`" | "{" | "}" | "~"
 <character1>     ::= <character> | "'"
 <character2>     ::= <character> | '"'
 <rule-name>      ::= <letter> | <rule-name> <rule-char>
 <rule-char>      ::= <letter> | <digit> | "-"
</syntaxhighlight>

Note that "" is the [[empty string]].

The original BNF did not use quotes as shown in <code>&lt;literal&gt;</code> rule. This assumes that no [[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] is necessary for proper interpretation of the rule.

<code>&lt;EOL&gt;</code> represents the appropriate [[newline|line-end]] specifier (in [[ASCII]], carriage-return, line-feed or both depending on the [[operating system]]). <code>&lt;rule-name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> are to be substituted with a declared rule's name/label or literal text, respectively.

In the U.S. postal address example above, the entire block-quote is a syntax.  Each line or unbroken grouping of lines is a rule; for example one rule begins with <code>&lt;name-part&gt; ::=</code>. The other part of that rule (aside from a line-end) is an expression, which consists of two lists separated by a pipe <code>|</code>.  These two lists consists of some terms (three terms and two terms, respectively).  Each term in this particular rule is a rule-name.

==Variants==
There are many variants and extensions of BNF, generally either for the sake of simplicity and succinctness, or to adapt it to a specific application. One common feature of many variants is the use of [[regular expression]] repetition operators such as <code>*</code> and <code>+</code>. The [[extended Backus–Naur form]] (EBNF) is a common one.

Another common extension is the use of square brackets around optional items. Although not present in the original ALGOL 60 report (instead introduced a few years later in [[International Business Machines|IBM]]'s [[PL/I]] definition), the notation is now universally recognised.

[[Augmented Backus–Naur form]] (ABNF) and Routing Backus–Naur form (RBNF)<ref>[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5511 RBNF].</ref> are extensions commonly used to describe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) [[protocol (computing)|protocol]]s.

[[Parsing expression grammar]]s build on the BNF and [[regular expression]] notations to form an alternative class of [[formal grammar]], which is essentially [[analytic grammar|analytic]] rather than [[generative grammar|generative]] in character.

Many BNF specifications found online today are intended to be human-readable and are non-formal.  These often include many of the following syntax rules and extensions:
* Optional items enclosed in square brackets: <code>[&lt;item-x&gt;]</code>.
* Items existing 0 or more times are enclosed in curly brackets or suffixed with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) such as <code>&lt;word&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; {&lt;letter&gt;}</code> or <code>&lt;word&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; &lt;letter&gt;*</code> respectively.
* Items existing 1 or more times are suffixed with an addition (plus) symbol, <code>+</code>.
* Terminals may appear in bold rather than italics, and non-terminals in plain text rather than angle brackets.
* Where items are grouped, they are enclosed in simple parentheses.

===Software using BNF===
* [[ANTLR]], another parser generator written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
* [[Qlik]] Sense, a BI tool, uses a variant of BNF for scripting
* [[BNF Converter]] (BNFC<ref>{{Citation | url = http://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/ | contribution = BNFC | place = [[Sweden|SE]] | publisher = Chalmers | title = Language technology}}</ref>), operating on a variant called "labeled Backus–Naur form" (LBNF). In this variant, each production for a given non-terminal is given a label, which can be used as a constructor of an [[algebraic data type]] representing that nonterminal. The converter is capable of producing types and parsers for [[abstract syntax]] in several languages, including [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and Java.
