'''Interprovincial migration in Canada''' is the movement by people from one [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province or territory]] to another with the intention of settling, permanently or temporarily, in the new province or territory; it is more-or-less stable over time.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Finnie|first=Ross|date=2004|others=School of Policy Studies at Queen’s University and Business and Labour Market Analysis Division, Statistics Canada|title=Who moves?

The Interprovincial migration levels of each province can be constructed as a way to measure the success of each jurisdiction. The main measurement used is ''net interprovincial migration'', which is simply the difference between residents moving out of a province (out-migration) and the number of residents from other provinces moving into that province (in-migration). Since 1971, the provinces which received the most net cumulative interprovincial migrants (adjusted for population) were [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], while the provinces which had the largest net loss of interprovincial migrants (adjusted for population) were [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Quebec]], and the [[Atlantic Provinces|Atlantic provinces]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/interprovincial-migration-in-canada.pdf|title=Interprovincial Migration in Canada: Quebeckers Vote with Their Feet|website=www.fraserinstitute.org|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Last_best_west.jpg|alt=|thumb|Pamphlet advertising for immigration to [[Western Canada]], {{circa|1910}}]]
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Canadians who left their home province to settle elsewhere usually went to the [[United States]] rather than to other Canadian provinces. In fact, from the early years of confederation to the 1930s, Quebec and the [[maritimes provinces]] experienced a period of [[History of immigration to the United States#1850 to 1930|mass-emigration to the United States]]. From 1860 to 1920, half a million people left the maritimes,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thornton|first=Patricia A.|date=Autumn 1985|title=The Problem of Out-Migration from Atlantic Canada, 1871-1921: A New Look|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/viewPDFInterstitial/12079/12923|journal=[[Acadiensis]]|volume=XV|issue=1|pages=3–34|issn=0044-5851|jstor=30302704}}</ref> and between 1840 and 1930, about 900,000 [[French Canadians]] left [[Quebec]] in order to immigrate to the United States, mainly in [[New England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/leaving.htm|title=French Canadian Emigration to the United States, 1840–1930|author=Bélanger, Damien-Claude|date=23 August 2000|work=Québec History, Claude Bélanger, Marianopolis College|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125200529/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/leaving.htm|archive-date=25 January 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=2007-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/stats/goto-us.htm|title=Emigration to the United States from Canada and Quebec, 1840–1940|last=Bélanger|first=Claude|work=Quebec History|publisher=Marianopolis College|access-date=24 July 2013}}</ref>

However, some French Canadians and Maritimers were also drawn to [[Ontario]] in the 19th century and early 20th century, when the development of mining and forestry resources in the [[Northeastern Ontario|northeastern]] and [[Eastern Ontario|eastern]] regions of the province attracted a large workforce. This migration significantly increased the proportion of francophones in Ontario.<ref>Robert Craig Brown,  and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed'' (1974) pp 253-62</ref> The [[Francophone population of Ontario]] continues to be concentrated mainly in the northeastern and eastern parts of the province, close to the border with Quebec, although smaller pockets of Francophone settlement exist throughout the province.

After Manitoba joined Confederation in [[1870 in Canada|1870]], the new provincial government was controlled by [[English Canadians|Anglo Canadians]]. The agreement for the establishment of the Province had included guarantees that the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] would receive grants of land and that their existing unofficial landholdings would be recognized. These guarantees were largely ignored. New anglophone migrants coming from Ontario were instead given most of the land. Facing this discrimination, the Métis moved in large numbers to what would become Saskatchewan and Alberta.<ref name="sprague2">{{vcite book|author=Sprague, DN|title=Canada and the Métis, 1869–1885|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|location=Waterloo, ON|date=1988|pages=33–67, 89–129|isbn=0-88920-964-2}}</ref>

Starting in [[1871 in Canada|1871]], the Canadian government entered [[Numbered Treaties|multiple treaties]] with [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous nations]] to gain their consent to take their lands "for immigration and settlement" in the area of the former [[Rupert's Land]] (although many of the treaty terms made to get this consent were subsequently violated by Canada).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carr-Steward|first=Sheila|date=2001|title=A Treaty Right to Education|url=http://www.csse-scee.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE26-2/CJE26-2-Carr.pdf|journal=Canadian Journal of Education|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304230030/http://www.csse-scee.ca/CJE/Articles/FullText/CJE26-2/CJE26-2-Carr.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Dominion government then passed the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' in [[1872 in Canada|1872]] to encourage the settlement of the [[Canadian Prairies]], and to help prevent the area from being claimed by the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Administration of Dominion Lands, 1870-1930|last=Lambrecht|first=Kirk N|year=1991}}</ref> The act gave a claimant 160 acres (or 65 hectares) for free, the only cost to the farmer being a $10 administration fee.

Out-emigration from Quebec dramatically spiked in [[1977 in Canada|1977]], one year after the [[Parti Québécois]] won the [[1976 Quebec general election]]s. It spiked again in [[1996 in Canada|1996]], one year after the [[1995 Quebec referendum]]. This second spike was, however, 37.5% the size of the 1977 spike.<ref name=":2" />

== Influences ==

A number of factors have been identified by academic research in influencing interprovincial migration.

=== Demographic factors ===
The odds of a Canadian moving from one province to another is inversely related to the home [[Population of Canada by province and territory|province's population size]]: the larger the province, the less likely a resident is to move away. Interprovincial migration is negatively related to [[Marriage in Canada|marriage]], and the presence of children for both men and women. Younger people also tend to be more mobile than their older counterparts. Men are more likely to move than women, although men's rates of interprovincial migration are declining slightly while women's are holding steadier or rising slightly.<ref name=":0" />

Interprovincial migration is also more common among residents of smaller cities, towns, and especially rural areas than for residents of larger cities. The largest Canadian population centers ([[Greater Toronto Area|Toronto]], [[Greater Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[Greater Montreal|Montréal]] and [[Calgary Metropolitan Region|Calgary]]) also tend to attract the largest amount of interprovincial migrants, and there is a lot of flow between these cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/boc-review-spring13-amirault.pdf|title=Explaining Canada's regional Migration Patterns|last=Amirault|first=David|last2=de Munnik|first2=Daniel|date=Spring 2013|website=www.bankofcanada.ca|publisher=Bank of Canada Review|access-date=2018-12-28|last3=Miller|first3=Sarah}}</ref>

=== Economic factors ===
The economic situation of each province is an important indicator of [[internal migration]] within Canada. It is more likely for people to move out of a province with higher [[Economy of Canada#Unemployment rate|unemployment rate]]. Interprovincial migration is also positively related to the individuals' receipt of [[Employment Insurance#Canada|unemployment insurance]], having no market income, and the receipt of [[social assistance]] (especially for men).<ref name=":0" /> Canadian provinces also tend to lose more people than they gain when their province is in [[recession]]. Alberta, for example, experienced a net loss of people to interprovincial migration from September 2015 to December 2017.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/alberta-gained-more-people-from-interprovincial-migration-than-it-lost-for-first-time-since-oil-downturn|title=Alberta no longer a loser on interprovincial migration {{!}} Edmonton Journal|last=December 21|first=Jonny Wakefield Updated|last2=2017|date=2017-12-21|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>

=== Language ===
Language spoken is a strong predictor of interprovincial migration. Francophone [[Quebeckers]] are among the groups of people which are the least likely to move across provinces.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/reports-statistics/research/interprovincial-migration-french-speaking-immigrants-outside-quebec.html|title=Interprovincial migration of French-speaking immigrants outside Quebec|last=Immigration|first=Refugees and Citizenship Canada|last2=Immigration|first2=Refugees and Citizenship Canada|date=2017-02-06|website=aem|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> Francophones in [[New Brunswick]] are much less likely to move out of province than their anglophone counterparts.<ref name=":4" />

The only group less likely to migrate across province than Francophone quebeckers is francophone immigrants living in Quebec. Inversely, Francophone immigrants living outside Quebec is the group most prone to interprovincial migration, as 9.2% of them move to another province. Over half of Francophones outside Quebec (immigrant and Canada-born) who migrate across provinces choose Quebec as their destination.<ref name=":6" />

=== Literacy ===
[[Literacy]] used to be a significant indicator of interprovincial migration in Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. Anglophone Canadians who could read were more likely to move than their illiterate counterparts. For francophone Quebeckers, however, this was the opposite, as literate unilingual francophones were more likely to stay in Quebec than illiterate unilingual francophones. Literacy had, however, no effet on the likelihood of migration of bilingual Quebeckers.<ref name=":4" />

== Provincial level ==

=== Alberta ===
Over the past five decades, Alberta has had the highest net increase from interprovincial migration of any province. However, it typically experiences population decline during economic downturns, as it did during the 1980s.<ref name=":2" /> [[Petroleum industry in Canada|Oil]] is the main industry driving interprovincial migration to Alberta, as many Canadians move to Alberta to work on the oil fields. Interprovincial migration to Alberta rises and drops dependent of the [[price of oil]]. There was a dramatic reduction after the [[World oil market chronology from 2003#2014|2014 drop in oil prices]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-death-of-the-alberta-dream/|title=The death of the Alberta dream - Macleans.ca|website=www.macleans.ca|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia has also traditionally been gaining from interprovincial migration. Over the last 50 years, British Columbia had 12 years of negative interprovincial immigration: the lowest in the country. The only time the province significantly lost population to this phenomenon was during the 1990s, when it had a negative interprovincial migration for 5 consecutive years.<ref name=":2" />

=== New Brunswick ===
New Brunswick has typically experienced less emigration than its size and economic situation would suggest, probably because of the low rate of emigration of its francophone population.<ref name=":0" /> However, New Brunswick is predicted to continue low or negative population growth in the long term due to interprovincial migration and a low birth rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbjobs.ca/sites/default/files/2017-09-12_implications_of_nb_population_forecasts.pdf|title=The Implications of New Brunswick's Population Forecasts|website=www.nbjobs.ca|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>

Since it started being recorded in 1971, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is the province that has lost the biggest share of its population to interprovincial migration, which was especially high in the 1990s. Out-migration from the province was curtailed in 2008 and net migration stayed positive through 2014, when it again dropped due to bleak finances and rising unemployment (caused by falling oil prices).<ref name=":2" /> With the announcement of the 2016 provincial budget, St. John's ''[[The Telegram|Telegram]]'' columnist Russell Wangersky published the column "Get out if you can", which urged young Newfoundlanders to leave the province to avoid future hardships.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/exodus-newfoundland-and-labrador-s-bleak-finances-fuel-angst-for-the-future-1.3543233|title=Exodus?

=== Nova Scotia ===
From 1971 to 2012, [[Nova Scotia]] had a persistent negative trend in net interprovincial migration. Combined with a declining birth rate, this poses a significant demographic challenge for the province, as its population is projected to decline from 948,000 people in 2011 to 926,000 people in 2038. The destination for Nova Scotia migrants was most often Ontario, until the turn of the 21st century when Alberta became a more popular destination; New Brunswick ranks as a distant third.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rashti|first=Amir Ahmadi|last2=Koops|first2=Adrian|last3=Covey|first3=Spencer|date=Spring 2015|title=The Effects of Capital on Interprovincial Migration: A Nova Scotia Focused Assessment|journal=Dalhousie Journal of Interdisciplinary Management|volume=11|pages=28}}</ref>

=== Ontario ===
Ontario's interprovincial migrations have shifted over the years. It was negative in the 1970s, positive in the 1980s, but then negative again in the 1990s. It returned to positive figures around the time of the turn of the millennium, was consistently in the negatives from 2003 to 2015, then returned to the positives through 2018. Over the period from 1971 to 2015, Ontario was the province which experience the second-lowest levels of interprovincial in-migration and out-migration, second only to Quebec.<ref name=":2" />

=== Prince Edward Island ===
Since 1971, Prince Edward Island mostly had years of positive interprovincial migration. However, in the 2010s, it turned to the negative. This interprovincial migration exceeded all immigration to the province in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/apec-report-immigration-1.3722805|title=Immigration not keeping pace with people leaving P.E.I. {{!}} CBC News|last=Aug 16|first=Kevin Yarr · CBC News · Posted|last2=August 16|first2=2016 11:00 AM AT {{!}} Last Updated|website=CBC|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28|last3=2016}}</ref>

=== Quebec ===
Since it began being recorded in 1971 until 2018, each year Quebec has had negative interprovincial migration, and among the provinces it has experienced the largest net loss of people due to the effect.<ref name=":2" /> Between 1981 and 2017, Quebec lost about 229,700 people below the age of 45 to interprovincial migration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/quebec-losing-young-people-to-interprovincial-migration-report-shows|title=Quebec losing young people to interprovincial migration, report shows {{!}} Montreal Gazette|last=Serebrin|first=Jacob|last2=July 26|first2=Montreal Gazette Updated|date=2018-07-26|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28|last3=2018}}</ref> Per capita, Quebec has lost significantly fewer people than other provinces. This is due to the large population of the province and the very low migration rate of francophone Quebeckers.<ref name=":0" /> However, Quebec receives much fewer than average in-migrants from other provinces.<ref name=":2" />

In Quebec, [[Allophone (Canada)|allo-phones]] are more likely to migrate out of the province than average: between 1996 and 2001, over 19,170 migrated to other provinces; 18,810 of whom migrated to Ontario.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Analytic/companion/lang/tables/migration.cfm |title=Net population gains or losses from interprovincial migration by language group, provinces and territories, 1991-1996 and 1996-2001 |access-date=2018-12-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617104746/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/lang/tables/migration.cfm |archive-date=2008-06-17 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Saskatchewan ===
Inter-provincial migration has long been a demographic challenge for Saskatchewan, and it was often said that "Saskatchewan's most valuable export [was] its young people".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Interprovincial Migration - in the Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan|last=Elliot|first=Doug|publisher=Canadian Plains Research Center, University of Regina|year=2005|location=Regina|pages=483–484}}</ref> The trend reversed in 2006 as the nascent oil [[fracking]] industry started growing in the province, but returned to negative net migration starting in 2013. Most people migrating from Saskatchewan move west to Alberta or British Columbia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4258201/exodus-of-saskatchewan-residents-to-alberta-british-columbia-continues-to-plague-province/|title=Exodus of Saskatchewan residents to Alberta, British Columbia, continues to plague province {{!}} Globalnews.ca|date=2018-06-06|website=globalnews.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229032727/https://globalnews.ca/news/4258201/exodus-of-saskatchewan-residents-to-alberta-british-columbia-continues-to-plague-province/|archive-date=2018-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>
