A term other than ''[[character (computing)|character]]'' is used here because a given character may be represented in different applications by more than one code, and different codes may use different numbers of bits (i.e., different byte sizes). In input-output transmission the grouping of bits may be completely arbitrary and have no relation to actual characters. (The term is coined from ''[[bite]]'', but respelled to avoid accidental mutation to ''bit''.)<br />A ''[[Word (unit)|word]]'' consists of the number of data bits transmitted in parallel from or to memory in one memory cycle. [[Word size]] is thus defined as a structural property of the memory.

{{defn|In [[cryptography]], encryption is the process of [[Data compression|encoding]] information.

Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor. For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a [[pseudo-random]] encryption [[Key (cryptography)|key]] generated by an [[algorithm]]. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.

A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of [[Significant figures|significant digits]] (the [[significand]]) and scaled using an [[exponentiation|exponent]] in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen. A number that can be represented exactly is of the following form:
: <math>\text{significand} \times \text{base}^\text{exponent},</math>
where significand is an [[integer]], base is an integer greater than or equal to two, and exponent is also an integer.

{{term|[[semantics (computer science)|semantics]]}}
{{defn|In [[programming language theory]], semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of [[programming language]]s.

{{term|[[sequence]]}}
{{defn|In [[mathematics]], a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and [[order theory|order]] does matter.  Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order does matter.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').

The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention.  When a symbol is used to denote a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] ''F'' is generally denoted ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (mathematics)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&nbsp;(&nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.}}

Sorting is also often useful for [[Canonicalization|canonicalizing]] data and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

# The output is in nondecreasing order (each element is no smaller than the previous element according to the desired [[total order]]);<!-- confusing; this appears to mean that the output must be in ascending order, which isn't a necessary condition -->
# The output is a [[permutation]] (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

Further, the input data is often stored in an [[Array data type|array]], which allows [[random access]], rather than a list, which only allows [[sequential access]]; though many algorithms can be applied to either type of data after suitable modification.

Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the {{gli|source code|coding}} phase, to form the typical V shape. The V-Model demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of [[Software testing|testing]]. The horizontal and vertical axes represent time or project completeness (left-to-right) and level of abstraction (coarsest-grain abstraction uppermost), respectively.<ref>[[Kevin Forsberg]] and [[Harold Mooz]], "The Relationship of System Engineering to the Project Cycle", in Proceedings of the First Annual Symposium of National Council on System Engineering, October 1991: 57–65.</ref>}}

{{term|[[waterfall model]]}}
{{defn|A breakdown of project activities into linear [[sequence|sequential]] phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialisation of tasks.  The approach is typical for certain areas of [[engineering design]]. In [[software development process|software development]], it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction ("downwards" like a [[waterfall]]) through the phases of conception, initiation, [[analysis]], [[Software design|design]], [[Software construction|construction]], [[Software testing|testing]], [[Implementation|deployment]] and [[software maintenance|maintenance]].}}

{{term|[[WAV|Waveform Audio File Format]]}}
{{ghat|Also '''WAVE''' or '''WAV''' due to its [[filename extension]].}}
{{defn|An [[audio file format]] standard, developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[International Business Machines|IBM]], for storing an audio bitstream on [[personal computer|PCs]]. It is an application of the [[Resource Interchange File Format]] (RIFF) [[bitstream format]] method for storing data in "chunks", and thus is also close to the [[8SVX]] and the [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]] format used on [[Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers, respectively. It is the main format used on [[Microsoft Windows]] systems for raw and typically uncompressed audio. The usual bitstream encoding is the [[linear pulse-code modulation]] (LPCM) format.}}

{{term|[[web crawler]]}}
{{ghat|Also '''spider''', '''spiderbot''', or simply '''crawler'''.}}
{{defn|An {{gli|Internet bot}} that systematically browses the [[World Wide Web]], typically for the purpose of [[Web indexing]] (''web spidering'').}}

{{term|[[Wi-Fi]]}}
{{defn|A family of wireless networking technologies, based on the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards, which are commonly used for [[Wireless LAN|local area network]]ing of devices and [[Internet]] access. ''Wi{{nbh}}Fi'' is a trademark of the non-profit [[Wi-Fi Alliance]], which restricts the use of the term ''Wi-Fi Certified'' to products that successfully complete [[Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations|interoperability]] certification testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Wi_Fi.html|title=What is Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11x)?
