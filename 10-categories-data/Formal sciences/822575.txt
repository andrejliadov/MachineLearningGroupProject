{{short description|The study of chemical cycles of the earth that are either driven by or influence biological activity}}

'''Biogeochemistry''' is the [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] that involves the study of the [[chemistry|chemical]], [[physics|physical]], [[geology|geological]], and [[biology|biological]] processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment (including the [[biosphere]], the [[cryosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[pedosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and the [[lithosphere]]). In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycles]] of [[chemical element]]s, such as [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]], and their interactions with and incorporation into [[life|living things]] transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or influence biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[Sulfur cycle|sulfur]], [[Iron cycle|iron]], and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]] cycles. Biogeochemistry is a [[Systems thinking|systems science]] closely related to [[systems ecology]].

==History==
[[File:RR5009-0006R BU 130-летие со дня рождения В.И.Вернадского.png|thumb|right|Vladimir Vernadsky]]

The founder of biogeochemistry was [[Russia]]n and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] scientist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]  whose 1926 book ''The [[Biosphere]]'',<ref>Vladimir I. Vernadsky, 2007, Essays on Geochemistry & the Biosphere, tr. Olga Barash, Santa Fe, NM, Synergetic Press, {{ISBN|0-907791-36-0}} (originally published in Russian in 1924)</ref> in the tradition of [[Mendeleev]], formulated a physics of the Earth as a living whole. Vernadsky distinguished three spheres, where a sphere was a concept similar to the concept of a [[phase-space]]. He observed that each sphere had its own laws of [[evolution]], and that the higher spheres modified and dominated the lower:

# Abiotic sphere – all the non-living energy and material processes
# Biosphere – the life processes that live within the abiotic sphere
# Nöesis or [[noosphere]] – the sphere of human cognitive process

Human activities (e.g., agriculture and industry) modify the biosphere and abiotic sphere.  In the contemporary environment, the amount of influence humans have on the other two spheres is comparable to a geological force (see [[Anthropocene]]).

==Early development==
The American [[limnology|limnologist]] and [[geochemistry|geochemist]] [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] is credited with outlining the broad scope and principles of this new field. More recently, the basic elements of the discipline of biogeochemistry were restated and popularized by the British scientist and writer, [[James Lovelock]], under the label of the ''[[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Hypothesis]]''.  Lovelock emphasizes a concept that life processes regulate the Earth through [[feedback]] mechanisms to keep it habitable.

==Research==
There are biogeochemistry research groups in many universities around the world.  Since this is a highly inter-disciplinary field, these are situated within a wide range of host disciplines including: [[atmospheric sciences]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[geomicrobiology]], [[environmental chemistry]], [[geology]], [[oceanography]] and [[soil science]].  These are often bracketed into larger disciplines such as [[earth science]] and [[environmental science]].

Many researchers investigate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of [[chemical element]]s such as [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], as well as their [[stable isotope]]s.  The cycles of [[trace element]]s such as the [[trace metal]]s and the [[radionuclide]]s are also studied. This research has obvious applications in the exploration for ore deposits and oil, and in remediation of environmental pollution.

Some important research fields for biogeochemistry include:

* [[scientific model|modelling]] of natural systems
* soil and water acidification recovery processes
* [[eutrophication]] of surface waters
* [[carbon sequestration]]
* [[Environmental remediation]]
* [[global change]]
* [[climate change]]
* biogeochemical [[prospecting]] for ore deposits
* [[Soil chemistry]]
