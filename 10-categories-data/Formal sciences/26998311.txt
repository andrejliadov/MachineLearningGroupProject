The '''BSSN formalism''' is a [[Scientific formalism#In modern physics|formalism]] of [[general relativity]] that was developed by [[Thomas W. Baumgarte|Thomas W. <u>B</u>aumgarte]], [[Stuart L. Shapiro|Stuart L. <u>S</u>hapiro]], Masaru <u>S</u>hibata and Takashi <u>N</u>akamura between 1987 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |title=General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Using BSSN formalism |date=2008-07-28 |author=Jinho Kim |publisher=[[Seoul National University]] |accessdate=2009-10-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66TbfxEOa?url=http://www.ksc.re.kr/kcnr/Presentations/26thNR/26thNRJKim.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 }}</ref> It is a modification of the [[ADM formalism]] developed during the 1950s.

The ADM formalism is a [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism that does not permit stable and long-term numerical simulations. In the BSSN formalism, the ADM equations are modified by introducing auxiliary variables. The formalism has been tested for a long-term evolution of linear gravitational waves and used for a variety of purposes such as simulating the non-linear evolution of [[gravitational wave]]s or the evolution and collision of [[black hole]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/listing/bibliography/pram/Masaru_Shibata/ |title=Status of numerical relativity |date=October 2004 |author=Masaru Shibata |publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] |accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |pmc=4338837 |title=Formation of black hole and emission of gravitational waves |year=2006 |author=Takashi Nakamura |journal=[[Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B]] |volume=82 |issue=9 |pages=311â€“327 |bibcode=2006PJAB...82..311N |doi=10.2183/pjab.82.311 |pmid=25792793}}</ref>
