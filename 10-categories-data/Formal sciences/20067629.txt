In [[computer science]], a '''bridging model''' is an abstract model of a [[computer]] which provides a [[conceptual bridge]] between the physical implementation of the machine and the abstraction available to a [[programmer]] of that machine; in other words, it is intended to provide a common level of understanding between [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] engineers.

A successful bridging model is one which can be efficiently implemented in reality and efficiently targeted by programmers; in particular, it should be possible for a [[compiler]] to produce good code from a typical high-level language. The term was introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]]'s 1990 paper ''A Bridging Model for Parallel Computation'', which argued that the strength of the [[Von Neumann architecture|von Neumann model]] was largely responsible for the success of computing as a whole.<ref name="CACM_Valiant">Leslie G. Valiant, A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, Volume 33 Issue 8, Aug. 1990 [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=79173.79181]</ref> The paper goes on to develop the [[bulk synchronous parallel]] model as an analogous model for [[parallel computing]].
