The '''Mizar system''' consists of a [[formal language]] for writing mathematical definitions and proofs, a [[proof assistant]], which is able to [[Automated proof checking|mechanically check]] proofs written in this language, and a library of [[mathematical formalization|formalized mathematics]], which can be used in the proof of new theorems.<ref name="A Brief Overview of Mizar">{{cite journal | last = Naumowicz | first = Adam |author2=Artur Korniłowicz | title = A Brief Overview of Mizar | journal = Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics | year = 2009 | volume = 5674 | pages = 67–72 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03359-9_5| isbn = 978-3-642-03358-2 }}</ref> The system is maintained and developed by the Mizar Project, formerly under the direction of its founder [[Andrzej Trybulec]].

In 2009 the Mizar Mathematical Library was the largest coherent body of strictly formalized mathematics in existence.<ref name="Arrow">{{cite journal | last = Wiedijk | first = Freek | title = Formalizing Arrow's theorem | journal = [[Sādhanā (journal)|Sādhanā]] | year = 2009 | volume = 34 | pages = 193–220 | issue = 1 | doi=10.1007/s12046-009-0005-1| hdl = 2066/75428 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

== History ==

The Mizar Project was started around 1973 by [[Andrzej Trybulec]] as an attempt to reconstruct mathematical [[vernacular]] so it can be checked by a computer.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Matuszewski | first = Roman |author2=Piotr Rudnicki | title = Mizar: the first 30 years | journal = Mechanized Mathematics and Its Applications | year = 2005 | volume = 4 | url = http://mizar.org/people/romat/MatRud2005.pdf}}</ref> Its current goal, apart from the continual development of the Mizar System, is the collaborative creation of a large library of formally verified proofs, covering most of the core of modern mathematics. This is in line with the influential [[QED manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Wiedijk | first = Freek | title = Mizar | url = https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/mizar/ | accessdate = 24 July 2018}}</ref>

Currently the project is developed and maintained by research groups at [[Białystok University]], Poland, the [[University of Alberta]], Canada, and [[Shinshu University]], Japan. While the Mizar proof checker remains proprietary,<ref name="not-open-source">[http://old.nabble.com/TPHOLs-becomes-ITP-%28fwd%29-td19435554.html#a19493250 Mailing list discussion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009115553/http://old.nabble.com/TPHOLs-becomes-ITP-(fwd)-td19435554.html |date=2011-10-09 }} referring to the close-sourcing of Mizar.</ref> the Mizar Mathematical Library—the sizable body of formalized mathematics that it verified—is licensed open-source.<ref name="library-open-source">[http://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/forum/archive/1104/msg00000.html Mailing list announcement] referring to the open-sourcing of MML.</ref>

Papers related to the Mizar system regularly appear in the peer-reviewed journals of the mathematic formalization academic community. These include ''[[Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric]]'', ''[[Intelligent Computer Mathematics]]'', ''[[Interactive Theorem Proving]]'', ''[[Journal of Automated Reasoning]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Formalized Reasoning]]''.

== Mizar language ==

The distinctive feature of the Mizar language is its readability. As is common in mathematical text, it relies on [[classical logic]] and a [[declarative programming|declarative style]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Geuvers | first = H. | title = Proof assistants: History, ideas and future | journal = Sadhana | year = 2009 | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–25 | doi = 10.1007/s12046-009-0001-5 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Mizar articles are written in ordinary [[ASCII]], but the language was designed to be close enough to the mathematical vernacular that most mathematicians could read and understand Mizar articles without special training.<ref name="A Brief Overview of Mizar"/> Yet, the language enables the increased level of formality necessary for [[automated proof checking]].

For a proof to be admitted, all steps have to be justified either by elementary logical arguments or by citing previously verified proofs.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wiedijk | first = Freek | title = Formal Proof--Getting Started | journal = Notices of the AMS |volume=55 |issue=11 |pages=1408–1414 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101408p.pdf}}</ref> This results in a higher level of rigor and detail than is customary in mathematical textbooks and publications. Thus, a typical Mizar article is about four times as long as an equivalent paper written in ordinary style.<ref>{{cite web | last = Wiedijk | first = Freek | title = The "de Bruijn factor" | url = https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/factor/index.html | accessdate = 24 July 2018}}</ref>

Formalization is relatively labor-intensive, but not impossibly difficult. Once one is versed in the system, it takes about one week of full-time work to have a textbook page formally verified. This suggests that its benefits are now in the reach of applied fields such as [[probability theory]] and [[economics]].<ref name="Arrow"/>

== Mizar Mathematical Library ==

The Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) includes all theorems to which authors can refer in newly written articles. Once approved by the proof checker they are further evaluated in a process of [[peer-review]] for appropriate contribution and style. If accepted they are published in the associated ''Journal of Formalized Mathematics''<ref name="Journal of Formalized Mathematics">[http://fm.mizar.org/ ''Journal of Formalized Mathematics'']</ref> and added to the MML.

=== Breadth ===

As of July 2012, the MML included 1150 articles written by 241 authors.<ref name="MML Query">[http://mmlquery.mizar.org The MML Query search engine]</ref> In aggregate, these contain more than 10,000 formal definitions of mathematical objects and about 52,000 theorems proved on these objects. More than 180 named mathematical facts have so benefited from formal codification.<ref name="MML facts">{{cite web | title = A list of named theorems in the MML | url = http://mmlquery.mizar.org/mmlquery/fillin.php?filledfilename=mml-facts.mqt&argument=number+102 | accessdate = 22 July 2012}}</ref> Some examples are the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]], [[Kőnig's lemma]], [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]], [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] and [[Jordan curve theorem]].

This breadth of coverage has led some<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wiedijk | first = Freek | title = The QED Manifesto Revisited | journal = From Insight to Proof: Festschrift in Honour of Andrzej Trybulec | year = 2007 | volume = 10 | series = [[Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric]] | issue = 23 | url = http://logika.uwb.edu.pl/studies/vol23.html}}</ref> to suggest Mizar as one of the leading approximations to the [[QED manifesto|QED utopia]] of encoding all core mathematics in computer verifiable form.

=== Availability ===

All MML articles are available in [[PDF]] form as the papers of the ''Journal of Formalized Mathematics''.<ref name="Journal of Formalized Mathematics"/> The full text of the MML is distributed with the Mizar checker and can be freely downloaded from the Mizar website. In an ongoing recent project<ref>[https://archive.today/20130222164311/http://foundations.cs.ru.nl/fndswiki/Research/MathWiki The MathWiki project homepage]</ref> the library was also made available in an experimental [[wiki]] form<ref name="MML wiki">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235227/http://mws.cs.ru.nl/mwiki/ The MML in wiki form]</ref> that only admits edits when they are approved by the Mizar checker.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Alama | first = Jesse |author2=Kasper Brink |author3=Lionel Mamane |author4=Josef Urban | title = Large Formal Wikis: Issues and Solutions | journal = Intelligent Computer Mathematics | year = 2011 | volume = 6824 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 133–148 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-22673-1_10| arxiv=1107.3212 | isbn = 978-3-642-22672-4 }}</ref>

The MML Query website<ref name="MML Query"/> implements a powerful search engine for the contents of the MML. Among other abilities, it can retrieve all MML theorems proved about any particular type or operator.<ref>[http://mmlquery.mizar.org/cgi-bin/mmlquery/emacs_search?input=(symbol+to_power+|+notation+|+constructor+|+occur+|+th)+ordered+by+number+of+ref An example of an MML query], yielding all theorems proved on the [[exponent]] operator, by the number of times they are cited in subsequent theorems.</ref><ref>[http://mmlquery.mizar.org/cgi-bin/mmlquery/emacs_search?input=(atleast+*+(+PROB_1:modenot+3+ref)+%7C+th)+ordered+by+number+of+ref Another example of an MML query], yielding all theorems proved on [[sigma field]]s.</ref>

=== Logical structure ===

The MML is built on the axioms of the [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]]. Even though semantically [[implementation of mathematics in set theory|all objects are sets]], the language allows one to define and use [[weak typing|syntactical weak types]]. For example, a set may be declared to be of type '''Nat''' only when its internal structure conforms with a particular list of requirements. In turn, this list serves as the definition of the [[natural numbers]] and the set of all the sets that conform to this list is denoted as '''NAT'''.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Grabowski | first = Adam |author2=Artur Kornilowicz |author3=Adam Naumowicz  | title = Mizar in a Nutshell | journal = [[Journal of Formalized Reasoning]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 152–245 | url = http://jfr.unibo.it/article/view/1980}}</ref> This implementation of types seeks to reflect the way most mathematicians formally think of symbols<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Paul | title = Practical Foundations of Mathematics | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn = 9780521631075 | url = http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/Practical-Foundations/html/ | access-date = 2012-07-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623031212/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pt/Practical-Foundations/html/ | archive-date = 2015-06-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and so streamline codification.
