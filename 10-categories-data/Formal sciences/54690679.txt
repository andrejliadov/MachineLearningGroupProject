'''Computational human modeling''' is an interdisciplinary [[computational science]] that links the diverse fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], and [[computer vision]] with [[machine learning]], [[mathematics]], and [[cognitive psychology]].

Computational human modeling emphasizes descriptions of human for A.I. research and applications.

==Major topics==
Research in computational human modeling can include computer vision studies on identify ([[face recognition]]), attributes (gender, age, skin color), expressions, geometry (3D face modeling, 3D body modeling), and activity (pose, gaze, actions, and social interactions).
