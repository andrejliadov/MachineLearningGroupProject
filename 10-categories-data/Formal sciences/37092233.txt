'''Adaptive sampling''' is a technique used in computational [[molecular biology]] to efficiently simulate [[protein folding]].

==Background==
Proteins spend a large portion – nearly 96% in some cases<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/> – of their [[protein folding|folding]] time "waiting" in various [[thermodynamic free energy]] minima. Consequently, a straightforward simulation of this process would spend a great deal of computation to this state, with the transitions between the states – the aspects of protein folding of greater scientific interest – taking place only rarely.<ref name="Simulation FAQ"/> Adaptive sampling exploits this property to simulate the protein's [[phase space]] in between these states. Using adaptive sampling, molecular simulations that previously would have taken decades can be performed in a matter of weeks.<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/>

==Theory==
If a protein folds through the [[metastable state]]s A -> B -> C, researchers can calculate the length of the transition time between A and C by simulating the A -> B transition and the B -> C transition. The protein may fold through alternative routes which may overlap in part with the A -> B -> C pathway. Decomposing the problem in this manner is efficient because each step can be simulated in parallel.<ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/>

==Applications==
Adaptive sampling is used by the [[Folding@home]] distributed computing project in combination with [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state models]].<ref name="Simulation FAQ"/><ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/>

==Disadvantages==
While adaptive sampling is useful for short simulations, longer trajectories may be more helpful for certain types of biochemical problems.<ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/><ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/>
