{{short description|Political science perspective emphasizing the role of the economy in voting decisions}}
In [[political science]], '''economic voting''' is a theoretical perspective which argues that [[voting|voter behavior]] is heavily influenced by the [[economy|economic]] conditions in their country at the time of the [[election]]. According to the classical form of this perspective, voters tend to vote more in favor of the [[incumbent]] candidate and party when the economy is doing well than when it is doing poorly. This view has been supported by considerable empirical evidence.<ref name="testing">{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis-Beck |first1=Michael Steven |last2=Nadeau |first2=Richard |date=June 2011 |title=Economic voting theory: Testing new dimensions |journal=Electoral Studies |language=en |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=288–294 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.001}}</ref> There is a substantial literature which shows that across the world's democracies, economic conditions shape electoral outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lewis-Beck|first1=Michael S.|last2=Stegmaier|first2=Mary|date=2000-06-01|title=Economic Determinants of Electoral Outcomes|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=3|issue=1|pages=183–219|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.183|doi-access=free|issn=1094-2939}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The economic governance theory proposed by Chanchal Kumar Sharma & Wilfried Swenden suggests that voters largely held national incumbents responsible for economic success or failure under the command-economy paradigm, but state incumbents under the market economy paradigm. As free-market reforms empowered the states to develop their own economic and social policies, subnational and not national political incumbents, often representing regional or state parties, were increasingly held responsible for changes in the ''economic life'' of the states they governed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=Chanchal Kumar|last2=Swenden|first2=Wilfried|date=2019-08-05|title=Economic governance: Does it make or break a dominant party equilibrium?
