In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]], '''circumscription''' is the definition of a [[taxon]], that is, a group of [[organisms]].

One goal of biological taxonomy is to achieve a stable circumscription for every taxon.  Achieving stability is not yet a certainty in most taxa, and many that had been regarded as stable for decades are in upheaval in the light of rapid developments in [[molecular phylogenetics]]. In essence, new discoveries may invalidate the application of irrelevant attributes used in established or obsolete circumscriptions, or present new attributes useful in [[cladistic taxonomy]]. 

An example of a taxonomic group with unstable circumscription is [[Anacardiaceae]], a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plant]]s. Some experts favor a circumscription<ref>[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm Anacardiaceae] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315000926/http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/anacardi.htm |date=March 15, 2005 }} in [http://delta-intkey.com/angio/ L.
