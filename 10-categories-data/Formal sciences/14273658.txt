The '''agent systems reference model''' (ASRM) is a layered, abstract description for [[multiagent systems]].  As such, the [[reference model]]
* provides a taxonomy of terms, concepts and definitions to compare agent systems;
* identifies functional elements that are common in agent systems;
* captures data flow and dependencies among the functional elements in agent systems; and
* specifies assumptions and requirements regarding the dependencies among these elements.

The ASRM differentiates itself from [[technical standard]]s, such as [[Knowledge Interchange Format]], [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]], and those of the [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]] in that it defines the required ''existence'' of components of a multiagent system; standards prescribe how they are ''designed''.

==Technical approach==

The ASRM was technically constructed through [[Reverse engineering|forensic software analysis]] of existing agent-based systems.  Such fielded systems include [[Java Agent DEvelopment framework|JaDE]], [[Cougaar]], [[Extendable mobile agent architecture|EMAA]], [[NOMADS]], [[Retsina (agent framework)|Retsina]], [[A-Globe]], among others.  In so doing, through empirical evidence, the ASRM motivates its functional breakdown of agent-based systems.
