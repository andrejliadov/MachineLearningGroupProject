'''Confrontation analysis''' (also known as '''dilemma analysis''') is an [[operational analysis]] technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of [[drama theory]]. 

It is derived from [[game theory]] but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional ''dilemmas''.<ref name="dilemm">See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=17 definition of Dilemma]</ref>

==Derivation and use==

Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and [[metagame analysis]]. It has been turned to defence,<ref name="dw1">See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-future-of-libya/4553627902 The future of Libya]</ref> political, legal, financial<ref name="ft">"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of "confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst [[Michael Young (former military analyst)|Mike Young's]] [http://www.decisionworkshops.com Decision Workshops]" –  ''Greek Dungeons and German Dragons'', James Macintosh, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 November 2011.</ref> and commercial <ref>See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/letting-agency/4550567082 Letting agency case study]</ref> applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General [[Rupert Smith]]'s book ''[[The Utility of Force]]'' drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.{{quotation|I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further|General Rupert Smith|[[The Utility of Force]] (p.xvi)}}

Confrontation analysis can also be used in a ''decision workshop'' as structure to support role-playing<ref name="ft"/> for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation0.JPG|thumb|361px|left|An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the ''card table''<ref name="ct"/> changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their ''dilemmas''<ref name="dilemm"/>]]
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their ''positions''<ref name="posn">See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=29 definition of Position]</ref> clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a ''card table'' (also known as an options board<ref name="ct">See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=29 definition of Options Board/Card table]</ref>) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their ''position''<ref name="posn"/>) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the ''threatened future''). These interactions produce ''dilemmas''<ref name="dilemm"/> and the ''card table'' changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

Consider the example on the [[:File:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|right]] (Initial Card Table), taken from the [[Bosnian War#1995|1995 Bosnian Conflict]].<ref>This example developed from that described in [[Rupert Smith|Smith R]], Tait A, Howard N (1999) [http://www.decisionmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/warandpeace.pdf Confrontations in War and Peace]. ''Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001</ref> This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The [[Bosnian Serbs]] had [[Bosniak]] enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.

Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages.
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes
*The UN said it would initiate air strikes.  However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table).

Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined ''dilemmas''<ref name="dilemm"/> that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables.  It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem.

In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three ''persuasion dilemmas''<ref name="pd">See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=32 definition of Persuasion Dilemma]</ref> in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a ''rejection dilemma''<ref name="rd">See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=40 definition of Rejection Dilemma]</ref> in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken.

Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas.  It took two actions:

Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage.  This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Second Card Table:<ref name="ct"/> The UN eliminated the Bosnian "hostage" card and brought in an additional, credible "Artillery" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two ''persuasion dilemmas''<ref name="pd"/> and two ''rejection dilemmas''<ref name="rd"/>]]
Secondly, with the addition of the [[Rapid Reaction Force]], and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card "Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible.  The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
* For the UN NOT to use artillery
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them.
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them.
*The UN said it would use artillery.  The Bosnian Serbs believed this.
*The UN said it would use air strikes.  This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation3.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Final Card Table:<ref name="ct"/> The final situation. The Bosnian Serbs modified their position to eliminate their dilemmas. This involved accepting their initial goals as unobtainable]]
Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal.  The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture).

Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word ''confrontation'' should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way.

The ''card tables'' are isomorphic to [[game theory]] models, but are not built with the aim of finding a ''solution''. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.<ref>See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-tables-in-a-decision-works/4557003218 understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis]</ref>
