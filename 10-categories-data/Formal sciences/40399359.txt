A '''Bioeffector'''  is a viable [[microorganism]] or active natural compound which directly or indirectly affects plant performance ([[Biofertilizer]]), and thus has the potential to reduce [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] use in crop production.<ref>[http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/fileadmin/tagungen/03_PPPHE/Doku/2014/MinutesPPPHE2014.pdf Minutes of the 6th International Symposium Plant Protection and Plant Health in Europe, May 2014 Braunschweig, Germany]</ref>

== Types ==
Bioeffectors have a direct or indirect effect on plant performance by influencing the functional implementation or activation of biological mechanisms, particularly those interfering with soil-plant-microbe interactions.<ref>V. Römheld, G. Neumann (2006): ''The Rhizosphere: Contributions of the soil-root interface to sustainable soil systems''. In: N. Uphoff, N., N. A. S. Ball et al. (Hg.), ''Biological Approaches to Sustainable Soil Systems'', S. 92–107, CRC-Press, Oxford, UK.</ref>
In contrast to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, the effectiveness of bioeffectors is not based on a substantial direct input of mineral plant nutrients, either in inorganic or organic forms.

*Products in use are:
** Microbial residues,
** Composting and fermentation products,
** Plant and algae extracts
*Bioeffector-preparations (''bio-agents'') as ready-formulated products are applied:
** with the purpose of stimulating plant growth (bio-stimulants),
** to improve plant nutrient acquisition (bio-fertilizers),
** to protect plants from [[pathogens]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]] ([[Biological pest control|bio-control agents]])
** or generally to advance cropping efficiency; they can contain one or more bio-effectors along with other substances”<ref>Bakonyi N., Donath S., Weinmann M., Neumann G., [[Torsten Müller (agroscientist)|Müller T.]], [[Volker Roemheld|Römheld V.]] (2008): Assessing commercial bio-fertilisers for improved phoshorus availability. Use of rapid screening tests. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pflanzenernährung 2008</ref>
*Well established bioeffectors with documented positive results in the field level are:
** [[Rhizobia]] strains for soil or seed inoculation as a prerequisite for symbiotic N2-fixation when establishing new legume species or varieties.
** positive effects of [[mycorrhiza]] inoculation for soils with a (temporarily) low potential for natural root mycorrhization.
** sufficient mycorrhization enhances nutrient (P) and water uptake and increases resistance to pathogenic fungi.
*Further mechanisms for the positive impact of bioeffectors on plant growth have postulated, promising a high potential for resource preservation due to reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use:
** Active nutrient mobilisation by exudation of acids and carboxylates (e.g. P-mobilisation),
** exudation of micro-nutrient mobilising siderophores/chelates (e.g. Fe<sup>3+</sup>),
** reduction of trace elements from less soluble oxidised to highly soluble reduced forms (e.g. Fe<sup>3+</sup> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>4+</sup> to Mn<sup>2+</sup>),
** associative/non-symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation, protective antagonism to plant pathogens,
** enhancement of mycorrhizal infection and growth, and stimulating hormonal effects.

== Research and Public Dissemination ==
Under the Acronym ''Biofector'' the European Union supports the Research of Bioeffectors under the leadership of the [[University of Hohenheim]]. Coordinator [[Guenter Neumann (agricultural scientist)|Guenter Neumann]], Projectmembers: [[Jiří Balík]], [[Borbala Biro]], [[Karl Fritz Lauer]], [[Uwe Ludewig]], [[Torsten Müller (agroscientist)|Torsten Müller]], [[Alessandro Piccolo (agricultural scientist)|Alessandro Piccolo]], [[Manfred G. Raupp]], [[Kornelia Smalla]], [[Pavel Tlustoš]], [[Markus Weinmann]].

The results of the project will be evaluated by the members of the [[Association Biostimulants in Agriculture]] (ABISTA) and provided agriculture for use and EU institutions for the legislative and registration procedures.<ref>[http://www.biostimulants.info/ Webpage Biostimulants Association]</ref> 

Other Biostimulants Organisations are [[European Biostimulant Industry Council]], [[International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association]] and [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]].
