{{short description|In combinatorics, the autocorrelation of a word is the set of periods of this word}}

In [[combinatorics]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the autocorrelation of a [[word (group theory)|word]] is the set of periods of this word. More precisely, it is a sequence of values which indicate how much the end of a word looks likes the beginning of a word. This value can be used to compute, for example, the average value of the first occurrence of this word in a random string.

==Definition==
In this article, ''A'' is an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]], and <math>w=w_1\dots w_n</math> a [[Word (group theory)|word]] on ''A'' of length ''n''. The autocorrelation of <math>w</math> can be defined as the [[correlation (formal language)|correlation]] of <math>w</math> with itself. However, we redefine this notion below.

===Autocorrelation vector===
The autocorrelation vector of <math>w</math> is <math>c=(c_0,\dots,c_{n-1})</math>, with <math>c_i</math> being 1 if the [[Substring#Prefix|prefix]] of length <math>n-i</math> equals the [[Substring#Suffix|suffix]] of length <math>n-i</math>, and with <math>c_i</math> being 0 otherwise. That is <math>c_i</math> indicates whether <math>w_{i+1}\dots w_n=w_1\dots w_{n-i}</math>.

For example, the autocorrelation vector of <math>aaa</math> is <math>(1,1,1)</math> since, clearly, for <math>i</math> being 0, 1 or 2, the prefix of length <math>n-i</math> is equal to the suffix of length <math>n-i</math>. The autocorrelation vector of <math>abb</math> is <math>(1,0,0)</math> since no strict prefix is equal to a strict suffix. Finally, the autocorrelation vector of <math>aabbaa</math> is 100011, as shown in the following table:

Note that <math>c_0</math> is always equal to 1, since the prefix and the suffix of length <math>n</math> are both equal to the word <math>w</math>. Similarly, <math>c_{n-1}</math> is 1 if and only if the first and the last letters are the same.



===Autocorrelation polynomial===
The autocorrelation polynomial of <math>w</math> is defined as <math>c(z)=c_0z^0+\dots+c_{n-1}z^{n-1}</math>. It is a polynomial of degree at most <math>n-1</math>. 

For example, the autocorrelation polynomial of <math>aaa</math> is <math>1+z+z^2</math> and the autocorrelation polynomial of <math>abb</math> is <math>1</math>. Finally, the autocorrelation polynomial of <math>aabbaa</math> is <math>1+z^4+z^5</math>.

==Property==
We now indicate some properties which can be computed using the autocorrelation polynomial.

===First occurrence of a word in a random string===
Suppose that you choose an infinite sequence <math>s</math> of letters of <math>A</math>, randomly, each letter with probability <math>\frac{1}{|A|}</math>, where <math>|A|</math> is the number of letters of <math>A</math>. Let us call <math>E</math> the expectation of the first occurrence of <math>m</math> in <math>s</math>. Then <math>E</math> equals <math>|A|^nc\left(\frac{1}{|A|}\right)</math>. That is, each subword <math>v</math> of <math>w</math> which is both a prefix and a suffix causes the average value of the first occurrence of <math>w</math> to occur <math>|A|^{|v|}</math> letters later. Here <math>|v|</math> is the length of <math>|v|</math>.

For example, over the binary alphabet <math>A=\{a,b\}</math>, the first occurrence of <math>aa</math> is at position <math>2^2(1+\frac 12)=6</math>  while the average first occurrence of <math>ab</math> is at position <math>2^2(1)=4</math>. Intuitively, the fact that the first occurrence of <math>aa</math> is later than the first occurrence of <math>ab</math> can be explained in two ways:
*We can consider, for each position <math>p</math>, what are the requirement for <math>w</math>'s first occurrence to be at <math>p</math>.
**The first occurrence of <math>ab</math> can be at position 1 in only one way in both case. If <math>s</math> starts with <math>w</math>. This has probability <math>\frac14</math> for both considered values of <math>w</math>.
**The first occurrence of <math>ab</math> is at  position 2 if the prefix of <math>s</math> of length 3 is <math>aab</math> or is <math>bab</math>. However, the first occurrence of <math>aa</math> is at position 2 if and only if the prefix of <math>s</math> of length 3 is <math>baa</math>.  (Note that the first occurrence of <math>aa</math> in <math>aaa</math> is at position 1.). 
**In general, the number of prefixes of length <math>n+1</math> such that the first occurrence of <math>aa</math> is at position <math>n</math> is smaller for <math>aa</math> than for <math>ba</math>. This explain why, on average, the first <math>aa</math> arrive later than the first <math>ab</math>.
*We can also consider the fact that the average number of occurrences of <math>w</math> in a random string of length <math>l</math> is <math>|A|^{l-n}</math>. This number is independent of the autocorrelaction polynomial. An occurrence of <math>w</math> may overlap another occurrence in different ways. More precisely, each 1 in its autocorrelaction vector correspond to a way for occurrence to overlap. Since many occurrences of <math>w</math> can be packed together, using overlapping, but the average number of occurrences does not change, it follows that the distance between two non-overlapping occurrences is greater when the autocorrelaction vector contains many 1's.


===Ordinary generating functions===
Autocorrelation polynomials allows to give simple equations for the [[ordinary generating functions]] (OGF) of many natural questions.

*The OGF of the languages of words not containing  <math>w</math> is <math>\frac{c(z)}{z^n+(1-|A|z)c(z)}</math>.
*The OGF of the languages of words containing  <math>w</math> is <math>\frac{z^n}{(1-|A|z)(z^n+(1-|A|z)c(z))}</math>. 
*The OGF of the languages of words containing a single occurrence of <math>w</math>, at the end of the word is <math>\frac{z^n}{z^{n}+(1-|A|z)c(z)}</math>.
