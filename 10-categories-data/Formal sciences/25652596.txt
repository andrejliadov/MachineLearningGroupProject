Climax species, also called '''late [[Sere (ecology)|seral]]''', '''late-successional''', '''[[K-selected]]''' or '''equilibrium''' species, are [[plant]] [[species]] that can germinate and grow with limited resources, like low-sun exposure or low water availability.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal| vauthors = Shimano K |date=2000-02-01|title=A power function for forest structure and regeneration pattern of pioneer and climax species in patch mosaic forests |journal=Plant Ecology|language=en|volume=146|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1023/A:1009867302660|issn=1573-5052}}</ref> They are the species within [[Ecological succession|forest succession]] that are more adapted to stable and predictable environments, and will remain essentially unchanged in terms of species composition for as long as a site remains undisturbed.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Wehenkel C, Bergmann F, Gregorius HR |date=2006-07-01|title=Is there a trade-off between species diversity and genetic diversity in forest tree communities? |journal=Plant Ecology|language=en|volume=185|issue=1|pages=151–161|doi=10.1007/s11258-005-9091-2 }}</ref>  

The [[Seedling|seedlings]] of climax species can grow in the shade of the parent trees, ensuring their dominance indefinitely. The presence of climax species can also reduce the prevalence of other species  within an ecosystem.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Do HT, Grant JC, Zimmer HC, Trinh BN, Nichols JD | title = Site conditions for regeneration of climax species, the key for restoring moist deciduous tropical forest in Southern Vietnam | journal = PloS One | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = e0233524 | date = 2020-05-29 | pmid = 32469962 | pmc = 7259571 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0233524 }}</ref> However, a [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], such as fire, may kill the climax species, allowing [[Pioneer species|pioneer]] or earlier successional species to re-establish for a time.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Wehenkel C, Bergmann F, Gregorius HR |date=2006-07-01|title=Is there a trade-off between species diversity and genetic diversity in forest tree communities? |journal=Plant Ecology|language=en|volume=185|issue=1|pages=151–161|doi=10.1007/s11258-005-9091-2|issn=1573-5052}}</ref> They are the opposite of [[pioneer species]], also known as [[Ruderal species|ruderal]], fugitive, opportunistic or [[R-selected]] species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown S, Dockery J, Pernarowski M | title = Traveling wave solutions of a reaction diffusion model for competing pioneer and climax species | journal = Mathematical Biosciences | volume = 194 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–36 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15836862 | doi = 10.1016/j.mbs.2004.10.001 }}</ref>  

Given the prevailing ecological conditions, climax species dominate the [[climax community]]. When the pace of succession slows down as the result of [[ecological homeostasis]], the maximum permitted [[biodiversity]] is reached.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Ernest SK | chapter = Homeostasis|date= January 2008 | title = Encyclopedia of Ecology|pages=1879–1884| veditors = Jørgensen SE, Fath BD |place=Oxford|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-008045405-4.00507-3|isbn=978-0-08-045405-4 }}</ref> Their reproductive strategies and other adaptive characteristics can be considered more sophisticated than those of opportunistic species.<ref name=":02">{{cite journal| vauthors = Shimano K |date=2000-02-01|title=A power function for forest structure and regeneration pattern of pioneer and climax species in patch mosaic forests |journal=Plant Ecology|language=en|volume=146|issue=2|pages=205–218|doi=10.1023/A:1009867302660|issn=1573-5052}}</ref>

Through [[negative feedback]], they adapt themselves to specific environmental conditions. Climax species are mostly found in forests. Climax species, closely controlled by [[carrying capacity]], follow [[K strategy|K strategies]], wherein species produce fewer numbers of potential offspring, but invest more heavily in securing the reproductive success of each one to the micro-environmental conditions of its specific [[ecological niche]].  Climax species might be [[Semelparity and Iteroparity|iteroparous]], [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption efficient]] and [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]].<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = McShaffrey D | publisher = Marietta College | url = http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html | title = Relationships Among Species | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090616010027/http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html | archive-date = 16 June 2009 }}</ref>

==Disputed term==
The idea of a climax species has been criticized in recent ecological literature.<ref>[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm Results, Analysis of Timberland Owned by San Jose Water Company] 2007-04-27</ref>  Any assessment of successional states depends on assumptions about the natural fire regime.  But the idea of a dominant species is still widely used in [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] programs and [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California Department of Forestry]] literature.

==Examples==

[[Picea glauca|White spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') is an example of a climax species in the northern forests of North America due to its ability to adapt to resource scarce, stable conditions, it dominates Northern forest ecosystem in the absence of a disturbance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Picea glauca|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/picgla/all.html|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.fs.fed.us}}</ref>

Other examples of climax species in old-growth forests:
*[[Tsuga canadensis|Canadian hemlock]]
*[[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]]
*[[Abies concolor|White fir]]
*[[Sloanea woollsii|Yellow carabeen]]
*[[Blue grama]]
*[[Douglas fir]]
*[[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast redwood]]
*[[European beech]]
