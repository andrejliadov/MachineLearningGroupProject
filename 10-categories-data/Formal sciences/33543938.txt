==Philosophy==
===Nature===
* [[Definitions of mathematics]] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
* [[Language of mathematics]] is the system used by [[mathematician]]s to communicate [[Mathematics|mathematical]] ideas among themselves, and is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2019-08-01|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/language/MathIsLanguage.shtml|title=Mathematics Is a Language|last=Bogomolny|first=Alexander |author-link=Alexander Bogomolny|website=www.cut-the-knot.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>
* [[Philosophy of mathematics]] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.
:* [[Classical mathematics]] refers generally to the mainstream approach to mathematics, which is based on classical [[logic]] and [[ZFC set theory]].
:* [[Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)|Constructive mathematics]] asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists. In classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption.
:* [[Impredicativity|Predicative mathematics]]

===Mathematics is===
* An [[academic discipline]] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* A [[formal science]] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

===Concepts===
* [[Mathematical object]] {{emdash}} an [[abstract concept]] in [[mathematics]]; an ''object'' is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do [[deductive reasoning]] and [[mathematical proof]]s. Each branch of mathematics has its own objects.{{efn|For a partial list of objects, see [[Mathematical object]].}}{{efn|See [[Object (philosophy)|Object]] and [[Abstract and concrete]] for further information on the philosophical foundations of objects.}}
* [[Mathematical structure]] {{emdash}} a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g., [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]], [[Relation (math)|relation]], [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], [[Topology#Topologies on sets|topology]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/#structure|title=The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon — Mathematical Structure|date=2019-08-01|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> A partial list of possible structures are [[Measure theory|measures]], [[algebraic structure]]s ([[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, etc.), [[Topology|topologies]], [[Metric space|metric structures]] ([[Geometry|geometries]]), [[Order theory|orders]], [[Event structure|events]], [[equivalence relation]]s, [[differential structure]]s, and [[Category (category theory)|categories]].

:*[[Elementary arithmetic]] is the part of arithmetic which deals with basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
:*[[Modular arithmetic]] 
:*[[Second-order arithmetic]] is a collection of axiomatic systems that formalize the natural numbers and their subsets.
