'''Micro x-ray fluorescence''' (''µXRF'') is an elemental analysis technique that relies on the same principles as [[x-ray fluorescence]] (''XRF''). The difference is that micro x-ray fluorescence has a spatial resolution with a diameter many orders of magnitude smaller than conventional XRF. While a smaller excitation spot can be achieved by restricting x-ray beam using a pinhole aperture, this method blocks much of the x-ray [[flux]] which has an adverse effect on the sensitivity of trace [[elemental analysis]].<ref>S.

==Application in forensic science==

'''Micro x-ray fluorescence''' is among the newest technologies used to detect [[fingerprint]]s. It is a new visualization technique which rapidly reveals the elemental composition of a sample by irradiating it with a thin beam of X-rays without disturbing the sample. It was discovered recently by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The newly discovered technique was then first revealed at the 229th national meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] (March, 2005). This new discovery could prove to be very beneficial to the law enforcement world, because it is expected that ''µXRF'' will be able to detect the most complex molecules in fingerprints.<ref>Bernstein, Michael, [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-03/acs-fv030805.php], ''New fingerprint visualization method uses X-rays to reveal missing clues'' 13 Mar 2005 accessed(14 Oct 2008)</ref>

Michael Bernstein of the American Chemical Society describes how the process works "Salts such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]] excreted in sweat are sometimes present in detectable quantities in fingerprints. Using µXRF, the researchers showed that they could detect the sodium, potassium and chlorine from such salts. And since these salts are deposited along the patterns present in a fingerprint, an image of the fingerprint can be visualized producing an elemental image for analysis." This basically means that we can “see” a fingerprint because the salts are deposited mainly along the patterns present in a fingerprint.<ref>Worley, Christopher, {{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15248.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184241/http://www.aip.org/dbis/stories/2006/15248.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 }}, ''American Institute of Physics'' 12 Jan 2006 accessed(14 Oct 2008)</ref>

Since ''µXRF'' technology uses [[X-ray]] technology to detect fingerprints, instead of traditional techniques, the image comes out much clearer. Traditional fingerprints are performed by a technique using powders, liquids or vapors to add color to the fingerprint so it can be distinguished. But sometimes this process may alter the fingerprint or may not be able to detect some of the more complex molecules.

Another µXRF application in forensics is [[Gunshot residue|GSR (gunshot residue)]] determination. Some specific elements, as antimony, barium and lead, can be identified on a cotton passed on the hands and clothes of the suspect of using a gun.
