'''Arationality''' is the state or characteristic of being arational, of being outside the [[Domain_of_discourse|domain]] of [[reason]]. The term is distinct from [[irrationality]], which describes a state that goes ''against'' reason rather than beyond it. In this regard, that of going beyond reason, arationality is also contrary to [[positivism]], the belief that reality can be understood rationally.<ref name="Helminiak">Daniel A. Helminiak.

Arationality is also identified with certain pre-modern modes of thinking, including magic and ritual.<ref name="Helminiak"/>

== Arationality and novelty ==

The concept of arationality can be viewed in relation to the question of [[novelty]].<ref> of how new things come into being.

}}</ref> A new song for instance can always be reduced to the musical notes that compose it, all of which preexisted the song's creation. But despite being composed of "old" things (musical notes), one could still ask: to what extend did something new come into existence when the song was first composed. A real theory of novelty then, i.e. a theory that can account for "newness", should be able to show how things come into being without first reducing them to things that already are. To avoid this [[reductionism|reductionist]] trap we might need to go beyond the very methods that work by way of reduction, i.e. [[Scientific_method|scientific reason]] and [[Logic|formal logic]]. A true theory of novelty therefore might need to acknowledge in the creative process, whether artistic or physical, an arational source.
