The distinction between the quantitative exact sciences and those sciences which deal with the causes of things is due to [[Aristotle]], who distinguished mathematics from natural philosophy and considered the exact sciences to be the "more natural of the branches of mathematics."<ref name = "Grant_42">{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | date = 2007 | title = A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | pages = 42–43 | isbn = 9781139461092 }}</ref>  [[Thomas Aquinas]] employed this distinction when he pointed out that astronomy explains the [[spherical Earth|spherical shape of the Earth]] by mathematical reasoning while physics explains it by [[material cause]]s.<ref>{{Citation | last = Aquinas | first = Thomas | author-link = Thomas Aquinas | title = Summa Theologica | at = Part I, Q. 1, Art. 1, Reply 2 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1001.htm#1 | access-date = 3 September 2016 | quote = For the astronomer and the physicist both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth, for instance, is round: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e. abstracting from matter), but the physicist by means of matter itself. }}</ref>  This distinction was widely, but not universally, accepted until the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th century.<ref name = "Grant_303">{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | date = 2007 | title = A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | pages = 303–305 | isbn = 9781139461092 }}</ref>  [[Edward Grant]] has proposed that a fundamental change leading to the new sciences was the unification of the exact sciences and physics by [[Kepler]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and others, which resulted in a quantitative investigation of the physical causes of natural phenomena.<ref name = "Grant_312">{{Citation | last = Grant | first = Edward | author-link = Edward Grant | date = 2007 | title = A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | pages = 303, 312–313 | isbn = 9781139461092 }}</ref>
