'''Financial econometrics'''  is the application of statistical methods to financial [[market data]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic) |date=2014 |title=Introductory Econometrics for Finance |edition=3rd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=9781107661455}}</ref> Financial econometrics is a branch of [[financial economics]], in the field of [[economics]]. Areas of study include capital markets,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=John |authorlink1=John Y. Campbell|last2=Lo |first2=Andrew |authorlink2=Andrew Lo |last3=MacKinlay|first3=Andrew|date=1997 |title=The Econometrics of Financial Markets |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |ISBN=9780691043012}}</ref> financial institutions, corporate finance and corporate governance. Topics often revolve around asset valuation of individual stocks, bonds, derivatives, currencies and other financial instruments.

It differs from other forms of [[econometrics]] because the emphasis is usually on analyzing the prices of financial assets traded at competitive, liquid markets.

People working in the finance industry or researching the finance sector often use econometric techniques in a range of activities â€“ for example, in support of [[Investment management|portfolio management]] and in the valuation of securities. Financial econometrics is essential for [[risk management]] when it is important to know how often 'bad' investment outcomes are expected to occur over future days, weeks, months and years.

==Topics==

The sort of topics that financial econometricians are typically familiar with include:
* analysis of high-frequency price observations
* [[arbitrage pricing theory]]
* asset price dynamics<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Taylor (economist) |date=2005 |title=Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |ISBN=9780691134796}}</ref>
*  [[modern portfolio theory|optimal asset allocation]]
* [[cointegration]]
* [[event study]]
* nonlinear financial models such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Wang, Peijie|year=2003|title=Financial Econometrics: Methods and Models|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-22455-0}}</ref>
* [[realized variance]]
* fund performance analysis such as [[returns-based style analysis]]
* tests of the [[random walk hypothesis]]
* the [[capital asset pricing model]]
* the term structure of interest rates (the [[yield curve]])
* [[value at risk]]
*  [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] estimation techniques such as [[exponential smoothing]] models and [[RiskMetrics]]

==Research community==

The Society for Financial Econometrics (SoFiE)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sofie.stern.nyu.edu/ |title={title} |access-date=2012-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117124501/http://sofie.stern.nyu.edu/ |archive-date=2012-11-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> is a global network of academics and practitioners dedicated to sharing research and ideas in the fast-growing field of financial econometrics. It is an independent non-profit membership organization, committed to promoting and expanding research and education by organizing and sponsoring conferences, programs and activities at the intersection of finance and econometrics, including links to macroeconomic fundamentals. SoFiE was co-founded by [[Robert F. Engle]] and [[Eric Ghysels]].

Premier-quality journals which publish financial econometrics research include [[Econometrica]], [[Journal of Econometrics]] and [[Journal of Business & Economic Statistics]]. The Journal of Financial Econometrics<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/ |title={title} |access-date=2009-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124061843/http://jfec.oxfordjournals.org/ |archive-date=2009-11-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> has an exclusive focus on financial econometrics. It is edited by Federico Bandi and Andrew Patton, and it has a close relationship with SoFiE.

The [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] has been awarded for significant contribution to financial econometrics; in 2003 to [[Robert F. Engle]] "for methods of analyzing economic time series with time-varying volatility" and [[Clive Granger]] "for methods of analyzing economic time series with common trends"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2003/ |title={title} |access-date=2017-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602020545/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2003/ |archive-date=2017-06-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> and in 2013 to [[Eugene Fama]], [[Lars Peter Hansen]] and [[Robert J.
