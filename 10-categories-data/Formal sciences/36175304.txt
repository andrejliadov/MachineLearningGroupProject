{{short description|Actuarial mathematical models used in assessing the impact of the epidemic in South Africa}}

The '''Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS models''', also known as '''ASSA AIDS models''', are a series of [[mathematical model]]s developed to assist the actuarial profession and the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa]] in assessing and addressing the impact of the [[AIDS|HIV and AIDS]] epidemic in [[South Africa]].<ref name=IMF/><ref>[http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm South Africa HIV AIDS Statistics and Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS Models]</ref><ref>[http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx Actuarial Society of South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104031521/http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx |date=January 4, 2009 }}</ref> The models have been developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]]<ref>[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm AIDS Committee Publications till date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701024530/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm |date=July 1, 2012 }}</ref> of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|Society]] and the Center for Actuarial Research (CARe) at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm ASSA AIDS Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090613/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm |date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1996 the first and earliest version of ASSA AIDS model ASSA500 was developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]] of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|society]],<ref>[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html Harvard School of Public Health Report on ASSA HIV AIDS Models ]</ref><ref>[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm ASSA500 the first model of AIDS Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601041036/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}.</ref> [[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|100px|thumb|A red ribbon use as logo of ASSA AIDS Committee]] While the ASSA2008 model is the most recent version of ASSA AIDS and demographic model which was released in March 2011.<ref>[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm The ASSA2008 model the most recent model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410192403/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm |date=April 10, 2012 }}</ref>  The models have assisted insurers and those insured to have fair and balanced insurance policies in a country ravaged by AIDS.<ref>http://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/Portals/1/Documents/fa4bedae-e09d-4ed6-a3aa-47f7a0369ff7.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>http://www.cover.co.za/long-term-insurance/still-a-lot-of-life-in-life</ref>

A joint task team of the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to estimate the impact of extending the life of AIDS patients.<ref name=IMF>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_LcnKavtYgC&q=ASSA+AIDS+model&pg=PA119|title= Post-Apartheid South Africa: The First Ten Years|accessdate=25 June 2012|author= Michael Nowak and Luca Antonio Ricci, eds|date= 12 January 2006|publisher= International Monetary Fund, 2006, p. 119 |isbn= 9781451955231}}</ref>

ASSA is one of only two models used in South Africa;<ref name=IMF/> both are capable of making projections on the progression of the epidemic through an interaction of many factors. Four population risk groups are included, along with assumptions about sexual behaviour, rates of infection, conception rates, the median duration to mortality of those with HIV/AIDS, and the rates of transmission between mother and child.<ref name=IMF/> The impact of drug treatments at birth and while nursing, enhanced STD treatment, and risk avoidance is projected by a lower rate scenario<ref name=IMF/> The model makes provisions for migration of the population, separate modeling of racial groups, and separate modeling of provincial populations.<ref name=IMF/>

A study by the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to project a positive result for the increased implementation of [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARV) in the country,<ref name=IMF/> although their cost is a problem.<ref>[http://www.pmg.org.za/report/20100504-public-hearings-provincial-departments-helath-under-spending-hospital Public Hearings with National Treasury, Department of Health on under-expenditure of Hospital Revitalisation, Comprehensive HIV and AIDS, and Forensic Pathology Grants]</ref>
