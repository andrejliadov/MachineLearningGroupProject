'''McGuireâ€™s Psychological Motivations''' is a classification system that organizes theories of motives into 16 categories.  The system helps [[marketer]]s to isolate motives likely to be involved in various [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] situations.

==Categories==

McGuire first divided the motivation into two main categories using two criteria:
# Is the mode of motivation [[cognitive]] or [[affective]]?
# Is the motive focused on preservation of the [[status quo]] or on growth?

Then for each division in each category he stated there is two more basic elements.
# Is this behavior actively initiated or in response to the [[Social environment|environment]]?
# Does this behavior help the individual achieve a new internal or a new external [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] to the environment?
