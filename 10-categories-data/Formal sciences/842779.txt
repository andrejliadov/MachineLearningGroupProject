'''''Calculating Space''''' ({{lang-de|Rechnender Raum}}) is [[Konrad Zuse]]'s 1969 book on [[automata theory]]. He proposed that all processes in the [[universe]] are computational.<ref name=mainzer-chua>{{cite book | first1=Klaus | last1=Mainzer | first2=Leon | last2=Chua | title=The Universe as Automaton: From Simplicity and Symmetry to Complexity | page=6 | publisher=Springer |date=September 2011}}</ref> This view is known today as [[simulation hypothesis]], [[digital physics]] or [[pancomputationalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Vincent|title=Pancomputationalism: Theory or Metaphor?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242700683_Pancomputationalism_Theory_or_Metaphor|journal=Philosophy, computing and information science|pages=213-221}}</ref> Zuse proposed that the [[universe]] is being computed by some sort of [[cellular automaton]] or other discrete computing machinery,<ref name=mainzer-chua/> challenging the long-held view that some physical laws are continuous by nature. He focused on cellular automata as a possible substrate of the computation, and pointed out that the classical notions of [[entropy]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|its growth]] do not make sense in deterministically computed universes. Zuse's thesis was later expanded by German computer scientist [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] in his book ''Algorithimic Theories of Everything''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen Schmidhuber|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0011122.pdf|title=Algorithimic Theories of Everything}}</ref>

[[Bell's theorem]] is sometimes thought to contradict Zuse's hypothesis, but it is not applicable to [[deterministic universe]]s, as Bell himself pointed out. Similarly, while [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]] limits in a fundamental way what an observer can observe, when the observer is himself a part of the universe he is trying to observe, that principle does not rule out Zuse's hypothesis, which views any observer as a part of the hypothesized deterministic process. So far there is no unambiguous physical evidence against the possibility that "everything is just a computation," and a great deal has been written about [[digital physics]] since Zuse's book appeared.
