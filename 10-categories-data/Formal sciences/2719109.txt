'''Channel use''' is a quantity used in [[signal processing]] or [[telecommunication]] related to [[symbol rate]] and [[channel capacity]]. Capacity is measured in bits per input symbol into the channel (bits per channel use). If a symbol enters the channel every ''T''<sub>s</sub> seconds (for every symbol period a symbol is transmitted) the channel capacity in [[bits per second]] is ''C/T''<sub>s</sub>. The phrase "1 [[bit]] per channel use" denotes the transmission of 1 symbol (of duration ''T''<sub>s</sub>) containing 1 data bit.
