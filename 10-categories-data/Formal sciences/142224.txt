'''''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''''' (also known as '''''A.I.''''') is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The screenplay by Spielberg and screen story by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] were loosely based on the 1969 short story "[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. The film was produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]], Spielberg and [[Bonnie Curtis]]. It stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]] and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.

Development of ''A.I.'' originally began with producer-director [[Stanley Kubrick]], after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in protracted [[development hell|development]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay.

The film received positive reviews, and grossed approximately $235 million. The film was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]], for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (by [[John Williams]]). In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, ''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was voted the eighty-third-greatest film since 2000.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=31 July 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archive-date=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''A.I.'' is dedicated to Kubrick.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->
In the 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities, reducing the world's population. Mecha, humanoid robots seemingly capable of complex thought but lacking in emotions, have been created. In [[Madison, New Jersey]], David, a prototype Mecha child capable of experiencing love, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin contracted a rare disease and has been placed in [[suspended animation]]. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David seeks to have Monica express the same love towards him. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear which belonged to Martin. Martin is unexpectedly cured of his disease and brought home. Martin becomes jealous of David, and taunts him to perform worrisome acts, such as cutting off locks of Monica's hair while she is sleeping. At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, triggering his self-protection programming. David grabs onto Martin, and they both fall into the pool. Martin is saved before he drowns, and Henry convinces Monica to return David to his creators to be destroyed. On the way there, Monica has a change of heart and spares David from destruction by leaving him in the woods. With Teddy as his only companion, David recalls ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and decides to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]] so that she may turn him into a real boy, which he believes will win back Monica's love.

David and Teddy are captured by a Flesh Fair, where obsolete Mecha are destroyed before jeering crowds. David is nearly destroyed himself and pleads for his life. The audience, deceived by David's realistic nature, revolts and allows David to escape alongside Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha on the run from authorities after being charged with murder. David, Teddy and Joe go to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]] and has also provided fairy tale information interpreted by David as suggesting that a Blue Fairy has the power to help him. Above the ruins of Manhattan, David meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells him that their meeting demonstrates David's ability to love and desire. David finds many copies of himself, including a female variant Darlene, boxed and ready to be shipped. Disheartened by his lost sense of individuality, David attempts suicide by falling from a skyscraper into the ocean. While underwater, David catches sight of a figure resembling the Blue Fairy before Joe rescues him in an amphibious aircraft. Before David can explain, Joe is captured via [[electromagnet]] by authorities. David and Teddy take control of the aircraft to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue from an attraction on [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. Believing the Blue Fairy to be real, David asks the statue to turn him into a real boy, and repeats this request until his internal power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humans are extinct and [[Manhattan]] is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced form called Specialists, and have become interested in learning about humanity. They find and revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Specialists reconstruct the Swinton family home from David's memories and explain to him, via an interactive image of the Blue Fairy, that it is impossible to make David a real boy. However, at David's insistence, they recreate Monica through genetic material from the strand of hair that Teddy kept. This Monica can live for only one day, and the process cannot be repeated. David spends his happiest day with Monica, and as she falls asleep in the evening, she tells David that she has always loved him: "the everlasting moment he had been waiting for", the narrator says; “David falls asleep as well and goes to that place 'where dreams are born.'"

===Development===
Kubrick began development on an adaptation of "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a [[film treatment]]. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Scott Brake |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |title=Spielberg Talks About the Genesis of ''A.I.'' |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |access-date=August 4, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522124838/http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to co-finance ''A.I.'' and cover distribution duties.<ref name=Ian/> The film labored in [[development hell]], and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.<ref name=connect>{{Cite news |author=Steven Gaydos |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |title=The Kubrick Connection |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |access-date=July 19, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120041001/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |archive-date=January 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Bob Shaw]] briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' for inspiration, calling ''A.I.'' "a [[picaresque]] robot version of ''[[Pinocchio]]''".<ref name=Ian/><ref>{{Cite news |author=Dana Haris |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |title=Spielberg lines up ''A.I.'', ''Report'' |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |access-date=July 16, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118141115/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1528658/13/Panteli_Georgia_PhD%20Thesis.pdf|title=From Puppet to Cyborg|page=55|publisher=Discovery|language=en|author=Georgia Panteli|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref>

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on ''A.I.'' in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a [[G.I.

Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the [[toyetic|kiddie market]]."<ref name=Ian/> Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped ''A.I.'' to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', feeling [[computer animation]] was not advanced enough to create the David character.

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in [[pre-production]] with [[Chris Baker (artist)|Christopher "Fangorn" Baker]] as [[concept art]]ist, and [[Sara Maitland]] assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus".<ref name=Ian>{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-07-03 |title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick |access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref> Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''.<ref name=FAQ>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-08-18 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |date=2008-08-18 |access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref> [[Chris Cunningham]] became the new visual effects supervisor.

==Reception==
Based on 194 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 74% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.62/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism. ''A.I.'' is, in a word, fascinating."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ai_artificial_intelligence/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708094802/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ai_artificial_intelligence/ |url-status=live |archive-date=July 8, 2008 |title=A.I.

Producer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick "would have applauded" the final film, while Kubrick's widow [[Christiane Kubrick|Christiane]] also enjoyed ''A.I''.<ref>{{Cite news |author=[[Army Archerd]] |url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117801772 |title=''A.I.''

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE &#124; The mind behind AI |work=BBC News |date=September 20, 2001 |access-date=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |archive-date=October 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Richard Corliss]] heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,130942,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072644/http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0%2C8599%2C130942%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=''A.I.''&nbsp;– Spielberg's Strange Love&nbsp;– ''TIME'' |date=June 17, 2001 |access-date=April 1, 2017}}</ref>

[[Leonard Maltin]], on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide|Movie Guide]]'', writing: "[The] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [the] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." However, he calls John Williams' music score "striking". [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] compared ''A.I.'' to ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972), and praised both "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work."<ref>{{Cite news |author-link=Jonathan Rosenbaum |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2001/0107/010713.html |title=The Best of Both Worlds |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=June 29, 2001 |access-date=August 6, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215232738/http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/2001/0107/010713.html |archive-date=February 15, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Film critic [[Armond White]], of the ''[[New York Press]]'', praised the film noting that "each part of David's journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema's most thoughtful, speculative artists&nbsp;– [[Frank Borzage|Borzage]], [[Yasujirō Ozu|Ozu]], [[Jacques Demy|Demy]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovsky]]."<ref>{{cite web|first=Armond|last=White|date=July 4, 2001|url=http://www.nypress.com/spielbergs-ai-dares-viewers-to-remember-and-accept-the-part-of-themselves-that-is-capable-of-feeling/|title=Spielberg's A.I.

[[Mick LaSalle]] gave a largely negative review. "''A.I.'' exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless" [[Jar Jar Binks]], yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic [[Albert Einstein]].<ref>{{Cite news |author-link=Mick LaSalle |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/29/DD239232.DTL |title=Artificial foolishness |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 29, 2001 |access-date=August 6, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815082644/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F29%2FDD239232.DTL |archive-date=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Peter Travers]] gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future."

In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/ai.html |title=Review: A.I |publisher=Reelviews.net |access-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

Screenwriter [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] has speculated, "Worldwide, ''A.I.'' was very successful (and the 4th-highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the [[alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]-style beings in the final 20 minutes were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |title=Author Talk: Ian Watson |publisher=Moon Milk Review |date=May 10, 2010 |access-date=April 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150715/http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [Despite Mr. Watson's reference to worldwide box office of 4th, the movie actually finished 16th worldwide among 2001 movie releases.]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-2001 |title = Top 2001 Movies at the Worldwide Box Office}}</ref>

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic [[Joe Leydon]] that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film—all the stuff in the house—was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of ''A.I.'', not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.{{'"}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |author-link=Joe Leydon |url=http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |title='Minority Report' looks at the day after tomorrow&nbsp;-- and is relevant to today <!-- Apparently accidental typos in quoted refs should be "silently" repaired. --> |work=Moving Picture Show |date=June 20, 2002 |access-date=April 29, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815010940/http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |archive-date=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He also added: "While there was divisiveness when A.I. came out, I felt that I had achieved Stanley’s wishes, or goals."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ew.com/article/2011/12/02/steven-spielberg-ew-interview/ |title = Steven Spielberg: The EW interview}}</ref>

Upon rewatching the film many years after its release, BBC film critic [[Mark Kermode]] apologized to Spielberg in an interview in January 2013 for "getting it wrong" on the film when he first viewed it in 2001.
