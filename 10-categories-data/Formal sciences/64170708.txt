{{short description|Max Weber's methodological position}}
[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|[[Max Weber]], the creator of this concept]]

The '''axiological neutrality''' is a [[methodological]] position that the [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] offered in ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'', that aim for the researcher to become aware of his own [[values]] during his [[scientific]] work, to reduce as much as possible the [[biases]] that his own value judgements could cause.<ref>Definition of this concept by [[Isabelle Kalinowski]] in the [https://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/neutralite-axiologique/ Encyclopedia Universalis (in French)]</ref> 

The demand developped by Max Weber is part of the criteria of [[scientific neutrality]].<ref>From the "Axiology" article in [https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/axiology Encyclopedia.com], from [[Evandro Agazzi]]</ref> 

The aim of the researcher in [[social sciences]] is to make research about subjects structured by values, while offering an [[analysis]] that will not be, itself, based on a [[value judgement]]. According to this concept, the researched should make of these values an “[[object]]”, without passing on them a prescriptive judgement.<ref>Marc-Kevin Daoust, in [https://www.cairn-int.info/abstract-E_RESS_531_0199--rethinking-axiological-neutrality.htm this article], in ''Revue européenne des sciences sociales'', 2015/1, online in [[Cairn]]</ref>

In this way, Weber developed a distinction between “value judgement” and “link to the values”. The “link to the values” describes the action of analysis of the researcher who, by respecting the principle of the axiological neutrality, makes of cultural values several facts to analyse without venturing a prescriptive judgement on them, i. e. without passing a value judgement.<ref>From [[Fred H. Blum]] in the ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 50, No 1 (Jul. 1944), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2770341?seq=1 readable online]</ref> 

The original term comes from the German ''werturteilsfreie Wissenschaft'', and was introduced by Max Weber.<ref>[http://encyclo-philo.fr/neutralite-scientifique-a/ ''Neutralité scientifique'' (in French)], Marc-Kevin Daoust, septembre 2017</ref>
