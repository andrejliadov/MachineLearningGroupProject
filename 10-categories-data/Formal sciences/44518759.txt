'''Social media mining''' is the process of obtaining [[big data]] from user-generated content on social media sites and [[mobile apps]] in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research. The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of [[mining]] for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services.

Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from [[computer science]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]]. Social media miners develop [[algorithm]]s suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from  [[social network analysis]], [[network science]], [[sociology]], [[ethnography]], optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data.<ref name="Zafarani">{{cite web |last1=Zafarani |first1=Reza |last2=Abbasi |first2=Mohammad Ali |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |title=Social Media Mining: An Introduction |year=2014 |url=http://dmml.asu.edu/smm |accessdate = 15 November 2014 }}</ref> In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens.

==Background==

As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein,<ref name="Kaplan">{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media |year=2010 |journal = Business Horizons | volume = 53 | issue = 1 |pages=59–68 |doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.09.003 }}</ref> social media is the "group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking ([[Facebook]] or [[LinkedIn]]), microblogging ([[Twitter]]), photo sharing ([[Flickr]], [[Instagram]], [[Photobucket]], or [[Picasa]]), news aggregation ([[Google Reader]], [[StumbleUpon]], or [[Feedburner]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]], [[MetaCafe]]), livecasting ([[Ustream]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]), virtual worlds ([[Kaneva]]), social gaming ([[World of Warcraft]]), social search ([[Google]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], or [[Ask.com]]), and instant messaging ([[Google Talk]], [[Skype]], or [[Yahoo! messenger]]).

The first social media website was introduced by [[GeoCities]] in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of [[HTML]] coding. The first social networking site, [[SixDegrees.com]], was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma.
Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.

== Uses ==

Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.<ref name="dmml.asu.edu">Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s10639-016-9501-1|title = Mining of Social Media data of University students|journal = Education and Information Technologies|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 1515–1526|year = 2017|last1 = Singh|first1 = Archana}}</ref> Once the data received goes through [[social media analytics]], it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.<ref name="Tang, J. 2016">Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). "[https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07569 A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media]". ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 49: 3.</ref> These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes.<ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/> Social analytics also uses [[sentiment analysis]], because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.<ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013">Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., & Stahl, F., (2013). "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis."</ref> This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.<ref>Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., & Beg, M. (2017). "[http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=09765697&AN=124636382&h=CRizoEFK077eiZ%2BUFNYsD%2Bi0B8FlPIpmOfLq9H4D1swnUxLgiAcNEXQjdvulXH8nbT1FRMB1RnT2ziplkTOiCw%3D%3D&crl=c Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining]." ''International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science'', 8: 5.</ref>

These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network.<ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/> Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for [[influencer marketing]]. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites.<ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/> Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends.<ref name="Tang, J. 2016"/> Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter.<ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"/> These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity.<ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/> By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with.

Social media can help in identifying the provenance of information due its unique features: user-generated content, user profiles, user interactions, and spatial or temporal information.<ref name="Barb-etal13">{{Cite journal |last1=Barbier |first1=Geoffrey |last2=Feng |first2=Zhuo |last3=Gundecha |first3=Pritam |last4=Liu |first4=Huan |title=Provenance Data in Social Media |year=2013 |journal=Synthesis Lectures on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery |volume=4 |pages=1–84 |doi=10.2200/S00496ED1V01Y201304DMK007 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c0a21fb656664a8b82844a2777b24116ee0e9087 }}</ref><ref name="Gund-etal13">{{Cite book |last1=Gundecha |first1=Pritam |last2=Feng |first2=Zhuo |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |chapter=Seeking Provenance of Information in Social Media |year=2013 |title= Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management Conference|chapter-url=http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Epgundech//papers/pritamCIKM13a.pdf}}</ref>
*[[Vulnerability management]] – A user's [[vulnerability]] on a social networking sites can be managed in three sequential steps: (1) identifying new ways in which a user can be vulnerable, (2) quantifying or measuring a user's vulnerability, and (3) reducing or mitigating them.<ref name="Gund-etal14">{{Cite journal |last1=Gundecha |first1=Pritam |last2=Barbier |first2=Geoffrey |last3=Tang |first3=Jiliang |last4=Liu |first4=Huan |title=User Vulnerability and its Reduction on a Social Networking Site |year=2014 |journal=  ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data|volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=1–25 | url=http://www.public.asu.edu/%7Epgundech//papers/pritamTKDD14.pdf|doi=10.1145/2630421 }}</ref>
*Opinion mining on candidates/parties - Social media is a popular medium for candidates/parties to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voters' opinion. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media posts can match (or even improve) traditional opinion polls.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Marozzo | first1 = Fabrizio | last2 = Bessi | first2 = Alessandro | title = Analyzing polarization of social media users and news sites during political campaigns  | journal = Social Network Analysis and Mining | year = 2018  | volume = 8 | doi = 10.1007/s13278-017-0479-5 | pages = 1 }}</ref>
