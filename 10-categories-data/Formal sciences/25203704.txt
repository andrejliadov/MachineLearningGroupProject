'''Basic body awareness therapy''' is an [[evidence-based treatment]] form in [[physiotherapy]] first developed in the ’70.. It represents a [[Holistic health|holistic]] approach to human movements considering physical, [[Physiology|physiological]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Existentialism|existential]] aspects of human existence.  B-BAT aims to bring aspects of health and human resources to the fore.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
 
B-BAT is based on the theory of [[psychotherapist]] Jaques Dropsy and his movement system.  It has  roots in a number of different movement systems from Western and Eastern tradition  (Alexander, Feldenkreis, Gindler, Idla, [[Zen meditation]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]]) emphasizing the body and [[nonverbal communication]] as a gateway to personal [[empowerment]].  B-BAT has integrated elements from [[humanistic]] and [[existential philosophy]] ([[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]]), psychology (Reich, [[Jung]], Lowen) and including aspects from [[natural science]], movement science, actors training, [[modern dance]] and [[fine art]].

The aim of  B-BAT is to establish increased awareness of the body and consciousness in movements, progressing towards less effort and a better function in ''being, doing and relating.'' The [[therapy]] program includes movements from [[everyday life]], lying, sitting, standing and walking.  It also includes the use of [[voice]], relational exercises and [[massage]]. ''Free breathing, balance and awareness'' in all exercises are central.

B-BAT  includes assessment tools, the body awareness rating scale (BARS) and the body awareness scale (BAS), BAS- interview, and includes a structured therapy model. A number of studies have been done on this therapy approach proving it beneficial for people suffering from a number of pathological conditions.

B-BAT aims to increase the [[physiotherapist]]`s personal and professional development, in [[clinical practice]] and [[research]]. It emphasises processes, knowledge, experiences and qualitative oriented research methodology and methods. 
B-BAT  is a well-known approach used by physiotherapists in [[mental health]] and community-based physiotherapy, especially in the Northern part of Europe. It has been introduced at ''university level'' by B-BAT teachers and is part of [[training]] and research programs. There is an expanding international network, originating from the Swedish-Norwegian group of authorised [[teacher]]s responsible for the quality-security of the method.
