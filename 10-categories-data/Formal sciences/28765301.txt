The '''Groves Classification''' is a numbering system to enable the shape of any [[academic dress|academic gown or hood]] to be easily described and identified. It was devised by '''Nicholas Groves''' to establish a common terminology for hoods and gowns to remedy the situation of individual universities using differing terms to describe the same item. As such it is used in same manner as an heraldic blazon whereby a textual description enables a coat of arms to be drawn. The system was first described in the Burgon Society's annual in 2001 and adopted as standard by robe makers and scholars of academic dress.<ref name='Burgon Annual'>{{Citation | surname=Groves| given=Nicholas | title=Towards a Standard Terminology for Describing Academic Dress | journal=The Burgon Society Annual |volume=1 | year=2001 | pages=9–12 | url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/society/library/trans/annual2001.pdf }}.</ref>

The original Groves Classification included a standardization for shapes and patterns of hoods and gowns worn by graduates and undergraduates. Further information was given regarding the use of different fabrics and standardization of colors, but the focus was placed on gowns and hoods which are explained further below.<ref name='Burgon Annual'/>

The Classification undergoes periodic revision as new hood and gown patterns emerge.

===Hoods===
Hoods in the Classification are divided into three different types as summarised in the table below. Unlike the gowns and robes, these are based on the shape of the hood rather than the degrees for which they are worn.

*'''[f]''' full shape hoods are those that have a [[cape]], a [[cowl]] and a [[liripipe]].
*'''[s]''' simple shape hoods have only a cowl and a liripipe.
*'''[a]''' Aberdeen shape hoods have only a cape and a vestigial cowl.

===Gowns===
Gowns in the Groves system are divided into three classes. These generally follow the shapes associated with each different [[academic degree]] in the British educational system. 
*[b] [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] gowns typically have large open sleeves
*[m] [[master's degree|master's]] gowns typically have long closed sleeves with armhole at elbow level
*[d] [[doctoral degree|doctor's]] robes vary in shape widely between institutions and are all classed as [d].

==Additions==
The Groves classification system was first published in 2001. Since that time, it has been adapted and changed to include newly devised academic dress and revisions of existing schemes.<ref name='Burgon Annual'/> The Burgon Society maintains a comprehensive listing of system shapes on its website. In addition to those included above, the current list classifies undergraduate gowns in use throughout the United Kingdom and academic headwear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php|title=The Design of Academical Dress|publisher=The Burgon Society|access-date=2011-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223213337/http://www.burgon.org.uk/design/groves.php|archive-date=2009-02-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===American doctoral robes===
[[File:ICC Doctor Gown.JPG|thumb|An American doctoral robe as originally prescribed by the ICC]]
In 2012, a system of classification was created to include unique doctoral robes in the United States of America. The Intercollegiate Code describes the form of dress for doctors at American institutions, but many have changed the colors of their robes.<ref name="ICC Gowns">{{cite journal |last1=Boven |first1=David T. |title=A Touch of Colour: Surveying Variation in American Academic Dress and a System of Categories for Departures |journal=Transactions of the Burgon Society |date=2012 |volume=12 |pages=86-102 |doi=10.4148/2475-7799.1102 |url=https://newprairiepress.org/burgonsociety/vol12/iss1/7/ |access-date=26 February 2020|doi-access=free }}</ref> Several institutions have even developed unique forms of robes for the doctoral graduates. In all of these instances, there are some cases where <ref name="ICC Gowns" />
