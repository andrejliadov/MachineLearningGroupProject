A '''cognitive bias''' is a systematic pattern of deviation from [[norm (philosophy)|norm]] or rationality in judgment.<ref name = "Haselton_2005">{{cite book| vauthors = Haselton MG, Nettle D, Andrews PW | chapter = The evolution of cognitive bias.|year=2005|location = Hoboken, NJ, US | publisher = John Wiley & Sons Inc| veditors = Buss DM | title = The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|pages=724–746| url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/handbookevpsych.pdf}}</ref> Individuals create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] input, may dictate their [[behavior]] in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called [[irrationality]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kahneman D, Tversky A |year=1972 |title=Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=430–454 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3 |url=http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kahneman-Tversky-1972.pdf |access-date=2017-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214120047/http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kahneman-Tversky-1972.pdf |archive-date=2019-12-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Baron J | date = 2007 | title = Thinking and Deciding | edition = 4th | location = New York, NY | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref><ref name="Ariely.2008">{{cite book| last=Ariely |first=Dan | name-list-style = vanc |author-link=Dan Ariely| year=2008| title=Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions| location=New York, NY| publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-135323-9|title-link=Predictably Irrational }}</ref>

Although it may seem like such misperceptions would be aberrations, biases can help humans find commonalities and shortcuts to assist in the navigation of common situations in life.<ref>{{Cite web|title=12 Common Biases That Affect How We Make Everyday Decisions|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/thoughts-thinking/201809/12-common-biases-affect-how-we-make-everyday-decisions|access-date=2020-07-21|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

A continually evolving [[list of cognitive biases]] has been identified over the last six decades of research on human judgment and decision-making in [[cognitive science]], [[social psychology]], and [[behavioral economics]]. Daniel Kahneman and  Tversky (1996) argue that cognitive biases have efficient practical implications for areas including clinical judgment, entrepreneurship, finance, and management.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kahneman D, Tversky A | title = On the reality of cognitive illusions | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 582–91; discussion 592–6 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8759048 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.582 | url = http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/KahnemanTversky1996PsychRev.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.174.5117 }}</ref><ref name="S.X.

==Overview==

The notion of cognitive biases was introduced by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] in 1972<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kahneman D, Frederick S |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment | veditors = Gilovich T, Griffin DW, Kahneman D |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=51–52 |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}</ref> and grew out of their experience of people's ''[[Numeracy#Innumeracy|innumeracy]]'', or inability to reason intuitively with the greater [[orders of magnitude]]. Tversky, Kahneman and colleagues demonstrated several [[reproducibility|replicable]] ways in which human judgments and decisions differ from [[rational choice theory]]. Tversky and Kahneman explained human differences in judgment and decision-making in terms of heuristics. Heuristics involve mental shortcuts which provide swift estimates about the possibility of uncertain occurrences.<ref name="Baumeister2" /> Heuristics are simple for the brain to compute but sometimes introduce "severe and systematic errors."<ref name="h_and_b" />

For example, the representativeness heuristic is defined as “The tendency to judge the frequency or likelihood" of an occurrence by the extent of which the event "resembles the typical case".<ref name=Baumeister2>{{cite book| vauthors = Baumeister RF, Bushman BJ |title=Social psychology and human nature: International Edition|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, USA|pages=141}}</ref> 

The "Linda Problem" illustrates the representativeness heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Tversky A, Kahneman D |title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgement|journal=Psychological Review|year=1983|volume=90|issue=4  |pages=293–315|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.90.4.293 |url=http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/TverskyKahneman1983PsychRev.pdf}}</ref>). Participants were given a description of "Linda" that suggests Linda might well be a feminist (e.g., she is said to be concerned about discrimination and social justice issues). They were then asked whether they thought Linda was more likely to be (a) a "bank teller" or (b) a "bank teller and active in the feminist movement." A majority chose answer (b). This error (mathematically, answer (b) cannot be more likely than answer (a)) is an example of the "[[conjunction fallacy]]"; Tversky and Kahneman argued that respondents chose (b) because it seemed more "representative" or typical of persons who might fit the description of Linda. The representativeness heuristic may lead to errors such as activating stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of others (Haselton et al., 2005, p.&nbsp;726).

Critics of Kahneman and Tversky, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], alternatively argued that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases. They should rather conceive rationality as an adaptive tool, not identical to the rules of [[formal logic]] or the [[probability calculus]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Gigerenzer G |chapter=Bounded and Rational | veditors = Stainton RJ |title=Contemporary Debates in Cognitive Science |publisher=Blackwell |year=2006 |page=129 |isbn=978-1-4051-1304-5 }}</ref> Nevertheless, experiments such as the "Linda problem" grew into heuristics and biases research programs, which spread beyond academic psychology into other disciplines including medicine and political science.

==Types==
Biases can be distinguished on a number of dimensions. For a more complete list, see [[list of cognitive biases]]. Examples of cognitive biases include:
* Biases specific to ''groups'' (such as the [[Group polarization#Risky shift|risky shift]]) versus biases at the individual level.
* Biases that affect [[decision-making]], where the ''desirability'' of options has to be considered (e.g., [[sunk costs]] fallacy).
* Biases, such as [[illusory correlation]], that affect ''judgment'' of how likely something is or whether one thing is the cause of another.
* Biases that affect ''memory'',<ref name="Schacter.1999">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schacter DL | title = The seven sins of memory. Insights from psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 182–203 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10199218 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182 }}</ref> such as consistency bias (remembering one's past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one's present attitudes).
* Biases that reflect a subject's ''motivation'',<ref name="Kunda1990">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunda Z | title = The case for motivated reasoning | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 480–98 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2270237 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480 | url = http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/kunda90_psychol_bulletin_the-case-for-motivated-reasoning.pdf | access-date = 2017-10-27 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170706055600/http://synapse.princeton.edu/~sam/kunda90_psychol_bulletin_the-case-for-motivated-reasoning.pdf | archive-date = 2017-07-06 }}</ref> for example, the desire for a positive self-image leading to [[egocentric bias]] and the avoidance of unpleasant [[cognitive dissonance]].<ref name="Hoorens1993">{{cite book | vauthors = Hoorens V |year=1993 |contribution=Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison |title=European Review of Social Psychology 4 |editor=[[Wolfgang Stroebe|Stroebe, W.]] |editor2=Hewstone, Miles |publisher=Wiley }}</ref>

Other biases are due to the particular way the brain perceives, forms memories and makes judgments. This distinction is sometimes described as "[[hot cognition]]" versus "cold cognition", as [[motivated reasoning]] can involve a state of [[arousal]]. Among the "cold" biases,

* some are due to ''ignoring relevant information'' (e.g., [[neglect of probability]]),
* some involve a decision or judgment being ''affected by irrelevant information'' (for example the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]] where the same problem receives different responses depending on how it is described; or the [[distinction bias]] where choices presented together have different outcomes than those presented separately), and
* others give ''excessive weight'' to an unimportant but salient feature of the problem (e.g., [[anchoring]]).

The fact that some biases reflect motivation, specifically the motivation to have positive attitudes to oneself,<ref name="Hoorens1993" /> accounts for the fact that many biases are self-serving or self-directed (e.g., [[illusion of asymmetric insight]], [[self-serving bias]]). There are also biases in how subjects evaluate in-groups or out-groups; evaluating in-groups as more diverse and "better" in many respects, even when those groups are arbitrarily defined ([[ingroup bias]], [[outgroup homogeneity bias]]).

Some cognitive biases belong to the subgroup of [[attentional bias]]es, which refers to paying increased attention to certain stimuli. It has been shown, for example, that people addicted to alcohol and other drugs pay more attention to drug-related stimuli. Common psychological tests to measure those biases are the [[Stroop effect|Stroop task]]<ref name="pmid5328883">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen AR, Rohwer WD | title = The Stroop color-word test: a review | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–93 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5328883 | doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(66)90004-7 }}</ref><ref name="pmid2034749">{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod CM | title = Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 163–203 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 2034749 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.109.2.163 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/109/2/163 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.2563 }}</ref> and the [[Dot-probe paradigm|dot probe task]].

Individuals' susceptibility to some types of cognitive biases can be measured by the [[Cognitive reflection test|Cognitive Reflection Test]] (CRT) developed by Shane Frederick (2005).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Frederick |first=Shane | name-list-style = vanc |date=2005|title=Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=25–42|doi=10.1257/089533005775196732|issn=0895-3309|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oechssler|first1=Jörg|last2=Roider|first2=Andreas|last3=Schmitz|first3=Patrick W. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2009|title=Cognitive abilities and behavioral biases|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization|volume=72|issue=1|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2009.04.018|issn=0167-2681|url=https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/21701/2/roder2.pdf}}</ref>

|-
| [[Fundamental attribution error]] (FAE)
| Also known as the correspondence bias <ref name="Baumeister"/> is the tendency for people to over-emphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others. At the same time, individuals under-emphasize the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior. Edward E. Jones and Victor A. Harris' (1967)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones EE, Harris VA  |title=The attribution of attitudes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=3|pages=1–24|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}</ref> classic study illustrates the FAE. Despite being made aware that the target's speech direction (pro-Castro/anti-Castro) was assigned to the writer, participants ignored the situational pressures and attributed pro-Castro attitudes to the writer when the speech represented such attitudes.

|-
|[[Anchoring (cognitive bias)|Anchoring]]
|Anchoring bias is defined as the incapability of people to make appropriate adjustments from a starting point to cause into a final answer.

==Practical significance==
{{further|Confirmation bias#Consequences}}

Many social institutions rely on individuals to make rational judgments.

The securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons. In truth, actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases, heuristics, and framing effects.

A fair [[jury trial]], for example, requires that the jury ignore irrelevant features of the case, weigh the relevant features appropriately, consider different possibilities open-mindedness and resist [[fallacies]] such as [[appeal to emotion]]. The various biases demonstrated in these psychological experiments suggest that people will frequently fail to do all these things.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sutherland | first = Stuart | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2007 | title = Irrationality: The Enemy Within | edition = Second | publisher = Pinter & Martin | isbn = 978-1-905177-07-3 }}</ref> However, they fail to do so in systematic, directional ways that are predictable.<ref name="Ariely.2008"/>

Cognitive biases are also related to the persistence of [[Theory of everything|theory-of-everything]] thinking,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/berksons-paradox/|title=Berkson's Paradox {{!}} Brilliant Math & Science Wiki|website=brilliant.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/clustering-illusion/|title=Clustering Illusion - Definition, Example, Implications in Investing|website=Corporate Finance Institute|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref> to large social issues such as prejudice, and they also work as a hindrance in the acceptance of scientific non-intuitive knowledge by the public.<ref name=mot>{{cite book|title=Motivation in language: studies in honor of Günter Radden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzhJ3KpLpQUC&pg=PA275&cd=3&q=essentialism%20definition| vauthors = Radden G, Cuyckens H |publisher=[[John Benjamins]]|year=2003|page=275 | isbn=978-1-58811-426-6}}</ref>

However, in some academic disciplines, the study of bias is very popular. For instance, bias is a wide spread and well studied phenomenon because most decisions that concern the minds and hearts of entrepreneurs are computationally intractable.<ref name="S.X. Zhang and J. Cueto 2015"/>

Cognitive biases can create other issues that arise in everyday life. One study showed the connection between cognitive bias, specifically approach bias, and inhibitory control on how much unhealthy snack food a person would eat.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kakoschke N, Kemps E, Tiggemann M | title = Combined effects of cognitive bias for food cues and poor inhibitory control on unhealthy food intake | journal = Appetite | volume = 87 | pages = 358–64 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25592403 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2015.01.004 | hdl = 2328/35717 | s2cid = 31561602 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> They found that the participants who ate more of the unhealthy snack food, tended to have less inhibitory control and more reliance on approach bias. Others have also hypothesized that cognitive biases could be linked to various eating disorders and how people view their bodies and their body image.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williamson DA, Muller SL, Reas DL, Thaw JM | title = Cognitive bias in eating disorders: implications for theory and treatment | journal = Behavior Modification | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 556–77 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10533440 | doi = 10.1177/0145445599234003 | s2cid = 36189809 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Donald A.| name-list-style = vanc |date=1996|title=Body image disturbance in eating disorders: A form of cognitive bias? |journal=Eating Disorders|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–58|doi=10.1080/10640269608250075|issn=1064-0266 }}</ref>

It has also been argued that cognitive biases can be used in destructive ways.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Trout J |date=2005|title=Paternalism and Cognitive Bias|journal=Law and Philosophy|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=393–434|doi=10.1007/s10982-004-8197-3|s2cid=143783638|issn=0167-5249}}</ref> Some believe that there are people in authority who use cognitive biases and heuristics in order to manipulate others so that they can reach their end goals. Some medications and other health care treatments rely on cognitive biases in order to persuade others who are susceptible to cognitive biases to use their products. Many see this as taking advantage of one’s natural struggle of judgement and decision-making. They also believe that it is the government’s responsibility to regulate these misleading ads.

Cognitive biases also seem to play a role in property sale price and value. Participants in the experiment were shown a residential property.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=Deborah S. |last2=Frethey-Bentham |first2=Catherine | name-list-style = vanc |date=2010|title=The effect of context and the level of decision maker training on the perception of a property's probable sale price |journal=Journal of Property Research|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=247–267|doi=10.1080/09599916.2010.518406|s2cid=154866472 |issn=0959-9916}}</ref> Afterwards, they were shown another property that was completely unrelated to the first property. They were asked to say what they believed the value and the sale price of the second property would be. They found that showing the participants an unrelated property did have an effect on how they valued the second property.


==Reducing==
{{main|Cognitive bias mitigation| Cognitive bias modification}}

Because they cause [[systematic error]]s, cognitive biases cannot be compensated for using a [[wisdom of the crowd]] technique of averaging answers from several people.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy |title=The Feedback Fallacy | first1 = Marcus | last1 = Buckingham | first2 = Ashley | last2 = Goodall | name-list-style = vanc |issue=March–April 2019 |magazine=[[Harvard Business Review]]}}</ref>  [[Debiasing]] is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision-making through incentives, nudges, and training. [[Cognitive bias mitigation]] and [[cognitive bias modification]] are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects. [[Reference class forecasting]] is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] has dubbed the [[outside view]].

[[Cognitive bias modification]] refers to the process of modifying cognitive biases in healthy people and also refers to a growing area of psychological (non-pharmaceutical) therapies for anxiety, depression and addiction called cognitive bias modification therapy (CBMT). CBMT is sub-group of therapies within a growing area of psychological therapies based on modifying cognitive processes with or without accompanying medication and talk therapy, sometimes referred to as applied cognitive processing therapies (ACPT). Although cognitive bias modification can refer to modifying cognitive processes in healthy individuals, CBMT is a growing area of evidence-based psychological therapy, in which cognitive processes are modified to relieve suffering<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLeod C, Mathews A, Tata P | title = Attentional bias in emotional disorders | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–20 | date = February 1986 | pmid = 3700842 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843x.95.1.15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bar-Haim Y, Lamy D, Pergamin L, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH | title = Threat-related attentional bias in anxious and nonanxious individuals: a meta-analytic study | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–24 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17201568 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.1 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.324.4312 }}</ref> from serious [[Major depressive disorder|depression]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes EA, Lang TJ, Shah DM | title = Developing interpretation bias modification as a "cognitive vaccine" for depressed mood: imagining positive events makes you feel better than thinking about them verbally | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 118 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–88 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19222316 | doi = 10.1037/a0012590 }}</ref> [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hakamata Y, Lissek S, Bar-Haim Y, Britton JC, Fox NA, Leibenluft E, Ernst M, Pine DS | display-authors = 6 | title = Attention bias modification treatment: a meta-analysis toward the establishment of novel treatment for anxiety | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 68 | issue = 11 | pages = 982–90 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20887977 | pmc = 3296778 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.07.021 }}</ref> and addiction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberl C, Wiers RW, Pawelczack S, Rinck M, Becker ES, Lindenmeyer J | title = Approach bias modification in alcohol dependence: do clinical effects replicate and for whom does it work best? | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 4 | pages = 38–51 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23218805 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2012.11.002 | pmc = 6987692 }}</ref> CBMT techniques are technology assisted therapies that are delivered via a computer with or without clinician support.

==Common theoretical causes of some cognitive biases==
Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include:

*[[Bounded rationality]] — limits on optimization and rationality
**[[Prospect theory]]
**[[Mental accounting]]
**[[Adaptive bias]] — basing decisions on limited information and biasing them based on the costs of being wrong
*[[Attribute substitution]] — making a complex, difficult judgment by unconsciously replacing it with an easier judgment<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Kahneman D, Frederick S | chapter = Representativeness revisited: Attribute substitution in intuitive judgment | veditors = Gilovich T, Griffin DW, Kahneman D |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81  |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}</ref>
*[[Attribution theory]]
**[[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]]
**[[Naïve realism (psychology)|Naïve realism]]
*[[Cognitive dissonance]], and related:
**[[Impression management]]
**[[Self-perception theory]]
* Information-processing shortcuts ([[Heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]),<ref>Kahneman, D., Slovic, P., & Tversky, A. (1982). Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases (1st ed.). Cambridge University Press.</ref> including:
**[[Availability heuristic]] — estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples<ref name="h_and_b" />
**[[Representativeness heuristic]] — judging probabilities based on resemblance<ref name="h_and_b"/>
**[[Affect heuristic]] — basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Slovic P, Finucane M, Peters E, MacGregor DG |chapter=The Affect Heuristic |pages=397–420 | veditors = Gilovich T, Griffin D, Kahneman D |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}</ref>
*[[Emotion]]al and moral motivations<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Pfister HR, Böhm G |year=2008|title=The multiplicity of emotions: A framework of emotional functions in decision making|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=3|pages=5–17}}</ref> deriving, for example, from:
** The [[two-factor theory of emotion]]
** The [[somatic markers hypothesis]]
*[[Introspection illusion]]
* Misinterpretations or [[misuse of statistics]]; [[innumeracy]].
*[[Social influence]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Wang X, Simons F, Brédart S |year=2001|title=Social cues and verbal framing in risky choice|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1002/1099-0771(200101)14:1<1::AID-BDM361>3.0.CO;2-N}}</ref>

*Noisy information processing (distortions during storage in and retrieval from memory).<ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /> For example, a 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article suggests that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism.<ref name="HilbertPsychBull">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilbert M | title = Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: how noisy information processing can bias human decision making | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 138 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–37 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22122235 | doi = 10.1037/a0025940 | url = http://www.martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.432.8763 | lay-url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001 }}</ref> The article shows that noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions) can produce [[List of cognitive biases#Decision-making, belief and behavioral biases|regressive conservatism]], the [[Conservatism (belief revision)|belief revision]] (Bayesian conservatism), [[illusory correlation]]s, [[illusory superiority]] (better-than-average effect) and [[worse-than-average effect]], [[subadditivity effect]], [[List of cognitive biases#Decision-making, belief and behavioral biases|exaggerated expectation]], [[overconfidence]], and the [[hard–easy effect]].

==Individual differences in cognitive biases==
People do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]], [[temporal discounting]], and [[bias blind spot]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences|journal = Management Science|date = 2015-04-24|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|first1 = Irene|last1 = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H. Lauren|last4 = Min|first5 = Sophie|last5 = Lebrecht|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam | name-list-style = vanc |volume=61|issue = 10|pages=2468–2486|doi-access = free}}</ref> That said, these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change. Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases: [[anchoring]], bias blind spot, [[confirmation bias]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[projection bias]], and [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Debiasing Decisions Improved Decision Making With a Single Training Intervention|journal = Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2372-7322|pages = 129–140|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/2372732215600886|first1 = Carey K.|last1 = Morewedge|first2 = Haewon|last2 = Yoon|first3 = Irene|last3 = Scopelliti|first4 = Carl W.|last4 = Symborski|first5 = James H.|last5 = Korris|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam |s2cid = 4848978|url = http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/12324/1/Debiasing_Decisions_PIBBS.pdf| name-list-style = vanc }}</ref>

Individual differences in cognitive bias have also been linked to varying levels of cognitive abilities and functions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vartanian O, Beatty EL, Smith I, Blackler K, Lam Q, Forbes S, De Neys W | title = The Reflective Mind: Examining Individual Differences in Susceptibility to Base Rate Neglect with fMRI | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 1011–1022 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29668391 | doi = 10.1162/jocn_a_01264 | s2cid = 4933030 | url = https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/dd1e7c5b-482d-4470-8a24-6ce013f1211a }}</ref> The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) has been used to help understand the connection between cognitive biases and cognitive ability. There have been inconclusive results when using the Cognitive Reflection Test to understand ability. However, there does seem to be a correlation; those who gain a higher score on the Cognitive Reflection Test, have higher cognitive ability and rational-thinking skills. This in turn helps predict the performance on cognitive bias and heuristic tests. Those with higher CRT scores tend to be able to answer more correctly on different heuristic and cognitive bias tests and tasks.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Toplak ME, West RF, Stanovich KE | title = The Cognitive Reflection Test as a predictor of performance on heuristics-and-biases tasks | journal = Memory & Cognition | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 1275–89 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21541821 | doi = 10.3758/s13421-011-0104-1 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Age is another individual difference that has an effect on one’s ability to be susceptible to cognitive bias. Older individuals tend to be more susceptible to cognitive biases and have less cognitive flexibility. However, older individuals were able to decrease their susceptibility to cognitive biases throughout ongoing trials.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson CG, Nusbaum AT, Whitney P, Hinson JM | title = Age-differences in cognitive flexibility when overcoming a preexisting bias through feedback | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 586–594 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 29161963 | doi = 10.1080/13803395.2017.1398311 | s2cid = 13372385 }}</ref> These experiments had both young and older adults complete a framing task. Younger adults had more cognitive flexibility than older adults. Cognitive flexibility is linked to helping overcome preexisting biases.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms against theories of cognitive biases are usually founded in the fact that both sides of a [[debate]] often claim the other's thoughts to be subject to [[human nature]] and the result of cognitive bias, while claiming their own viewpoint to be above the cognitive bias and the correct way to "overcome" the issue. This rift ties to a more fundamental issue that stems from a lack of consensus in the field, thereby creating arguments that can be [[falsifiability|non-falsifiably]] used to validate any contradicting viewpoint.{{Citation needed|reason=Who has claimed that theories about cognitive biases are not falsifiable?|date=August 2019}}

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] is one of the main opponents to cognitive biases and heuristics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clavien|first=Christine | name-list-style = vanc |date=2010|title=Gerd Gigerenzer, Gut Feelings: Short Cuts to Better Decision Making: Penguin Books, 2008 (1st ed. 2007), £ 8.99 (paperback), {{text|ISBN-13}}: 978-0141015910|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=113–115|doi=10.1007/s10677-009-9172-8|s2cid=8097667 |issn=1386-2820|url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_68DBD7560A77 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gigerenzer | first = Gerd | name-list-style = vanc |title=Adaptive thinking : rationality in the real world|date=2000|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-19-803117-8|location=Oxford|oclc=352897263}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book|last=Gigerenzer | first = Gerd | name-list-style = vanc |title=Simple heuristics that make us smart|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Todd, Peter M., ABC Research Group.|isbn=0-585-35863-X|location=New York|oclc=47009468}}</ref> Gigerenzer believes that cognitive biases are not biases, but rules of thumb, or as he would put it “gut feelings” that can actually help us make accurate decisions in our lives. His view shines a much more positive light on cognitive biases than many other researchers. Many view cognitive biases and heuristics as irrational ways of making decisions and judgements. Gigerenzer argues that using heuristics and cognitive biases are rational and helpful for making decisions in our everyday life.
