A '''bigraph''' (often used in the plural '''bigraphs''') can be modelled as the superposition of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] (the ''link graph'') and a set of [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]] (the ''place graph'').<ref name="intro">''[http://www.itu.dk/research/pls/wiki/index.php/A_Brief_Introduction_To_Bigraphs A Brief Introduction To Bigraphs]'', [[IT University of Copenhagen]], Denmark.</ref><ref name="milner">Milner, Robin. ''[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/archive/rm135/uam-theme.html The Bigraphical Model]'', [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], UK.</ref>

Each [[Node (mathematics)|node]] of the bigraph is part of a graph and also part of some tree that describes how the nodes are nested. Bigraphs can be conveniently and formally displayed as [[diagram]]s.<ref name="intro" /> They have applications in the modelling of distributed systems for [[ubiquitous computing]] and can be used to describe [[Mobile agent|mobile]] interactions. They have also been used by [[Robin Milner]] in an attempt to subsume [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] (CCS) and [[Pi calculus|π-calculus]].<ref name="milner" /> They have been studied in the context of [[category theory]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Anatomy of a bigraph==

Aside from nodes and ([[hyperedge|hyper-]])[[Edge (graph theory)|edges]], a bigraph may have associated with it one or more ''regions'' which are roots in the place forest, and zero or more  ''holes'' in the place graph, into which other bigraph regions may be inserted.  Similarly, to nodes we may assign ''controls'' that define identities and an arity (the number of ''ports'' for a given node to which link-graph edges may connect).  These controls are drawn from a bigraph ''signature''.  In the link graph we define ''inner'' and ''outer'' names, which define the connection points at which coincident names may be fused to form a single link.

==Foundations==

A bigraph is a 5-tuple:

<math>(V,E,ctrl,prnt,link) : \langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle,</math>

where <math>V</math> is a set of nodes, <math>E</math> is a set of edges, <math>ctrl</math> is the ''control map'' that assigns controls to nodes, <math>prnt</math> is the ''parent map'' that defines the nesting of nodes, and <math>link</math> is the ''link map'' that defines the link structure.

The notation <math>\langle k,X \rangle \to \langle m,Y \rangle</math> indicates that the bigraph has <math>k</math> ''holes'' (sites) and a set of inner names <math>X</math> and <math>m</math> ''regions'', with a set of ''outer names'' <math>Y</math>.  These are respectively known as the ''inner'' and ''outer'' interfaces of the bigraph.

Formally speaking, each bigraph is an arrow in a symmetric partial [[monoidal category]] (usually abbreviated ''spm-category'') in which the objects are these interfaces.<ref>{{cite conference

==Extensions and variants==

===Bigraphs with sharing===
[[File:Bigraphs-sharing-example.svg|alt=Example bigraph with sharing|thumb|230x230px|Example bigraph with sharing in which the node of control M is shared by the two nodes of control S. This is represented by M being in the intersection of the two S-nodes.]]

}}</ref> are a generalisation of Milner's formalisation that allows for a straightforward representation of overlapping or intersecting spatial locations. In bigraphs with sharing, the place graph is defined as a [[directed acyclic graph |directed acyclic graph (DAG)]], i.e. <math>prnt</math> is a [[binary relation]] instead of a [[Function (mathematics)|map]]. The definition of link graph is unaffected by the introduction of sharing. Note that standard bigraphs are a sub-class of bigraphs with sharing.

Areas of application of bigraphs with sharing include wireless networking protocols,<ref>{{cite journal
