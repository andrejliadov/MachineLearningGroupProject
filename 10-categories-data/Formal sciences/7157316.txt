In [[epidemiology]], the '''attack rate''' is the percentage of an at-risk population that contracts the disease during a specified time interval.<ref>{{cite web |title=Principles of Epidemiology {{!}} Lesson 3 - Section 2 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html |website=www.cdc.gov |accessdate=7 April 2020 |language=en-us |date=10 December 2019}}</ref> It is used in hypothetical predictions and during actual [[outbreaks]] of disease. An at-risk population is defined as one that has no immunity to the attacking pathogen which can be either a [[novel pathogen]] or an established pathogen. It is used to project the number of victims to expect during an [[epidemic]]. This aids in marshalling resources for delivery of medical care as well as production of vaccines and/or anti-viral and anti-bacterial medicines.<ref>Anthony N. Glaser. High-Yield Biostatistics. Williams & Wilkins. Baltimore. 1995</ref> The rate is arrived at by taking the number of new cases in the population at risk and dividing by the number of persons at risk in the population.
