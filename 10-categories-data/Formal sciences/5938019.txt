'''Complexity theory and organizations''', also called '''complexity strategy''' or '''complex adaptive organizations''', is the use of the study of [[Complex systems|complexity systems]] in the field of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].<ref name=CAS-T-32/><ref name=CAS-T-33/><ref name=CAS-T-31/><ref name=CAS-T-29/> It draws from research in the natural sciences that examines uncertainty and non-linearity.<ref name="Grobman, Gary M 2005">{{cite journal|author=Grobman, Gary M.|title=Complexity Theory: a new way to look at organizational change|journal=Public Administration Quarterly|year=2005|url=http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|volume=29|issue=3|access-date=2016-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807100905/http://www.complexityforum.com/members/Grobman%202005%20Complexity%20theory.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> Complexity theory emphasizes interactions and the accompanying [[feedback]] loops that constantly change systems. While it proposes that systems are unpredictable, they are also constrained by order-generating rules.<ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005">{{cite journal|author=Burnes, Bernard|title=Complexity theories and organizational change|journal=International Journal of Management Reviews|volume=7|issue=2|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00107.x|pages=73–90}}</ref>{{rp|74}}

Complexity theory has been used in the fields of [[strategic management]] and [[organizational studies]].  Application areas include understanding how [[organizations]] or firms [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]] to their environments and how they cope with conditions of uncertainty.  Organisations have complex structures in that they are [[dynamic network analysis|dynamic network]]s of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities. They are adaptive; in that the individual and [[collective behavior]] mutate and [[self-organizing|self-organize]] corresponding to a change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.<ref name="CAS-T-01" /><ref name="CAS-T-02" />

== Key concepts ==

=== Complex adaptive systems ===
Organizations can be treated as [[complex adaptive systems]] (CAS) as they exhibit fundamental CAS principles like self-organization, [[complexity]], [[emergence]],<ref name="CAS-T-13" /> interdependence, space of possibilities, co-evolution,<ref name=CAS-T-37/> [[Chaos theory|chaos]],<ref name=CAS-T-30/><ref name=CAS-T-34/> and [[self-similarity]].<ref name="CAS-T-01" /><ref name="CAS-T-03" /><ref name="terra">{{cite journal|last1=Terra|first1=Leonardo Augusto Amaral|last2=Passador|first2=João Luiz|title=Symbiotic Dynamic: The Strategic Problem from the Perspective of Complexity|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|date=2016|volume=33|issue=2|page=235|doi=10.1002/sres.2379}}</ref>

CAS are contrasted with ordered and [[chaotic systems]] by the relationship that exists between the system and the agents which act within it.<ref name=CAS-T-30/> In an ordered system the level of constraint means that all agent behaviour is limited to the rules of the system. In a chaotic system the agents are unconstrained and susceptible to statistical and other analysis.  In a CAS, the system and the agents co-evolve; the system lightly constrains agent behaviour, but the agents modify the system by their interaction with it. This [[self-organizing]] nature is an important characteristic of CAS; and its ability to learn to adapt, differentiate it from other self organizing systems.<ref name=CAS-T-01/><ref name=CAS-T-30/><ref name=CAS-T-34/>

Organizational environments can be viewed as complex adaptive systems where [[coevolution]] generally occurs near the [[edge of chaos]], and it should maintain a balance between flexibility and stability to avoid organizational failure.<ref name=CAS-T-35/><ref name=CAS-T-30/><ref name=CAS-T-29/><ref name=CAS-T-37/> As a response to coping with turbulent environments; businesses bring out [[flexibility]], [[creativity]],<ref name=CAS-T-36/> [[agility]], and [[innovation]] near the edge of chaos; provided the organizational structure has sufficient [[decentralized]], [[Flat organization|non-hierarchical network]] structures.<ref name=CAS-T-35/><ref name=CAS-T-30/><ref name=CAS-T-29/>
  
== Implications for organizational management ==
CAS approaches to strategy seek to understand the nature of system constraints and agent interaction and generally takes an evolutionary or naturalistic approach to strategy.  Some research integrates [[computer simulation and organizational studies]].

===Complexity theory and knowledge management===
Complexity theory also relates to [[knowledge management]] (KM) and [[organizational learning]] (OL). "Complex systems are, by any other definition, learning organizations."<ref name="CAS-T-28" /> Complexity Theory, KM, and OL are all complementary and co-dependent.<ref name="CAS-T-28" /> “KM and OL each lack a theory of how cognition happens in human social systems – complexity theory offers this missing piece”.<ref name="CAS-T-28" />

=== Complexity theory and project management ===
Complexity theory is also being used to better understand new ways of doing [[project management]], as traditional models have been found lacking to current challenges.<ref name="Saynisch 2010">{{cite journal|author=Saynisch, Manfred|title=Beyond frontiers of traditional project management: An approach to evolutionary, self-organizational principles and the complexity theory—results of the research program|journal=Project Management Journal|volume=41|issue=2|year=2010|pages=21–37|doi=10.1002/pmj.20159|s2cid=47040850}}</ref>{{rp|23}} This approaches advocates forming a "culture of trust" that "welcomes outsiders, embraces new ideas, and promotes cooperation."<ref name="Saynisch 2010"/>{{rp|35}}

=== Recommendations for managers ===
Complexity Theory implies approaches that focus on flatter, more flexible organizations, rather than top-down, command-and-control styles of management.<ref name="Burnes, Bernard 2005"/>{{rp|84}}<ref name=CAS-T-29/><ref name=CAS-T-35/>

==Additional examples ==
A typical example for an organization behaving as CAS is Wikipedia<ref name="CAS-T-11" /> – collaborated and managed by a loosely organized management structure,<ref name="CAS-T-11" /> composed of a complex mix of [[human–computer interaction]]s.<ref name="CAS-T-16" /><ref name="CAS-T-17" /><ref name="CAS-T-18" /> By managing behavior, and not only mere content, Wikipedia uses simple rules to produce a complex, evolving knowledge base which has largely replaced older sources in popular use.

Other examples include the complex [[Macroeconomics|global macroeconomic network]] within a country or group of countries<!--much more complex than mere macroeconomic, any help in redirecting to a better page would be welcomed--->; [[stock market]] and complex web of [[Cross-border_cooperation|cross-border]] [[holding companies]]; [[manufacturing|manufacturing business]]es<!--much more complex than mere manufacturing, any help in rewording would be welcomed--->; and any human social group-based endeavor in a particular [[ideology]] and [[social system]] such as [[political party|political parties]], [[community|communities]], [[geopolitical]] organizations, and [[terrorist network analysis|terrorist networks]] of both hierarchical and [[leaderless resistance|leaderless]] nature.<ref name="GT-33" />  This new macro level state may create difficulty for an observer in explaining and describing the collective behavior in terms of its constituent parts, as a result of the complex dynamic networks of interactions, outlined earlier.<ref name="CAS-T-01" />
