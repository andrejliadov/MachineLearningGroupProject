In [[decision theory]], a '''decision rule''' is a function which maps an observation to an appropriate action. Decision rules play an important role in the theory of [[statistics]] and [[economics]], and are closely related to the concept of a [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] in [[game theory]].

In order to evaluate the usefulness of a decision rule, it is necessary to have a [[loss function]] detailing the outcome of each action under different states.

== Formal definition ==
Given an observable random variable ''X'' over the [[probability space]] <math> \scriptstyle (\mathcal{X},\Sigma, P_\theta)</math>, determined by a parameter ''θ''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''Θ'', and a set ''A'' of possible actions, a (deterministic) '''decision rule''' is a function ''δ''&nbsp;:&nbsp;<math>\scriptstyle\mathcal{X}</math>→&nbsp;''A''.

== Examples of decision rules ==
* An [[estimator]] is a decision rule used for estimating a parameter. In this case the set of actions is the parameter space, and a loss function details the cost of the discrepancy between the true value of the parameter and the estimated value. For example, in a linear model with a single scalar parameter <math>\theta</math>, the domain of <math>\theta</math> may extend over <math>\mathcal{R}</math> (all real numbers). An associated decision rule for estimating <math>\theta</math> from some observed data might be, "choose the value of the <math>\theta</math>, say <math>\hat{\theta}</math>, that minimizes the sum of squared error between some observed responses and responses predicted from the corresponding covariates given that you chose <math>\hat{\theta}</math>." Thus, the cost function is the sum of squared error, and one would aim to minimize this cost. Once the cost function is defined, <math>\hat{\theta}</math> could be chosen, for instance, using some optimization algorithm.
