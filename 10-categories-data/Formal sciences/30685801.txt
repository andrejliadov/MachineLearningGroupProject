'''Daycent''' is a daily time series [[biogeochemical]] [[Computer simulation|model]] used in [[agroecosystems]] to simulates [[Mass flux|fluxes]] of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] between the [[atmosphere]], [[vegetation]], and [[soil]].<ref>Del Grosso, S.J., Parton, W.J., Mosier, A.R., Hartman, M.D., Keough, C.A., Peterson, G.A., Ojima, D.S., Schimel, D.S., 2001.

(Eds.), Nitrogen in the Environment: Sources, Problems, and Management. Elsevier Science Publishers, The Netherlands, pp. 413-431.</ref>  It is a daily version of the [http://www.nrel.colostate.edu/projects/century/ CENTURY] biogeochemical model.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]]/ARS and the [[Colorado State University]] Natural Resource Ecology Lab are currently using the Daycent model to develop a national [[Emission inventory|inventory]] of [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] emissions from [[United States|U.S.]] [[Agricultural soil science|agricultural soils]]. This inventory will be compared and contrasted with the existing [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) agricultural N<sub>2</sub>O emissions inventory for the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads10/US-GHG-Inventory-2010_Upfront.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214516/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads10/US-GHG-Inventory-2010_Upfront.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-29 |title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 - 2008 |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |date=April 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>Del Grosso, S.J., Parton, W.J., Mosier, A.R., Walsh, M.K., Ojima, D.S., and Thorton, P.E.

Model inputs include daily maximum/minimum air [[temperature]] and [[precipitation]], surface [[soil texture]] class, and [[land cover]]/[[land use|use]] data. Model outputs include daily fluxes of various N-gas species (e.g., [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]], [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]], [[Nitrogen gas|N<sub>2</sub>]]); daily [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]] flux from [[Soil respiration#Soil animals|heterotrophic soil respiration]]; soil organic [[carbon|C]] and [[nitrogen|N]]; [[net primary productivity]]; daily water and [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub>) leaching, and other [[ecosystem]] parameters. Daycent has been tested with data from various native and managed systems.<ref>Del Grosso, S.J., Parton, W.J., Mosier, A.R., Hartman, M.D., Brenner, J., Ojima, D.S., Schimel, D.S., 2001a.
