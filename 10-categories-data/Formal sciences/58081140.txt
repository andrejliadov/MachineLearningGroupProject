{{DISPLAYTITLE:Actino-''ugpB'' RNA motif}}
The '''Actino-''ugpB'' RNA motif''' is a conserved [[RNA]] structure that was [[Bioinformatics discovery of non-coding RNAs|discovered by bioinformatics]].<ref name="Weinberg2017b">{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinberg Z, Lünse CE, Corbino KA, Ames TD, Nelson JW, Roth A, Perkins KR, Sherlock ME, Breaker RR |title=Detection of 224 candidate structured RNAs by comparative analysis of specific subsets of intergenic regions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=45 |issue=18 |pages=10811–10823 |date=October 2017 |pmid=28977401 |pmc=5737381 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkx699 |url=}}</ref>
Actino-''ugpB'' motifs are found in strains of the species ''[[Gardnerella vaginalis]]'', within the phylum [[Actinobacteria]].

It is ambiguous whether Actino-''ugpB'' RNAs function as [[cis-regulatory element]]s or whether they operate in ''trans''.  Many of the RNAs are upstream of the gene 'ugpB', which encodes a protein putatively involved in [[sugar]] [[secretion|transport]].  However, several of the RNAs are not located upstream of a protein-coding [[gene]].  Structurally, the motif consists of two hairpins with conserved [[nucleotide]]s located in the stems and outside of the hairpins, but not in their terminal loops.
