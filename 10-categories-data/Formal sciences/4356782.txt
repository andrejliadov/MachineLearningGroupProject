{{short description|Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) special interest group}}
'''ACM SIGACT''' or '''SIGACT''' is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] [[Special Interest Group]] on Algorithms and Computation Theory, whose purpose is support of research in [[theoretical computer science]]. It was founded in 1968 by [[Patrick C. Fischer]].<ref>{{citation|journal=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 31, 2011|title=Patrick C. Fischer, Early Unabomber Target, Is Dead at 75|first=Paul|last=Vitello|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/us/31fischer.html?_r=1}}.</ref>

==Publications==
SIGACT publishes a quarterly print newsletter, '''''SIGACT News'''''. Its online version, ''SIGACT News Online'', is available since 1996 for SIGACT members, with unrestricted access to some features.

==Conferences==
SIGACT sponsors or has sponsored several annual conferences.

*COLT: Conference on Learning Theory, until 1999 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE249|title=Event: COLT|work=acm.org}}</ref>
*PODC: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (jointly sponsored by SIGOPS)
*PODS: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Database Systems]]
*POPL: ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages]]
*SOCG: ACM [[Symposium on Computational Geometry]] (jointly sponsored by [[SIGGRAPH]]), until 2014 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://makingsocg.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/results-of-the-vote/|title=Results of the Vote|work=Making SOCG}}</ref>
*SODA: ACM/SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (jointly sponsored by the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]]). Two annual workshops held in conjunction with SODA also have the same joint sponsorship:
**ALENEX: Workshop on Algorithms and Experiments
**ANALCO: Workshop on Analytic Algorithms and Combinatorics
*SPAA: ACM [[Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures]]
*STOC: ACM [[Symposium on the Theory of Computing]]

COLT, PODC, PODS, POPL, SODA, and STOC are all listed as highly cited venues by both citeseerx<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/stats/venues citeseerx venue impact factor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216011623/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/stats/venues |date=February 16, 2015 }}, citeseerx.</ref> and libra.<ref>[http://libra.msra.cn/conf_category_24.htm Libra Conferences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520015430/http://libra.msra.cn/conf_category_24.htm |date=May 20, 2009 }}, LIBRA.</ref>
