In computer networking, if the network is [[Bisection|bisected]] into two partitions, the '''bisection bandwidth''' of a [[network topology]] is the bandwidth available between the two partitions.<ref>{{cite book|author = John L.

Bisection bandwidth accounts for the bottleneck bandwidth of the entire network. Therefore bisection bandwidth represents bandwidth characteristics of the network better than any other metric.

== Bisection bandwidth calculations<ref name=":0" /> ==
For a [[Network topology|linear array]] with n nodes bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth. For linear array only one link needs to be broken to bisect the network into two partitions.

For [[Ring network|ring]] topology with n nodes two links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth becomes bandwidth of two links.

For [[Tree network|tree]] topology with n nodes can be bisected at the root by breaking one link, so bisection bandwidth is one link bandwidth.

For [[Mesh networking|Mesh]] topology with n nodes, <math>\sqrt{n}</math> links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of  <math>\sqrt{n}</math> links.

For [[Hypercube internetwork topology|Hyper-cube]] topology with n nodes, n/2 links should be broken to bisect the network, so bisection bandwidth is bandwidth of n/2 links.

== Significance of bisection bandwidth ==
Theoretical support for the importance of this measure of network performance was developed in the PhD research of [http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Thomborson:Clark_D=.html Clark Thomborson (formerly Clark Thompson)].<ref>{{cite thesis|url=https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~cthombor/Pubs/cmu-cs-80-140/cmu-cs-80-140scans.pdf|author=C. D. Thompson|title=A complexity theory for VLSI |publisher=Carnegie-Mellon University|year=1980|number=Technical Report CMU-CS-80-140}}</ref>  Thomborson proved that important algorithms for sorting, [[Fast Fourier transform]]ation, and matrix-matrix multiplication become communication-limited—as opposed to CPU-limited or memory-limited—on computers with insufficient bisection width.

Based on [[Bill Dally|Bill Dally's]] analysis of latency, average case throughput, and hot-spot throughput of m-ary n-cube networks<ref name=":0" /> for various m, It can be observed that low-dimensional networks, in comparison to high-dimensional networks (e.g., binary n-cubes) with the same bisection width (e.g., [[Torus interconnect|tori]]), have reduced latency and higher hot-spot throughput.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bill Dally|author-link=Bill Dally|title=Performance analysis of k-ary n-cube interconnection networks|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=39|pages=775–785|number=6|year=1990|doi=10.1109/12.53599|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.5096}}</ref>
