'''AREMOS''' was a [[data management]] and [[econometrics]] [[software]] package released by [[Global Insight]]. It was most popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, when it was used by leading economists.<ref>REVIEW: AREMOS DATA MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMETRIC SOFTWARE, VERSION 1.0 Economic Inquiry 26 (2), 365–367. {{doi|10.1111/j.1465-7295.1988.tb01501.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Jean-Louis |last=Brillet |title=Econometric modelling on microcomputers: A review of major software packages |journal=[[Journal of Applied Econometrics]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=73–92 |year=1989 |doi=10.1002/jae.3950040106 }}</ref> Developed as a DOS application by [[Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates - WEFA]] now [[IHS Markit]], it has gone through many iterations. Thomsons' Datastream macroeconomic databases which were accessible with AREMOS, were a key selling point.<ref>[http://www.highandwatt.com/efds/economics.htm Economics<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref>

The U.S. statistical agency [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] ran AREMOS extensively until 2015.<ref>[https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=2e6d509576eec4c4976eada451f50139&tab=core&_cview=0 AREMOS Software Licenses] at FedBizOpps.gov</ref>

Today its use is largely [[Legacy system|legacy]] and has been superseded by newer econometric packages such as [[EViews]], developed by WEFA successor company, IHS Markit. It is rumored that sales of AREMOS have been ended and access shut down in late 2015.
