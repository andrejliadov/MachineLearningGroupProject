'''Closed ecological systems''' ('''CES''') are [[ecosystems]] that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small [[wikt:manmade|manmade]] ecosystems. Such systems are scientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a [[life support system]] during [[space flight]]s, in [[space stations]] or [[space habitat]]s.<ref>{{cite book | title=Manmade Closed Ecological Systems | author= I.

In a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life form, such as a [[mouse]] or a [[human]], waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[feces]] and [[urine]] must eventually be converted into [[oxygen]], [[food]], and [[water]].

A closed ecological system must contain at least one [[autotroph]]ic organism. While both [[chemotroph]]ic and [[phototroph]]ic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green [[algae]].

== Examples ==

A closed ecological system for an entire planet is called an [[Ecosphere (planetary)|ecosphere]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fs/turner/pdfs/lexicon_of_the_spheres.pdf|title=A Lexicon of the Spheres|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]|access-date=2016-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018011127/http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fs/turner/pdfs/lexicon_of_the_spheres.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-18|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/11|title=ESO 2 Science 11: The Ecosphere and the Ecosystems|publisher=Science Helpdesk}}</ref>

[[Artificiality|Man-made]] closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include [[Biosphere 2]], [[MELiSSA]], and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and [[BIOS-3]] projects.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575â€“85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | jstor=1313164 | pmid=11540303| doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[Bottle garden]]s and [[Ecosphere (aquarium)|aquarium ecospheres]] are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny [[shrimp]], [[algae]], [[gravel]], decorative [[Animal shell|shell]]s, and [[gorgonia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ecospheres.co.uk/what-is-an-ecosphere/  | title=What is an EcoSphere?

==In fiction==

The 1993 novel ''[[This Other Eden (novel)|This Other Eden]]'' by [[Ben Elton]] featured the development of "claustrospheres" which were closed ecological systems contained within a dome in which people could take refuge in the event of environmental collapse.

The critically panned 1996 
comedy film ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' involved the protagonists becoming trapped in a closed ecological system being run as an experiment.
