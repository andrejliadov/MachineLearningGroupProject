The '''Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society''' was first established in 1974 to promote philosophical conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research that are inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Graz: Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society |url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref><ref name=ALWS>{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at|access-date=2013-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114161932/http://www.alws.at/|archive-date=2013-11-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It is an international society, which also has a publication series.<ref name =ontos>{{cite web|title=Publications of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.ontos-verlag.de/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.browse&category_id=21&Itemid=1}}</ref>

==History==

In 1974, [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS), but it was the impetus of the first [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]] that led to its development as an international society. The location of the ALWS is in Kirchberg am Wechsel and the location was selected because Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools close Kirchberg am Wechsel in the 1920s.<ref name=ALWS/>

==Goals==

The ALWS has two primary goals. 
*To promote the analysis, tradition, and dissemination of Wittgenstein's philosophy.  
*To promote, more generally, philosophy that has its roots in Austria and other countries with emphasis on [[analytic philosophy]] inspired by Wittgenstein and [[philosophy of science]] inspired by, but not limited to, the philosophy of the Vienna Circle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Goals|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/unsere_ziele/|access-date=2013-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324140146/http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/unsere_ziele/|archive-date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Membership==

They currently report 120 members both national and international.  Individuals can download an application form their website.  Membership is decided by the Executive Committee of the ALWS based on academic criteria.  Students pay half the fee.  Members receive a 30% discount on fees for the International Wittgenstein Symposium and for ALWS publications.<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/mitgliedschaft/|access-date=2013-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324142452/http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/mitgliedschaft/|archive-date=2013-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>
