The '''''Historical Thesaurus of English''''' ('''''HTE''''') is the largest [[thesaurus]] in the world. It is called a ''historical thesaurus'' as it arranges the whole vocabulary of English, from the earliest written records in [[Old English]] to the present, according to the first documented occurrence of a word in the entire history of the English language. The HTE was conceived and begun in 1965 by the [[English Language]] & [[Linguistics]] department of the [[University of Glasgow]], who have ever since continued to compile the thesaurus. From the 1980s onwards the project was moved from paper-based records to a computer [[database]].

Today, the HTE is available to the public online, but a print version, the '''''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''HTOED''''') , was published in 2009.

== Main project: The Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE) ==
The ''Historical Thesaurus of English'' (''HTE'') is a complete [[database]] of all the words in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and other dictionaries (including [[Old English language|Old English]]), arranged by [[semantic field]] and date. In this way, the ''HTE'' arranges the whole vocabulary of [[English language|English]], from the earliest written records in Old English to the present, alongside dates of use.

It is the first historical thesaurus to be compiled for any of the world's languages and contains 800,000 meanings for 600,000 words, within 230,000 categories.<ref name="Woolcock">{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6644646.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Nicola | last=Woolcock | title=After a 44-year labour of love worlds biggest thesaurus is born | date=2009-07-06}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hitchings|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Hitchings|title=Historical Thesaurus is a masterpiece worth waiting 40 years for|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6413166/Historical-Thesaurus-is-a-masterpiece-worth-waiting-40-years-for.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2009|ref=Hitchings-2009|location=London}}</ref>  As the ''HTE'' website states, "in addition to providing hitherto unavailable information for linguistic and textual scholars, the ''Historical Thesaurus'' online is a rich resource for students of social and cultural history, showing how concepts developed through the words that refer to them."<ref name="hte">{{cite web |url=http://ht.ac.uk/ |title=Home page |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2019-10-15}}</ref>

=== Structure ===
The work is divided into three main sections: the External World, the Mind, and Society. These are broken down into successively narrower domains. The text eventually discriminates more than 236,000 categories.
