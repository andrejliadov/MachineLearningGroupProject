Mathematicians seek and use [[pattern]]s<ref name=future/><ref name=devlin/> to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the [[truth]] or falsity of such by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of [[physical objects]]. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The [[research]] required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|title=Eudoxus' Influence on Euclid's Elements with a close look at The Method of Exhaustion|last=Wise|first=David|website=jwilson.coe.uga.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601004355/http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|archive-date=June 1, 2019|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.<ref>Eves, p. 306</ref>

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[finance]], and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]] (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.<ref>Peterson, p. 12</ref><ref name=wigner1960 />

==History==
{{main|History of mathematics}}
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]].

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.<ref>See, for example, Raymond L.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&nbsp;million, and more than 75&nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''máthēma'' (''{{Lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|en|μάθημα}}|label=none}}''), meaning "that which is learnt,"<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=mathematic (n.)|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=March 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "what one gets to know," hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.<ref>Both meanings can be found in Plato, the narrower in [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+6.510c&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168 510c], but Plato did not use a ''math-'' word; Aristotle did, commenting on it. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}. ''OED Online'', "Mathematics".</ref> Its [[adjective]] is ''mathēmatikós'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}}), meaning "related to learning" or "studious," which likewise further came to mean "mathematical." In particular, ''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}}; {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}) meant "the mathematical art."

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|title=Pythagoras – Greek Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215259/https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "[[astrology]]" (or sometimes "[[astronomy]]") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.<ref name="Boas">{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | author-link=Ralph P.

The apparent [[plural]] form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin [[Neuter (grammar)|neuter]] plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural ''ta mathēmatiká'' ({{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}}), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.<ref>''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"</ref> In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.<ref name=maths>[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

==Definitions of mathematics==
[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World.]]
{{main|Definitions of mathematics}}Mathematics has no generally accepted definition.<ref name="Mura" /><ref name="Runge" /> [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.<ref name="Franklin">{{Cite book|last=Franklin|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104|title=Philosophy of Mathematics|date=2009-07-08|isbn=978-0-08-093058-9|pages=104–106|access-date=July 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906134402/https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 19th&nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.<ref name="Cajori">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematics|publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint)|year=1893|isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&pg=PA285 285–86]|author-link=Florian Cajori}}</ref>

A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.<ref name="Mura" /> There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.<ref name="Runge" /> Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."<ref name="Mura" />

=== Three leading types ===
Three leading types of definition of mathematics today are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.<ref name="Snapper">{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |jstor=2689412 }}</ref> All have severe flaws, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.<ref name="Snapper" />

==== Logicist definitions ====
An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was that of [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1870): "the science that draws necessary conclusions."<ref name="Peirce">{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |publisher=Van Nostrand |author=Peirce, Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ/page/n62 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's (1903) "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic."<ref name="Russell">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog/page/n36 5]|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|access-date=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

==== Intuitionist definitions ====
[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."<ref name=Snapper/> A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct. Intuitionists also reject the [[law of excluded middle]] (i.e., <math>P \vee \neg P</math>). While this stance does force them to reject one common version of [[proof by contradiction]] as a viable proof method, namely the inference of <math>P</math> from <math>\neg P \to \bot</math>, they are still able to infer <math>\neg P</math> from <math>P \to \bot</math>. For them, <math> \neg (\neg P) </math> is a strictly weaker statement than <math> P </math>.<ref name=SEP-P>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/ Intuitionism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>

==== Formalist definitions ====
[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".<ref name="Curry">{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |author-link=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}</ref> A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' on how the tokens are to be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth", and is used to refer to a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".<ref name="Waltershausen">Waltershausen, p. 79</ref> More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archive-date=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."<ref>Popper 1995, p. 56</ref> Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |year=2002 |orig-year=[https://books.google.com/?id=KZvXAAAAMAAJ 1959] |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-0-415-27843-0 |page=[18]}}</ref>

Several authors consider that mathematics is not a science because it does not rely on [[empirical evidence]].<ref name= "Bishop1991">{{cite book | last1 = Bishop | first1 = Alan | year = 1991 | chapter = Environmental activities and mathematical culture | title = Mathematical Enculturation: A Cultural Perspective on Mathematics Education | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9AgrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 | pages = 20–59 | location = Norwell, Massachusetts | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn = 978-0-792-31270-3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}</ref><ref name= "Nickles2013" >{{cite book | last = Nickles | first = Thomas | year = 2013 | chapter = The Problem of Demarcation | title = Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem | page = 104 | location = Chicago | publisher = The University of Chicago Press}}</ref><ref name="Pigliucci2014">{{Cite magazine| year = 2014| last = [[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci]]| first = Massimo| title = Are There 'Other' Ways of Knowing?| magazine = [[Philosophy Now]]| url = https://philosophynow.org/issues/102/Are_There_Other_Ways_of_Knowing| access-date = 6 April 2020}}</ref>

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians<ref>See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''</ref> feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borel|first=Armand|date=March 2017|title=Mathematics: Art and Science|journal=EMS Newsletter|volume=3|issue=103|pages=37–45|doi=10.4171/news/103/8|issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}</ref>

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".<ref name=wigner1960>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archive-date=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&nbsp;pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |access-date=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}</ref> Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments have been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.

The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref>

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |access-date=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archive-date=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.<ref>Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].</ref> [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."</ref>

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|978-0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.<ref>"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|978-0-486-61630-8}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."</ref>

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model—the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===

====Number systems and number theory====
{{Main|Arithmetic|Number system|Number theory}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s
<math>\mathbb{N}</math>
and [[integer]]s 
<math>\mathbb{Z}</math>
("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s
<math>\mathbb{Q}</math>
("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s,
<math>\mathbb{R}</math>
which are used to represent limits of sequences of rational numbers and [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to the [[complex number]]s
<math>\mathbb{C}</math>.
According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], all polynomial [[equation]]s in one unknown with complex coefficients have a solution in the complex numbers, regardless of degree of the polynomial.
<math>\mathbb{N},\ \mathbb{Z},\ \mathbb{Q},\ \mathbb{R}</math> and <math>\mathbb{C}</math>
are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]".  Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

:{|style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

:{|style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15"

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]—in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proven only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[Industry (manufacturing)|industry]]. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]].

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincaré Conjecture]], has been solved.

Mathematicians seek and use [[pattern]]s<ref name=future/><ref name=devlin/> to formulate new [[conjecture]]s; they resolve the [[truth]] or falsity of such by [[mathematical proof]]. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning can be used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]] and [[logic]], mathematics developed from [[counting]], [[calculation]], [[measurement]], and the systematic study of the [[shape]]s and [[motion (physics)|motions]] of [[physical objects]]. Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. The [[research]] required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

[[Logic|Rigorous arguments]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|title=Eudoxus' Influence on Euclid's Elements with a close look at The Method of Exhaustion|last=Wise|first=David|website=jwilson.coe.uga.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601004355/http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|archive-date=June 1, 2019|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Since the pioneering work of [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1858–1932), [[David Hilbert]] (1862–1943), and others [[Foundations of mathematics|on axiomatic systems in the late 19th&nbsp;century]], it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by [[Mathematical rigor|rigorous]] [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from appropriately chosen [[axiom]]s and [[definition]]s. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when mathematical innovations interacting with new [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.<ref>Eves, p. 306</ref>

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[finance]], and the [[social sciences]]. [[Applied mathematics]] has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]]. Mathematicians engage in [[pure mathematics]] (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.<ref>Peterson, p. 12</ref><ref name=wigner1960 />

==History==
{{main|History of mathematics}}
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]].

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.<ref>See, for example, Raymond L.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science, to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&nbsp;million, and more than 75&nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''máthēma'' (''{{Lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|en|μάθημα}}|label=none}}''), meaning "that which is learnt,"<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=mathematic (n.)|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=March 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "what one gets to know," hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.<ref>Both meanings can be found in Plato, the narrower in [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+6.510c&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168 510c], but Plato did not use a ''math-'' word; Aristotle did, commenting on it. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}. ''OED Online'', "Mathematics".</ref> Its [[adjective]] is ''mathēmatikós'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}}), meaning "related to learning" or "studious," which likewise further came to mean "mathematical." In particular, ''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}}; {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}) meant "the mathematical art."

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|title=Pythagoras – Greek Mathematics – The Story of Mathematics|website=www.storyofmathematics.com|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215259/https://www.storyofmathematics.com/greek_pythagoras.html|archive-date=September 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "[[astrology]]" (or sometimes "[[astronomy]]") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.<ref name="Boas">{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P.

The apparent [[plural]] form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin [[Neuter (grammar)|neuter]] plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural ''ta mathēmatiká'' ({{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}}), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.<ref>''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"</ref> In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.<ref name=maths>[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"].

==Definitions of mathematics==
[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World.]]
{{main|Definitions of mathematics}}Mathematics has no generally accepted definition.<ref name="Mura" /><ref name="Runge" /> [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.<ref name="Franklin">{{Cite book|last=Franklin|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104|title=Philosophy of Mathematics|date=2009-07-08|isbn=978-0-08-093058-9|pages=104–106|access-date=July 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906134402/https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 19th&nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.<ref name="Cajori">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematics|publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint)|year=1893|isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&pg=PA285 285–86]|author-link=Florian Cajori}}</ref>

A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.<ref name="Mura" /> There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.<ref name="Runge" /> Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."<ref name="Mura" />

=== Three leading types ===
Three leading types of definition of mathematics today are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.<ref name="Snapper">{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |jstor=2689412 }}</ref> All have severe flaws, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.<ref name="Snapper" />

==== Logicist definitions ====
An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was that of [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1870): "the science that draws necessary conclusions."<ref name="Peirce">{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |publisher=Van Nostrand |author=Peirce, Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ/page/n62 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's (1903) "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic."<ref name="Russell">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog/page/n36 5]|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|access-date=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

==== Intuitionist definitions ====
[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."<ref name=Snapper/> A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct. Intuitionists also reject the [[law of excluded middle]] (i.e., <math>P \vee \neg P</math>). While this stance does force them to reject one common version of [[proof by contradiction]] as a viable proof method, namely the inference of <math>P</math> from <math>\neg P \to \bot</math>, they are still able to infer <math>\neg P</math> from <math>P \to \bot</math>. For them, <math> \neg (\neg P) </math> is a strictly weaker statement than <math> P </math>.<ref name=SEP-P>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/ Intuitionism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>

==== Formalist definitions ====
[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".<ref name="Curry">{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |author-link=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}</ref> A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' on how the tokens are to be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth", and is used to refer to a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]

The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".<ref name="Waltershausen">Waltershausen, p. 79</ref> More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archive-date=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."<ref>Popper 1995, p. 56</ref> Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |year=2002 |orig-year=[https://books.google.com/?id=KZvXAAAAMAAJ 1959] |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-0-415-27843-0 |page=[18]}}</ref>

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians<ref>See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''</ref> feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borel|first=Armand|date=March 2017|title=Mathematics: Art and Science|journal=EMS Newsletter|volume=3|issue=103|pages=37–45|doi=10.4171/news/103/8|issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}</ref>

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".<ref name=wigner1960>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archive-date=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&nbsp;pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |access-date=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}</ref> Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments have been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.

The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref>

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |access-date=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archive-date=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.<ref>Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].</ref> [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."</ref>

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|978-0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.<ref>"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|978-0-486-61630-8}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."</ref>

==Fields of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]
Mathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].

[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model—the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

===Pure mathematics===
{{main|Pure mathematics}}

====Number systems and number theory====
{{Main|Arithmetic|Number system|Number theory}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
The study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s
<math>\mathbb{N}</math>
and [[integer]]s 
<math>\mathbb{Z}</math>
("whole numbers") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.

As the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s
<math>\mathbb{Q}</math>
("[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s,
<math>\mathbb{R}</math>
which are used to represent limits of sequences of rational numbers and [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to the [[complex number]]s
<math>\mathbb{C}</math>.
According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], all polynomial [[equation]]s in one unknown with complex coefficients have a solution in the complex numbers, regardless of degree of the polynomial.
<math>\mathbb{N},\ \mathbb{Z},\ \mathbb{Q},\ \mathbb{R}</math> and <math>\mathbb{C}</math>
are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of "[[infinity]]".  Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.

:{|style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="20"

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Many mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

:{|style="border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto" cellspacing="15"

|}

====Space====
{{Main|Geometry}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
The study of space originates with [[geometry]]—in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincaré conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proven only with the help of computers.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[Industry (manufacturing)|industry]]. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];<ref>[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref> the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data becomes available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]—with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.<ref name="RaoOpt">{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |author-link=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincaré Conjecture]], has been solved.
