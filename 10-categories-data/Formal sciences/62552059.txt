'''''AI Dungeon''''' is a [[free-to-play]] single-player and multiplayer [[Interactive fiction|text adventure game]] which uses [[artificial intelligence]] to generate unlimited content. It also allows players to create and share their own custom adventure settings. The game's first version was made available on [[Project Jupyter|Colab]] in May 2019, and its second version (initially called ''AI Dungeon 2'') was released online and for [[iOS]] & [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in December 2019. The AI model was then upgraded in July 2020.

''AI Dungeon'' is a text adventure game; however, unlike traditional text adventure games, which use pre-written content,<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|last=Nelius|first=Joanna|date=2020-08-03|title=This AI-Powered Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Text Game Is Super Fun and Makes No Sense|url=https://gizmodo.com/this-ai-powered-choose-your-own-adventure-text-game-is-1844593111|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-04|website=Gizmodo|language=en-us}}</ref> ''AI Dungeon'' uses artificial intelligence to generate effectively limitless open-ended storylines.<ref>{{cite web|last=Macgregor|first=Jody|date=December 8, 2019|title=This AI writes a text adventure while you play it|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/this-ai-writes-a-text-adventure-while-you-play-it/|access-date=December 10, 2019|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Vincent|first=James|date=December 6, 2019|title=This AI text adventure game has pretty much infinite possibilities|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/6/20998993/ai-dungeon-2-choose-your-own-adventure-game-text-nick-walton-gpt-machine-learning|access-date=December 10, 2019|work=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=":18">{{Cite web|last=Grannell|first=Craig|date=2020-01-12|title=App of the week: AI Dungeon|url=https://www.stuff.tv/app-reviews/ai-dungeon/review|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

When first beginning the game, players are greeted by the following opening:<blockquote>"You're about to enter a world of endless possibilities, where you can do absolutely anything you can imagine.... Will you proceed?"<ref name=":4" /></blockquote>Players are then prompted to choose a setting for their adventure (e.g. [[fantasy]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]], [[cyberpunk]], [[Zombie|zombies]]),<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|last=Mundy|first=Jon|date=2020-02-28|title=AI Dungeon - freeform narrative adventures|url=https://www.tapsmart.com/news/ai-dungeon-freeform-narrative-adventures/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-12|website=TapSmart|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite web|last=Kulp|first=Patrick|date=2020-07-24|title=A Cutting-Edge Storytelling AI Co-Wrote This Story on Itself|url=https://www.adweek.com/creativity/we-asked-todays-most-advanced-storytelling-ai-to-co-write-a-story-about-itself/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-29|website=Adweek|language=en-US}}</ref> followed by other options relevant to the setting (such as [[character class]] for fantasy settings).<ref>{{Cite web|last=McDonald|first=Glenn|date=2020-03-18|title=I slayed dragons with an AI-powered dungeon master|url=https://expmag.com/2020/03/i-slayed-dragons-with-an-ai-powered-dungeon-master/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Experience Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

After beginning an adventure, there are three main interaction methods that can be chosen for each of the player's pieces of text input:<ref name="verge2" />

* Do: Must be followed by a [[verb]], allowing the player to perform an action.
* Say: Must be followed by dialog sentences, allowing players to communicate with other characters.
* Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events.
The game's artificial intelligence allows it to adapt and respond to almost any action entered by the player.<ref name=":12" />

Providing blank input can also be used to prompt the AI to generate further content, and the game also provides players with options to [[Undo|undo/redo]] or modify recent events, in order to improve the game's narrative.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gailloreto|first=Coleman|date=2020-11-15|title=How Good Is The AI Dungeon At Narrating Roleplaying Games?|url=https://screenrant.com/ai-dungeon-game-run-dm-gm-tabletop-rpgs/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-20|website=[[ScreenRant]]|language=en-US}}</ref> Players are also given an option to explicitly tell the AI what elements to "remember" for reference in future parts of their playthrough.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Creswell|first=Jacob|date=2020-11-17|title=AI Dungeon Proves Machine Learning Games Are the Future|url=https://www.cbr.com/ai-dungeon-machine-learning-future-of-games/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-25|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== User-generated content ===
In addition to the pre-configured settings available in ''AI Dungeon'', players also have the ability to create entirely custom "adventures" from scratch, simply by describing the setting in text format. The AI will then generate a setting, based on the user's input.<ref name="verge2" /><ref name=":9" />

Custom adventures that players create can also be published for others to play through in their own way. The game provides an interface for browsing published adventures, along with the ability to leave comments and upvote/[[Like button|like]] each one.

=== Multiplayer ===
''AI Dungeon'' also features a multiplayer mode, whereby different players each have a dedicated character, and can take turns interacting with the AI within the same game session. This supports both online play across multiple devices or local "pass-n-play" style using a shared device.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

Unlike the single-player game, in which actions and stories use [[Narration#Second-person|second person narration]] ("you..."), multiplayer game stories are presented using [[Narration|third-person narration]].<ref name=":2" />

Each game's host player is given additional permissions (likened to that of a [[Dungeons & Dragons]] [[Dungeon Master]]) whereby they can supervise the AI and make modifications to its output.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Worlds ===
''AI Dungeon'' also provides players with the ability to set their adventures within specific 'Worlds', which give context to the broader environment in which the adventure takes place.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|last=Orr|first=Andrew|date=2020-10-01|title=Delve Into the 'AI Dungeon' for Text-Based Adventures|url=https://www.macobserver.com/cool-stuff-found/delve-into-ai-dungeon/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-10-03|website=The Mac Observer|language=en-US}}</ref> This feature was first released with two different worlds available for selection:

* "Xaxas is a world of peace and prosperity. It is a land in which all races live together in harmony."<ref name=":20" />
* "Kedar is a world of dragons, demons, and monsters."<ref name=":20" />

=== Premium features ===
The game also features additional functionality for players who pay for a monthly premium subscription, such as:

* Access to the advanced ''Dragon'' AI model.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|last=Cox|first=Matt|date=2020-08-03|title=Console an AI about its lack of sentience in AI Dungeon 2|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/08/03/console-an-ai-about-its-lack-of-sentience-in-ai-dungeon-2/|access-date=2020-08-03|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US}}</ref>
*[[Text-to-speech]] functionality to provide audio narration.
* Custom scripts when creating adventures.
* The ability to configure advanced settings, such as the length and randomness level of responses.

=== Artbreeder content ===
''AI Dungeon'' also provides the ability for players to select a premade [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] for themselves which were generated by Artbreeder, an artificial intelligence website which uses [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN) technology to combine and synthesize images.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kulicki|first=Maks|date=2020-05-22|title=3 Artificial Intelligence tools to enhance your creativity|url=https://becominghuman.ai/3-artificial-intelligence-tools-to-enhance-your-creativity-adc9cbb8c388|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref>

“I realized that there were no games available that gave you the same freedom to do anything that I found in [Dungeons & Dragons]<ref name=":2" /> ... You can be so creative compared to other games."<ref name=":8" /></blockquote>
This led him to the question:<ref name=":2" /><blockquote>"What if you could make an AI dungeon master?"<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Lim|first=Hengtee|date=2020-06-11|title=Can AI Make Video Games? - How Nick Walton Created AI Dungeon|url=https://lionbridge.ai/articles/can-ai-make-video-games-how-nick-walton-created-ai-dungeon/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-11|website=Lionbridge AI|language=en}}</ref></blockquote>However, despite this focus on player freedom, unlike later versions of ''AI Dungeon'', the original did not allow players to specify any action they wanted. Instead, it generated them a finite list of possible actions to choose from.<ref name=":14" />

This first version of the game was released to the public in May 2019.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> It was released within Google Colab (an online [[Google]] tool for [[Data science|data scientists]] and AI researchers, which allows for free execution of code on Google-hosted machines<ref>{{Cite web|last=Li|first=Abner|date=2020-02-08|title=Google introduces Colab Pro w/ faster GPUs, more memory|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/02/08/google-introduces-colab-pro/|access-date=2020-07-26|website=9to5Google|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":12" />); however, it required the downloading of the full model for each player (a size of 5 [[Gigabyte|gigabytes]] at the time).<ref name=":12" /> Within days of the initial release, this mandatory download resulted in [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] charges of over $20,000, forcing the temporary shut-down of the game until a [[peer-to-peer]] alternative solution was established.<ref name=":12" />

This initial version is not to be confused with another GPT-2-based adventure game, ''GPT Adventure'', created by [[Northwestern University]] [[neuroscience]] [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] student Nathan Whitmore, [[Training, validation, and test sets|trained]] using [[1970s]] text-based games (such as [[Zork]]),<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2019-09-16|title=A student turned the world's best AI bot into a choose your own adventure game|url=https://diagram.news/openai-chat-bot-turned-choose-your-own-adventure-game/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Diagram News}}</ref> and released (also on Google Colab) several months after the public release of ''AI Dungeon''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rayne|first=Elizabeth|date=2019-09-09|title=This AI 'choose your own adventure' game literally writes itself as you play|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/this-ai-choose-your-own-adventure-game-literally-writes-itself-as-you-play|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=SYFY Wire|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Robitzski|first=Dan|date=2019-09-05|title=A neural network dreams up this text adventure game as you play|url=https://futurism.com/text-adventure-game-neural-network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=Futurism|language=en}}</ref>

Reflecting later, in July 2020, on the first version of ''AI Dungeon'', its creator, Walton, stated that:<blockquote>"The first version of AI Dungeon was entertaining in its own wacky way, but it could almost never form a cohesive story ... it was nothing like what it’s become today."<ref name=":5" /></blockquote>

=== ''AI Dungeon 2'' (Full GPT-2) ===
In November 2019, a new, 'full' version of GPT-2 was released by OpenAI. This new model included support for 1.5 [[billion]] parameters (which determine the accuracy with which a [[Machine learning|machine learning model]] can perform a task<ref>{{Cite web|last=Guo|first=Jingru|title=AI Notes: Parameter optimization in neural networks|url=https://www.deeplearning.ai/ai-notes/optimization/|access-date=2020-07-15|website=deeplearning.ai}}</ref>), compared with the 126 million parameter version used in the earliest stages of ''AI Dungeon''<nowiki/>'s development.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" /> The game was recreated by Walton, leveraging this new version of the model, and temporarily rebranded as ''AI Dungeon 2''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=December 6, 2019|title=In AI Dungeon 2, You Can Do Anything--Even Start A Rock Band Made Of Skeletons|url=https://kotaku.com/in-ai-dungeon-2-you-can-do-anything-even-start-a-rock-1840276553|access-date=December 14, 2019|website=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>

At this time, Nick Walton also established a [[Patreon]] campaign to support the game's further growth (such as addition of multiplayer and voice support,<ref name=":12" /> along with longer-term plans to include music and image content<ref name=":12" />) and turn the game into a commercial endeavor, which Walton felt was necessary in order to cover the costs of delivering a high-quality version of the game.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":12" /> ''AI Dungeon'' was one of the only commercial applications to be based upon GPT-2.<ref name=":13" />

=== ''Dragon'' model release (GPT-3) ===
In July 2020, the developers introduced a premium-exclusive version of the AI model, named ''Dragon'', which uses OpenAI's new [[Application programming interface|API]] for leveraging the [[GPT-3]] model without maintaining a local copy (released on June 11, 2020<ref name=":7" />).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|date=2020-07-17|title=The new, GPT-3-powered version of AI Dungeon is scarily good|url=https://boingboing.net/2020/07/17/the-new-gpt-3-powered-version.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Boing Boing|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> GPT-3 was trained with 570 gigabytes of text content (approximately one [[trillion]] words, with a $12 million development cost<ref name=":13" />) and can support 175 billion parameters, compared to the 40GB of training content and 1.5 billion parameters of GPT-2.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Heaven|first=Will Douglas|date=2020-07-20|title=OpenAI's new language generator GPT-3 is shockingly good—and completely mindless|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/20/1005454/openai-machine-learning-language-generator-gpt-3-nlp/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-26|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6" /> This upgrade allowed ''AI Dungeon'' to maintain a much more coherent story than previously possible.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|last=Bastian|first=Matthias|date=2020-07-18|title=AI Dungeon: KI-Textadventure mit GPT-3 "ein Paradigmenwechsel"|url=https://mixed.de/ai-dungeon-ki-textadventure-laeuft-mit-gpt-3/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-19|website=MIXED|language=de-DE}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Nieri|first=Adam|date=2020-07-18|title=AI-written Scenario for Dungeons & Dragons Is Actually Quite Good|url=https://mindmatters.ai/2020/07/ai-written-scenario-for-dungeons-dragons-is-actually-quite-good/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-07-19|website=Mind Matters|language=en-US}}</ref>

It's just much more coherent in terms of understanding who the characters are, what they’re saying, what’s going on in the story and just being able to write an interesting and believable story."<ref name=":13" /></blockquote>In the latter half of 2020, the 'Worlds' feature was added to ''AI Dungeon'', providing players with a selection of overarching worlds in which their adventures can take place.<ref name=":20" />

== Reception ==
Approximately two thousand people played the original version of the game within the first month of its May 2019 release.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" /> By contrast, within a week of its December 2019 relaunch, the game reached over 100,000 players and over 500,000 play-throughs,<ref name=":0" /> and reached 1.5 million players by June 2020.<ref name=":3" />

As of December 2019, the game's corresponding Patreon campaign was raising approximately $15,000 per month.<ref name="verge2" />

=== GPT-2 edition reviews ===
{{Video game reviews|rev1=''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''|rev1Score={{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=":18" />|rev2=''TapSmart''|rev2Score={{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=":9" />|rev3=''148Apps''|rev3Score={{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=":19" />}}In his January 2020 review of the GPT-2-powered version of ''AI Dungeon'' (known at the time as ''AI Dungeon 2''), Craig Grannell of ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff Magazine]]'' named it 'App of the Week' and awarded it 4 out of 5 stars. Grannell praised the game's flexibility and its custom story feature, but criticised the abrupt shifts in content that were common in the GPT-2 edition of the game:<ref name=":18" /><blockquote>[''AI Dungeon'' is] an endless world of dreamlike storytelling, and a fascinating glimpse into the future of AI.<ref name=":18" /></blockquote>Campbell Bird of ''148Apps'' also awarded this edition of the game 4 out of 5 stars in his review, also praising its creativity whilst criticising the lack of memory for previous content:<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|last=Bird|first=Campbell|date=2019-12-30|title=AI Dungeon review|url=https://www.148apps.com/reviews/ai-dungeon-review/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-05|website=148Apps}}</ref><blockquote>''AI Dungeon'' is like doing improv with a partner who is equal parts enthusiastic and drunk ... [It] is a game that’s charming, occasionally frustrating, but mostly just impressive in its raw creativity and spirit.<ref name=":19" /></blockquote>Jon Mundy of ''TapSmart'' awarded it a 3 out of 5 star rating, similarly praising its variety and the "magical" custom adventure option, but described its adventure narratives as "often too passive and vague" and lacking in resolution.<ref name=":9" />

=== Creating non-game content ===
In addition to those who used ''AI Dungeon'' for its primary purpose as a game, other users experimented with using its language generation interface to create other forms of content that would not be found in traditional games (primarily via the custom adventure option). Although the game was primarily trained using text adventures, training content for the GPT models themselves included large amounts of web content (including the entirety of the English-language [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vincent|first=James|date=2020-07-30|title=OpenAI's latest breakthrough is astonishingly powerful, but still fighting its flaws|url=https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential|access-date=2020-07-31|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref>), thereby allowing the game to adapt to areas outside of this core focus.<ref name=":13" /> Examples of ''AI Dungeon'' being used in this way include it:
