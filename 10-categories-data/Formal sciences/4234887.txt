{{Advanced Placement}}
In the United States, '''Advanced Placement Computer Science''' is a suite of [[Advanced Placement]] courses and examinations covering areas of [[computer science]]. They are offered by the [[College Board]] to [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] students as an opportunity to earn college credit for [[college]]-level courses.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit & Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}</ref>  The suite consists of two current classes and one discontinued class.

AP Computer Science was taught in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] for the 1984–1998 exams, in [[C++]] for 1999–2003, and in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] since 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apsi.thecubscientist.com/05_DailySchedule/historyAPCS.pdf|title=AP Computer Science: A Brief History|last=Lew|first=Michael|website=Thecubscientist|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>

==AP Computer Science A==
[[AP Computer Science A]] is a programming class.<ref name=CSAcoursedetails>{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/course-details | title = AP Computer Science A: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board  | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}</ref>  The course emphasizes [[object-oriented programming]] methodology, especially problem solving and [[algorithm]] development, plus an overview of data structures and abstraction. The [[AP Computer Science A]] exam tests students on their knowledge of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computer science. 

The [[Microsoft]]-sponsored program [[Technology Education and Literacy in Schools]] (TEALS) aims to increase the number of students taking AP Computer Science classes.<ref name="Bishop2012-07-27">{{cite news|last=Bishop |first=Todd |date=2012-07-27 |title=Geek of the Week: Kevin Wang is putting computer scientists into high schools |url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |newspaper=[[GeekWire]] |accessdate=2015-07-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Zo1zm7iP?url=http://www.geekwire.com/2012/kevin-wang/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==AP Computer Science AB (discontinued)==
[[AP Computer Science AB]] included all the topics of AP Computer Science A, as well as a more formal and a more in-depth study of [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], and [[data abstraction]]. For example, [[binary trees]] were studied in AP Computer Science AB but not in AP Computer Science A. The use of [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive]] data structures and [[dynamic allocation|dynamically allocated]] structures were fundamental to AP Computer Science AB. 

AP Computer Science AB was equivalent to a full-year college course.<ref name=CSABhomepage>{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | title = AP Computer Science AB Course Home Page | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516202349/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/8153.html | archive-date = May 16, 2008}}</ref> 

Due to low numbers of students taking the exam, AP Computer Science AB was discontinued following the May 2009 exam administration.<ref name=CSABdiscontinued>{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | title = Important Announcement about AP Computer Science AB | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | year = 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409195847/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195948.html | archive-date = April 9, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Cech | first = Scott J. | url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2008/04/09/32ap.h27.html | title = College Board Intends to Drop AP Programs in Four Subjects | work = Education Week | date = April 9, 2008}}</ref>

==AP Computer Science Principles==
[[AP Computer Science Principles]] is an introductory course to computer science, "with a focus on how computing powers the world".<ref name=CSPcoursedetails>{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-principles/course-details | title = AP Computer Science Principles: Course Details | work = AP Students | publisher = The College Board | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}</ref> It is designed as a parallel to AP Computer Science A, to emphasize [[computational thinking]] and fluency. It is meant to be the equivalent of a first-semester course in computing.
