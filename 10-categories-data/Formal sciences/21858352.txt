'''Experimetrics''' comprises the body of econometric techniques that are customized to experimental applications.{{Neologism|date=May 2011}}


'''Experimetrics''' refers to the application of [[econometrics]] to [[economics]] experiments.<ref>Colin Camerer, ''Behavioral Game Theory: Experiments in Strategic Interaction'' (2003), p. 42.</ref>  Experimetrics refers to formal procedures used in designed investigations of economic hypotheses.<ref>Houser, D. (2008) [http://mason.gmu.edu/~dhouser/experimetrics.pdf "Experiments and Econometrics"] In: Durlauf, S. and Blume L. (Eds.), New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd edition.

One branch of experimetrics uses experiments to evaluate the performance of econometric estimators <ref>Cox,J.C., Oaxaca, R.L. (2009) "Chapter 114 Experimetrics: The Use of Market Experiments to Evaluate the Performance of Econometric Estimators", In: Charles R. Plott and Vernon L. Smith, Editor(s) (2008) ''Handbook of Experimental Economics Results'', Elsevier, 2008, Volume 1, Pages 1078-1086, {{ISBN|978-0-444-82642-8}}, {{DOI| 10.1016/S1574-0722(07)00114-X}} [https://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/Experimetrics.pdf PDF preprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114201243/https://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/Experimetrics.pdf |date=2009-11-14 }}</ref>

In short, experimetrics is the field of study that lies at the intersection of [[experimental economics]] and econometrics.  It refers to a  broad swath of the economics literature, and encompasses both the theoretical and statistical basis of econometrics, as well as the methodology of the experimental method.
