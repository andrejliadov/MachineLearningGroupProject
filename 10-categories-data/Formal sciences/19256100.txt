'''3D-Jury''' is a [[metaserver]] that aggregates and compares models from various [[protein structure prediction]] servers.  It takes in groups of predictions made by a collection of servers and assigns each pair a 3D-Jury score, based on structural similarity.  The score is generated by counting the number of [[Alpha carbon|C<sub>&alpha;</sub>]] atoms in the two predictions within 3.5 [[Angstrom|Å]] of each other after being [[Protein structural alignment|superpositioned]].  To improve accuracy of the final model, users can select the prediction servers from which to aggregate results.<ref>{{cite journal | title=3D-Jury: a simple approach to improve protein structure predictions | journal=Bioinformatics | author=Ginalski K | year=2003 | volume=19 | issue=8 | pages=1015–1018 | url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/8/1015 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg124 | pmid=12761065|display-authors=etal| doi-access=free }}</ref>
