'''Ecosystem services''' are the many and varied benefits to humans provided by the natural environment and from healthy [[ecosystems]]. Such ecosystems include, for example, [[agroecosystem]]s, [[forest ecosystem]]s, [[grassland ecosystem]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. These ecosystems, functioning in healthy relationship, offer such things like natural pollination of crops, clean air, extreme weather mitigation, human mental and physical well-being. Collectively, these benefits are becoming known as 'ecosystem services', and are often integral to the provisioning of clean [[drinking water]], the [[decomposition]] of wastes, and resilience and productivity of food ecosystems.

While scientists and [[environmentalists]] have discussed ecosystem services implicitly for decades, the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MA) in the early 2000s popularized this concept.<ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). 2005.

[[Island Press]], Washington. 155pp.</ref> There, ecosystem services are grouped into four broad categories: ''provisioning'', such as the production of food and water; ''regulating'', such as the control of climate and disease; ''supporting'', such as [[nutrient cycles]] and [[oxygen]] production; and ''cultural'', such as spiritual and recreational benefits. To help inform [[Decision-making|decision-makers]], many ecosystem services are being valuated in order to draw equivalent comparisons to human engineered infrastructure and services.

==History==

While the notion of human dependence on Earth's ecosystems reaches to the start of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''{{'}} existence, the term 'natural capital' was first coined by [[E. F. Schumacher|E.F. Schumacher]] in 1973 in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful|Small is Beautiful]]''.<ref>Schumacher, E.F (1973). ''Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics As If People Mattered''.</ref>  Recognition of how ecosystems could provide complex services to humankind date back to at least [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) who understood that [[deforestation]] could lead to soil [[erosion]] and the drying of springs.<ref name="Daily1997">Daily, G.C. 1997. Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems. Island Press, Washington. 392pp.</ref>{{page needed| date=February 2015}}  Modern ideas of ecosystem services probably began when Marsh challenged in 1864 the idea that Earth's natural resources are unbounded by pointing out changes in [[soil fertility]] in the Mediterranean.<ref>Marsh, G.P. 1864 (1965). Man and Nature. [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], New York. 472pp.</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2015}} It was not until the late 1940s that three key authors—[[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr]],<ref>Osborn, F. 1948. [[Our Plundered Planet]]. Little, Brown and Company: Boston. 217pp.</ref> [[William Vogt]],<ref>Vogt, W. 1948. Road to Survival. William Sloan: New York. 335pp.</ref> and [[Aldo Leopold]] <ref>Leopold, A. 1949. A Sand County Almanac and Sketches from Here and There. [[Oxford University Press]], New York. 226pp.</ref>—promoted recognition of human dependence on the environment.

In 1956, [[Paul Sears]] drew attention to the critical role of the ecosystem in processing wastes and recycling nutrients.<ref>Sears, P.B. 1956. "The processes of environmental change by man." ''In'': W.L. Thomas, editor. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (Volume 2). [[University of Chicago Press]], Chicago. 1193pp.</ref> In 1970, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] and Rosa Weigert called attention to "ecological systems" in their environmental science textbook<ref>Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1970. Population, Resources, Environment: Issues in Human Ecology. [[W. H. Freeman and Company|W.H. Freeman]], San Francisco. 383pp. – see p.157</ref> and "the most subtle and dangerous threat to man's existence... the potential destruction, by man's own activities, of those ecological systems upon which the very existence of the human species depends".

The term "'''environmental services'''" was introduced in a 1970 report of the ''Study of Critical Environmental Problems'',<ref>Study of Critical Environmental Problems (SCEP). 1970. Man's Impact on the Global Environment. MIT Press, Cambridge. 319pp.</ref> which listed services including insect pollination, [[fisheries]], [[climate]] regulation and [[flood]] control. In following years, variations of the term were used, but eventually 'ecosystem services' became the standard in scientific literature.<ref>Ehrlich, P.R. and A. Ehrlich. 1981. Extinction: The Causes and Consequences of the Disappearance of Species. [[Random House]], New York. 305pp.</ref>

The ecosystem services concept has continued to expand and includes [[socio-economic]] and [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] objectives, which are discussed below. A history of the concepts and terminology of ecosystem services as of 1997, can be found in Daily's book "Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems".<ref name="Daily1997"/>

While [[Gretchen Daily]]'s original definition distinguished between ecosystem goods and ecosystem services, [[Robert Costanza]] and colleagues' later work and that of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment lumped all of these together as ecosystem services.<ref name="Brown2007">{{cite journal|last1=Brown |first1=Thomas C. |author2=John C.

==Definition==
Per the 2006 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), ecosystem services are "the benefits people obtain from ecosystems". The MA also delineated the four categories of ecosystem services—supporting, provisioning, regulating and cultural—discussed below.

By 2010, there had evolved various working definitions and descriptions of ecosystem services in the literature.<ref>Ojea, E. Classifying Ecosystem Services for Economic Valuation: the case of forest water services. BIOECON Conference, Venice 27–28 September 2010</ref> To prevent double counting in ecosystem services audits, for instance, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) replaced "Supporting Services" in the MA with "Habitat Services" and "ecosystem functions", defined as "a subset of the interactions between ecosystem structure and processes that underpin the capacity of an ecosystem to provide goods and services".<ref>[http://www.teebtest.org/wp-content/uploads/Study%20and%20Reports/Reports/Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations/TEEB%20Ecological%20and%20Economic%20Foundations%20report/TEEB%20Foundations.pdf The Ecological and Economic Foundation], chapter 1, p.19, [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|TEEB]], 2010</ref>

==Categorization==
[[Image:Dungbeetle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Detritivore]]s like this [[dung beetle]] help to turn animal wastes into organic material that can be reused by primary producers.]]

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report 2005 defined ecosystem services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems and distinguishes four categories of ecosystem services, where the so-called supporting services are regarded as the basis for the services of the other three categories.<ref name="Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005"/>

=== Supporting services ===
These include services such as [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]], [[primary production]], [[soil formation]], [[habitat]] provision and [[pollination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Conservation of ecosystem services|url=http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|website=basicbiology.net|publisher=Adam Purcell|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129194450/http://basicbiology.net/biology/conservation/ecosystem_services.php|archive-date=29 November 2014}}</ref> These services make it possible for the ecosystems to continue providing services such as food supply, flood regulation, and water purification.  Slade et al <ref>{{cite web|title=Eleanor M. Slade, Robert Bagchi, Nadine Keller & Christopher D. Philipson. When Do More Species Maximize More Ecosystem Services? Trends in Plant Science.| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136013851930161X }}</ref> outline the situation where a greater number of species would maximize more ecosystem services

=== Provisioning services ===
The following services are also known as ''ecosystem goods'':{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}
* food (including [[seafood]] and [[Game (food)|game]]), crops, wild foods, and [[spice]]s
* raw materials (including lumber, skins, fuel wood, organic matter, fodder, and fertilizer)
* genetic resources (including crop improvement genes, and health care)
* water purity
* [[biogenic minerals]]
* [[Medication|medicinal resources]] (including pharmaceuticals, chemical models, and test and assay organisms)
* [[energy]] ([[hydropower]], [[biofuel|biomass fuels]])
*ornamental resources (including fashion, handicraft, jewelry, pets, worship, decoration and souvenirs like furs, feathers, ivory, orchids, butterflies, aquarium fish, shells, etc.)

=== Regulating services ===
* Carbon sequestration and [[climate]] regulation
* [[Predation]] regulates prey populations
* Waste [[decomposition]] and detoxification
* Purification of [[water purification|water]] and [[air pollution|air]]
* [[Pest (organism)|pest]] and [[disease]] control
*Flood protection<ref>{{Cite web | author= Basic Biology | date= 2016 | title= Wetlands | url=https://basicbiology.net/environment/land/wetlands}}</ref>

===Cultural services===
* cultural (including use of nature as motif in books, film, painting, folklore, national symbols, advertising, etc.)
* spiritual and historical (including use of nature for religious or heritage value or natural)
* [[recreation]]al experiences (including [[ecotourism]], outdoor sports, and recreation)
* science and education (including use of natural systems for school excursions, and [[scientific discovery]])
* Therapeutic (including Ecotherapy, social forestry and animal assisted therapy)

As of 2012, there was a discussion as to how the concept of cultural ecosystem services could be operationalized, how landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance to define can fit into the ecosystem services approach.<ref>Daniel, T. C. et al. 2012: ''Contributions of cultural services to the ecosystem services agenda.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 8812–8819 [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/18/1114773109.full.pdf+html].</ref> who vote for models that explicitly link ecological structures and functions with cultural values and benefits.
Likewise, there has been a fundamental critique of the concept of cultural ecosystem services that builds on three arguments:<ref>Kirchhoff, T. 2012: ''Pivotal cultural values of nature cannot be integrated into the ecosystem services framework.'' Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109 (46): E3146.</ref>

# Pivotal cultural values attaching to the natural/cultivated environment rely on an area's unique character that cannot be addressed by methods that use universal scientific parameters to determine ecological structures and functions. 
# If a natural/cultivated environment has symbolic meanings and cultural values the object of these values are not ecosystems but shaped phenomena like mountains, lakes, forests, and, mainly, symbolic landscapes.<ref>Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Kirchhoff, T./Trepl, L./Vicenzotti, V. 2012:''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research iFirst.</ref> 
# Cultural values do result not from properties produced by ecosystems but are the product of a specific way of seeing within the given cultural framework of symbolic experience.<ref>Cf. Cosgrove, D.E. 1984: ''Social Formation and Symbolic Landscape'', London; Schama, S. 1995: ''Landscape and memory''. New York; Backhaus, G./Murungi, J. (eds.): ''Symbolic Landscapes''. Dordrecht 2009.</ref>

The Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) is a classification scheme developed to accounting systems (like National counts etc.), in order to avoid double-counting of Suporting Services with others Provisioning and Regulating Services.<ref>https://cices.eu/</ref>

==Examples==
The following examples illustrate the relationships between humans and natural ecosystems through the services derived from them:
* In [[New York City]], where the quality of drinking water had fallen below standards required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]], authorities opted to restore the polluted [[Catskill Park|Catskill Watershed]] that had previously provided the city with the ecosystem service of water purification. Once the input of sewage and pesticides to the [[Drainage basin|watershed]] area was reduced, natural [[abiotic]] processes such as soil [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and [[filtration]] of chemicals, together with biotic recycling via root systems and soil [[microorganisms]], [[water quality]] improved to levels that met government standards. The cost of this investment in [[natural capital]] was estimated between $1–1.5 billion, which contrasted dramatically with the estimated $6–8 billion cost of constructing a [[water filtration]] plant plus the $300 million annual running costs.<ref>[[Graciela Chichilnisky|Chichilnisky, G.]] and G. Heal. 1998. Economic returns from the biosphere. [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 391: 629–630.</ref>
* Pollination of [[crops]] by bees is required for 15–30% of U.S. [[food production]]; most large-scale farmers import non-native honey bees to provide this service. A 2005 study<ref name="Kremen 2005">Kremen, C. 2005. Managing ecosystem services: what do we need to know about their ecology?  [[Ecology Letters]] 8: 468–479.</ref> reported that in California's agricultural region, it was found that wild bees alone could provide partial or complete pollination services or enhance the services provided by honey bees through behavioral interactions. However, [[Intensive farming|intensified agricultural practices]] can quickly erode pollination services through the loss of species. The remaining species are unable to compensate this. The results of this study also indicate that the proportion of [[chaparral]] and [[California oak woodland|oak-woodland habitat]] available for wild bees within 1–2&nbsp;km of a [[farm]] can stabilize and enhance the provision of pollination services. The presence of such ecosystem elements functions almost like an insurance policy for farmers.
* In watersheds of the [[Yangtze River]] China, [[Spatial analysis|spatial models]] for water flow through different forest habitats were created to determine potential contributions for [[hydroelectric power]] in the region. By quantifying the relative value of ecological parameters (vegetation-soil-slope complexes), researchers were able to estimate the annual economic benefit of maintaining forests in the watershed for power services to be 2.2 times that if it were harvested once for timber.<ref>Guo, Z.W., X.M. Xio and D.M. Li. 2000. An assessment of ecosystem services: water flow regulation and hydroelectric power production. Ecological Applications 10: 925–936.</ref>
* In the 1980s, mineral water company [[Vittel]] now a brand of Nestlé Waters) faced the problem that nitrate and pesticides were entering the company's springs in northeastern France. Local farmers had intensified agricultural practices and cleared native vegetation that previously had filtered water before it seeped into the aquifer used by Vittel. This contamination threatened the company's right to use the "natural mineral water" label under French law.<ref>Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore. (2008) The Corporate Ecosystem Services Review (Version 1.0). [[World Resources Institute]].</ref> In response to this business risk, Vittel developed an incentive package for farmers to improve their agricultural practices and consequently reduce water pollution that had affected Vittel's product. For example, Vittel provided subsidies and free technical assistance to farmers in exchange for farmers' agreement to enhance pasture management, reforest catchments, and reduce the use of agrochemicals, an example of a [[payment for ecosystem services]] program.<ref>Perrot-Maître, D. (2006) The Vittel payments for ecosystem services: a "perfect" PES case? [[International Institute for Environment and Development]], London, UK.</ref>
* In 2016, it was counted that to plant 15 000 ha new woodland in the UK, considering only the value of timber, it would cost £79 000 000, which is more than the benefit of £65 000 000. If, however, all other benefits the trees in lowland could provide (like soil stabilization, wind deflection, recreation, food production, air purification, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, fuel production, cooling, flood prevention) were included, the costs will increase due to displacing the profitable farmland (would be around £231 000 000) but would be overweight by benefits of £546 000 000.<ref>{{Citation|last=EU Environment|title=Ecosystem services and Biodiversity – Science for Environment Policy|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s|access-date=2016-09-06|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806014145/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6luBEJfi3s|archive-date=6 August 2017}}</ref>
* In Europe, various projects are implemented in order to define the values of concrete ecosystems and to implement this concept into decision making process. For example,  "LIFE Viva grass" project aims to do this with grasslands in Baltics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vivagrass.eu/|title=LIFE Viva Grass {{!}} Integrated planning tool for grassland ecosystem services|website=vivagrass.eu|access-date=2016-09-06|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807201444/http://vivagrass.eu/|archive-date=7 August 2016}}</ref>

==Ecology==
Understanding of ecosystem services requires a strong foundation in [[ecology]], which describes the underlying principles and interactions of organisms and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. Since the scales at which these entities interact can vary from [[microbes]] to [[landscapes]], milliseconds to millions of years, one of the greatest remaining challenges is the descriptive characterization of energy and material flow between them.  For example, the area of a forest floor, the [[detritus]] upon it, the microorganisms in the soil and characteristics of the soil itself will all contribute to the abilities of that forest for providing ecosystem services like carbon sequestration, water purification, and [[erosion]] prevention to other areas within the watershed. Note that it is often possible for multiple services to be bundled together and when benefits of targeted objectives are secured, there may also be ancillary benefits—the same forest may provide [[habitat]] for other organisms as well as human recreation, which are also ecosystem services.

The complexity of Earth's ecosystems poses a challenge for scientists as they try to understand how relationships are interwoven among organisms, processes and their surroundings. As it relates to human ecology, a suggested research agenda<ref name="Kremen 2005"/> for the study of ecosystem services includes the following steps:
# identification of ''ecosystem service providers'' (''ESP''s)—[[species]] or populations that provide specific ecosystem services—and characterization of their functional roles and relationships;
# determination of community structure aspects that influence how ESPs function in their [[natural landscape]], such as compensatory responses that stabilize function and non-random extinction sequences which can erode it;
# assessment of key environmental (abiotic) factors influencing the provision of services;
# measurement of the spatial and temporal scales ESPs and their services operate on.

Recently, a technique has been developed to improve and standardize the evaluation of ESP functionality by quantifying the relative importance of different species in terms of their efficiency and abundance.<ref name="Balvanera">Balvanera, P. C. Kremen, and M. Martinez. 2005. Applying community structure analysis to ecosystem function: examples from pollination and carbon storage. Ecological Applications 15: 360–375.</ref> Such parameters provide indications of how species respond to changes in the environment (i.e. predators, resource availability, climate) and are useful for identifying species that are disproportionately important at providing ecosystem services. However, a critical drawback is that the technique does not account for the effects of interactions, which are often both complex and fundamental in maintaining an ecosystem and can involve species that are not readily detected as a priority. Even so, estimating the functional structure of an ecosystem and combining it with information about individual species traits can help us understand the [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of an ecosystem amidst environmental change.

Many ecologists also believe that the provision of ecosystem services can be stabilized with [[biodiversity]]. Increasing biodiversity also benefits the variety of ecosystem services available to society. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and an ecosystem's stability is essential to the management of natural resources and their services.

===Redundancy hypothesis===
The concept of ecological redundancy is sometimes referred to as ''functional compensation'' and assumes that more than one species performs a given role within an ecosystem.<ref>Walker, B.H. 1992. "Biodiversity and ecological redundancy." [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 6: 18–23.</ref> More specifically, it is characterized by a particular species increasing its efficiency at providing a service when conditions are stressed in order to maintain aggregate stability in the ecosystem.<ref>Frost, T.M., [[Stephen R. Carpenter|S.R. Carpenter]], A.R. Ives, and T.K. Kratz. 1995. "Species compensation and complementarity in ecosystem function." ''In'': C. Jones and J. Lawton, editors. Linking species and ecosystems. [[Chapman & Hall]], London. 387pp.</ref> However, such increased dependence on a compensating species places additional stress on the ecosystem and often enhances its susceptibility to subsequent [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The redundancy hypothesis can be summarized as "species redundancy enhances ecosystem resilience".<ref name="Naeem 1998">Naeem S. 1998. "Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability" [[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] 12: 39–45.</ref>

Another idea uses the analogy of rivets in an airplane wing to compare the exponential effect the loss of each species will have on the function of an ecosystem; this is sometimes referred to as ''rivet popping''.<ref name="Lawton 1994">Lawton, J.H. 1994. What do species do in ecosystems? [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 71: 367–374.</ref> If only one species disappears, the loss of the ecosystem's efficiency as a whole is relatively small; however, if several species are lost, the system essentially collapses—similar to an airplane that lost too many rivets. The hypothesis assumes that species are relatively specialized in their roles and that their ability to compensate for one another is less than in the redundancy hypothesis. As a result, the loss of any species is critical to the performance of the ecosystem. The key difference is the rate at which the loss of species affects total ecosystem functioning.

===Portfolio effect===
A third explanation, known as the ''portfolio effect'', compares biodiversity to stock holdings, where diversification minimizes the volatility of the investment, or in this case, the risk of instability of ecosystem services.<ref>Tilman, D., C.L. Lehman, and C.E. Bristow. 1998. Diversity-stability relationships: statistical inevitability or ecological consequence?" ''The American Naturalist'' 151: 277–282.</ref> This is related to the idea of ''response diversity'' where a suite of species will exhibit differential responses to a given environmental perturbation. When considered together, they create a stabilizing function that preserves the integrity of a service.<ref>Elmqvist, T., C. Folke, M. Nyström, G. Peterson, J. Bengtsson, B. Walker and J. Norberg. 2003. Response diversity, ecosystem change, and resilience. [[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 1: 488–494.</ref>

Several experiments have tested these hypotheses in both the field and the lab. In [[Ecotron|ECOTRON]], a laboratory in the UK where many of the [[biotic component|biotic]] and abiotic factors of nature can be simulated, studies have focused on the effects of [[earthworms]] and [[symbiotic bacteria]] on plant roots.<ref name="Lawton 1994"/> These laboratory experiments seem to favor the rivet hypothesis. However, a study on grasslands at Cedar Creek Reserve in Minnesota supports the redundancy hypothesis, as have many other field studies.<ref>Grime, J.P. 1997. "Biodiversity and ecosystem function: The debate deepened." Science 277</ref>

[[Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment]] 2: 249–257.</ref> Weighting factors such as a service's irreplaceability or bundled services can also allocate economic value such that goal attainment becomes more efficient.

The economic valuation of ecosystem services also involves social communication and information, areas that remain particularly challenging and are the focus of many researchers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Varela|first2=Elsa|last3=Piqué|first3=Miriam|last4=Prokofieva|first4=Irina|title=Demand and supply of ecosystem services in a Mediterranean forest: Computing payment boundaries.|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=17|pages=53–63|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.11.006|url=http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806071955/http://arxiudigital.ctfc.cat/docs/upload/27_522_Gorriz%20et%20al%202016_Demand%20and%20supply%20of%20ES%20in%20a%20Med%20forest_Computing%20payment%20boundaries.pdf|archive-date=6 August 2016}}</ref> In general, the idea is that although individuals make decisions for any variety of reasons, trends reveal the aggregated preferences of a society, from which the economic value of services can be inferred and assigned. The six major methods for valuing ecosystem services in monetary terms are:<ref>Farber, S.C., R. Costanza and M.A. Wilson. 2002. Economic and ecological concepts for valuing ecosystem services. Ecological Economics 41: 375–392.</ref>

* Avoided cost: Services allow society to avoid costs that would have been incurred in the absence of those services (e.g. waste treatment by [[wetland]] habitats avoids health costs)
* Replacement cost: Services could be replaced with man-made systems (e.g. [[Restoration Ecology|restoration]] of the [[Catskill Watershed]] cost less than the construction of a [[water purification]] plant)
* Factor income: Services provide for the enhancement of incomes (e.g. improved [[water quality]] increases the commercial take of a [[fishery]] and improves the income of fishers)
* Travel cost: Service demand may require travel, whose costs can reflect the implied value of the service (e.g. value of [[ecotourism]] experience is at least what a visitor is willing to pay to get there)
* Hedonic pricing: Service demand may be reflected in the prices people will pay for associated goods (e.g. coastal housing prices exceed that of inland homes)
* Contingent valuation: Service demand may be elicited by posing hypothetical scenarios that involve some valuation of alternatives (e.g. visitors willing to pay for increased access to national parks)

A peer-reviewed study published in 1997 estimated the value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital to be between US$16–54 trillion per year, with an average of US$33 trillion per year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Costanza |first1=Robert |first2=Ralph |last2=d'Arge |first3=Rudolf |last3=de Groot |first4=Stephen |last4=Farberk |first5=Monica |last5=Grasso |first6=Bruce |last6=Hannon |first7=Karin |last7=Limburg |first8=Shahid |last8=Naeem |first9=Robert V. |last9=O'Neill |first10=Jose |last10=Paruelo |first11=Robert G. |last11=Raskin |first12=Paul |last12=Sutton |first13=Marjan |last13=van den Belt |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |date=15 May 1997 |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |access-date=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |s2cid=672256 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archive-date=30 July 2012}}</ref> However, Salles (2011) indicated 'The total value of biodiversity is infinite, so having debate about what is the total value of nature is actually pointless because we can't live without it'.<ref>Salles, J.

As of 2012, many companies were not fully aware of the extent of their dependence and impact on ecosystems and the possible ramifications. Likewise, environmental management systems and environmental due diligence tools are more suited to handle "traditional" issues of pollution and natural [[resource consumption]]. Most focus on [[environmental impacts]], not dependence. Several tools and methodologies can help the private sector value and assess ecosystem services, including Our Ecosystem,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecometrica.com/products/our-ecosystem/ |title=Our Ecosystem – Mapping & Data Sharing Software |publisher=Ecometrica |access-date=2012-07-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617100654/http://ecometrica.com/products/our-ecosystem/ |archive-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> the 2008 Corporate Ecosystem Services Review,<ref>Hanson, C, J Ranganathan, C Iceland, and J Finisdore.

==Management and policy==

Although monetary pricing continues with respect to the valuation of ecosystem services, the challenges in policy implementation and management are significant and multitudinous. The administration of [[common pool resources]] has been a subject of extensive academic pursuit.<ref name="Ostrom 1990">Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action. [[Cambridge University Press]], Cambridge. 279pp.</ref><ref>Dietz, T. E. Ostrom and P.C. Stern. 2003.

Social capital and the collective management of resources" ''Science'' 302: 1912–1914.</ref><ref>Heikkila, T. 2004. Institutional boundaries and common-pool resource management: a comparative analysis of water management programs in California. ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' from [[Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management]] 23: 97–117.</ref><ref>Gibson, C.C., J.T. Williams and E. Ostrom. 2005. Local management and better forests. [[World Development (journal)|World Development]] 33: 273–284.</ref> From defining the problems to finding solutions that can be applied in practical and sustainable ways, there is much to overcome. Considering options must balance present and future human needs, and decision-makers must frequently work from valid but incomplete information. Existing legal policies are often considered insufficient since they typically pertain to human health-based standards that are mismatched with necessary means to protect [[ecosystem health]] and services. In 2000, to improve the information available, the implementation of an ''Ecosystem Services Framework'' has been suggested (ESF<ref name="Daily 2000">Daily, G.C. 2000. Management objectives for the protection of ecosystem services. Environmental Science & Policy 3: 333–339.</ref>), which integrates the biophysical and [[socio-economic]] dimensions of protecting the environment and is designed to guide institutions through multidisciplinary information and jargon, helping to direct strategic choices.

As of 2005 Local to regional collective management efforts were considered appropriate for services like crop [[pollination]] or resources like water.<ref name="Kremen 2005"/><ref name="Ostrom 1990"/> Another approach that has become increasingly popular during the 1990s is the marketing of ecosystem services protection. Payment and trading of services is an emerging worldwide small-scale solution where one can acquire credits for activities such as sponsoring the protection of carbon sequestration sources or the [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] of ecosystem service providers. In some cases, banks for handling such credits have been established and conservation companies have even gone public on stock exchanges, defining an evermore parallel link with economic endeavors and opportunities for tying into social perceptions.<ref name="Daily et al. 2000."/> However, crucial for implementation are clearly defined [[land rights]], which are often lacking in many [[developing countries]].<ref name=ODI1>Jessica Brown and Neil Bird 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation Costa Rica sustainable resource management: Successfully tackling tropical deforestation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083601/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5049&title=costa-rica-sustainable-resource-management-successfully-tackling-tropical-deforestation |date=14 May 2011 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> In particular, many forest-rich developing countries suffering [[deforestation]] experience conflict between different forest stakeholders.<ref name=ODI1/> In addition, concerns for such global transactions include inconsistent compensation for services or resources sacrificed elsewhere and misconceived warrants for irresponsible use. As of 2001, another approach focused on protecting ecosystem service [[biodiversity hotspot]]s. Recognition that the conservation of many ecosystem services aligns with more traditional conservation goals (i.e. [[biodiversity]]) has led to the suggested merging of objectives for maximizing their mutual success. This may be particularly strategic when employing networks that permit the flow of services across [[landscapes]], and might also facilitate securing the financial means to protect services through a diversification of investors.<ref>Balvanera, P., G.C. Daily, P.R. Ehrlich, T.H. Ricketts, S.Bailey, S. Kark, C. Kremen and H. Pereira. 2001. Conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services.

[[PLoS Biology]] 4: 2138–2152.</ref>

For example, as of 2013 there had been interest in the valuation of ecosystem services provided by [[shellfish]] production and restoration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Northern Economics Inc|title=Valuation of Ecosystem Services from Shellfish Restoration, Enhancement and Management: A Review of the Literature|url=http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|publisher=Prepared for Pacific Shellfish Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203085756/http://www.pacshell.org/pdf/ShellfishEcoServices.pdf|archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> A keystone species, low in the food chain, bivalve shellfish such as oysters support a complex community of species by performing a number of functions essential to the diverse array of species that surround them. There is also increasing recognition that some shellfish species may impact or control many ecological processes; so much so that they are included on the list of "ecosystem engineers"—organisms that physically, biologically or chemically modify the environment around them in ways that influence the health of other organisms.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jones|author2=Lawton, and Shachak|title=Organisms as Ecosystem Engineers|journal=Oikos|year=1994|volume=69|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.2307/3545850|jstor=3545850}}</ref> Many of the ecological functions and processes performed or affected by shellfish contribute to human well-being by providing a stream of valuable ecosystem services over time by filtering out particulate materials and potentially mitigating water quality issues by controlling [[nutrient pollution|excess nutrients]] in the water.
As of 2018, the concept of ecosystem services had not been properly implemented into international and regional legislation yet.<ref>Kistenkas, Frederik H., Irene Bouwma, ''Barriers for the ecosystem services concept in European water and nature conservation law'', Ecosystem Services 29 (2018) 223–227</ref>

Notwithstanding, the United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 15]] has a target to ensure the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecosystem services.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goal 15 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref>

===Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)===

Ecosystem-based adaptation or EbA is a strategy for community development and environmental management that seeks to use an ecosystem services framework to help communities adapt to the effects of [[climate change]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] defines it as "the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change", which includes the use of "sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems, as part of an overall adaptation strategy that takes into account the multiple social, economic and cultural co-benefits for local communities".<ref name="ebaflagship.org">[http://ebaflagship.org/images/ContentsForPublications/eba%20policy%20brochure%20web.pdf ebaflagship.org]</ref>

In 2001, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment announced that humanity's impact on the natural world was increasing to levels never before seen, and that the degradation of the planet's ecosystems would become a major barrier to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. In recognition of this fact, Ecosystem-Based Adaptation sought to use the restoration of ecosystems as a stepping-stone to improve the quality of life in communities experiencing the impacts of climate change. Specifically, it involved the restoration of such ecosystems that provide food and water and protection from [[storm surges]] and flooding. EbA interventions combine elements of both [[climate change mitigation]] and [[adaptation to global warming]] to help address the community's current and future needs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604195815/http://www.unep.org/climatechange/adaptation/EcosystemBasedAdaptation/tabid/29583/Default.aspx |archive-date=4 June 2015}}</ref>

Collaborative planning between scientists, policy makers, and community members is an essential element of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation. By drawing on the expertise of outside experts and local residents alike, EbA seeks to develop unique solutions to unique problems, rather than simply replicating past projects.<ref name="ebaflagship.org"/>

==Estuarine and coastal ecosystem services==
{{section too long|date=May 2020}}
Ecosystem services are defined as the gains acquired by humankind from surroundings ecosystems. Four different types of ecosystem services have been distinguished by the scientific body: regulating services, provisioning services, cultural services and supporting services. An ecosystem does not necessarily offer all four types of services simultaneously; but given the intricate nature of any ecosystem, it is usually assumed that humans benefit from a combination of these services. The services offered by diverse types of ecosystems (forests, seas, coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) differ in nature and in consequence. In fact, some services directly affect the livelihood of neighboring human populations (such as fresh water, food or aesthetic value, etc.) while other services affect general environmental conditions by which humans are indirectly impacted (such as climate change, erosion regulation or natural hazard regulation, etc.).<ref>Barbier, E.B.; Hacker, S.D.; Kennedy, C.; Koch, E.W.; Stier, A.C. & Silliman, B.R. [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170109135811/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/10-1510.1/epdf] ''Ecological Monographs'', 2011</ref>

Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are both marine ecosystems. An [[estuary]] is defined as the area in which a river meets the sea or the ocean. The waters surrounding this area are predominantly salty waters or brackish waters; and the incoming river water is dynamically motioned by the tide. An estuary strip may be covered by populations of reed (or similar plants) and/or sandbanks (or similar form or land).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

A coastal ecosystem occurs in areas where the sea or ocean waters meet the land.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Regulating services===
Regulating services are the "benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|title=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|website=www.millenniumassessment.org|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224041032/http://millenniumassessment.org/en/index.html|archive-date=24 February 2018}}</ref> In the case of coastal and estuarine ecosystems, these services include climate regulation, waste treatment and disease control and natural hazard regulation.

====Climate regulation====
Both the biotic and abiotic ensembles of marine ecosystems play a role in climate regulation. They act as sponges when it comes to gases in the atmosphere, retaining large levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide). Marine plants also use CO<sub>2</sub> for photosynthesis purposes and help in reducing the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The oceans and seas absorb the heat from the atmosphere and redistribute it through the means of water currents, and atmospheric processes, such as evaporation and the reflection of light allow for the cooling and warming of the overlying atmosphere. The ocean temperatures are thus imperative to the regulation of the atmospheric temperatures in any part of the world: "without the ocean, the Earth would be unbearably hot during the daylight hours and frigidly cold, if not frozen, at night".<ref name="davidsuzuki.org">MOlnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn & Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016}}, 2009</ref>

====Waste treatment and disease regulation====
Another service offered by marine ecosystem is the treatment of wastes, thus helping in the regulation of diseases. Wastes can be diluted and detoxified through transport across marine ecosystems; pollutants are removed from the environment and stored, buried or recycled in marine ecosystems: "Marine ecosystems break down organic waste through microbial communities that filter water, reduce/limit the effects of eutrophication, and break down toxic hydrocarbons into their basic components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, and water".<ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/> The fact that waste is diluted with large volumes of water and moves with water currents leads to the regulation of diseases and the reduction of toxics in seafood.

====Buffer zones====
Coastal and estuarine ecosystems act as buffer zones against natural hazards and environmental disturbances, such as floods, cyclones, tidal surges and storms. The role they play is to "[absorb] a portion of the impact and thus [lessen] its effect on the land".<ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/> Wetlands, for example, and the vegetation it supports – trees, root mats, etc. – retain large amounts of water (surface water, snowmelt, rain, groundwater) and then slowly releases them back, decreasing the likeliness of floods.<ref>Campos, A.C.; Hernandez, M.E.; Moreno-Casasola, P.; Espinosa, E.C.; Robledo, A.R. & Mata, D.I. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02626667.2011.629786] ''Hydrological Sciences Journal'', December 2011.</ref> Mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines from tidal erosion or erosion by currents; a process that was studied after the 1999 cyclone that hit India. Villages that were surrounded with mangrove forests encountered less damages than other villages that weren't protected by mangroves.<ref>Badol, Ruchi & Hussain, S.A. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&fid=314311&jid=ENC&volumeId=32&issueId=01&aid=314310], ''Environmental Conservation'', February 2005</ref>

===Provisioning Services===
Provisioning services consist of all "the products obtained from ecosystems". 

==== Forest products ====
Forests produce a large type and variety of timber products, including roundwood, sawnwood, panels, and engineered wood, e.g., cross-laminated timber, as well as pulp and paper.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4060/ca9825en|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 – Main report|publisher=FAO|year=2020|isbn=978-92-5-132974-0|location=Rome}}</ref> Besides the production of timber, forestry activities may also result in products that undergo little processing, such as fire wood, charcoal, wood chips and roundwood used in an unprocessed form.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4060/ca8753en|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 – Key findings|publisher=FAO|year=2020|isbn=978-92-5-132581-0|location=2020}}</ref> Global production and trade of all major wood-based products recorded their highest ever values in 2018.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/ca7415en|title=Global forest products facts and figures 2018|publisher=FAO|year=2019}}</ref> Production, imports and exports of roundwood, sawnwood, wood-based panels, wood pulp, wood charcoal and pellets reached<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4060/ca8985en|title=The State of the World’s Forests 2020. Forests, biodiversity and people – In brief|publisher=FAO & UNEP|year=2020|isbn=978-92-5-132707-4|location=Rome}}</ref> their maximum quantities since 1947 when [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] started reporting global forest product statistics.<ref name=":0" /> In 2018, growth in production of the main wood-based product groups ranged from 1 percent (woodbased panels) to 5 percent (industrial roundwood).<ref name=":0" /> The fastest growth occurred in the Asia-Pacific, Northern American and European regions, likely due to positive economic growth in these areas.<ref name=":0" />

Forests also provide non-wood forest products, including fodder, aromatic and medicinal plants, and wild foods. Worldwide, around 1 billion people depend to some extent on wild foods such as wild meat, edible insects, edible plant products, mushrooms and fish, which often contain high levels of key micronutrients.<ref name=":1" /> The value of forest foods as a nutritional resource is not limited to low- and middle-income countries; more than 100 million people in the European Union (EU) regularly consume wild food.<ref name=":1" /> Some 2.4 billion people – in both urban and rural settings – use wood-based energy for cooking.<ref name=":1" />

====Marine products====
Marine ecosystems provide people with: wild & cultured seafood, fresh water, fiber & fuel and biochemical & genetic resources.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Humans consume a large number of products originating from the seas, whether as a nutritious product or for use in other sectors: "More than one billion people worldwide, or one-sixth of the global population, rely on fish as their main source of animal protein. In 2000, marine and coastal fisheries accounted for 12 per cent of world food production".<ref name="ReferenceA">Molnar, Michelle; Clarke-Murray, Cathryn; Whitworth, Jogn & Tam, Jordan. {{cite web |url=http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230158/http://www.davidsuzuki.org/publications/downloads/2009/marine_ecosystems_report_web.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016}}, 2009</ref> Fish and other edible marine products – primarily fish, shellfish, roe and seaweeds – constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions. A very pertinent example would be sushi, the national food of Japan, which consists mostly of different types of fish and seaweed.

====Fresh water====
Water bodies that are not highly concentrated in salts are referred to as 'fresh water' bodies. Fresh water may run through lakes, rivers and streams, to name a few; but it is most prominently found in the frozen state or as soil moisture or buried deep underground. Fresh water is not only important for the survival of humans, but also for the survival of all the existing species of animals, plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Raw materials====
Marine creatures provide us with the raw materials needed for the manufacturing of clothing, building materials (lime extracted from coral reefs), ornamental items and personal-use items (luffas, art and jewelry): "The skin of marine mammals for clothing, gas deposits for energy production, lime (extracted from coral reefs) for building construction, and the timber of mangroves and coastal forests for shelter are some of the more familiar uses of marine organisms. Raw marine materials are utilized for non-essential goods as well, such as shells and corals in ornamental items".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Humans have also referred to processes within marine environments for the production of renewable energy: using the power of waves – or tidal power – as a source of energy for the powering of a turbine, for example.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Oceans and seas are used as sites for offshore oil and gas installations, offshore wind farms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Biochemical and genetic resources====
Biochemical resources are compounds extracted from marine organisms for use in medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other biochemical products. Genetic resources are the genetic information found in marine organisms that would later on be used for animal and plant breeding and for technological advances in the biological field. These resources are either directly taken out from an organism – such as fish oil as a source of omega3 –, or used as a model for innovative man-made products: "such as the construction of fiber optics technology based on the properties of sponges. ... Compared to terrestrial products, marine-sourced products tend to be more highly bioactive, likely due to the fact that marine organisms have to retain their potency despite being diluted in the surrounding sea-water".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Cultural services===
Cultural services relate to the non-material world, as they benefit the benefit recreational, aesthetic, cognitive and spiritual activities, which are not easily quantifiable in monetary terms.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Inspirational====
Marine environments have been used by many as an inspiration for their works of art, music, architecture, traditions... Water environments are spiritually important as a lot of people view them as a means for rejuvenation and change of perspective. Many also consider the water as being a part of their personality, especially if they have lived near it since they were kids: they associate it to fond memories and past experiences. Living near water bodies for a long time results in a certain set of water activities that become a ritual in the lives of people and of the culture in the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Recreation and tourism====
Sea sports are very popular among coastal populations: surfing, snorkeling, whale watching, kayaking, recreational fishing...a lot of tourists also travel to resorts close to the sea or rivers or lakes to be able to experience these activities, and relax near the water.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 14]] also has targets aimed at enhancing the use of ecosystem services for sustainable tourism especially in [[Small Island Developing States]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goal 14 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref> [[File:Tourism on Greek Beaches.jpg|thumb|Beach accommodated into a recreational area.]]

====Science and education====
A lot can be learned from marine processes, environments and organisms – that could be implemented into our daily actions and into the scientific domain. Although much is still yet to still be known about the ocean world: "by the extraordinary intricacy and complexity of the marine environment and how it is influenced by large spatial scales, time lags, and cumulative effects".<ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/>

===Supporting services===
Supporting services are the services that allow for the other ecosystem services to be present. They have indirect impacts on humans that last over a long period of time. Several services can be considered as being both supporting services and regulating/cultural/provisioning services.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

====Nutrient cycling====
Nutrient cycling is the movement of nutrients through an ecosystem by biotic and abiotic processes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scienceaid.net/biology/ecology/nutrient.html|title=Nutrient Cycles: Recycling in Ecosystems, The Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles – ScienceAid|work=ScienceAid|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}</ref> The ocean is a vast storage pool for these nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The nutrients are absorbed by the basic organisms of the marine food web and are thus transferred from one organism to the other and from one ecosystem to the other. Nutrients are recycled through the life cycle of organisms as they die and decompose, releasing the nutrients into the neighboring environment. "The service of nutrient cycling eventually impacts all other ecosystem services as all living things require a constant supply of nutrients to survive".<ref name="davidsuzuki.org"/>

====Biologically mediated habitats====
Biologically mediated habitats are defined as being the habitats that living marine structures offer to other organisms.<ref>UK National Ecosystem Assessment Technical Report, {{cite web |url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060244/http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/Resources/tabid/82/Default.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2014}}, ''Chapters 13–16'', June 2011</ref> These need not to have evolved for the sole purpose of serving as a habitat, but happen to become living quarters whilst growing naturally. For example, coral reefs and mangrove forests are home to numerous species of fish, seaweed and shellfish... The importance of these habitats is that they allow for interactions between different species, aiding the provisioning of marine goods and services. They are also very important for the growth at the early life stages of marine species (breeding and bursary spaces), as they serve as a food source and as a shelter from predators.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[File:Example of Biologically Mediated Habitats.jpg|thumb|Coral and other living organisms serve as habitats for many marine species.]]

====Primary production====
Primary production refers to the production of organic matter, i.e., chemically bound energy, through processes such as photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. The organic matter produced by primary producers forms the basis of all food webs. Further, it generates oxygen (O2), a molecule necessary to sustain animals and humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1118506243|title=isbn:1118506243 – Google zoeken|website=books.google.be|access-date=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services|title=Ecosystem Services|website=msu.edu|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228161544/http://www.canr.msu.edu/nativeplants/ecosystem_services/|archive-date=28 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|title=Oxygen and Human Requirements|website=www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022082604/http://www.geography.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/wc.notes/1.atmosphere/oxygen_and_human_requirements.htm|archive-date=22 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|title=BBC – GCSE Bitesize: Inhaled and exhaled air|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026150605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/pe/appliedanatomy/1_anatomy_respiratorysys_rev3.shtml|archive-date=26 October 2017}}</ref> On average, a human consumes about 550 liter of oxygen per day, whereas plants produce 1,5 liter of oxygen per 10 grams of growth.<ref>New Scientist, June 2019</ref>

==Land use change decisions==

Ecosystem services decisions require making complex choices at the intersection of [[ecology]], [[technology]], [[society]] and the [[economy]]. The process of making ecosystem services decisions must consider the interaction of many types of information, honor all [[project stakeholder|stakeholder]] viewpoints, including [[regulatory agencies]], proposal proponents, decision makers, residents, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, and measure the impacts on all four parts of the intersection. These decisions are usually [[spatial planning|spatial]], always [[multi-objective optimization|multi-objective]], and based on uncertain data, models, and estimates. Often it is the combination of the best science combined with the stakeholder values, estimates and opinions that drive the process.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gorriz-Misfud|first1=Elena|last2=Secco|first2=L|last3=Pisani|first3=E|title=Exploring the interlinkages between governance and social capital: A dynamic model for forestry.|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|volume=65|pages=25–36|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2016.01.006}}</ref>

One analytical study modeled the stakeholders as [[software agent|agents]] to support water resource management decisions in the Middle Rio Grande basin of New Mexico.  This study focused on modeling the stakeholder inputs across a spatial decision, but ignored uncertainty.<ref>{{ cite web|url= http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2012/120710.pdf|author= Tidwell, V., E.

In Baltic countries scientists, nature conservationists and local authorities are implementing integrated planning approach for grassland ecosystems.<ref>[http://vivagrass.eu/about-the-project/]</ref> They are developing an integrated planning tool based on [[GIS]] (geographic information system) technology and put online that will help for planners to choose the best grassland management solution for concrete grassland. It will look holistically at the processes in the countryside and help to find best grassland management solutions by taking into account both natural and socioeconomic factors of the particular site.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}
