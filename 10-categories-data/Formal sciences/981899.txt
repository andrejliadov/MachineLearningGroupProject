The '''buying decision process''' is the [[decision-making]] process used by consumers regarding the market transactions before, during, and after the purchase of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]]. It can be seen as a particular form of a [[cost–benefit analysis]] in the presence of multiple alternatives.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engel |first1=James F. |last2=Kollat |first2=David T. |last3=Blackwell |first3=Rodger D. |date=1968 |title=Consumer Behavior |edition=First |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nicosia |first=Francesco M. |date=1966 |title=Consumer decision process marketing and advertising implications |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref>

Common examples include [[shopping]] and deciding what to eat. Decision-making is a psychological construct. This means that although a decision cannot be "seen", we can infer from observable behavior that a decision has been made. Therefore, we conclude that a psychological "decision-making" event has occurred. It is a construction that imputes a commitment to action. That is, based on observable actions, we assume that people have made a commitment to effect the action.

Nobel laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] sees [[economic]] decision-making as a vain attempt to be rational. Simon claimed (in 1947 and 1957) that if a complete analysis is to be done, a decision will be immensely complex. Simon also wrote that peoples' information processing ability is limited. The assumption of a perfectly [[Rationality|rational]] economic actor is unrealistic. Consumers are influenced by emotional and nonrational considerations making attempts to be rational only partially successful. He called for replacing the perfect rationality assumptions of homo economicus with a conception of rationality tailored to cognitively limited agents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forest |first1=Joëlle |last2=Mehier |first2=Caroline |date=September 2001 |title=John R.

==Stages==
The stages of the buyer decision process were first introduced by John Dewey in 1910. Later studies expanded upon Dewey's initial finding.

*Problem/Need Recognition - Recognize what the problem or need is and identify the product or type of product which is required. Page text.<ref name="Marketing Management by Philip Kotler">{{cite web|url= http://dl.ueb.edu.vn/bitstream/1247/2250/1/Marketing_Management_-_Millenium_Edition.pdf |title=dl.ueb.edu.vn/bitstream/1247/2250/1/Marketing_Management_-_Millenium_Edition.pdf |first=Philip |last=Kotler |publisher=Pearson Customer Publishing |accessdate=28 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130201142039/http://dl.ueb.edu.vn/bitstream/1247/2250/1/Marketing_Management_-_Millenium_Edition.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013 }}</ref>
*Information Search - The consumer researches the product which would satisfy the recognized need.<ref name="Marketing Management by Philip Kotler" />
*Evaluation of Alternatives - The consumer evaluates the searched alternatives. Generally, the information search reveals multiple products for the consumer to evaluate and understand which product would be appropriate.<ref name="Marketing Management by Philip Kotler" />
*Purchase Decision - After the consumer has evaluated all the options and would be having the intention to buy any product, there could be now only two things which might just change the decision of the consumer of buying the product that is what the other peers of the consumer think of the product and any unforeseen circumstances. Unforeseen circumstances for example, in this case, could be financial losses which led to not buying of the product.<ref name="Marketing Management by Philip Kotler" />
*Post Purchase Behavior - After the purchase, the consumer may experience post-purchase dissonance feeling that buying another product would have been better. Addressing post-purchase dissonance spreads the good word for the product and increases the chance of frequent repurchase.<ref name="Marketing Management by Philip Kotler" />

These five stages are a framework to evaluate customers' buying decision process. While many consumers pass through these stages in a fixed, linear sequence, some stages such as evaluation of alternatives may occur throughout the purchase decision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rossiter |first1=J.R. |last2=Bellman |first2=S. |title=Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications |publisher=Pearson Australia |date=2005 |page=24}}</ref> The time and effort devoted to each stage depend on a number of factors including the perceived risk and the consumer's motivations. In the case of an impulse purchase, such as the purchase of a chocolate bar as a personal treat, the consumer may spend minimal time engaged in information search and evaluation and proceed directly to the actual purchase.<ref name= "Kotler2009">{{cite book|last1=Kotler |first1=Phillip |last2=Keller |first2=K.L. |last3=Koshy |first3=A. |last4=Jha |first4=M. |date=2009 |title=Marketing Management – a South Asian Perspective |location=Delhi, India |publisher=Prentice Hall}}</ref>

[[File: A serviceman accesses social media channels using an iPad, outside MOD Main Building in London MOD 45156052.jpg|thumb|upright|The rise of digital media and social networks are changing the way that consumers search for product information]]

===Problem/need-recognition===
Problem/Need-recognition is the first step in the buying decision. Without knowing what the customer needs,they will not be enticed to purchase the product. The need can be triggered by internal stimuli (e.g. [[hunger]], [[thirst]]) or external stimuli (e.g. [[advertising]]).<ref name="Kotler2009" />&nbsp; [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]] held that [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|needs are arranged in a hierarchy]]. According to [[Maslow's hierarchy]], only when a person has fulfilled the needs at a certain stage, can he or she move to the next stage.
The problem must be the products or services available. It's how the problem must be recognized.

===Information search===
The [[Information Search Process|information search]] stage is the next step that the customers may take after they have recognized the problem or need in order to find out what they feel is the best solution. This is the buyer's effort at searching the internal and external business environments to identify and observe sources of information related to the focal buying decision. The field of information has come a long way in the last forty years, and has enabled easier and faster information discovery.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Michele D.|title=Taxonomy of Buying Decision Approaches |journal=Journal of Marketing|date=January 1993|volume=57|issue=1|pages=38–56|jstor=1252056|publisher=American Marketing Association|doi=10.2307/1252056}}</ref> Consumers can rely on print, visual, and/or voice media for getting information.

===Evaluation of alternatives===
[[File:Mahane_Yehuda_shoppers.jpg|thumb|Shoppers inspect the quality of fresh produce at a market in Jerusalem]]

At this stage, consumers evaluate different products/brands on the basis of varying product attributes, and whether these can deliver the benefits that the customers are seeking.<ref name= "Kotler2009" />&nbsp; This stage is heavily influenced by one's attitude, as "attitude puts one in a frame of mind: liking or disliking an object, moving towards or away from it".<ref name= "Kotler2009" />&nbsp; Another factor that influences the evaluation process is the degree of [[involvement]]. For example, if the customer involvement is high, then he/she will evaluate a number of brands; whereas if it is low, only one brand will be evaluated.

|}

===Purchase decision===
This is the fourth stage, where the purchase takes place. According to Kotler, Keller, Koshy, and Jha (2009),<ref name="Kotler2009"/> the final purchase decision can be disrupted by two factors: negative feedback from other customers and the level of motivation to comply or accept the feedback. For example, after going through the above three stages, a customer chooses to buy a [[Nikon D80]] [[DSLR]] camera. However, because his good friend, who is also a photographer, gives him negative feedback, he will then be bound to change his preference. Secondly, the decision may be disrupted due to unanticipated situations such as a sudden job loss or the closing of a retail store.

===Post-purchase behavior===
These stages are important to keeping customers. Customers match products with their experiences on whether they are either content or discontent with the product. This affects the decision process for resemblant purchases from the same company in the future,<ref>Blythe, Karn(2008) Consumer Behavior. U.K., Thompson Learning, 2008</ref> mainly at the information search stage and evaluation of alternatives stage. If brand loyalty is made then customers will often fast-tracked or skip completely the information search and evaluation of alternative stages. 

Either being content or discontent, a customer will spread good or bad opinions about the product. At this stage, companies try to make favorable post-purchase communication to encourage the customers to purchase.<ref>Foxall, Gordon.R., (2005) Understanding Consumer Choice USA, Palgrave Macmillan, 2005</ref>&nbsp;

Also, [[cognitive dissonance]] ([[consumer confusion]] in marketing terms) is common at this stage; customers often go through the feelings of post-purchase psychological tension or anxiety. Questions include: "Have I made the right decision?", "Is it a good choice?", etc.

==Models of buyer decision-making==
[[File:US Navy 060513-N-5174T-045 Lt. Taylor Forester makes a few last minute decisions before purchasing a gold necklace from a Navy Exchange vendor aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Making a few last minute decisions before purchasing a gold necklace from a Navy Exchange vendor]]

There are generally three ways of analyzing consumer buying decisions:
* [[Consumer theory|Economic models]] - largely quantitative and are based on the assumptions of rationality and near perfect knowledge. The consumer is seen to maximize its utility. See [[consumer theory]]. [[Game theory]] can also be used in some circumstances.
* [[Applied psychology|Psychological models]] - psychological and cognitive processes such as motivation and need recognition. They are qualitative rather than quantitative and build on sociological factors like cultural influences and family influences.
* [[Consumer behavior]] models - practical models used by marketers. They typically blend both economic and psychological models.

In an early study of the buyer decision process literature, Frank Nicosia (Nicosia, F. 1966; pp 9–21) identified three types of buyer decision-making models. They are the [[univariate]] model (He called it the "simple scheme".) in which only one behavioral determinant was allowed in a [[stimulus-response]] type of relationship; the [[Multivariate testing in marketing|multi-variate model]] (He called it a "reduced form scheme".) in which numerous [[independent variables]] were assumed to determine buyer behavior; and finally the [[structural equation modeling|"system of equations" model]] (He called it a "structural scheme" or "process scheme".) in which numerous functional relations (either univariate or multivariate) interact in a complex system of equations. He concluded that only this third type of model is capable of expressing the complexity of buyer decision processes. In chapter 7, Nicosia builds a comprehensive model involving five modules. The encoding module includes determinants like "attributes of the brand", "environmental factors", "consumer's attributes", "attributes of the organization", and "attributes of the message". Other modules in the system include consumer decoding, search and evaluation, decision, and consumption.

Some [[neuromarketing]] research papers examined how to approach motivation as indexed by electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry over the prefrontal cortex predicts purchase decision when brand and price are varied. In a within-subjects design, the participants have presented purchase decision trials with 14 different grocery products (seven private labels and seven national brand products) whose prices were increased and decreased while their EEG activity was recorded. The results showed that relatively greater left frontal activation (i.e., higher approach motivation) during the decision period predicted an affirmative purchase decision. The relationship of frontal EEG asymmetry with purchase decision was stronger for national brand products compared with private label products and when the price of a product was below a normal price (i.e., implicit reference price) compared with when it was above a normal price. The higher perceived need for a product and higher perceived product quality were associated with greater relative left frontal activation.<ref>Niklas Ravaja, Outi Somervuori and Mikko Salminen (2012) [http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-24740-001/ Predicting purchase decision The role of hemispheric asymmetry over the frontal cortex], Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics</ref>

For any high-involvement product category, the decision-making time is normally long and buyers generally evaluate the information available very cautiously. They also utilize an active information search process. The risk associated with such a decision is very high.<ref>Impact of Brand Image on Consumer Decision-making: A Study on High-technology Products, MPM Raj, S Roy - Global Business Review, 2015</ref>

==Cognitive and personal biases in decision-making==
{{main|List of cognitive biases}}

It is generally agreed that [[bias]]es can creep into our decision-making processes, calling into question the correctness of a decision. Below is a list of some of the more common cognitive biases.
* Selective search for evidence - We tend to be willing to gather [[facts]] that support certain conclusions but disregard other facts that support different conclusions.
* [[Selective perception]] - We actively screen out information that we do not think is salient.
* Premature termination of search for evidence - We tend to accept the first alternative that looks like it might work.
* Conservatism and inertia - Unwillingness to change thought patterns that we have used in the past in the face of new circumstances.
* Experiential limitations - Unwillingness or inability to look beyond the scope of our past [[experiences]]; rejection of the unfamiliar.
* [[Wishful thinking]] or optimism - We tend to want to see things in a positive light and this can distort our perception and thinking.
* Recency - We tend to place more attention on more recent information and either ignore or forget more distant information.
* Repetition bias - A willingness to believe what we have been told most often and by the greatest number of different sources.
* [[Anchoring]] - Decisions are unduly influenced by initial information that shapes our view of subsequent information.
* [[Group think]] - Peer pressure to conform to the opinions held by the group.
* Source credibility bias - We reject something if we have a bias against the person, organization, or group to which the person belongs: We are inclined to accept a statement by someone we like.
* Incremental decision-making and escalating commitment - We look at a decision as a small step in a process and this tends to perpetuate a series of similar decisions. This can be contrasted with zero-based decision-making.
* Inconsistency - The unwillingness to apply the same decision criteria in similar situations.
* [[Attribution theory|Attribution asymmetry]] - We tend to attribute our success to our abilities and talents, but we attribute our failures to bad luck and external factors. We attribute other's success to good luck and their failures to their mistakes.
* Role fulfillment - We conform to the decision-making expectations that others have of someone in our position.
* Underestimating uncertainty and the illusion of control - We tend to underestimate future uncertainty because we tend to believe we have more control over events than we really do.
* Faulty generalizations - In order to simplify an extremely complex world, we tend to group things and people. These simplifying generalizations can bias decision-making processes.
* Ascription of causality - We tend to ascribe causation even when the evidence only suggests a correlation. Just because birds fly to the equatorial regions when the trees lose their leaves, does not mean that the birds migrate ''because'' the trees lose their leaves.

==Neuroscience==
[[Neuroscience]] is a useful tool and a source of theory development and testing in buyer decision-making research. Neuroimaging devices are used in [[Neuromarketing]] to investigate consumer behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal
