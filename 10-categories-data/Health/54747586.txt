'''Abuse during childbirth''' (or '''obstetric violence''') is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a form of [[violence against women]] and violation of the [[woman's rights]]. It is a global and frequent problem per [[World Health Organization]] studies, and can have lasting serious consequences for mother and child plus as well as prevent women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.<ref name="who1">{{Cite web |date=3 September 2014 |title=Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth |url=https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth/en/ |access-date=3 August 2017 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

Further examples of abuse during childbirth include non-consented care, non-confidential care, non-dignified care, discrimination, abandonment of care and detention in facilities. [[Adolescent]]s, [[Immigration|migrant]] women, women infected with [[HIV]], and [[ethnic minority]] women are more likely than others to experience abuse during childbirth.

==Definition and forms of abuse==
Abuse during childbirth or obstetric violence is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a violation of the [[woman's rights]].<ref name="who1"/>

Abuse during childbirth can occur in the full spectrum from non-confidential care, non-dignified care, discrimination, over frank physical abuse, non-consented care, abandonment of care to detention in facilities.<ref name=sando>{{cite journal |last1=Sando |first1=David |last2=Abuya |first2=Timothy |last3=Asefa |first3=Anteneh |last4=Banks |first4=Kathleen P. |last5=Freedman |first5=Lynn P. |last6=Kujawski |first6=Stephanie |last7=Markovitz |first7=Amanda |last8=Ndwiga |first8=Charity |last9=Ramsey |first9=Kate |last10=Ratcliffe |first10=Hannah |last11=Ugwu |first11=Emmanuel O. |last12=Warren |first12=Charlotte E. |last13=Jolivet |first13=R.

Non-confidential care means that the woman was exposed or has any personal medical information disclosed without consent. Non-dignified care refers to a provider being scolding, threatening, negative or discouraging. Discrimination within this context refers to refusing care because of age, medical background, or cultural/language background.  Non-consented care refers to when procedures such as caesarean section or sterilization, were not explained before being performed. Physical abuse refers to hitting, pinching, restraining, not giving pain-relief medication and even rape/sexual assault. Abandonment of care is when a provider is absent, the patient is ignored or denied companionship from loved ones. Lastly, detention in facilities refers to when providers will not let a patient leave because of outstanding balances, unpaid bribes etc.<ref name=sando/>

==Epidemiology==
Investigations into the [[prevalence]] of these practices have been conducted by the [[World Health Organization]]. Their studies demonstrate that this is a frequent and global problem. Women experience disrespectful, abusive or neglectful treatment during their childbirth, when the birth occurs in medical and health facilities. The abusive relationship and trust between women and health providers can create a great reluctance to obtain medical assistance during birth. Disrespectful and abusive treatment can be experienced during pregnancy. During childbirth, a woman is very vulnerable and cannot protect herself.<ref name = who2>{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134588/1/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf?ua=1&ua=1 | title = The prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth | access-date = 3 August 2017 | publisher = World Health organization }}</ref>

==Consequences==
Obstetric violence has the effect of preventing women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.<ref name="who1"/> The abusive relationship and loss of trust between women and health providers can create great reluctance to obtain medical assistance during birth. Disrespectful and abusive treatment can be experienced during pregnancy. During childbirth, a woman is very vulnerable and cannot protect herself. Results of this abuse can be very negative consequences for the infant and the mother.<ref name = who2 />

==Geography==

=== North America ===
Some sources refer to North American obstetricians and gynecologists, especially between the 1950s and 1980s, practicing what was called "''[[Husband stitch|the husband's stitch]]"'', which is placing extra stitches in the woman's vagina after the episiotomy or natural tearing, supposedly to increase the husband's future sexual pleasure and often causing long-term pain and discomfort to the woman. However, there is no proof that such a practice was widespread in North America,<ref name="doi.org">{{cite journal | last1 = Dobbeleir | first1 = Julie M.L.C.L. | last2 = Landuyt | first2 = Koenraad Van | last3 = Monstrey | first3 = Stan J. | title = Aesthetic surgery of the female genitalia | journal = Seminars in Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 130&ndash;141 | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | pmc = 3312147 | date = May 2011 | pmid=22547970}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Northrup | first = Christiane | title = Women's bodies, women's wisdom: the creating physical and emotional health and healing | url = https://archive.org/details/womensbodieswome00nort_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Bantam Books | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780553804836}}</ref> but mentions of it frequently appear in studies about [[episiotomy]] in other American countries such as Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Diniz | first1 = Simone G. | last2 = Chacham | first2 = Alessandra S. | title = "The Cut Above" and "the Cut Below'": abuse of caesareans and episiotomy in São Paulo, Brazil | journal = Reproductive Health Matters | volume = 12 | issue = 23 | pages = 100&ndash;110 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/S0968-8080(04)23112-3 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15242215 | doi-access = free }}</ref>
There has been a more recent highlight on North American doctors' treatment of pregnant women. The more recent idea is that there has been a "redressing" of obstetric violence and that women's right of choice has been compromised in some situations. Although the life of the woman and the fetus is endangered, the woman has the right to refuse care; such as, a caesarean section, episiotomy, and vacuum-assisted delivery. Being coerced into having these invasive procedures has been found to cause long lasting damage, with many women comparing the experience to rape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Borges |first1=Maria T.

The term "obstetric violence" is particularly used in Latin American countries, where the law prohibits such behavior. Such laws exist in several countries, including Argentina, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.<ref>{{cite web | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Sexual and reproductive health: Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth | url =https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth-govnts-support/en/ | website = who.int | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2015 | access-date = 21 October 2017}}

Research into obstetric violence at two public hospitals in Mexico analyzing the birthing experiences for one month in 2012 found that there was physical, verbal abuse and discrimination happened openly.

=== Africa ===
[[Tanzania]] is a country with a history of abuse during childbirth. In 2011, Shannon McMahon and others explored whether or not the supposed interventions to lower abuse during childbirth have been effective. When interviewing women, they referred to their experiences as neutral or better. However, after being shown the different aspects of abuse, an overwhelming majority of the women had actually experienced abuse during childbirth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McMahon |first1=Shannon A |last2=George |first2=Asha S |last3=Chebet |first3=Joy J |last4=Mosha |first4=Idda H |last5=Mpembeni |first5=Rose NM |last6=Winch |first6=Peter J |title=Experiences of and responses to disrespectful maternity care and abuse during childbirth; a qualitative study with women and men in Morogoro Region, Tanzania |journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth |date=12 August 2014 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=268 |doi=10.1186/1471-2393-14-268 |pmid=25112432 |pmc=4261577 |language=En |issn=1471-2393}}</ref>
In 2014, Hannah Ratcliffe and others explored possible interventions to improve the experiences of disrespect and abuse during childbirth. This study was conducted between 2013 and 2014. They implemented an "open birth day" which facilitated communication between patients and providers and educated them on the procedures surrounding birth. Aside from open birth day, they also implemented a "respectful maternity care workshop" which was meant to help create conversation surrounding respect between the staff and patients. What they found was that this approach was successful in helping reconstruct systems without costing much. There was an increase of 60% in satisfaction with women's delivery experience.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ratcliffe |first1=Hannah L. |last2=Sando |first2=David |last3=Lyatuu |first3=Goodluck Willey |last4=Emil |first4=Faida |last5=Mwanyika-Sando |first5=Mary |last6=Chalamilla |first6=Guerino |last7=Langer |first7=Ana |last8=McDonald |first8=Kathleen P. |title=Mitigating disrespect and abuse during childbirth in Tanzania: an exploratory study of the effects of two facility-based interventions in a large public hospital |journal=Reproductive Health |date=18 July 2016 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=79 |doi=10.1186/s12978-016-0187-z |pmid=27424608 |pmc=4948096 |language=En |issn=1742-4755}}</ref>
During the same time period as Ratcliffe's study, Stephanie Kujawaki and others did a comparative study of births with and without an intervention.  The baseline for the study was conducted in 2011-2012 and the final half of the study was conducted in 2015. What they found is that there was a 66% reduction in experiencing abuse and disrespect during childbirth. This study shows that community and health system reforms can help change and reshape norms in which women are mistreated during childbirth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kujawski |first1=Stephanie A. |last2=Freedman |first2=Lynn P. |last3=Ramsey |first3=Kate |last4=Mbaruku |first4=Godfrey |last5=Mbuyita |first5=Selemani |last6=Moyo |first6=Wema |last7=Kruk |first7=Margaret E. |title=Community and health system intervention to reduce disrespect and abuse during childbirth in Tanga Region, Tanzania: A comparative before-and-after study |journal=PLOS Medicine |date=11 July 2017 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=e1002341 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002341 |pmid=28700587 |pmc=5507413 |issn=1549-1676}}</ref>
