'''Cardiovascular fitness''' is a health-related component of [[physical fitness]] that is brought about by sustained physical activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frankmoranfitness.com/fitnessglossary.htm |title=Glossary of Fitness and Health Terms |author=Frank Moran |date= |publisher=Frank Moran |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207005653/http://www.frankmoranfitness.com/fitnessglossary.htm |archive-date=December 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A person's ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many [[physiological]] parameters, including [[heart rate]], stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption.

Understanding the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general [[metabolism]] rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, [[haemoglobin]] rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, [[venous return]] is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on [[muscular endurance]], and an indirect effect on [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[flexibility]].

To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, an individual needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]]. A 2005 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hillsdon|first=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}</ref>
