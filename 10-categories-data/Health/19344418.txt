Some rare but previously observed signs also include persistent pacing, rubbing and licking. Additionally, nonspecific signs have also been observed which include weight loss, decreased milk production, lameness, ear infections and teeth grinding due to pain. Some animals may show a combination of these signs, while others may only be observed demonstrating one of the many reported. Once clinical signs arise, they typically get worse over the subsequent weeks and months, eventually leading to recumbency, coma and death.<ref name=":0" />

== Cause ==
BSE is an infectious disease believed to be due to a misfolded protein,{{which|date=October 2020}} known as a [[prion]].<ref name=CDC2018Ab/><ref name=FDA2018/> Cattle are believed to have been infected from being fed [[meat and bone meal]] (MBM) that contained the remains of other cattle who spontaneously developed the disease or [[scrapie]]-infected sheep products.<ref name=CDC2018Ab/> The outbreak increased throughout the United Kingdom due to the practice of feeding meat-and-bone meal to young calves of dairy cows.<ref name=CDC2018Ab/><ref name=AMJ1997/>

Prions replicate by causing other normally folded proteins of the same type to take on their misfolded shape, which then go on to do the same, leading to an exponential chain reaction. Eventually, the prions aggregate into an [[alpha helical]], [[beta pleated sheet]], which is thought to be toxic to brain cells.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The agent is not destroyed even if the beef or material containing it is cooked or heat-treated.<ref name="TSE">{{cite web |title=Bovine Spongiform Encephalopaphy: An Overview  |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/BSEbrochure12-2006.pdf  |access-date=8 April 2008  |date=December 2006  |publisher=[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]]  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308030306/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/content/printable_version/BSEbrochure12-2006.pdf  |archive-date=8 March 2008  |df=dmy }}</ref> Transmission can occur when healthy animals come in contact with tainted tissues from others with the disease. In the brain, the agent causes native cellular prion protein to deform into the misfolded state, which then goes on to deform further prion protein in an exponential cascade. This results in protein aggregates, which then form dense [[senile plaques|plaque]] fibers. Brain cells begin to die off in massive numbers, eventually leading to the microscopic appearance of "holes" in the brain, degeneration of physical and mental abilities, and ultimately death.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The British Government enquiry took the view that the cause was not scrapie, as had originally been postulated, but was some event in the 1970s that could not be identified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/report/volume1/execsum4.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090505194948/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/report/volume1/execsum4.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-05-05|title=Vol.1 - Executive Summary of the Report of the Inquiry|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Histology bse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Brain tissue of a cow with BSE showing the typical microscopic "holes" in the grey matter]]
Diagnosis of BSE continues to be a practical problem. It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no signs are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> reliably except by examining ''post mortem'' brain tissue using neuropathological and immunohistochemical methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.{{by whom|date=August 2015}}

The traditional method of diagnosis relies on [[histopathological]] examination of the [[medulla oblongata]] of the brain, and other tissues, ''[[post mortem]]''. [[Immunohistochemistry]] can be used to demonstrate prion protein accumulation.<ref name="WikiVet">[http://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503042615/https://en.wikivet.net/Bovine_Spongiform_Encephalopathy |date=3 May 2016 }} reviewed and published by [[WikiVet]]. Retrieved 11 October 2011.</ref>

In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10<sup>−11</sup>) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA)|surround optical fiber immunoassay]] and some specific antibodies against PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an [[antibody]] for specificity and then finally loaded into a microcapillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus so it is totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artifacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop scrapie. The animals’ brains were analysed once any signs became apparent. The researchers could, therefore, compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited signs of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals. The results showed very clearly that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be detected in the blood of animals long before the signs appeared. After further development and testing, this method could be of great value in surveillance as a blood- or urine-based screening test for BSE.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Detecting Prions in Blood |journal=Microbiology Today. |pages=195 |date=August 2010 |url= https://www.sgm.ac.uk/pubs/micro_today/pdf/081010.pdf |access-date=21 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bionosis.com/news/Bionosis%20PrioNet%20Poster.pdf | title = SOFIA: An Assay Platform for Ultrasensitive Detection of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in Brain and Blood | publisher = SUNY Downstate Medical Center | authorlink = Rubenstein, R., et al. | access-date = 19 August 2011}}</ref>

===Classification===
BSE is a transmissible disease that primarily affects the [[central nervous system]]; it is a form of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]], like [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] and [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] in humans and [[scrapie]] in sheep, and [[chronic wasting disease]] in [[cervids|deer]].<ref name=Budka2015rev>{{cite journal | vauthors = Budka H, Will RG | title = The end of the BSE saga: do we still need surveillance for human prion diseases? | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 145 | pages = w14212 | date = 12 November 2015 | pmid = 26715203 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2015.14212 | url = https://smw.ch/index.php?id=75&tx_ezmjournal_articledetail[identifier]=smw.2015.14212 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eraña H, Venegas V, Moreno J, Castilla J | title = Prion-like disorders and Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: An overview of the mechanistic features that are shared by the various disease-related misfolded proteins | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 483 | issue = 4 | pages = 1125–1136 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27590581 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.08.166 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/897700 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Waddell L, Greig J, Mascarenhas M, Otten A, Corrin T, Hierlihy K | title = Current evidence on the transmissibility of chronic wasting disease prions to humans-A systematic review | journal = Transboundary and Emerging Diseases | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–49 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28139079 | doi = 10.1111/tbed.12612 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Prevention==
A ban on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle has resulted in a strong reduction in cases in countries where the disease has been present. In disease-free countries, control relies on import control, feeding regulations, and surveillance measures.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

In UK and US [[slaughterhouse]]s, the brain, spinal cord, [[Trigeminal ganglion|trigeminal ganglia]], intestines, eyes, and tonsils from cattle are classified as [[specified risk material]]s, and must be disposed of appropriately.<ref name="WikiVet"/>

An enhanced BSE-related feed ban was enacted in both the United States (2009) and Canada (2007) to help improve prevention and elimination of BSE.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/feed-ban.html|title=Feed Bans BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) {{!}} Prion Diseases {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
The tests used for detecting BSE vary considerably, as do the regulations in various jurisdictions for when, and which cattle, must be tested. For instance in the EU, the cattle tested are older (30 months or older), while many cattle are slaughtered younger than that. At the opposite end of the scale, Japan tests all cattle at the time of slaughter. Tests are also difficult, as the altered prion protein has very low levels in blood or urine, and no other signal has been found. Newer tests{{specify|date=July 2016}} are faster, more sensitive, and cheaper, so future figures possibly may be more comprehensive. Even so, currently the only reliable test is examination of tissues during a [[necropsy]].

As for vCJD in humans, autopsy tests are not always done, so those figures, too, are likely to be too low, but probably by a lesser fraction. In the United Kingdom, anyone with possible vCJD symptoms must be reported to the Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] has refused to impose a national requirement that physicians and hospitals report cases of the disease. Instead, the agency relies on other methods, including death certificates and urging physicians to send suspicious cases to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, which is funded by the CDC.

To control potential transmission of vCJD within the United States, the FDA had established strict restrictions on individuals' eligibility to donate blood. Individuals who had spent a cumulative time of 3 months or more in the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996, or a cumulative time of 5 years or more from 1980 to 2020 in any combination of countries in Europe, were prohibited from [[Blood donation|donating blood]].<ref>[http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical-listing#arc5 Eligibility Criteria for Blood Donation], American Red Cross</ref>

Due to blood shortages associated with the [[COVID-19 pandemic|2020 COVID-19 outbreak]], the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] announced that these restrictions were rescinded effective immediately. They are expected to remain rescinded indefinitely.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-updated-guidance-address-urgent-need-blood-during-pandemic FDA Provides Updated Guidance Addressing Urgent Need For Blood During The Pandemic], Food and Drug Administration</ref>

==== United States ====
Soybean meal is cheap and plentiful in the [[United States]], and cottonseed meal (1.5 million tons of which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is  suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals) is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to [[ruminant]]s such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and [[poultry]]. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rampton|first1=Sheldon|last2=Stauber|first2=John | name-list-style = vanc |title=Mad Cow USA|edition=1st|year=2004|publisher=Common Courage Press|location=Monroe, Maine|isbn=978-1-56751-110-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/madcowusa00shel}}</ref> Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnes R, Lehman C | title = Modeling of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a two-species feedback loop | journal = Epidemics | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 85–91 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746801 | doi = 10.1016/j.epidem.2013.04.001 | arxiv = 1511.04470 | s2cid = 1185101 }}<!--|access-date=12 April 2014--></ref> <!-- A proposal to end the use of cattle blood, restaurant scraps, and [[poultry litter]] (fecal matter, feathers, bedding material)<ref>The term "chicken litter" also includes spilled chicken feed, as well as fecal matter and feathers.

In February 2001, the US [[Government Accountability Office]] reported the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]], which is responsible for regulating feed, had not adequately enforced the various bans. Compliance with the regulations was shown to be extremely poor before the discovery of the cow in Washington infected with BSE in 2003, but industry representatives report that compliance is now total. Even so, critics call the partial prohibitions insufficient. Indeed, US meat producer [[Creekstone Farms Premium Beef|Creekstone Farms]] was forcibly prevented from conducting BSE testing by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], which under an obscure 1913 law had the authority to restrict sales of BSE testing kits, allegedly to protect other producers from being forced to conduct the same tests to stay competitive.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Creekstone Farms response to USDA appeal of summary judgement | publisher = 3buddies | date = 30 May 2007 | url = http://www.3buddies.com/creekstone/news-appeal-response.html | access-date = 20 June 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928064710/http://www.3buddies.com/creekstone/news-appeal-response.html | archive-date = 28 September 2007 }}

====Effect on the US beef industry====
{{Update section|date=November 2016}}
Japan was the top importer of US beef, buying 240,000 tons valued at $1.4 billion in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} After the discovery of the first case of BSE in the US on 23 December 2003, Japan halted US beef imports. In December 2005, Japan once again allowed imports of US beef, but reinstated its ban in January 2006 after a violation of the US-Japan beef import agreement: a vertebral column, which should have been removed prior to shipment, was included in a shipment of veal.

Tokyo yielded to US pressure to resume imports, ignoring consumer worries about the safety of US beef, said Japanese consumer groups. Michiko Kamiyama from Food Safety Citizen Watch and Yoko Tomiyama from [[Consumers Union of Japan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fswatch.org/newsletter/english/issue05.html|title=Food Safety Citizens'Watch English Newsletter|website=www.fswatch.org}}</ref> said about this: "The government has put priority on the political schedule between the two countries, not on food safety or human health."

Sixty-five nations implemented full or partial restrictions on importing US beef products because of concerns that US testing lacked sufficient rigor. As a result, exports of US beef declined from 1,300,000 [[tonnes]] (t) in 2003, (before the first mad cow was detected in the US) to 322,000 t in 2004. This has increased since then to 771,000 t in 2007 and to 1,300,000 t by 2017.<ref name="usmef">{{cite web|title=Statistics |url=http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/Statistics.asp |work=Trade Library |publisher=U.S. Meat Export Federation |access-date=20 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514152807/http://www.usmef.org/TradeLibrary/Statistics.asp |archive-date=14 May 2009 }}

On 31 December 2006, Hematech, Inc, a biotechnology company based in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls]], South Dakota, announced it had used genetic engineering and cloning technology to produce cattle that lacked a necessary gene for prion production – thus theoretically making them immune to BSE.<ref>{{cite news | first = Rick | last = Weiss | name-list-style = vanc | title = Scientists Announce Mad Cow Breakthrough | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/31/AR2006123100672.html |work=The Washington Post | date = 1 January 2007 | access-date = 1 January 2007}}</ref>

{{Main|United Kingdom BSE outbreak}}
[[File:ESB UK-1987-2008.svg|lang=en|thumb|upright=1.5|Evolution of the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the UK.]]
Cattle are naturally [[herbivore]]s, eating [[grass]]es. In modern industrial cattle-farming, though, various commercial feeds are used, which may contain ingredients including [[antibiotic]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and [[protein]] supplements. The use of meat and [[bone meal]], produced from the ground and cooked leftovers of the slaughtering process, as well as from the carcasses of sick and injured animals such as cattle or sheep<!-- rendered chicken parts are called poultry meal-->, as a protein supplement in cattle feed was widespread in [[Europe]] prior to about 1987.<ref name="FDA/CFSAN"/> Worldwide, [[soybean]] meal is the primary plant-based protein supplement fed to cattle. However, soybeans do not grow well in Europe, so cattle raisers throughout Europe turned to the cheaper animal byproduct feeds as an alternative. The British Inquiry dismissed suggestions that changes to processing might have increased the infectious agents in cattle feed, saying, "changes in process could not have been solely responsible for the emergence of BSE, and changes in regulation were not a factor at all."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/index.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090505194948/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-05-05 |title=The BSE Inquiry: Home|work=Open.gov.uk|date =October 2000|access-date=27 August 2014}}</ref> (The prion causing BSE is not destroyed by heat treatment.)

The first confirmed instance in which an animal fell ill with the disease occurred in 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and lab tests the following year indicated the presence of BSE; by November 1987, the British Ministry of Agriculture accepted it had a new disease on its hands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn111-brain-disease-drives-cows-wild/ |title=Brain disease drives cows wild| date=5 November 1987 | work=NewScientist | first=Stephanie | last=Pain | name-list-style = vanc | access-date=7 December 2018 }}</ref> Subsequently, 177 people (as of June 2014) contracted and died of a disease with similar neurological symptoms subsequently called (new) [[variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).<ref name="NCJDSU">{{cite web |title=Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease, Current Data (October 2009) |url=http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm  |access-date=14 October 2009  |date=October 2009  |publisher=The National Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU), [[University of Edinburgh]]  |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721234746/http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdworld.htm  |archive-date=21 July 2012  |df=dmy }};</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/worldfigs.pdf|title=Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Current Data|date=June 2014|access-date=11 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226031911/http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/documents/worldfigs.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is a separate disease from 'classical' [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], which is not related to BSE and has been known about since the early 1900s. Three cases of vCJD occurred in people who had lived in or visited the UK – one each in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States of America]]. Also, some concern existed about those who work with (and therefore inhale) cattle [[meat and bone meal]], such as [[horticulture|horticulturists]], who use it as fertilizer. Up-to-date statistics on all types of CJD are published by the National Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit <!-- (NCJDSU) --> in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].

For many of the vCJD patients, direct evidence exists that they had consumed tainted [[beef]], and this is assumed to be the mechanism by which all affected individuals contracted it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Disease incidence also appears to correlate with slaughtering practices that led to the mixture of [[nervous system]] tissue with [[ground meat]] (mince) and other beef. An estimated 400,000 cattle infected with BSE entered the human food chain in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Although the BSE epizootic was eventually brought under control by [[culling]] all suspect cattle populations, people are still being diagnosed with vCJD each year (though the number of new cases currently has dropped to fewer than five per year). This is attributed to the long incubation period for prion diseases, which is typically measured in years or decades. As a result, the full extent of the human vCJD outbreak is still not known.

The scientific consensus is that infectious BSE prion material is not destroyed through cooking procedures, meaning that even contaminated beef foodstuffs prepared "well done" may remain infectious.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mad cow disease: Still a concern |url=http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |work=MayoClinic.com |publisher=CNN |date=10 February 2006 |access-date=20 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425012159/http://premium.edition.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/ID/00012.html |archive-date=25 April 2005 }}

Alan Colchester, a professor of neurology at the [[University of Kent]], and Nancy Colchester, writing in the 3 September 2005 issue of the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', proposed a theory that the most likely initial origin of BSE in the United Kingdom was the importation from the Indian Subcontinent of bone meal which contained CJD-infected human remains.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colchester AC, Colchester NT | title = The origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy: the human prion disease hypothesis | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9488 | pages = 856–61 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16139661 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67218-2 | s2cid = 38330299 }}</ref> The government of India vehemently responded to the research, calling it "misleading, highly mischievous; a figment of imagination; absurd," further adding that India maintained constant surveillance and had not had a single case of either BSE or vCJD.<ref>{{cite news | title = India dismisses Lancet's mad cow | first1 = Chandrika | last1 = Mago | first2 = Kounteya | last2 = Sinha | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1218869.cms |work=The Times of India | date = 2 September 2005 | access-date = 20 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = New theory traces mad cow disease to animal feed exported from India | first = Geoff | last = Thompson | name-list-style = vanc | url = http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1453543.htm | work = The World Today | publisher = ABC | date = 5 September 2005 | access-date = 20 June 2009 }}</ref> The authors responded in the 22 January 2006 issue of ''The Lancet'' that their theory is unprovable only in the same sense as all other BSE origin theories are and that the theory warrants further investigation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron T, Biacabe AG | title = Origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9507 | pages = 297–8; author reply 298–9 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16443028 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68062-8 | s2cid = 54248829 }}

During the course of the investigation into the BSE epizootic, an enquiry was also made into the activities of the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] [[Medicines Control Agency]] (MCA). On 7 May 1999, [[David Osborne Hagger]], a retired civil servant who worked in the Medicines Division of the Department of Health between 1984 and 1994, produced a written statement to the BSE Inquiry in which he gave an account of his professional experience of BSE.<ref name="haggerpdf">{{cite web|url=http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/ws/s476.pdf|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080102164404/http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk/files/ws/s476.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 January 2008|title=BSE Inquiry, Statement No. 476|date=7 May 1999|publisher=BSE Inquiry|access-date=16 October 2008}} Statement of David Osborne Hagger, Head of Abridged Licensing and Coordinator of the Executive support business of the Medicines Division of the [[British Department of Health|Department of Health]] at Market Towers in London.</ref>

In February 1989, the MCA had been asked to "identify relevant manufacturers and obtain information about the bovine material contained in children’s vaccines, the stocks of these vaccines and how long it would take to switch to other products." In July, "[the] use of bovine insulin in a small group of mainly elderly patients was noted and it was recognised that alternative products for this group were not considered satisfactory." In September, the BSE Working Party of the [[Committee on the Safety of Medicines]] (CSM) recommended that "no licensing action is required at present in regard to products produced from bovine material or using prepared bovine brain in nutrient media and sourced from outside the [[United Kingdom]], the Channel Isles and the Republic of Ireland provided that the country of origin is known to be free of BSE, has competent veterinary advisers and is known to practise good animal husbandry."

In 1990, the British Diabetic Association became concerned regarding the safety of bovine insulin. The CSM assured them "[that] there was no insulin sourced from cattle in the UK or Ireland and that the situation in other countries was being monitored."

In 1991, the European Commission "[expressed] concerns about the possible transmission of the BSE/scrapie agent to man through use of certain cosmetic treatments."{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1992, sources in France reported to the MCA "that BSE had now been reported in France and there were some licensed surgical sutures derived from French bovine material." Concerns were also raised at a CSM meeting "regarding a possible risk of transmission of the BSE agent in gelatin products."<ref name="haggerpdf" />

For this failure, France was heavily criticised internationally. Thillier himself queried why there had never been a ban on French beef or basic safety precautions to stop the food chain becoming contaminated, suggesting "Perhaps because the French government forgot its role in guaranteeing the safety of food products, and this neglect cost the lives of nine people."<ref name="Standard">{{cite news|last1=Sparks|first1=Ian | name-list-style = vanc |title=Yes, we had mad cow disease too, France confesses|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/yes-we-had-mad-cow-disease-too-france-confesses-6927256.html|access-date=23 September 2017|publisher=Evening Standard|date=6 November 2008}}</ref> The Sydney Morning Herald added, "while blustering French politicians blamed Britain for the emergence of the disease  – and tried to quarantine the country by banning imports of British beef – they failed to adopt measures to prevent a hidden epidemic at home."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilsher|first1=Kim | name-list-style = vanc |title=France in denial as BSE-infected beef entered food chain|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/07/04/1088879375088.html|website=SMH.com|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=23 September 2017|date=2004-07-05}}</ref>

====The ban on British beef====
The BSE crisis led to the [[European Union]] (EU) banning exports of British beef with effect from March 1996; the ban lasted for 10 years before it was finally lifted on 1 May 2006<ref name="BBC-3-May-2006">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4967480.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=End to 10-year British beef ban |date=3 May 2006}}</ref> despite attempts in May through September 1996 by British prime minister [[John Major]] to get the ban lifted.

[[Russia]] was proceeding to lift the ban sometime after November 2012 after 16 years; the announcement was made during a visit by the UK's chief veterinary officer [[Nigel Gibbens]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20454206 |title=Russia to lift 16-year ban on British beef and lamb |date=22 November 2012 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref>

It was successfully negotiated that beef from Wales was allowed to be exported to the Dutch market, which had formerly been an important market for Northern Irish beef. Of two approved export establishments in the United Kingdom in 1999, one was in Scotland – an establishment to which live beef was supplied from Northern Ireland. As the incidence of BSE was very low in Northern Ireland – only six cases of BSE in 1999 – partly due to the early adoption of an advanced herd tagging and computerization system in the region, calls were made to remove the EU ban on exports with regard to Northern Irish beef.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmniaf/62/6205.htm UK Parliament website] Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs Second Report</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Northern Ireland (BSE) (Hansard, 10 February 2000) | website=api.parliament.uk | date=2000-02-10 | url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/2000/feb/10/northern-ireland-bse#column_393 | quote=My right hon.

Similar wildcat bans from countries known to have BSE were imposed in various European countries, although these were mostly subsequently ruled illegal. ''[[The Economist]]'' noted, "Unfortunately, much of the crisis in Europe can be blamed on politicians and bureaucrats. Even while some European countries were clamouring for bans on British beef, they were ignoring warnings from the European Commission about how to avoid the spread of BSE in their own herds."<ref name="Economist">{{cite news |title=Europe's mad cows |url=http://www.economist.com/node/436033 |access-date=23 September 2017 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=28 November 2000}}</ref>

==History==
Different hypotheses exist for the origin of BSE in cattle. One hypothesis suggests it may have jumped species from the disease [[scrapie]] in sheep, and another hypothesis suggests that it evolved from a rare spontaneous form of "mad cow disease" that has been seen occasionally in cattle for many centuries.<ref>{{cite journal| last = MacKenzie| first = Debora|date=17 March 2007| title = New twist in tale of BSE's beginnings| journal     = New Scientist| issue = 2595| url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325954.400-new-twist-in-tale-of-bses-beginnings.html| access-date  = 20 June 2009| doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(07)60642-3| volume = 193| pages = 11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Huor A, Espinosa JC, Vidal E, Cassard H, Douet JY, Lugan S, Aron N, Marín-Moreno A, Lorenzo P, Aguilar-Calvo P, Badiola J, Bolea R, Pumarola M, Benestad SL, Orge L, Thackray AM, Bujdoso R, Torres JM, Andreoletti O | display-authors = 6 | title = The emergence of classical BSE from atypical/Nor98 scrapie | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 116 | issue = 52 | pages = 26853–26862 | date = December 2019 | pmid = 31843908 | pmc = 6936354 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1915737116 }}</ref> In the 5th century [[Before Christ|BC]], [[Hippocrates]] described a similar illness in cattle and sheep, which he believed also occurred in man.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McAlister V | title = Sacred disease of our times: failure of the infectious disease model of spongiform encephalopathy | journal = Clinical and Investigative Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 101–4 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 16021982 | url = http://works.bepress.com/vivianmcalister/10/ }}</ref> [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]] recorded cases of a disease with similar characteristics in the fourth and fifth centuries AD.<ref>[[Digesta Artis Mulomedicinae]], [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus]]</ref>

In more recent UK history, the official BSE inquiry (published 2000) suggested that the outbreak there "probably arose from a single point source in the southwest of England in the 1970s".<ref name=Prusiner2001/>
