The '''Hospital of St John the Baptist''' was a hospital in [[High Wycombe]] in Buckinghamshire, England between 1180 and 1548. It was situated on the main road that ran from [[Oxford]] to London (what is now the [[A40 road|A40]]) east of the town centre.

==The Hospital==
In the 12th century hospitals were used as [[almshouse]]s for the poor or infirm. Founded by the [[Roman Catholic Church|church]], the Hospital of St John the Baptist was run by a Master (normally a [[monk]] or other religious figure) and a small community of brothers and sisters (other members of the church) who cared for the people who came to them for help. Three further beds at the hospital were also set aside for other poor or infirm people who were passing through on the road either to London or to Oxford.

The earliest known Master was Brother Gilbert who, in 1236, wrote to [[Pope Gregory IX]] in Rome asking for permission to establish a chapel dedicated to [[John the Baptist|St John the Baptist]] at the hospital. This permission was granted by [[Papal decree]] in 1239 and the chapel built shortly after. It is not known whether the hospital took on the name of St John the Baptist at this time, or whether it had already received that dedication.

The hospital continued to run until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the mid 16th century when all property belonging to the [[Catholic]] church was seized by [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. Officially the property of the King from that point in history, the hospital struggled to survive and eventually closed in 1548. The last recorded Master was Charles Chalfont{{ref|1}}, who ran the hospital from 1541 to 1548.

==The school==
In 1550 the buildings of the hospital were acquired by the mayor and [[Burgess (title)|burgess]]es of the town who wished to establish a school. The school took in boys by subscription and trained them in academic studies such as reading, writing, arithmetic and the classics. Most if not all of the boys who attended the school would have then gone on to university, probably at [[Oxford]]. In 1562 the school received a [[Royal charter]] from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. From that point on the school was (and still is) known as the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe|Royal Grammar School]].

The school operated in the old hospital until 1883 when funds were found for a new building. This was constructed just to the north of the old hospital, and the ancient building was finally demolished. In 1915 the school was then moved from this location altogether to its current location on [[Amersham Hill]].

==National Monument==
Part of the original hospital building was pulled down in 1767 to make way for the widening of the main road so that it could be established as a [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]]. The south wall of the hall was taken down at this time, and the hall shortened from 15 metres to about 12 metres. At the time of demolition most of the remaining buildings were pulled down, but some parts of the building were left standing. This includes the north wall and five columns of the hall with four [[arch]]es showing typical 12th century decoration and the north chapel wall with two half [[Latticework|lattice]] windows from the 13th&ndash;14th centuries. These [[ruins]] still remain today.

At the end of the 19th century the ruins left from the original demolition were strengthened using brick [[buttress]]es; in the early 20th century the columns and both walls were given stronger [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] of cement.

In 1993 the ruins were declared an [[English national monument]] by [[English Heritage]]. Today they are well looked after and are lit up at night making them a local landmark.

==Notes==
* {{note|1}} This name is recorded on the plaque that stands outside the hospital ruin. Others record this person as William Chalfont.
