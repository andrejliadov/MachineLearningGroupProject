'''Autoimmune disease in women''' is a description of the autoimmune diseases that affect women. Some of these differences are unique to women such as the effects during pregnancy. Women with autoimmune diseases can safely have children. There are some risks for the mother or baby, depending on the disease and how severe it is. For instance, pregnant women with [[lupus]] have a higher risk of [[preterm birth]] and [[stillbirth]]. [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] women with [[myasthenia gravis]] (MG) might have [[symptoms]] that lead to trouble breathing during pregnancy. For some women, symptoms tend to improve during pregnancy, while others find their symptoms tend to flare up. Also, some [[medicines]] used to treat [[autoimmune disease]]s might not be safe to use during pregnancy.<ref name=ATA>{{cite web  | url = http://www.thyroid.org/wp-content/uploads/patients/brochures/Postpartum_Thyroiditis_brochure.pdf | title = Postpartum Thyroiditis brochure | accessdate = 24 July 2017 | date = 2014 | publisher = American Thyroid Organization}}</ref><ref name=NIH2017/>

==During pregnancy==
Talking with a health care provider before becoming pregnant is recommended. They may suggest to wait until the disease is in remission or suggest a change in medication before becoming pregnant. There are [[endocrinologist]]s that specialize in treating women with high-risk pregnancies.<ref name=NIH2017/>

Some women with autoimmune diseases may have problems getting pregnant. This can happen for many reasons. Tests can tell if fertility problems are caused by an autoimmune disease or an unrelated reason. Fertility treatments are able to help some women with autoimmune disease become pregnant.<ref name=NIH2017/>

==Limitations==
Although most autoimmune diseases cannot be cured, it is possible to manage the disease and participate in same activities that other women are able to do. Women with autoimmune diseases lead full, active lives. Seeing a specialist will assist in maintaining function and the maintenance of optimal health.<ref name=NIH2017/>

==Non-pharmacological treatment==
Non-pharmacological treatments are effective in treating autoimmune disease and contribute to a sense of well-being. Women can:
*Eat healthy, well-balanced meals that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk products, and lean sources of protein. A healthy diet limits saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars.<ref name=NIH2017/>
*Engage in regular physical activity without overdoing it. Consulting with a clinician about what types of physical activity is appropriate. A gradual and gentle exercise program often works well for people with long-lasting muscle and joint pain. Some types of [[yoga]] or [[tai chi]] may be helpful.<ref name=NIH2017/>
*Get enough rest. Rest allows body tissues and joints the time they need to repair. Sleeping is a great way to maintain health and helps both body and mind. Lack of sleep, stress levels and symptoms might get worsen. Immunity to other infections or diseases is reduced when sleep is not adequate. Rest contributes to the ability to handle the stressors and problems. Many people need at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each day to feel well-rested.<ref name=NIH2017/>
*Reduce stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger symptoms to flare up with some autoimmune diseases. Simplifying daily stressors will help contribute to a sense of well-being. [[Meditation]], [[self-hypnosis]], and [[guided imagery]], may be effective in reducing stress, reducing pain, and the ability to deal with other aspects of living with the disease . Instructional materials can assist with learning these activities such as self-help books, audio sources, tapes, or with the help of an instructor. Joining a support group or talking with a counselor might also help manage stress and cope with the disease.<ref name=NIH2017/>

==Complementary treatments==

* Some complementary treatments can be effective and include:
* Listening to music
* Taking time to relax in a comfortable position
* Using  imagery throughout the day
* Imagining confronting the pain and watching it be destroyed.<ref name=NIH2017>{{cite web|title=Autoimmune Diseases|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/az-topics/autoimmunediseases|publisher=Office on Womenâ€™s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{PD-notice}}</ref>
