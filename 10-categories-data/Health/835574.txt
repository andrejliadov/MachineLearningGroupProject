'''Consumer health informatics''' ('''CHI''') is a sub-branch of [[health informatics]] that helps bridge the gap between patients and health resources. It is defined by the [[American Medical Informatics Association]] as "the field devoted to informatics from multiple consumer or patient views". The Consumer Health Informatics Working Group (CHIWG) of the [[International Medical Informatics Association]] (IMIA) define it as "the use of modern computers and telecommunications to support consumers in obtaining information, analyzing unique health care needs and helping them make decisions about their own health".<ref>{{cite web|last1=IMIA|first1=CHIWG|title=Consumer Health Informatics|url=http://www.imia-medinfo.org/new2/node/137|website=IMIA|accessdate=8 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307030452/http://www.imia-medinfo.org/new2/node/137|archivedate=7 March 2015}}</ref>
