==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Main symptoms of diabetes.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes]]

The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are unintended [[weight loss]], [[polyuria]] (increased urination), [[polydipsia]] (increased thirst), and [[polyphagia]] (increased hunger).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cooke DW, Plotnick L | s2cid = 20528207 | title = Type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics | journal = Pediatrics in Review | volume = 29 | issue = 11 | pages = 374–84; quiz 385 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18977856 | doi = 10.1542/pir.29-11-374 }}</ref> Symptoms may develop rapidly (weeks or months) in type 1 diabetes, while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type 2 diabetes.<ref name=WHO2019Fact>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs138/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Diabetes mellitus|website=WHO|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>

Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of diabetes although they are not specific to the disease. In addition to the known ones above, they include [[blurred vision]], [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], slow [[Wound healing|healing of cuts]], and [[Pruritus|itchy skin]]. Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens of the eye]], which leads to changes in its shape, resulting in [[vision changes]]. Long-term vision loss can also be caused by [[diabetic retinopathy]]. A number of [[skin rashes]] that can occur in diabetes are collectively known as [[diabetic dermadrome]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WpbVCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP6|title=Diabetes: Symptoms, Causes, Treatment and Prevention|last=Rockefeller|first=J.D.|date=2015|isbn=978-1-5146-0305-5|language=en}}</ref>

===Diabetic emergencies===
People (usually with type 1 diabetes) may also experience episodes of [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), a metabolic disturbance characterized by nausea, vomiting and [[abdominal pain]], the smell of [[acetone]] on the breath, deep breathing known as [[Kussmaul breathing]], and in severe cases a decreased level of consciousness.<ref name=ADA2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kitabchi AE, Umpierrez GE, Miles JM, Fisher JN | title = Hyperglycemic crises in adult patients with diabetes | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 1335–43 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19564476 | pmc = 2699725 | doi = 10.2337/dc09-9032 | url = http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/7/1335.full | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160625075136/http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/7/1335.full | url-status=live | archive-date = 2016-06-25 }}</ref>  A rare but equally severe possibility is [[hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state]] (HHS), which is more common in type 2 diabetes and is mainly the result of [[dehydration]].<ref name=ADA2009/>

Treatment-related [[Hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]] (hypoglycemia) is common in people with type 1 and also type 2 diabetes depending on the medication being used.  Most cases are mild and are not considered [[Medical emergency|medical emergencies]].  Effects can range from [[Anxiety|feelings of unease]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[Tremor|trembling]], and increased appetite in mild cases to more serious effects such as [[Altered mental status|confusion]], changes in behavior such as [[Aggression|aggressiveness]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], [[unconsciousness]], and (rarely) permanent [[brain damage]] or [[death]] in severe cases.<ref name=Kenny2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kenny C | title = When hypoglycemia is not obvious: diagnosing and treating under-recognized and undisclosed hypoglycemia | journal = Primary Care Diabetes | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–11 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24100231 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcd.2013.09.002 | url = http://www.primary-care-diabetes.com/article/S1751-9918(13)00113-7/fulltext | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=Verrotti2012>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verrotti A, Scaparrotta A, Olivieri C, Chiarelli F | title = Seizures and type 1 diabetes mellitus: current state of knowledge | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 167 | issue = 6 | pages = 749–58 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22956556 | doi = 10.1530/EJE-12-0699 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Tachypnea|Rapid breathing]], sweating, and cold, pale skin are characteristic of low blood sugar but not definitive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Symptoms of Low Blood Sugar|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/symptoms-of-low-blood-sugar-topic-overview|website=WebMD|access-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618163454/http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/symptoms-of-low-blood-sugar-topic-overview|archive-date=18 June 2016}}</ref>  Mild to moderate cases are self-treated by eating or drinking something high in sugar.

===Complications===

[[File:Diabetes complications.jpg|thumb|Retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are potential complications of diabetes]]
All forms of diabetes increase the risk of long-term complications. These typically develop after many years (10–20) but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time.

The major long-term complications relate to damage to [[blood vessel]]s.

Type&nbsp;1 diabetes is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreatic islets]], leading to insulin deficiency. This type can be further classified as [[immune-mediated]] or [[Idiopathic disease|idiopathic]]. The majority of type&nbsp;1 diabetes is of the immune-mediated nature, in which a [[T cell]]-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] attack leads to the loss of beta cells and thus insulin.<ref name="Rother">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rother KI | title = Diabetes treatment—bridging the divide | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 356 | issue = 15 | pages = 1499–501 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17429082 | pmc = 4152979 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078030 }}</ref> It causes approximately 10% of diabetes mellitus cases in North America and Europe.

"Brittle" diabetes, also known as unstable diabetes or labile diabetes, is a term that was traditionally used to describe the dramatic and recurrent swings in [[glucose]] levels, often occurring for no apparent reason in insulin-dependent diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood. [[Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults]] (LADA) is the diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults; it has a slower onset than the same condition in children.

===Gestational diabetes===

Gestational diabetes resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2–10% of all [[pregnancy|pregnancies]] and may improve or disappear after delivery.<ref name=NDIC_Stats>{{cite web|title=National Diabetes Clearinghouse (NDIC): National Diabetes Statistics 2011|url=http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/statistics/#Gestational|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=22 April 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417143052/http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/statistics/#Gestational|archive-date=17 April 2014}}</ref> It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested starting around 24–28 weeks gestation.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Soldavini|first=Jessica|date=November 2019|title=Krause's Food & The Nutrition Care Process|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior|volume=51|issue=10|pages=1225|doi=10.1016/j.jneb.2019.06.022|issn=1499-4046}}</ref> It is most often diagnosed in the second or third trimester because of the increase in insulin-antagonist hormone levels that occurs at this time.<ref name=":2" /> However, after pregnancy approximately 5–10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have another form of diabetes, most commonly type 2.<ref name=NDIC_Stats /> Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy.

Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include [[macrosomia]] (high birth weight), [[Congenital heart defect|congenital heart]] and [[central nervous system]] abnormalities, and [[skeletal muscle]] malformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetal [[surfactant]] production and cause [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]]. A [[Bilirubin#Hyperbilirubinemia|high blood bilirubin level]] may result from [[hemolysis|red blood cell destruction]]. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. [[Labor induction]] may be indicated with decreased placental function. A [[caesarean section]] may be performed if there is marked [[fetal distress]] or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as [[shoulder dystocia]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health |date=February 2015 |chapter=Intrapartum care |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0080685/ |title=Diabetes in Pregnancy: Management of diabetes and its complications from preconception to the postnatal period |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) |language=en}}</ref>

===Other types===
[[Maturity onset diabetes of the young]] (MODY) is a rare [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] inherited form of diabetes, due to one of several single-gene mutations causing defects in insulin production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monogenic Forms of Diabetes|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/monogenic-neonatal-mellitus-mody#3|website=National institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases|publisher=US NIH|access-date=12 March 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312195627/https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/monogenic-neonatal-mellitus-mody#3|archive-date=12 March 2017}}</ref> It is significantly less common than the three main types, constituting 1–2% of all cases. The name of this disease refers to early hypotheses as to its nature. Being due to a defective gene, this disease varies in age at presentation and in severity according to the specific gene defect; thus there are at least 13 subtypes of MODY. People with MODY often can control it without using insulin.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanabalasingham G, Owen KR | title = Diagnosis and management of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) | journal = BMJ | volume = 343 | issue = oct19 3 | pages = d6044 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22012810 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.d6044 | s2cid = 44891167 }}</ref>

Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type&nbsp;2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Genetic mutations ([[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal]] or [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]]) can lead to defects in beta cell function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of [[insulin receptor|insulin-antagonistic]] [[hormone]]s can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase [[insulin resistance]] (especially [[glucocorticoid]]s which can provoke "[[steroid diabetes]]"). The [[ICD-10]] (1992) diagnostic entity, ''malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus'' (MRDM or MMDM, ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.<ref name="WHO1999-DefDiagClass">{{cite web |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=Definition, Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and its Complications |year=1999 |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030308005119/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1999/WHO_NCD_NCS_99.2.pdf |archive-date=2003-03-08}}</ref>

[[File:Glucose-insulin-release.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Mechanism of insulin release in normal pancreatic [[beta cell]]s. Insulin production is more or less constant within the beta cells. Its release is triggered by food, chiefly food containing absorbable glucose.]]
[[Insulin]] is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of [[glucose]] from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the [[IGF-1]]. Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] play a central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Insulin Basics |url=http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/insulin/insulin-basics.html |publisher=American Diabetes Association |access-date=24 April 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214180514/http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/insulin/insulin-basics.html |archive-date=14 February 2014}}</ref>

The body obtains glucose from three main sources: the intestinal absorption of food; the breakdown of [[glycogen]] ([[glycogenolysis]]), the storage form of glucose found in the liver; and [[gluconeogenesis]], the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates in the body.<ref name=GreenspanEndo>{{cite book |veditors=Shoback DG, Gardner D |title=Greenspan's basic & clinical endocrinology |year=2011 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |isbn=978-0-07-162243-1|edition=9th}}</ref> Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose levels in the body. Insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis, it can stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen.<ref name=GreenspanEndo />

Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage. Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. This process is mainly controlled by the hormone [[glucagon]], which acts in the opposite manner to insulin.<ref name=GanongsPhys>{{cite book|vauthors=Barrett KE, etal |title=Ganong's review of medical physiology|year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |isbn=978-0-07-178003-2 |edition=24th}}</ref>

If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, or if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin ([[insulin resistance]]), or if the insulin itself is defective, then glucose is not absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and is not stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose, poor [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], and other metabolic derangements, such as metabolic [[acidosis]] in cases of complete insulin deficiency.<ref name=GreenspanEndo />

When glucose concentration in the blood remains high over time, the [[kidneys]] reach a threshold of [[reabsorption]], and the body excretes glucose in the [[urine]] ([[glycosuria]]).<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Murray RK, etal |title=Harper's illustrated biochemistry |year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |isbn=978-0-07-176576-3 |edition=29th}}</ref>  This increases the [[osmotic pressure]] of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production ([[polyuria]]) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume is replaced osmotically from water in body cells and other body compartments, causing [[dehydration]] and increased thirst ([[polydipsia]]).<ref name=GreenspanEndo /> In addition, intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates appetite leading to excessive food intake (polyphagia).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Juta's Complete Textbook of Medical Surgical Nursing|last=Mogotlane|first=Sophie|publisher=Juta|year=2013|location=Cape Town|pages=839}}</ref>

==Management==
{{Main|Diabetes management}}
[[File:ABCs of Diabetes.webm|thumb|Overview of the management of diabetes]]
Diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels as close to normal, without causing low blood sugar. This can usually be accomplished with dietary changes, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications).

Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nathan DM, Cleary PA, Backlund JY, Genuth SM, Lachin JM, Orchard TJ, Raskin P, Zinman B | title = Intensive diabetes treatment and cardiovascular disease in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 353 | issue = 25 | pages = 2643–53 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16371630 | pmc = 2637991 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa052187 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = The effect of intensive diabetes therapy on the development and progression of neuropathy.

===Medications===
====Glucose control====
{{see also|Anti-diabetic medication}}
Most medications used to treat diabetes act by lowering [[glucose|blood sugar levels]] through different mechanisms. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they experience fewer complications, such as [[diabetic nephropathy|kidney problems]] or [[diabetic retinopathy|eye problems]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Rosberger|first= DF | title = Diabetic retinopathy: current concepts and emerging therapy | journal = Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 721–45 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24286948 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecl.2013.08.001 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = MacIsaac|first1= RJ|last2= Jerums |first2=G|last3= Ekinci|first3= EI | title = Glycemic Control as Primary Prevention for Diabetic Kidney Disease | journal = Advances in Chronic Kidney Disease | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 141–148 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29580578 | doi = 10.1053/j.ackd.2017.11.003 }}</ref> There is however debate as to whether this is appropriate and [[cost effective]] for people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant.<ref name=Pozzilli2014>{{cite journal | last1 = Pozzilli |first1=P|last2= Strollo |first2=R|last3= Bonora| first3=E | title = One size does not fit all glycemic targets for type 2 diabetes | journal = Journal of Diabetes Investigation | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–41 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24843750 | pmc = 4023573 | doi = 10.1111/jdi.12206 }}</ref>

There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Type&nbsp;1 diabetes requires treatment with [[insulin]], typically with a combination of regular and [[NPH insulin]], or synthetic [[insulin analogs]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin at later stages. Some medications for type 2 diabetes are taken by mouth, such as [[metformin]], while others are only administered by injection, such as [[GLP-1 agonist]]s.

[[Metformin]] is generally recommended as a first-line treatment for type&nbsp;2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.<ref name=AFP09>{{cite journal | last1 = Ripsin |first1=CM|last2= Kang |first2=H|last3= Urban |first3=RJ | title = Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–36 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19145963 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0101/p29.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505033552/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0101/p29.pdf | url-status=live | archive-date = 2013-05-05 }}</ref> It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose.<ref name=Drugs2005>{{cite journal | last1 = Krentz |first1=AJ|last2= Bailey| first2=CJ | title = Oral antidiabetic agents: current role in type 2 diabetes mellitus | journal = Drugs | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–411 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15669880 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200565030-00005 |s2cid=29670619}}</ref> Several other groups of drugs, mostly given by mouth, may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes.

In countries using a [[general practitioner]] system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects.

The term "diabetes" or "to pass through" was first used in 230&nbsp;BCE by the Greek [[Apollonius (physician)|Apollonius of Memphis]].<ref name=History2010/> The disease was considered rare during the time of the [[Roman empire]], with [[Galen]] commenting he had only seen two cases during his career.<ref name=History2010/> This is possibly due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease.

The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]] (2nd or early 3rd{{nbsp}}century CE). He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of  the "[[Pneumatic school|Pneumatic School]]". He hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst.

===Naming===
The term "type&nbsp;1 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Likewise, the term "type&nbsp;2 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard nomenclature.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Diabetes mellitus is also occasionally known as "sugar diabetes" to differentiate it from [[diabetes insipidus]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Katrina|title=Living with diabetes|date=2008|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-2108-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/livingwithdiabet0000park/page/143 143]|url=https://archive.org/details/livingwithdiabet0000park|url-access=registration}}</ref>

==Other animals==
{{main|Diabetes in dogs|Diabetes in cats}}

In animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as [[Poodle|Miniature Poodles]].<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title=Diabetes mellitus | website=Merck Veterinary Manual, 9th edition (online version) | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/40302.htm | year=2005 | access-date=2011-10-23 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154816/http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm%2Fbc%2F40302.htm | archive-date=2011-09-27 }}</ref>

Feline diabetes is strikingly similar to human type 2 diabetes. The [[Burmese cat|Burmese]], [[Russian Blue]], [[Abyssinian cat|Abyssinian]], and [[Norwegian Forest cat|Norwegian Forest]] cat breeds are at higher risk than other breeds. Overweight cats are also at higher risk.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Öhlund|first1=Malin|title=Feline diabetes mellitus Aspects on epidemiology and pathogenesis|publisher=Acta Universitatis agriculturae Sueciae|isbn=978-91-7760-067-1|url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/14746/1/ohlund_m_171123.pdf}}</ref>

The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.<ref name=Merck/>

===Major clinical trials===
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was a clinical study conducted by the United States [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]] (NIDDK) that was published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' in 1993. Test subjects all had type 1 diabetes and were randomized to a tight glycemic arm and a control arm with the standard of care at the time; people were followed for an average of seven years, and people in the treatment had dramatically lower rates of diabetic complications.  It was as a landmark study at the time, and significantly changed the management of all forms of diabetes.<ref name=Pozzilli2014/><ref>{{cite journal |title=American Diabetes Association Statement: Implications of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial |journal=Diabetes Care |date=1 January 2003 |volume=26 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=S25–S27 |doi=10.2337/diacare.26.2007.S25|pmid=12502616 |author1=American Diabetes Association |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a clinical study conducted by Z that was published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1998. Around 3,800 people with type 2 diabetes were followed for an average of ten years, and were treated with tight glucose control or the standard of care, and again the treatment arm had far better outcomes.  This confirmed the importance of tight glucose control, as well as blood pressure control, for people with this condition.<ref name=Pozzilli2014/><ref>{{cite web |title=Position statement: UKPDS – Implications for the care of people with Type 2 diabetes |url=http://www.diabetes.org.uk/en/About_us/Our_Views/Position_statements/UKPDS__Implications_for_the_care_of_people_with_Type_2_diabetes_/ |publisher=Diabetes UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302213505/http://www.diabetes.org.uk/en/About_us/Our_Views/Position_statements/UKPDS__Implications_for_the_care_of_people_with_Type_2_diabetes_/ |archive-date=2 March 2009 |date=January 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(98)07019-6 |pmid=9742976 |title=Intensive blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin compared with conventional treatment and risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 33) |journal=The Lancet |volume=352 |issue=9131 |pages=837–53 |year=1998 |s2cid=7019505 }}</ref>
