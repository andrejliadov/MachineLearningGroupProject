He has been a campaigner for better audiological service in the UK and promotes ''[[Best practice|best practices]]'' to professional peers. 

A career change saw him based at London's Nomis Studios (1984–86) while the [[Live Aid]] production was underway, working in artist liaison and providing audiological advice on hearing protection to major musical artists.
