'''Health effects''' (or '''health impacts''') are changes in [[health]] resulting from exposure to a source. Health effects are an important consideration in many areas, such as [[hygiene]], [[pollution]] studies, [[occupational safety and health]], [[nutrition]] and [[health sciences]] in general.  Some of the major environmental sources of health effects are [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[noise pollution]] and [[over-illumination]]. 

A non-[[stochastic]] or deterministic health effect has a severity that is dependent on dose and is believed to have a threshold level for which no effect is seen. Stochastic health effects occur by chance, generally occurring without a threshold level of dose, whose [[probability]] is proportional to the dose and whose severity is independent of the dose, such as [[cancer]] and genetic effects. Occasionally, lack of exposure to certain effectors has detrimental consequences on an individual's health. Examples of such effectors include sunlight and exercise.
