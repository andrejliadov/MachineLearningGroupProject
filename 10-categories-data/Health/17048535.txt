They noted that raw food eaten by the patient may have been contaminated by rats. In 1955, Mackerass and Sanders identified the lifecycle of the worm in rats, defining snails and slugs as the intermediate hosts, and noting the path of transmission through the blood, brain, and lungs in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
Following World War II, ''A. cantonensis'' spread throughout Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Islands, including [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Cases were soon reported in [[New Caledonia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Rarotonga]], [[Saipan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the 1960s, even more cases were reported from the region from locations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Java]], [[Thailand]], [[Sarawak]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Vanuatu]].<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|title=EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS|date=2018-03-09|website=louisiana.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-15}}</ref>

In 1961, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study of eosinophilic meningitis in humans was conducted by Rosen, Laigret, and Bories, who hypothesized that the parasite causing these infections was carried by fish. However, Alicata noted that raw fish was consumed by large numbers of people in Hawaii without apparent consequences, and patients presenting with meningitis symptoms had a history of eating raw snails or [[prawn]]s in the weeks before presenting with symptoms. This observation, along with epidemiology and [[autopsy]] of infected brains, confirmed ''A. cantonensis'' infection in humans as the cause of the majority of eosinophilic meningitis cases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=J.E.|title=The discovery of Angiostrongylus cantonensis as a cause of human eosinophilic meningitis|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=7|issue=6|pages=151–153|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(91)90285-v|pmid=15463478|year=1991}}</ref>

Since then, cases of ''A. cantonensis'' infestations have appeared in [[American Samoa]], Australia, [[Hong Kong]], [[Bombay]], [[Fiji]], Hawaii, [[Honshu]], [[India]], [[Kyushu]], [[New Britain]], [[Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]], [[Western Samoa]], and most recently mainland [[China]]. Other sporadic occurrences of the parasite in its rat hosts have been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Louisiana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name=":4" />

In 2013, ''A. cantonensis'' was confirmed present in [[Florida]], USA, where its range and prevalence are expanding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwanowicz DD, Sanders LR, Schill WB, Xayavong MV, da Silva AJ, Qvarnstrom Y, Smith T | title = Spread of the Rat Lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) in Giant African Land Snails (Lissachatina fulica) in Florida, USA | journal = Journal of Wildlife Diseases | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 749–53 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25973628 | doi = 10.7589/2014-06-160 }}</ref> In 2018, a case was found in a [[New York City|New Yorker]] who had visited Hawaii.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|title=New York teen contracts rat lungworm during Hawaii vacation|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413052417/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|archive-date=2018-04-13|url-status=live|language=en}}</ref>

In recent years, the parasite has been shown to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food-consumption trends and global transportation of food products. Scientists are calling for a more thorough study of the epidemiology of ''A. cantonensis'', stricter food-safety policies, and the increase of knowledge on how to properly consume products commonly infested by the parasite, such as snails and slugs that act as intermediate hosts or those that act as [[Host (biology)#Paratenic hosts|paratenic hosts]], such as fish, frogs, or [[Fresh water|freshwater]] prawns.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lv S, Zhang Y, Steinmann P, Zhou XN | title = Emerging angiostrongyliasis in Mainland China | language = en-us | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18258099 | pmc = 2600175 | doi = 10.3201/eid1401.061529 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=Joseph E.|date=1967|title=Effect of Freezing and Boiling on the Infectivity of Third-Stage Larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Present in Land Snails and Freshwater Prawns|jstor=3276839|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1064–1066|doi=10.2307/3276839}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ash|first=Lawrence R.|date=1968|title=The Occurrence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in Frogs of New Caledonia with Observations on Paratenic Hosts of Metastrongyles|jstor=3277060|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=54|issue=3|pages=432–436|doi=10.2307/3277060}}</ref> Ingestion of food items that can be contaminated by the mucus excretions of intermediate or paratenic hosts, such as snails and slugs, or by the feces of rats that act as definitive hosts, can lead to infection of ''A. cantonensis''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards CS, Merritt JW | title = Studies on Angiostrongylus cantonensis in molluscan intermediate hosts | journal = The Journal of Parasitology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 6022396 | doi = 10.2307/3276595 | jstor = 3276595 }}</ref> The most common route of infection of  ''A. cantonesis'' in humans is by ingestion of either intermediate or paratenic hosts of the [[larva]]e.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell BG, Little MD | title = The finding of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in rats in New Orleans | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–73 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3275136 |doi= 10.4269/ajtmh.1988.38.568 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.890.7349 }}</ref> Unwashed fruits and vegetables, especially [[romaine lettuce]], can be contaminated with snail and slug mucus or can result in accidental ingestion of these intermediate and paratenic hosts.

==Pathogenesis of human angiostrongylosis==
The presence of parasitic worms burrowed in the neural tissue of the human [[central nervous system]] (CNS) causes complications. All of the following result in damage to the CNS:{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Eosinophilic meningitis==
{{See also|Eosinophilic meningitis}}
Although the clinical disease caused by ''Angiostrongylus'' invasion into the CNS is commonly referred to as "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the [[meninges]], or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck, and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing [[Neurological disorder|neurological]] symptoms depending on where in the brain [[parenchyma]] they migrate. Neurologic findings and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms. This inflammation can lead in the short term to paralysis, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbance, and coma and in the long term to permanent nerve damage, mental retardation, nerve damage, permanent brain damage, or death.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang QP, Lai DH, Zhu XQ, Chen XG, Lun ZR |url= http://manoa.hawaii.edu/ctahr/farmfoodsafety/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Wang_2008_The-Lancet-Infectious-Diseases.pdf | title = Human angiostrongyliasis | journal = The Lancet.

Eosinophilic meningitis is commonly defined by the increased number of [[eosinophil]]s in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In most cases, eosinophil levels rise to 10 or more eosinophils per μl in the CSF, accounting for at least 10% of the total CSF [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] (white blood cell) count.<ref name="urlwww.dhh.louisiana.gov">[https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf "EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS"]. Revised 28 February 2006, accessed 1 June 2011.</ref> The chemical analysis of the CSF typically resembles the findings in "[[aseptic meningitis]]" with slightly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. Presence of a significantly decreased glucose on CSF analysis is an indicator of severe [[meningoencephalitis]] and may indicate a poor [[Prognosis|medical outcome]]. Initial CSF analysis early in the disease process may occasionally show no increase of eosinophils, only to have classical increases in eosinophils in subsequent CSF analysis. Caution should be advised in using eosinophilic meningitis as the only criterion for diagnosing angiostrongylus infestation in someone with classic symptoms, as the disease evolves with the migration of the worms into the CNS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells of the [[Granulocyte|granulocytic]] cell line, which contain granules in their [[cytoplasm]]. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules degranulate, or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by [[chemokine]]s when the body is infested with parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Once at the site of inflammation, type 2 cytokines are released from [[T helper cell|helper T cells]], which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of [[degranulation]], releasing their toxic [[protein]]s in the fight against the foreign parasite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Clinical signs and symptoms===
According to a group [[case study]], the most common symptoms in mild eosinophilic meningitis tend to be headache (with 100% of people in the study suffering from this symptom), [[photophobia]] or visual disturbance (92%), neck stiffness (83%), fatigue (83%), [[hyperesthesia]]s (75%), vomiting (67%), and [[paresthesia]]s (50%).<ref name="Murphy 35–40" /><ref name=":5" /> [[Incubation period]] is often 3 weeks, but can be 3–36 days<ref name=":4" /> and even 80 days.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng YT, Tsai HC, Sy CL, Lee SS, Wann SR, Wang YH, Chen JK, Wu KS, Chen YS | title = Clinical manifestations of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: 18 years' experience in a medical center in southern Taiwan | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21524976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.034 | doi-access = free }} {{open access}}</ref>

===Diagnosis===
The diagnosis of disease caused by ''A. cantonensis'' infestation is often difficult and relies heavily on the history of a likely ingestion of a commonly infested host and the presence of typical features of the disease. The presumptive diagnosis is particularly strong when eosinophilic meningoencephalitis can be confirmed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis can be arrived at through detection of elevated cranial pressure and increased numbers of eosinophils. The diagnosis of the cause of eosinophilic meningitis and the presence of ''A. cantonensis'' is remarkably more difficult. A [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]], or a sample of CSF, must be taken to search for ''A. cantonensis'' worms or larvae. ''A. cantonensis'' is undetectable in the CSF of more than half of the infected individuals. Current methods of detecting specific antigens associated with ''A. cantonensis'' are also unreliable. Consequently, alternative approaches to detect antigen-[[antibody]] reactions are being explored, such as [[Agglutination-PCR|immuno-PCR]].<ref name="urlImmuno-PCR for Detection of Antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis Circulating Fifth-Stage Worms -- Chye et al. 50 (1): 51 -- Clinical Chemistry">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chye SM, Lin SR, Chen YL, Chung LY, Yen CM | title = Immuno-PCR for detection of antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis circulating fifth-stage worms | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14709636 | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.020867 | doi-access = free }} {{free access}}</ref> A rapid dot-blot [[ELISA|ELISA test]] is also available for quick, effective, and economical on-site diagnosis of  ''A. cantonensis''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eamsobhana P, Yong HS | title = Immunological diagnosis of human angiostrongyliasis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda: Angiostrongylidae) | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19117782 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.09.021 | doi-access = free }} {{open access}}</ref>
