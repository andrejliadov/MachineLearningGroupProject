The '''Doctor Television Channel''', known as '''Doctor TV''' (stylized as '''DrTV'''), was a healthy lifestyle digital [[television network]] in the [[United States]]. Doctor TV was primarily affiliated with the [[Digital subchannel|digital sub-channels]] (main channel or second) of television stations owned and/or operated by Edge Spectrum Inc, as well as a handful of other station groups, with additional stations adding the channel in the near future.  The network's programming format is somewhat similar to that of the [[Live Well Network]]. The DrTV headquarters were most recently located at 1511 S Chestnut St in [[Lufkin, Texas|Lufkin]], [[Texas]].<ref name=ei-drtv2015>[https://thewalktv.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/drtv-childrens-programming-report-q1-2015.doc DrTV Children’s Programming Report - First Quarter of 2015] ([[Microsoft Excel file format|XLS]] document)</ref>

==History==
In December 2013, DTV America Corporation announced the network's launch. The official launch took place on January 6, 2014. DTV America signed an agreement to launch Doctor TV [[Network affiliate|affiliated]] [[Low-power television|low-power]] [[television station]]s in 68 [[Media market|markets]] between December 2013 and July 2016, including 18 within the top 100 markets, with more coming soon after.<ref>Press Release (December 20, 2013). [http://dtvamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DTVAM-Press-Release-DrTV-131220.pdf “DTV America to launch 68 DrTV Affiliates”]. [[DTV America]] Corporation. Retrieved January 17, 2015.</ref> Currently, DTV America is the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates.<ref>[http://dtvamerica.com/drtv-channel/ DrTV Channel << DTV America]</ref> Doctor TV signed affiliation deals with stations  in 25 other markets. The network was to be dedicated to health care, in which what the channel's specialty programming will be offering. DTV America is currently the largest group of Doctor TV affiliates.<ref>[http://drtvchannel.com/drtvlaunch/ DrTV Launch - DRTV ChannelDRTV Channel]</ref>

In early 2014, the network's first affiliates signed on the air, including stations in [[Amarillo, Texas]]; [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]; [[Jackson, Tennessee]]; [[Lubbock, Texas]]; [[Fort Myers, Florida]]; and [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]]. Eventually, [[KGPT-CD]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]] became the first non-DTV America-operated station to sign one of its subchannels with Doctor TV in Fall 2014. Currently, the [[Sacramento, California]] media market is the largest by size{{Clarify|size as in area or viewers|date=June 2018}} to have a DrTV affiliate.<ref>[http://rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&callsign=kjnk-ld Digital TV Market Listing for KJNK-LD]</ref><ref name=DrTV-aff>[http://rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=DrTV DrTV query @ RabbitEars.info]</ref>

In the first quarter of 2015, [[WCKV-LD]] in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], along with [[KPVM-LP]] in [[Pahrump, Nevada]], became the newest stations to sign on DrTV-affiliated subchannels.

In January 2018, network was sold to Captender LLC with master control moved to Lufkin Texas. The network's social media ceased being updated shortly after the sale.

By the end of 2019, all of the network's stations had disaffiliated from the network<ref>[https://www.rabbitears.info/search.php?request=network_search&network=DrTV DrTV affiliates] via rabbitears.info; as of the January 31, 2020 listing, only one affiliate is shown, a station that is silent</ref> and its online feed had ceased operating.<ref>[http://drtvchannel.com/live DRTVchannel.com/live] as of January 31, 2020 returns an error message when attempting to stream</ref>

==Programming==
Doctor TV offered many healthy-lifestyle programs on their schedule. It is mainly a blend of programming with healthcare information from medical professionals. In addition, the channel offered healthy cooking shows, as well as three fitness program series.  They also broadcast “health minutes,” which are one-minute-long spots that give the viewer health advice in a varied topic. Four and a half hours of children's educational programming was provided on Saturday and Sunday mornings, making a total of 9 hours of [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]-mandated [[E/I|children's educational programming]], triple the 3 hour minimum.<ref name=DrTV-Apr15>[http://drtvchannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DRTV-Schedule-April-2015.pdf DrTV Program Schedule for April 2015]</ref>

Doctor TV also offered classic public domain movies from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern time zone|ET]] (7 to 9 p.m. CT) on Saturday and Sunday nights, and from 12 Midnight to 2:00&nbsp;a.m. ET (11 p.m. to 1 a.m. [[Central Time Zone|CT]]). Overnight hours from 2 to 4:30 ET (1:00 to 3:30&nbsp;a.m. CT), Doctor TV provided programming from [[The Worship Network]] under the title “Music for Meditation.”<ref name=DrTV-Apr15/>
