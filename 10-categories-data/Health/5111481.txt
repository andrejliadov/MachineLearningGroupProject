'''Food biodiversity''' is defined as "the diversity of plants, animals and other organisms used for food, covering the genetic resources within species, between species and provided by ecosystems."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guidelines on Assessing Biodiverse Foods in Dietary Intake Surveys|last=FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and Bioversity International|publisher=FAO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-5-109598-0|location=Rome, Italy|pages=2}}</ref>   

Food biodiversity can be considered from two main perspectives: production and consumption. From a consumption perspective, food biodiversity describes the diversity of foods in human diets and their contribution to [[dietary diversity]], cultural identity and good [[nutrition]]. Production of food biodiversity looks at the thousands of food products, such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, meat and condiments sourced from agriculture and from the wild (e.g. forests, uncultivated fields, water bodies). Food biodiversity covers the diversity ''between species,'' for example different animal and crop species, including those considered [[Neglected and underutilized crop|neglected and underutilized species]]. Food biodiversity also comprises the diversity ''within species,'' for example different varieties of fruit and vegetables, or different breeds of animals.

Food diversity, diet diversity nutritional diversity, are also terms used in the new diet culture spawned by Brandon Eisler, in the study known as Nutritional Diversity. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nutritionaldiversity.com/|title=Introduction to Nutritional Diversity {{!}} Cutting Edge Fitness & Health Diet|website=Nutritional Diversity|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-20}}</ref>

== Consumption of food biodiversity ==

=== Trends in food biodiversity consumption ===
Since 1961, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.<ref name="Khoury">{{cite journal|author=Khoury, C.K.|author2=Bjorkman, A.D.|author3=Dempewolf, H.|author4=Ramirez-Villegas, J.|author5=Guarino, L.|author6=Jarvis, A.|author7=Rieseberg, L.H.|author8=Struik, P.C.|date=2014|title=Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4001–4006|doi=10.1073/pnas.1313490111|pmc=3964121|pmid=24591623}}</ref> The differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern "global standard"<ref name="Khoury" /> diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[maize]], [[soybean]] (by +284%<ref name="Kinver">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26382067|title=Crop diversity decline 'threatens food security'|last1=Kinver|first1=Mark|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref>), [[palm oil]] (by +173%<ref name="Kinver" />), and [[sunflower]] (by +246%<ref name="Kinver" />).

=== Food biodiversity and nutrition ===
Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for public health as well as [[sustainable food systems]] perspective.

Food biodiversity provides necessary nutrients for quality diets and is  essential part of local food systems, cultures and [[food security]]. Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for sustainable food systems. Nutritionally, diversity in food is associated with higher micronutrient adequacy of diets.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lachat|first=Carl|last2=Raneri|first2=Jessica E.|last3=Walker Smith|first3=Katherine|last4=Kolsteren|first4=Patrick|last5=Van Damme|first5=Patrick|last6=Verzelen|first6=Kaat|last7=Penafiel|first7=Daniela|last8=Vanhove|first8=Wouter|last9=Kennedy|first9=Gina|last10=Hunter|first10=Danny|last11=Oduor Odhiambo|first11=Francis|last12=Ntandou-Bouzitou|first12=Gervais|last13=De Baets|first13=Bernard|last14=Ratnasekera|first14=Disna|last15=The Ky|first15=Hoang|last16=Remans|first16=Roseline|last17=Termote|first17=Celine|year=2017|title=Dietary species richness as a measure of food biodiversity and nutritional quality of diets|journal=PNAS|volume=115|issue=1|pages=127–132|doi=10.1073/pnas.1709194115|pmid=29255049|pmc=5776793}}</ref> On average, per additional species consumed, mean adequacy of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[folate]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] increased by 3%. From a conservation point of view, diets based on a wide variety of species place less pressure on single species.

==Production of food biodiversity==

=== Role of biodiversity in production systems ===
Conservation and management of broad-based [[genetic diversity]] within the domesticated species have been improving agricultural production for 10,000 years. However, diverse natural populations have been providing food and other products for much longer. High biodiversity can maximize production levels, which are sustained through beneficial impact of [[ecosystem services]] for agricultural, modified and natural ecosystems. Conversely, reliance on a narrow portfolio of crops or crop varieties can jeopardize food production systems. This is illustrated by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of Ireland]]. Potatoes were introduced into Ireland from the New World in about 1600 and they became the major food source of most Irish people. The wind-borne Potato blight fungus spread throughout the country In 1845-1847 and caused almost complete failure of the potato crop. It is estimated that 1 million people died of starvation, cholera and typhoid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm#Food_Supplies |title=Values Of Biodiversity<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=May 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120117203030/http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm#Food_Supplies |archive-date=January 17, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Ecosystem services ===
A wide range of biologically diverse populations in natural ecosystems and in / near agricultural ecosystems maintain essential ecological functions that are critical for the production of food. Such populations contribute positively to, for example, [[nutrient cycling]], [[decomposition]] of organic matter, crusted or degraded [[soil rehabilitation]], pest and disease regulation, [[water quality]] maintenance, and [[pollination]]. Maintaining species diversity, while building on and enhancing ecosystem functions, reduces external input requirements by increasing [[nutrient availability]], improving water use and [[soil structure]], and controlling pests.

=== Traits ===
Genetic diversity within food species is a source of useful genes with a variety of benefits. For example:

* Wild subspecies of tomatoes (''[[Solanum lycopersicum]] chmielewskii'') were [[crossbred]] with cultivated tomato species. After 10 generations, new tomato strains with larger fruits were produced. There was a marked increase in pigmentation. The content of soluble solid, mainly [[fructose]], [[glucose]] and other sugars increased.<ref name="Ittis">[[Hugh Iltis|H.H.Iltis]] (1988).

==Geographic patterns of biodiversity and food==

In 2016, researchers linked the centers and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume. Foreign crops (crops entirely from regions of diversity outside the location of the country) were extensively used in food supplies (68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean were derived from foreign crops) and production systems (69.3% of crops grown were foreign). Foreign crop usage was shown to have increased significantly over the past 50 years, including in countries with high indigenous crop diversity.<ref name=Khouryorigins>{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.
