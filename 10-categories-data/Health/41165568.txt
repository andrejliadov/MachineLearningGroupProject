The '''Bradburn Affect Balance Scale''' is a [[self-report]] measure of [[quality of life]]. The scale consists of ten mood states (for example, item one is "particularly excited  or  interested  in something"), and the subject must report if they have been in that state in the last week.<ref>Van Schuur, Wijbrandt H., and Martine Kruijtbosch. "Measuring subjective well-being: Unfolding the Bradburn affect balance scale." Social Indicators Research 36.1 (1995): 49-74.</ref>

The scale was included in the 1978-1979 [[Canada Health Survey]].<ref>McDOWELL, I. A. N., and E. D. Praught. "ON THE MEASUREMENT OF HAPPINESS AN EXAMINATION OF THE BRADBURN SCALE IN THE CANADA HEALTH SURVEY." American journal of epidemiology 116.6 (1982): 949-958.</ref>
