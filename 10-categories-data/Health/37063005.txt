==Impact of excess heat on the human body==

The human body requires evaporative cooling to prevent overheating, even with a low activity level.  With excessive ambient heat and humidity, adequate evaporative cooling does not take place. Human thermoregulatory capacity is exceeded.  A sustained [[wet-bulb temperature]] or  [[Wet-bulb globe temperature]] exceeding about {{convert|35|C}} can be fatal.<ref name=pnas>{{cite journal |first1=S.C. |last1=Sherwood |first2=M. |last2=Huber |title=An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress |journal=Proc.

In 2016 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published a report called: "UNEP FRONTIERS 2016 REPORT". In this report, the second chapter was dedicated to [[Zoonosis|Zoonotic diseases]], e.g., diseases that pass from animals to humans. In this chapter was written that [[deforestation]], [[climate change]], and [[livestock]] agriculture are among the main causes that increase the risk of such diseases. It was mentioned that every 4 months a new disease is discovered in humans. It was said that outbreaks that already happened (as of 2016) led to loss of lives and financial losses of billions dollars and if future diseases will turn into pandemics it will cost trillions of dollars.<ref>{{cite book |title=UNEP Frontiers 2016 Report: Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern |date=2016 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |location=Nairoby |isbn=978-92-807-3553-6 |pages=18–32 |url=https://environmentlive.unep.org/media/docs/assessments/UNEP_Frontiers_2016_report_emerging_issues_of_environmental_concern.pdf |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

==== Impact of warmer and wetter climates ====

Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include [[malaria]], [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[dengue fever]].<ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease">{{cite journal|last=Reiter |first=Paul |title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |year=2001 |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=141–161 |url=http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s1141 |pmid=11250812 |pmc=1240549 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824222504/http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |archive-date=24 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=elephantiasis>{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P.R. |title=Climate change and waterborne and vector-borne disease |journal=[[Journal of Applied Microbiology]] |year=2003 |volume=94 |pages=37S–46S |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.94.s1.5.x|pmid=12675935 |s2cid=9338260 }}</ref><ref name="Climate change & health" /> Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.<ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease" /><ref name=elephantiasis />   Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" />

[[Ticks]] are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.<ref name=Ticks>{{cite journal |last1=Süss |first1=J. |last2=Klaus |first2=C. |last3=Gerstengarbe |first3=F.W. |last4=Werner |first4=P.C. |title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. In addition to dehydration and heat stroke, these heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD). Recent{{when|date=March 2020}} studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: the Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy|last=Glaser|display-authors=etal| pmid=27151892 | doi=10.2215/CJN.13841215|volume=11|issue=8 |pmc=4974898|year=2016|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|pages=1472–83}}</ref> These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.

Warmer temperatures may also lead an increase in aggression levels. Research has shows links between higher temperatures and increased aggressive and criminal behaviour.

==== Impact of warmer oceans ====

The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as [[red tides]]) and [[cholera]].<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /><ref name="Climate change & health" /><ref name=Mozambique /> As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within [[zooplankton]] emerge from their dormant state.<ref name=Mozambique />  The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing [[cholera outbreaks]].<ref name=Mozambique>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/6 6–28] |chapter=Mozambique |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/6 }}</ref> As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.<ref name="Global Health">{{cite journal |last1=St. Louis |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hess |first2=Jeremy J. |title=Climate Change Impacts on and Implications for Global Health |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.023|pmid=18929979 }}</ref>   El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.<ref name=Mozambique /><ref name="Global Health" />
==== Impact of warmer freshwater ====
Warmer freshwater is increasing the presence of the amoeba ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'', in freshwater and the parasite ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' in pools, and both can cause a severe disease. Therefore, climate change will probably raise the number of those pathogens.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Alex |title=Climate change will raise Florida's risks of brain-eating amoeba and flesh-eating bacteria |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-08-climate-florida-brain-eating-amoeba-flesh-eating.html |access-date=13 July 2020 |agency=Medical Press |date=5 August 2019}}</ref> According to a letter of health officials, warning from the ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'': "Infections usually occur when temperatures increase for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels,".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Jordan |title=Deadly Brain-Eating Amoeba Confirmed in Florida |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/brain-eating-amoeba-florida-2646348423.html |access-date=13 July 2020 |agency=Ecowatch |date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

====Malaria====

[[Malaria]] is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the [[Plasmodium]] family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host's circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.<ref name=Lancet>{{Cite journal |first1=Brian M. |last1=Greenwood |first2=Kalifa |last2=Bojang |first3=Christopher J.M. |last3=Whitty |first4=Geoffrey A.T. |last4=Targett |title=Malaria |journal=The Lancet |date=23 April 2005 |volume=365 |pages=1487–1498 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66420-3 |pmid=15850634 |issue=9469|s2cid=208987634 }}</ref> The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

'About 3.2 billion people – nearly half of the world's population – are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were roughly 214 million malaria cases and an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths.' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/|title=10 facts on malaria|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>

Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.<ref name=infectious/> Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine [[pathogenicity]]. These include the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.<ref name=infectious>{{Cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Mia |first2=Rawshan A. |last2=Begum |first3=Ah-Choy |last3=Er |first4=Raja D.Z.R. Zainal |last4=Abidin |first5=Joy J. |last5=Pereira |title=Malaria and Climate Change: Discussion on Economic Impacts |journal=[[American Journal of Environmental Sciences]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.3844/ajessp.2011.73.82}}</ref> Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.

Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes ranges from 16 to 18 degrees Celsius.<ref name= commonwealth>{{cite report |last=Githeko |first=Andrew K. |title=Malaria and climate change |work=Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Update 2009/2010 |url=http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf |access-date=14 February 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61zHql3Vg?url=http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> If the temperature is decreased by 2 degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.<ref name=infectious2>{{Cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pates |first2=Christopher |last2=Curtis |title=Mosquito Behaviour and Vector Control |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |year=2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130439 |pmid=15355233}}</ref> These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.

Climate change has a direct impact on people's health in places where malaria was originally not prevalent. Mosquitoes are sensitive to temperature changes and the warming of their environment will boost their rates of production.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|pmid=16207843|pmc=2636266}}</ref> A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> In communities living in the higher altitudes in [[Africa]] and [[South America]], people are at now at a higher risk for developing malaria because of increase in the average temperature of the surroundings. This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease, causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.

The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.<ref name=Goklany>{{Cite journal |first1=Indur M. |last1=Goklany |first2=Sir David A. |last2=King |title=Climate Change and Malaria |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2004 |volume=306 |issue=5693 |pages=55–57 |doi=10.1126/science.306.5693.55|pmid=15459370 |s2cid=29125732 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231205 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.

If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread [[epidemic]] of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the number of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before.

[[Dengue fever]] is an infectious disease caused by [[dengue virus]]es known to be in the tropical regions.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue">{{cite web |title=Dengue and Severe Dengue, Fact Sheet |work=Media Centre |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2012}}</ref>   It is transmitted by the mosquito [[Aedes]], or A. aegypti.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simmon |first1=Cameron |last2=Farrar |first2=Jeremy J. |last3=Chau |first3=Nguyen van Vinh |last4=Wills |first4=Bridget |title=Dengue |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=12 April 2012 |volume=366 |issue=15 |pages=1423–1432 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1110265 |pmid=22494122|url=http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/191104/1/Current%20Concepts%20-%20Dengue.pdf |hdl=11343/191104 }}</ref>

The cases of dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue" /> The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gubler |first=DJ |title=Human and Medical Virology: Dengue Viruses |editor-last1=Mahy |editor-first1=Brian W.J. |editor-last2=van Regenmortel |editor-first2=Marc H.V. |encyclopedia=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&pg=PA372 |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378559-6 |pages=372–382}}</ref> The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of [[dengue hemorrhagic fever]]. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue" /> Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.<ref name=denguefever>{{cite web |title=Dengue Fever |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002350/ |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=24 November 2012}}</ref> There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the work of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.<ref name=denguefever/>

Dengue fever used to be considered a [[tropical disease]], but [[climate change]] is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of [[mosquitoes]], which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/69 69]–71}}</ref> The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing [[El Nino]] effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hopp |first1=Marianne J. |last2=Foley |first2=Jonathan A. |title=Global-Scale Relationships Between Climate and the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes Aegypti |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=February 2001 |volume=48 |issue=2/3 |pages=441–463 |doi=10.1023/a:1010717502442|s2cid=150524898 }}</ref>

There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent.

"Some 1.8 billion (more than 70%) of the population at risk for dengue worldwide live in member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region and Western Pacific Region, which bear nearly 75% of the current global disease burden due to dengue. The Asia Pacific Dengue Strategic Plan for both regions (2008--2015) has been prepared in consultation with member countries and development partners in response to the increasing threat from dengue, which is spreading to new geographical areas and causing high mortality during the early phase of outbreaks. The strategic plan aims to aid countries to reverse the rising trend of dengue by enhancing their preparedness to detect, characterize and contain outbreaks rapidly and to stop the spread to new areas." <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/tdr/publications/documents/dengue-diagnosis.pdf |title=Dengue: Guidelines for Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention and Control |date=2009 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>

==== Leishmaniasis ====
[[Leishmaniasis]] is a [[Neglected tropical diseases|neglected tropical disease]], caused by parasites of the genus ''[[Leishmania]]'' and transmitted by [[Sandfly|sandflies]]; it is distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, wherever the sand fly vector and reservoir hosts are present.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Report on Global Surveillance of Epidemic-prone Infectious Diseases - Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/CSR_ISR_2000_1leish/en/|access-date=25 November 2020|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> The disease can manifest in several ways depending on the infecting species of parasite: in [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]], ulcers develop on the skin often leaving [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] scars, while in [[visceral leishmaniasis]] parasites invade internal organs and can be fatal if untreated.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=March 2020|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis|access-date=25 November 2020|website=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Burza|first1=S|last2=Croft|first2=S|last3=Boelaert|first3=M|date=September 2018|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31204-2/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|volume=392|issue=10151|pages=951–970|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31204-2|pmid=30126638|s2cid=208790410|via=Elsevier}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates 12 million people around the world are living with leishmaniasis,<ref name=":2" /> and the [[Risk factor|risk factors]] for this disease include poverty,<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Alvar|first1=J|last2=Yactayo|first2=S|last3=Bern|first3=C|date=2006|title=Leishmaniasis and poverty|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922(06)00239-X|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=22|issue=12|pages=552–557|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2006.09.004|pmid=17023215|via=Cell Press}}</ref> urbanization,<ref name=":3" /> deforestation,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Almeida Rodrigues|first1=Maria Gabriela|last2=de Brito Sousa|first2=Jose Diego|last3= Barros Dias|first3=Adila Lilianes|last4=Monteiro|first4=Wuelton Marcelo|last5=de Souza Sampaio|first5=Vanderson|date=2019|title=The role of deforestation on American cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence: spatial-temporal distribution, environmental and socioeconomic factors associated in the Brazilian Amazon|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tmi.13196|journal=Tropical Medicine and International Health|volume=24|issue=3|pages=348–355|doi=10.1111/tmi.13196|pmid=30578585|s2cid=58488789}}</ref> and climate change.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=González|first1=Camila|last2=Wang|first2=Ophelia|last3=Strutz|first3=Stavana E.|last4=González-Salazar|first4=Constantino|last5= Sánchez-Cordero|first5=Víctor|last6=Sarkar|first6=Sahotra Sarkar|date=January 2010|title=Climate Change and Risk of Leishmaniasis in North America: Predictions from Ecological Niche Models of Vector and Reservoir Species|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=4|issue=1|page=e585|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000585|pmid=20098495|pmc=2799657}}</ref>

As in other [[Vector-borne disease|vector-borne diseases]], one of the reasons climate change can affect the incidence of leishmaniasis is the susceptibility of the sandfly vectors to changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity; these conditions will alter their range of distribution and seasonality.<ref name=":3" /> For example, modelling studies have predicted that climate change will increase suitable conditions for ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' vector species in Central Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=D|date=2011|title=Combining climatic projections and dispersal ability: a method for estimating the responses of sandfly vector species to climate change|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22140590/|journal=PLOS Negl Trop Dis|volume=5|issue=11|pages=e1407|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001407|pmid=22140590|pmc=3226457|via=Public Library of Science}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=L.K|last2=Kochmann|first2=J.|last3=Klimpel|first3=S.|last4=Cunze|first4=S.|date=2017|title=Modeling the climatic suitability of leishmaniasis vector species in Europe|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13822-1|journal=Nature Scientific Reports|volume=7|issue=1|page=13325|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-13822-1|pmid=29042642|pmc=5645347|bibcode=2017NatSR...713325K|via=Springer Nature}}</ref> Another model that looked at the distribution of ''[[Lutzomyia longipalpis]]'', an important visceral leishmaniasis vector, suggested an increased range of this species in the Amazon Basin.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=Influences of climate change on the potential distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis sensu lato (Psychodidae: Phlebotominae)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002075191730200X|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|volume=47|pages=667–674|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.04.007|via=Elsevier|last1=Peterson|first1=A.

Parasite development inside the sandfly can also be affected by temperature changes. For instance, ''Leishmania peruviana'' infections were lost during sandfly defecation when the infected vector was kept at higher temperatures, whereas in the same experiment ''[[Leishmania infantum]]'' and ''[[Leishmania braziliensis]]'' temperature seemed to make no difference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hlavacova|first=J.|last2=Votypka|first2=J.|last3=Volf|first3=P.|date=2013|title=The effect of temperature on Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) development in sand flies|journal=Journal of Medical Entomology|volume=50|pages=955–958|doi=10.1603/ME13053}}</ref>
==== Tick borne disease ====
A high humidity of greater than 85% is the best condition for a tick to start and finish its life cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Süss|first1=Jochen|last2=Klaus|first2=Christine|last3=Gerstengarbe|first3=Friedrich‐Wilhelm|last4=Werner|first4=Peter C.|date=1 January 2008|title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Temperature is so important to overall survival that an average monthly minimum temperature of below -7&nbsp;°C in the winter can prevent an area from maintaining established populations.<ref name=":0" />

The effect of climate on the tick life cycle is one of the more difficult projections to make in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles span multiple seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-and-health-assessment/vectorborne-diseases/boxes/life-cycle-blacklegged-ticks-ixodes|title=Life Cycle of Blacklegged Ticks, Ixodes scapularis {{!}} Climate and Health Assessment|last=USGCRP|website=health2016.globalchange.gov|language=en|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> Further, infection and spread of diseases such as Lyme disease happens across the multiple stages adding additional variables to consider. Infection of ticks happen in the larval/nymph stage (after the first blood meal) when they are exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease), but transmission to humans doesn't occur until the adult stages.

The expansion of tick populations are concurrent with global climatic change. Species distribution models of recent years indicate that the deer tick, known as ''I. scapularis,'' is pushing its distribution to higher latitudes of the Northeastern United States and Canada, as well as pushing and maintaining populations in the South Central and Northern Midwest regions of the United States.<ref name="Esteve-Gassent 38–64">{{Cite journal|last1=Esteve-Gassent|first1=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|journal=Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}</ref> Climate models project further expansion of tick habit north into Canada as progressing Northwest from the Northeastern United States.

Tick populations are not only spreading wider, but moving to higher elevations. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick known as ''D. andersoni'' is found along the front range and is want to feed, and consequently infect, human populations with tularemia (''Francisella tularensis''), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (''Rickettsia rickettsii''), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus). A case study testing climatic interaction affecting tick vector (''D. andersoni'') populations in Larimer County, Colorado indicated that an estimated increase of 1.2–2.0&nbsp;°C in summer temperatures would increase tick populations moving 100m upwards in elevation, increasing the range and susceptibility of tick-borne illnesses along the front range.

Initial symptoms of tick-borne infections are generally quite similar to that of other viral illnesses. This includes fever, headache, fatigue, and general malaise. This group of diseases can further be difficult to distinguish early on in the disease process due to these general symptoms in addition to most people (reported around 75%) not realizing they have been bitten or exposed to the tick vector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nadelman|first1=Robert B.|last2=Nowakowski|first2=John|last3=Forseter|first3=Gilda|last4=Goldberg|first4=Neil S.|last5=Bittker|first5=Susan|last6=Cooper|first6=Denise|last7=Aguero-Rosenfeld|first7=Maria|last8=Wormser|first8=Gary P.|date=May 1996|title=The clinical spectrum of early lyme borreliosis in patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(95)99915-9/pdf|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=en|volume=100|issue=5|pages=502–508|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(95)99915-9|pmid=8644761|issn=0002-9343}}</ref> Unique to early Lyme disease is the development of the classic erythema migrans skin rash, also known as the “bull’s eye” or “target” rash, which occurs in about 80% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Steere|first1=Allen C.|last2=Sikand|first2=Vijay K.|date=12 June 2003|title=The Presenting Manifestations of Lyme Disease and the Outcomes of Treatment|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=348|issue=24|pages=2472–2474|doi=10.1056/nejm200306123482423|pmid=12802042|issn=0028-4793}}</ref> This symptom can be an important distinguishing factor helping to make the diagnosis early.

Regardless of the specific diagnosis (Lyme, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Babesiosis etc.) the key to management and prevention of sequelae is early identification of disease and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. With regard to the effects of a warming world and the expansion of tick populations to previously unexposed areas, adaptive keys to prevention will include expansion of health care infrastructure and pharmacologic availability, as well as education of people and providers as to the risks of disease and preventive measures they can take.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap15_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability|last1=Mimura|first1=Nobuo|last2=Pulwarty|first2=Roger|last3=Duc|first3=Do Minh|last4=Elshinnawy|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Redsteer|first5=Margaret|last6=Huang|first6=He-Qing|last7=Nkem|first7=Johnson|last8=Sanchez Rodriguez|first8=Roberto|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|pages=869–898}}</ref>

In the face of these expanding threats, strong collaboration between government officials and environmental scientists is necessary for advancing preventive and reactive response measures. Without acknowledging the climate changes that make environments more habitable for disease carriers, policy and infrastructure will lag behind vector borne disease spread.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/08/06/21999/disease-bearing-ticks-head-north-weak-government-response-threatens-public-health|title=As disease-bearing ticks head north, weak government response threatens public health|work=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> The human cost associated with denying climate change science is one that concerns many governments.

==== Coronavirus ====
{{Further|Coronavirus disease 2019}}
According to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] the [[Coronavirus disease 2019]] is [[Zoonotic disease|zoonotic]], e.g., the virus passed from animals to humans. Such diseases are occurring more frequently in the latest decades, due to a number of factors, so, as for now, 75% of all emerging disease are zoonotic. Large part of the causes are environmental. One of the factors is climate change. Quick changes in temperature and humidity facilitate the spread of diseases. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] concludes that: "The most fundamental way to protect ourselves from zoonotic diseases is to prevent destruction of nature. Where ecosystems are healthy and biodiverse, they are resilient, adaptable and help to regulate diseases."<ref>{{cite web |title=Science points to causes of COVID-19 |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/science-points-causes-covid-19 |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |publisher=United Nations |access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref>

In April 2020 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published 2 short videos explaining the link between nature destruction (including from climate change), wildlife trade and [[COVID-19 pandemic]]<ref>{{cite web |title=A message from nature: coronavirus |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/video/message-nature-coronavirus |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How nature can protect us from pandemics |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/video/how-nature-can-protect-us-pandemics |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref> and created a section in its site dedicated to the issue.<ref>{{cite web |title=COVID-19 updates from the United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/covid-19-updates |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

Part of the causes of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] can be environmental, like [[climate change]] and [[deforestation]]. According to the [[World Bank]] climate change can increase the risk of an epidemic like the coronavirus by a number of ways including by causing deforestation. Deforestation is responsible for 31% of the zoonotic diseases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=BOUKERCHE|first1=SANDRINE|last2=MOHAMMED-ROBERTS|first2=RIANNA|title=Fighting infectious diseases: The connection to climate change|url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/fighting-infectious-diseases-connection-climate-change|access-date=12 June 2020|website=World Banks Blogs|publisher=The World Bank}}</ref>

Climate change can increase migration of animals and connection between them and humans. This can facilitate the transmission of viruses from one animal to another and to humans. Viruses generally learn to coexist with their host and became more dangerous when they pass to another. The increase in humidity can also make the transmission easier,<ref>{{cite news |last1=HARRIS |first1=ROBBIE |title=Coronavirus and Climate Change |url=https://www.wvtf.org/post/coronavirus-and-climate-change?fbclid=IwAR10fGiZ7GexvygV8Ea7_ILMZSlJDw77-Lq56mPk4Q5CYaiocZk7HVR3apw#stream/0 |access-date=1 March 2020 |agency=WVTF |date=6 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus, climate change, and the environment |url=https://www.ehn.org/coronavirus-environment-2645553060.html |website=Environmental Health News |access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> even though there are suggestions that increase in humidity and temperature may decrease the expansion of the pandemic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ferrell |first1=Jesse |title=Analysis of new research paper tying coronavirus to weather |url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/weathermatrix/analysis-of-new-research-paper-tying-coronavirus-to-weather/703270 |access-date=22 March 2020 |agency=AccuWeather |date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

Climate change reduces the number of animals in populations, what lead to less genetic diversity. Such condition facilitates the spread of viruses. Scientists already linked a number of zoonotic diseases outbreaks to floods and droughts and their frequency will increase with climate change. Also, others impacts of climate change can make societies less stable - more wars, human migration, less effective medical and sanitation systems increase the risk of epidemics.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Sarah |title=Climate change affects everything — even the coronavirus |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/04/15/climate-change-affects-everything-even-coronavirus/?arc404=true |access-date=12 June 2020 |agency=Washington Post |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>

Due to environmental and social causes, outbreaks became more frequent, so that in the past decade the [[World Health Organization]] declared global health emergency 4 times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benton |first1=Tim |last2=Kock |first2=Richard Anthony |last3=Bhardwaj |first3=Gitika |title=Coronavirus Crisis: Exploring the Human Impact on Nature |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/05/coronavirus-crisis-exploring-human-impact-nature |website=Chatham House |access-date=19 October 2020}}</ref>

In July 2020 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[International Livestock Research Institute]] published a report named: "[[Preventing the next pandemic - Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission]]. The report says that the frequency of zoonotic diseases like the coronavirus is increasing due to a number of causes, generally linked to nature destruction:  "high demand for animal protein, unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change" All those changes the way in which animals and humans interact.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: Fear over rise in animal-to-human diseases |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53314432 |access-date=7 July 2020 |agency=BBC |date=6 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Preventing the next pandemic - Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |publisher=United Nations |access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] created a special page dedicated to frequently asked questions about coronavirus and climate change, among other about the link between climate change and the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. On this page it summarized the current knowledge about the issue as follows: "There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.

However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent [[pandemics]], originate in [[wildlife]], and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of [[biodiversity]] and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases."<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Climate change |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change#:~:text=Will%20climate%20change%20make%20COVID,reducing%20transmission%20and%20treating%20patients. |website=World Health Organiztion |publisher=World Health Organiztion |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref>

==== Extreme heat and disease ====
Increased heat, generated by the buildup of carbon, has been found to help disease-carrying organisms such as mosquitos thrive by producing stable environments for them. A research organization known as Climate Central states “The land area of the U.S. most suitable for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes is projected to increase from 5 percent to about 50 percent by 2100, putting 60 percent of the northeastern U.S.’ population at risk for the diseases carried by this mosquito, including West Nile virus, dengue and Zika.”<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces a Rise in Mosquito 'Disease Danger Days' |url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-faces-a-rise-in-mosquito-disease-danger-days-21903 |website=Climate Central |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> An outbreak of diseases like the West Nile and Zika virus could trigger a crisis since it would cause severe illness in people as well as birth defects in infants. Less advanced countries would be especially affected as they may have very limited resources to combat an infestation.

==Impact on mental health{{anchor|Mental_health}}==
{{Further|Solastalgia}}
While the physical health impacts of [[climate change]] are well known, the impact on [[mental health]] has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chand |first1=Prabhat Kumar |last2=Murthy |first2=Pratima |title=Climate change and mental health |journal=Regional Health Forum |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=43–48 |url=http://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/who44.pdf#page=51}}</ref> According to 2011 in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Clayton & Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable [[populations]] and those with pre-existing serious [[mental illness]].<ref name=clayton>{{cite journal |last1=Doherty |first1=Susan |last2=Clayton |first2=Thomas J |title=The psychological impacts of global climate change |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |year=2011 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1037/a0023141 |pmid=21553952 |citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8333 }}</ref> Research done by Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom in 2008 found that climate change exposes populations to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], which negatively impacts mental health in very serious ways.<ref name=berry>{{Cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|last2=Kathryn|first2=Bowen|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|title=Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=2|pages=123–132|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-0112-0|pmid=20033251|year=2009|s2cid=22561555}}</ref>
Both the Clayton study and the Berry study identify three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: direct, indirect, and psychosocial.<ref name=clayton/><ref name=berry/> The Clayton study claims that in order to appreciate these impacts on psychological wellbeing, one must recognize the different cultural narratives associated with climate change, as well as how climate change and global phenomena like increased population, are interrelated. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower [[economic]] and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.<ref name=clayton/> A 2018 study of CDC data connected temperature rise to increased numbers of suicides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/817731002|publisher=USA Today|year=2018|title=Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides}}</ref> The study revealed that hotter days could increase suicide rates and could cause approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase/565826/|title=Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050|website=The Atlantic|date=23 July 2018}}</ref>

=== Direct impacts ===
Direct impacts on mental health happen when a [[community]] experiences [[extreme weather]] and changed [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=clayton/> 
Direct impacts like landscape changes, impaired [[place attachment]], and [[psychological trauma]] are all immediate and localized problems resulting from extreme weather events and environmental changes.<ref name=clayton/> Extreme weather events cause negative changes to landscape and [[agriculture]]. This leads to communities facing economic aspects, especially for communities that use agriculture as a main source of income. After economic fall, communities face loss of livelihoods and [[poverty]]. Many communities will also face isolation, alienation, [[grief]], bereavement, and displacement from these effects.<ref name=berry/><ref name=portier>{{cite web|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |work=National Institute of Environment Health Services |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |date=1 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421191355/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |archive-date=21 April 2012 }}</ref> Individuals will have an increased rate of [[anxiety]] and emotional stress. The rate of effects on mental health increases in already-vulnerable communities.<ref name=portier/> Clayton reinforces that the more powerful the extreme weather event, and the more frequent these weather events are, the more damage is done to the mental health of the community.<ref name=clayton/>
Some of the extreme weather events responsible for these mental health changes include wildfires,<ref name=portier/> earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,<ref name=berry/> and extreme heat.<ref name=worldhealth>{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Climate change and health|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

A study published in April 2020 found that by the end of the 21st century people could be exposed to [[Climate change mitigation|avoidable]] indoor CO2 levels of up to 1400 ppm, which would be triple the amount commonly experienced outdoors today and, according to the authors, may [[Carbon dioxide#Toxicity|cut humans' basic decision-making ability indoors by ~25% and complex strategic thinking by ~50%]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rising carbon dioxide levels will make us stupider |journal=Nature |date=20 April 2020 |volume=580 |issue=7805 |pages=567 |doi=10.1038/d41586-020-01134-w |pmid=32317783 |bibcode=2020Natur.580Q.567. |s2cid=216075495 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rising CO2 causes more than a climate crisis—it may directly harm our ability to think |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-04-co2-climate-crisisit-ability.html |access-date=17 May 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karnauskas |first1=Kristopher B. |last2=Miller |first2=Shelly L. |last3=Schapiro |first3=Anna C. |title=Fossil Fuel Combustion Is Driving Indoor CO2 Toward Levels Harmful to Human Cognition |journal=GeoHealth |date=2020 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=e2019GH000237 |doi=10.1029/2019GH000237 |pmid=32426622 |pmc=7229519 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Indirect impacts ===
Indirect impacts on mental health occur via impacts on physical health and community well-being. Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name="clayton"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>
[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>

As extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.<ref name=bowlby>{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279–294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}</ref> Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase. For every one-degree [[Fahrenheit]], there will be nine more murders in the country, which leads to an additional 24,000 murders or assaults per year in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2000-2004/01A.pdf|title=Heat and Violence|last=Anderson|first=C|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2001|location=Iowa|pages=33–38}}</ref>

There is also an increased risk in [[suicide]] in communities that suffer from extreme weather events. Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.<ref name=epstein>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.<ref name=epstein/> These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>

Some impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>

The effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>

=== Psychological impacts ===
Psychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/>

The loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.<ref name=bowlby/><ref>{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}</ref> The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections.

==Impact on natural resources==

===Drinking water===
[[Global Health Corps]] reports that when interruptions in the regular water supply, "forces rural and impoverished families to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghcorps.org/a-deadly-dinner-2/|title=A Deadly Dinner {{!}} Global Health Corps|website=ghcorps.org|access-date=6 August 2019}}</ref> Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the [[Developing country|developing world]] can be attributed to contaminated water.
<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2003/sgsm8707.doc.htm |title='Water-Related Diseases Responsible For 80 Per Cent Of All Illnesses, Deaths In Developing World', Says Secretary-General In Environment Day Message |access-date=6 August 2019
|date=16 May 2003|website=www.un.org}}</ref>

When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reports: Drought-Stricken Somalis Dying From Contaminated Water |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=31 October 2009 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-03-22-voa28/324586.html}}</ref>

The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Clovice |last1=Kankya |first2=Adrian |last2=Muwonge |first3=Berit |last3=Djønne |first4=Musso |last4=Munyeme |first5=John |last5=Opuda-Asibo |first6=Eystein |last6=Skjerve |first7=James |last7=Oloya |first8=Vigdis |last8=Edvardsen |first9=Tone B |last9=Johansen |display-authors=3 |title=Isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria from pastoral ecosystems of Uganda: Public Health significance |journal=BMC Public Health |date=16 May 2011 |volume=11 |issue=320 |pages=320 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-320 |pmid=21575226 |pmc=3123205}}</ref> During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/drought.asp |title=NRDC: Climate Change Threatens Health: Drought |work=nrdc.org}}</ref>  Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Hans W. |last1=Paerl |first2=Jef |last2=Huisman |title=Blooms Like It Hot |journal=Science |date=4 April 2008 |volume=320 |issue=5872 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.1126/science.1155398 |pmid=18388279 |citeseerx=10.1.1.364.6826 |s2cid=142881074 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) Blooms |work=California Department of Public Health |date=18 September 2013 |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx |access-date=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115131056/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/Pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx |archive-date=15 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces Era Of Water Scarcity |work=WaterNews |publisher=Circle of Blue |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2008/world/us-faces-era-of-water-scarcity/}}</ref>

===Fresh water===
As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. [[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031172136/http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Impact on livestock==
Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.

===Greenhouse gas effects===
Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archive-date=16 April 2012 }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016–2025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 |s2cid=6318195 }}</ref>

According to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.<ref name="strategies" />

The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.<ref name="strategies" />

As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.<ref name="strategies" /><ref name=impact>{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}</ref> This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.<ref name="strategies" />

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.<ref name="strategies" /><ref name="impact" /><ref>{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}</ref><ref name=who>{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corvalán |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92-4-156248-X |url=https://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}</ref>

===Heat stress===
[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&nbsp;°C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<ref name="impact" /> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.

==Impact on plant based food==
[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops—from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels—all of which directly affect [[human health]]. Part of this variability in possible outcomes is from the various [[climate change model]]s used to project potential impacts; each model takes into account different factors and so come out with a slightly different result.<ref name=Hertel>{{cite journal |last1=Hertel |first1=Thomas W. |last2=Rosch |first2=Stephanie D. |title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Poverty |journal=[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]] |date=June 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=355–385 |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppq016|hdl=10986/3949 |s2cid=55848822 |url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/91437/files/Hertel_et_al._IATRC_Summer_2010.pdf }}</ref> A second problem comes from the fact that projections are made based on historical data which is not necessarily helpful in accurate forecasting as changes are occurring exponentially.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein">{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref name=Kul>{{cite journal |last=Kulshreshtha |first=Surendra N. |title=Climate Change, Prairie Agriculture and Prairie Economy: The new normal |journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=March 2011 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01211.x}}</ref> As such, there are many different possible impacts—both positive and negative—that may result from climate change affecting global regions in different ways.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Canada>{{cite report |editor1-first=Donald S. |editor1-last=Lemmen |editor2-first=Fiona J. |editor2-last=Warren |title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2004 |isbn= 0-662-33123-0 |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/27428.pdf}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref>

===Food scarcity===
Food scarcity is a major key for many populations and is one of the prominent concerns with the changing climate. Currently, 1/6 of the [[global population]] are without adequate food supply.<ref name=Beddington>{{cite journal |last1=Beddington |first1=John R. |last2=Asaduzzaman |first2=Mohammed |last3=Clark |first3=Megan E. |last4=Bremauntz |first4=Adrian Fernández |last5=Guillou |first5=Marion D |last6=Jahn |first6=Molly M. |last7=Lin |first7=Erda |last8=Mamo |first8=Tekalign |last9=Negra |first9=Christine |last10=Nobre |first10=Carlos A. |last11=Scholes |first11=Robert J. |last12=Sharma |first12=Rita |last13=Van Bo |first13=Nguyen |last14=Wakhungu |first14=Judi |display-authors=3 |title=The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change |journal=Agriculture & Food Security |year=2012 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10 |doi=10.1186/2048-7010-1-10|doi-access=free }}</ref> By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 9 billion requiring global food productions to increase by 50% to meet population demand.<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Chakra>{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborty |first1=S. |last2=Newton |first2=A.

===Extreme weather===

====Rising temperatures====
As the [[temperature]] changes and weather patterns become more extreme, areas which were historically good for farmland will no longer be as amicable.<ref name=Connor>{{cite journal |last1=Connor |first1=Jeffery D. |last2=Schwabe |first2=Kurt |last3=King |first3=Darran |last4=Knapp |first4=Keith |title=Irrigated agriculture and climate change: The influence of water supply variability and salinity on adaptation |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=May 2012 |volume=77 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.021}}</ref><ref name=Sindhu>{{cite journal |last=Sindhu |first=J.S. |title=Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |journal=Indian Journal of Science and Technology |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=348–353 |doi=10.17485/ijst/2011/v4i3.32 |issn=0974-6846 |url=http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/view/29998/25953|doi-access=free }}</ref> The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major [[arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions ([[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Southwest United States]], and [[Southern Europe]]).<ref name=Connor/><ref name=Tubiello>{{cite journal |last1=Tubiello |first1=Francesco N. |last2=Rosenzweig |first2=Cynthia |title=Developing climate change impact metrics for agriculture |journal=The Integrated Assessment Journal |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165–184 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/276/240}}</ref> In addition, crop yields in [[tropical regions]] will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2&nbsp;°C) expected to occur during the first half of the century.<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana">{{cite journal |last1=Tubiello |first1=Francesco N. |last2=Soussana |first2=Jean-François |first3= S.

====Drought and flood====
Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of [[droughts]] and [[floods]]. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.<ref name=Canada/><ref name=Kristjanson>{{cite journal |last1=Kristjanson |first1=Patti |last2=Neufeldt |first2=Henry |last3=Gassner |first3=Anja |last4=Mango |first4=Joash |last5=Kyazze |first5=Florence B. |last6=Desta |first6=Solomon |last7=Sayula |first7=George |last8=Thiede |first8=Brian |last9=Förch |first9=Wiebke |last10=Thornton |first10=Pphilip K. |last11=Coe |first11=Richard |display-authors=3 |title=Are food insecure smallholder households making changes in their farming practices? Evidence from East Africa |journal=Food Security |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=381–397 |doi=10.1007/s12571-012-0194-z|doi-access=free }}</ref> In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/>

Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.<ref name=Connor/> The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/>  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this historical method of weed control will no longer be possible.<ref name=Rod10>{{cite journal |last1=Rodenburg |first1=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}</ref>

With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<ref name=Hertel/> Other farmers will respond by raising their [[food prices]]; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<ref name=Beddington/>

===Financial===
Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<ref name=Hertel/> However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana"/> In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana"/> The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Sindhu/> This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.

===Pests and pathogens===
Currently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>

Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last1=Rodenburg |first1=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D. E. |title=Challenges for weed management in African rice systems in a changing climate |journal=[[The Journal of Agricultural Science]] |date=August 2011 |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=427–435 |doi=10.1017/S0021859611000207|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/69596 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like [[aphids]], [[whiteflies]] and [[locusts]].<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/>

The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse [[weed]]s over the [[monocropping|monocrops]] most farms consist of.<ref name=Rod11/> Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> Characteristics of weeds such as their [[genetic diversity]], cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.<ref name=Thomson/> Finally, with the increased {{CO2}} levels, [[herbicides]] will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.<ref name=Rod11/>

==Impact on nutrition==
	Another area of concern is the effect of climate change on the nutritional content of food for human consumption. Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Of significant concern is the [[protein]] content of plants, which also decreases in relation to elevating carbon content.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Chakra/><ref name="Effects of CO2">{{cite journal |last1=Taub |first1=Daniel R. |last2=Miller |first2=Brian |last3=Allen |first3=Holly |title=Effects of elevated {{CO2}} on the protein concentration of food crops: a meta-analysis |journal=[[Global Change Biology]] |date=March 2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01511.x}}</ref> 
	
Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of [[essential nutrients]] in crops contributes the problem of [[micronutrient malnutrition]] in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.<ref name=Loladze>{{cite journal |last=Loladze |first=Irakli |title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |date=1 October 2002 |volume=17 |pages=457–461 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02587-9}}</ref> This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in [[calories]], [[fat]]s, and animal products. This results in [[undernutrition]] and an increase in [[obesity]] and diet-related [[chronic diseases]].<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Loladze/>
	
Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. [[Iron deficiency]] affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing [[maternal mortality]] and hindering [[cognitive development]] in children, leading to education losses. [[Iodine deficiency]] leads to ailments like [[goitre]], [[brain damage]] and [[cretinism]] and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.<ref name=Loladze/> Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.
	
Small increases in {{CO2}} levels can cause a {{CO2}} fertilization effect where the growth and reproduction abilities of [[C3 carbon fixation|C<sub>3</sub>]] plants such as soybeans and [[rice]] are actually enhanced by 10-20% in laboratory experiments. This does not take into account, however, the additional burden of pests, pathogens, nutrients and water affecting the crop yield.<ref name="Effects of CO2"/><ref name=Gregory>{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=Peter J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Scott N. |last3=Newton |first3=Adrian C. |last4=Ingram |first4=John S.I. |title=Integrating pests and pathogens into the climate change/food security debate |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2009 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=2827–2838 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp080|pmid=19380424 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Adaptation and mitigation strategies==
While researchers acknowledge there are possible [[benefits of global warming]], most agree that the negative consequences of climate change will outweigh any potential benefits and instead the shifting climate will result in more benefits to developed countries and more detriments to developing countries; exacerbating the discrepancy between wealthy and impoverished nations.<ref name=Chakra/><ref name="Fischer & Shah" /><ref name=Gregory/>  By thoughtful and proactive efforts, climate change can be mitigated by addressing these issues with a [[multidisciplinary approach]] that works on a [[Earth|global]], national and community basis that recognizes the uniqueness of each country's situation.<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Sindhu/> 
	
According to a study of [[East Africa]]’s [[smallholding|smallholder]] farms, impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being seen there resulting in changes to farming practices such as [[intercropping]], crop, soil, land, water and livestock management systems, and introduction of new technologies and seed varieties by some of the farmers.<ref name="Kristjanson"/> Some other suggestions such as eliminating [[supply chain]] and household [[food waste]], encouraging diverse and vegetable-rich diets, and providing global access to foods ([[food aid]] programs) have been suggested as ways to adapt.<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Chakra/> Many researchers agree that agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate [[fertilization]] use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Sindhu/><ref name=Rod11/><ref name=IFPRI>{{cite report |last1=Nelson |first1=Gerald C. |first2=Mark W. |last2=Rosegrant |first3=Jawoo |last3=Koo |first4=Richard |last4=Robertson |first5=Timothy |last5=Sulser |first6=Tingju |last6=Zhu |first7=Claudia |last7=Ringler |first8=Siwa |last8=Msangi |first9=Amanda |last9=Palazzo |first10=Miroslav |last10=Batka |first11=Marilia |last11=Magalhaes |first12=Rowena |last12=Valmonte-Santos |first13=Mandy |last13=Ewing |first14=David |last14=Lee |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation |publisher=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] |date=October 2009 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160505014731/http%3A//ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  On a government and global level, research and investments into [[agricultural productivity]] and [[infrastructure]] must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them.

==Oceans and human health==

===Overview===
Perhaps one of the most recent adverse [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to be explored is that of [[ocean acidification]]. Our [[oceans]] cover approximately 71 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and support a diverse range of [[ecosystems]], which are home to over 50 percent of all the [[species]] on the planet.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |title=Oceans & Coasts |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.noaa.gov/oceans-coasts |access-date=12 August 2016}}</ref> Oceans regulate [[climate]] and [[weather]] as well as providing [[nutrition]] for a vast variety of species, humans included.<ref name=NOAA/> Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] from the [[atmosphere]].<ref name=raven99>{{Cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J.A. |last2=Falkowski |first2=P.G. |date=June 1999 |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric {{co2}} |journal=[[Plant, Cell & Environment]] | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=741–755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}</ref> This process is part of the [[carbon cycle]] in which the fluxes of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in Earth's [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]] and [[lithosphere]] are described.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Carbon Cycle |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |access-date=29 November 2012 |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9020247}}</ref> Humans have drastically added to the amount of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in the atmosphere through the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the process of [[deforestation]]. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].

===Coral===
With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name="atoll">{{cite journal|last1=Terry|first1=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88–89|pages=76–84|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name="child">{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328–1332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.<ref name="atoll" /> In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.<ref name="child" /> Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low-lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.

===Human health===
The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans. According to Small and Nicholls, they estimated that 1.2 billion people worldwide, lived in the near-coastal region (within 100&nbsp;km and 100m of the shoreline).<ref name=settle>{{cite journal |last1=Small |first1=Christopher |last2=Nicholls |first2=Robert J. |title=A Global Analysis of Human Settlement in Coastal Zones |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |date=Summer 2003 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=584–599 |jstor=4299200}}</ref> This data was collected in 1990 and therefore is a conservative estimate in modern terms. In the U.S. alone 53% of the population lives within 50 miles of the coastal shoreline.<ref name=grass>{{cite journal |last1=Delorenzo |first1=Marie E. |last2=Wallace |first2=Sarah C. |last3=Danese |first3=Loren E. |last4=Baird |first4=Thomas D. |title=Temperature and Salinity effects on the toxicity of common pesticides to the grass shrimp, ''Palaemonetes pugio'' |journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health |year=2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=455–460 |doi=10.1080/03601230902935121|pmid=20183050 |s2cid=23209169 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1234438 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> Humans rely heavily on oceans for food, employment, recreation, weather patterns and transportation.<ref name=guest>{{cite journal |last1=Sandifer |first1=Paul A. |first2=A.

===Food safety===
Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].<ref name=pseudo>{{cite journal |last1=Tatters |first1=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32116 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}</ref>  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.<ref name=pseudo/>  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.<ref name=pseudo/>

==Extreme weather events==
Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>

===Drought===
Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.
A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.
During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>

The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious [[cycle of poverty]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S–181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>

===Floods===
[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}</ref>  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well-being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.<ref name=alderman>{{cite journal |last1=Alderman |first1=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37–47 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:346602/UQ346602_OA.pdf }}</ref>

Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>

Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>

[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>

[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>

Non-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.<ref name=alderman/>

=== Hurricanes ===
Another result of the warming oceans are stronger [[hurricanes]], which will wreak more havoc on land, and in the oceans,<ref name="Storms and Sickness">{{cite book|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161 161–178]|chapter=Storms and Sickness|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PA161|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/161}}</ref> and create more opportunities for vectors to breed and infectious diseases to flourish.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /><ref name="Sobering Predictions" /> [[Extreme weather]] also means stronger winds. These winds can carry vectors tens of thousands of kilometers, resulting in an introduction of new infectious agents to regions that have never seen them before, making the humans in these regions even more susceptible.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" />

===Glacial melting===
A [[glacier]] is a mass of ice that has originated from snow that has been compacted via pressure and have definite lateral limits and movements in definite directions.<ref name="Chinn">{{cite journal|last=Chinn|first=T.J.|date=2001|title=Distribution of the glacial water resources of New Zealand|url=http://hydrologynz.co.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=139–187}}<!-- removed from ref, these point to a different article: {{|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90093-3 |bibcode=1979JHyd...40..139C}} --></ref> They are found in areas where the temperatures do not get warm enough to melt annual snow accumulation, thus resulting in many layers of snow piling up over many years, creating the pressure needed to make a glacier.  [[Global climate change]] and fluctuation is causing an increasingly exponential melting of Earth's glaciers.  These melting glaciers have many [[social]] and [[ecological]] consequences that directly or indirectly impact the health and well-being of humans.<ref name=Orlove>{{cite journal |last=Orlove |first=Ben |title=Glacier Retreat: Reviewing the Limits of Human Adaptation to Climate Change |journal=Environment |year=2009 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=22–34 |doi=10.3200/envt.51.3.22-34|s2cid=153516688 }}</ref>  The recession of glaciers change [[sea salt]], [[sediment]], and temperature ratios in the ocean which changes currents, weather patterns, and marine life.<ref name=Epstein>{{cite book |title=Changing Planet, changing health |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |author1=Epstein, P. |author2=Ferber, D. |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 }}</ref>  The melt also [[ocean levels|increases ocean levels]] and decreases the [[Water resources|availability of water]] for human consumption, agriculture, and hydroelectricity.  This aggravates and increases the likelihood of issues such as sanitation,  [[world hunger]], population shifts, and [[Extreme weather|catastrophic weather]] such as flooding, drought, and worldwide temperature fluctuations.<ref name=Epstein/>

Glacial retreat first gained the attention of alpinists and the tourist industry shortly after 1940 – when the globe warmed ~0.5&nbsp;°C.<ref name=Chinn/> Even with 62 years of awareness, [[climate change]] is just becoming an issue for some parts of society. Over this time period the [[alpine glaciers|cirque and steep alpine glaciers]] were able to [[acclimatize]] to the new temperatures posed by climate change; large [[valley glacier]]s have not yet made this adjustment. This means the large valley glaciers are rapidly retreating, as their mass is attempting to achieve equilibrium with the current climate.  If regional [[snow line]]s stay constant, then the glaciers remain constant.<ref name=Chinn/> Today this is clearly not the case as global warming is causing mountain snow lines to rapidly retreat.  Even the United States’ famous [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] is receding.  More than two-thirds of its glaciers have disappeared and it is expected for them to be nonexistent in the park by the year 2030.<ref name=Hall>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Myrna H.P. |last2=Fagre |first2=Daniel B. |title=Modeled Climate Change in Glacier National Park, 1850-2100 |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2003 |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=131 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[0131:mcigci]2.0.co;2|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Glacial melt will affect [[Coastal wetland|low-lying coastal wetlands]] via [[sea level rise]], change key drivers of [[fresh-water ecosystem]]s, shift the timing of snow packs, and alter the unique character of associated fresh water streams off of snow pack.<ref name=Jenkins>{{cite journal |first1=K.M. |last1=Jenkins |last2=Kingsford |first2=R.T. |last3=Closs |first3=G.P. |last4=Wolfenden |first4=B.J. |last5=Matthaei |first5=C.D. |last6=Hay |first6=S.E. |display-authors=3 |title=Climate change and freshwater ecosystems in Oceania: an assessment of vulnerability and adaption opportunities |journal=[[Pacific Conservation Biology]] |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=201–219 |doi=10.1071/PC110201 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  It has also been stated that the sea level will rise 28–43&nbsp;cm by 2100;<ref name=Jenkins/> if all the ice on Earth melts, it is predicted that the ocean level will increase 75 meters, destroying many coastal cities.<ref name=Epstein/>  In addition, the freshwater swaps in northern areas are already affected by the intrusion of salt water. “Sea level rise will cause a change of state from freshwater to marine or [[Estuarine|estuarine ecosystems]], radically altering the composition of [[Biotic community|biotic communities]]".<ref name=Jenkins/>

Not only are glaciers causing a rise in sea level, they are causing an increase in [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ESNO) and global temperature itself.<ref name=Chinn/>  Glacier loss adds to global heat rise through a decrease in what is called [[ice-albedo feedback]].  As more ice melts, there is less [[Solar reflectance|solar reflectivity]] and less heat is reflected away from the Earth, causing more heat to be absorbed, and retained in the atmosphere and soil <ref name=Epstein/> In addition to the El Niño events, glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of [[sea surface temperatures]] <ref name=Chinn/> and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the [[Atlantic conveyor belt|Atlantic conveyor belt's]] usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant, cold, fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north.<ref name=Epstein/>

Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff.<ref name=Hall/>  Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being.<ref name=Epstein/>  Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  “In many parts of the world, disappearing [[mountain glacier]]s and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity.<ref name=Epstein/>

===Mountain pine beetle, forest ecosystems and forest fires===
[[File:Dendroctonus ponderosae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Adult mountain pine beetle]]

Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the [[mountain pine beetle]] (MPB). This is because temperature is a factor which determines insect development and population success.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sambaraju |first1=Kishan R. |last2=Carroll |first2=Allan L. |last3=Zhu |first3=Jun |last4=Stahl |first4=Kerstin |last5=Moore |first5=R.

It is a simple relationship between a [[host (biology)|host]] (the forest), an [[Biological agent|agent]] (the beetle) and the [[Natural environment|environment]] (the weather & temperature).<ref name=pinebeetle/> However, as climate change causes mountain areas to become warmer and drier, pine beetles have more power to infest and destroy the forest ecosystems, such as the whitebark pine forests of the Rockies.<ref name=pinebeetle/> This is a forest so important to forest ecosystems that it is called the “rooftop of the rockies”. Climate change has led to a threatening pine beetle [[pandemic]], causing them to spread far beyond their native habitat. This leads to [[ecosystem]] changes, [[forest fires]], [[floods]] and hazards to human [[health]].<ref name=pinebeetle/>

The whitebark pine ecosystem in these high elevations plays many essential roles, providing support to plant and animal life.<ref name=pinebeetle/>  They provide food for [[grizzly bears]] and [[squirrels]], as well as shelter and breeding grounds for [[elk]] and [[deer]]; protects [[Drainage divide|watersheds]] by sending water to parched foothills and plains; serves as a reservoir by dispensing supplies of water from melted snowpacks that are trapped beneath the shaded areas; and creates new soil which allows for growth of other trees and plant species.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Without these pines, animals do not have adequate food, water, or shelter, and the reproductive life cycle, as well as quality of life, is affected as a consequence.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Normally, the pine beetle cannot survive in these frigid temperatures and high elevation of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=pinebeetle/> However, warmer temperatures means that the pine beetle can now survive and attack these forests, as it no longer is cold enough to freeze and kill the beetle at such elevations.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Increased temperatures also allow the pine beetle to increase their life cycle by 100%: it only takes a single year instead of two for the pine beetle to develop. As the Rockies have not adapted to deal with pine beetle [[infestations]], they lack the defenses to fight the beetles.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Warmer [[weather patterns]], [[drought]], and beetle defense mechanisms together dries out [[sap]] in [[pine trees]], which is the main mechanism of defense that trees have against the beetle, as it drowns the beetles and their eggs.<ref name=pinebeetle/> This makes it easier for the beetle to infest and release chemicals into the tree, luring other beetles in an attempt to overcome the weakened defense system of the pine tree. As a consequence, the host (forest) becomes more vulnerable to the disease-causing agent (the beetle).<ref name=pinebeetle/>

The whitebark forests of the Rockies are not the only forests that have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the “lungs of the Earth”.<ref name=pinebeetle/> These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.<ref name=pinebeetle/> In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]]. [[Forest fires]] present dangers to the environment, human health and the [[economy]].<ref name=pinebeetle/>  They are detrimental to [[air quality]] and [[vegetation]], releasing [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] compounds as they burn.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Due to human induced [[deforestation]] and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting [[diseases]] can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, [[insect]] infestations, forest diebacks, [[acid rain]], habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.<ref name=pinebeetle/>

==Displacement/migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People |work=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233729/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |archive-date=5 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.<ref name=bogumil>{{cite thesis |first=Bogumil |last=Terminski |title=Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges |publisher=Centre d'Etude de l'Ethnicité et des Migrations, Université de Liège |date=2012 |url=http://labos.ulg.ac.be/cedem/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf}}</ref>

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.<ref name="beta">{{cite report|title=Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=2012 |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 April 2015 |isbn=978-92-9092-611-5 }}</ref>

To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure
development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants&nbsp;– particularly low-skilled ones&nbsp;– are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<ref name="beta" />

The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.<ref name=bogumil/> This situates the debate on [[environmental migrant|environmental migration]] in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the [[UNHCR]] who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.<ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology">{{cite report |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality? |series=New Issues in Refugee Research |id=Working Paper No. 34 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf}}</ref> Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[The Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>

In 2016 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published a report called: "UNEP FRONTIERS 2016 REPORT". In this report, the second chapter was dedicated to [[Zoonosis|Zoonotic diseases]], e.g., diseases that pass from animals to humans. In this chapter was written that [[deforestation]], [[climate change]], and [[livestock]] agriculture are among the main causes that increase the risk of such diseases. It was mentioned that every 4 months a new disease is discovered in humans. It was said that outbreaks that already happened (as of 2016) led to loss of lives and financial losses of billions dollars and if future diseases will turn into pandemics it will cost trillions of dollars.<ref>{{cite book |title=UNEP Frontiers 2016 Report: Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern |date=2016 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |location=Nairoby |isbn=978-92-807-3553-6 |pages=18–32 |url=https://environmentlive.unep.org/media/docs/assessments/UNEP_Frontiers_2016_report_emerging_issues_of_environmental_concern.pdf |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

==== Impact of warmer and wetter climates ====

Mosquito-borne diseases are probably the greatest threat to humans as they include [[malaria]], [[Lymphatic filariasis|elephantiasis]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[yellow fever]], and [[dengue fever]].<ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease">{{cite journal|last=Reiter |first=Paul |title=Climate Change and Mosquito-Borne Disease |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |year=2001 |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=141–161 |url=http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |doi=10.1289/ehp.01109s1141 |pmid=11250812 |pmc=1240549 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824222504/http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/2001/suppl-1/141-161reiter/abstract.html |archive-date=24 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=elephantiasis>{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=P.R. |title=Climate change and waterborne and vector-borne disease |journal=[[Journal of Applied Microbiology]] |year=2003 |volume=94 |pages=37S–46S |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2672.94.s1.5.x|pmid=12675935 |s2cid=9338260 }}</ref><ref name="Climate change & health" /> Studies are showing higher prevalence of these diseases in areas that have experienced extreme flooding and drought.<ref name="Mosquitoes-Borne Disease" /><ref name=elephantiasis />   Flooding creates more standing water for mosquitoes to breed; as well,  shown that these vectors are able to feed more and grow faster in warmer climates.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> As the climate warms over the oceans and coastal regions, warmer temperatures are also creeping up to higher elevations allowing mosquitoes to survive in areas they had never been able to before.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> As the climate continues to warm there is a risk that malaria will make a return to the developed world.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" />

[[Ticks]] are also thriving in the warmer temperatures allowing them to feed and grow at a faster rate.<ref name=Ticks>{{cite journal |last1=Süss |first1=J. |last2=Klaus |first2=C. |last3=Gerstengarbe |first3=F.W. |last4=Werner |first4=P.C. |title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Another impact that the warming global temperature has had is on the frequency and severity of heat waves. In addition to dehydration and heat stroke, these heat waves have also resulted in epidemics of [[chronic kidney disease]] (CKD). Recent{{when|date=March 2020}} studies have shown that prolonged heat exposure, physical exertion, and dehydration are sufficient factors to developing CKD.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: the Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy|last=Glaser|display-authors=etal| pmid=27151892 | doi=10.2215/CJN.13841215|volume=11|issue=8 |pmc=4974898|year=2016|journal=Clin J Am Soc Nephrol|pages=1472–83}}</ref> These cases are occurring across the world congruently with heat stress nephropathy.

Other diseases on the rise due to extreme weather include [[hantavirus]],<ref name=Hantavirus>{{cite journal |last=Klempa |first=B. |title=Hantaviruses and Climate Change |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |date=June 2009 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=518–523 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02848.x|pmid=19604276 |doi-access=free }}</ref>   [[schistosomiasis]],<ref name=elephantiasis /><ref name="Climate change & health">{{cite journal |last1=McMichael |first1=A.J. |last2=Woodruff |first2=R.E. |last3=Hales |first3=S. |title=Climate change and human health: present and future risks |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=11 March 2006 |volume=367 |issue=9513 |pages=859–869 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68079-3|pmid=16530580 |s2cid=11220212 }}</ref> [[onchocerciasis]] (river blindness),<ref name="Climate change & health" />  and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Emerging Infections">{{cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Paul R. |title=Climate change and emerging infectious diseases |journal=Microbes and Infection |year=2001 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=747–754 |doi=10.1016/s1286-4579(01)01429-0|pmid=11489423 }}</ref> It also  causes the rise in hay fever, as when the weather gets warmer there is a rise in pollen levels in the air.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shaftel|first=Holly|year=2016|title=A blanket around the earth|journal=A Blanket Around the Earth|volume=1|pages=42}}</ref><ref name=":4" />

Projected increases in temperature would make parts of southwest Asia uninhabitable, when temperature combined with high humidity reaches a [[wet-bulb temperature]] of 35&nbsp;°C, the threshold for a fit human to survive in well-ventilated conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability |journal=Nature |year=2015 |first1=Jeremy S. |last1=Pal |first2=Elfatih A.

Warmer temperatures may also lead an increase in aggression levels. Research has shows links between higher temperatures and increased aggressive and criminal behaviour. This can be seen by the rise in the rate of criminality during the warmer summer months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Padhy|first=Susanta|date=2015|title=Mental health effects of climate change|journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=19|issue=1|pages=3–7|pmc=4446935|pmid=26023264|doi=10.4103/0019-5278.156997}}</ref>

==== Impact of warmer oceans ====

The warming oceans are becoming a breeding ground for toxic algae blooms (also known as [[red tides]]) and [[cholera]].<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /><ref name="Climate change & health" /><ref name=Mozambique /> As the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the oceans increase, the cholera bacteria that lives within [[zooplankton]] emerge from their dormant state.<ref name=Mozambique />  The changing winds and changing ocean currents push the zooplankton toward the coastline, carrying the cholera bacteria, which then contaminate drinking water, causing [[cholera outbreaks]].<ref name=Mozambique>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnOkFhXo8rEC&pg=PP1 |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/6 6–28] |chapter=Mozambique |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/6 }}</ref> As flooding increases there is also an increase in cholera epidemics as the flood waters that are carrying the bacteria are infiltrating the drinking water supply.<ref name="Global Health">{{cite journal |last1=St. Louis |first1=Michael E. |last2=Hess |first2=Jeremy J. |title=Climate Change Impacts on and Implications for Global Health |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |year=2008 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2008.08.023|pmid=18929979 }}</ref>   El Nino has also been linked with cholera outbreaks because this weather pattern warms the shoreline waters, causing the cholera bacteria to multiply rapidly.<ref name=Mozambique /><ref name="Global Health" />
==== Impact of warmer freshwater ====
Warmer freshwater is increasing the presence of the amoeba ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'', in freshwater and the parasite ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' in pools, and both can cause a severe disease. Therefore, climate change will probably raise the number of those pathogens.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harris |first1=Alex |title=Climate change will raise Florida's risks of brain-eating amoeba and flesh-eating bacteria |url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-08-climate-florida-brain-eating-amoeba-flesh-eating.html |access-date=13 July 2020 |agency=Medical Press |date=5 August 2019}}</ref> According to a letter of health officials, warning from the ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'': "Infections usually occur when temperatures increase for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels,".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davidson |first1=Jordan |title=Deadly Brain-Eating Amoeba Confirmed in Florida |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/brain-eating-amoeba-florida-2646348423.html |access-date=13 July 2020 |agency=Ecowatch |date=6 July 2020}}</ref>

====Malaria====

[[Malaria]] is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that infects humans and other animals caused by microorganisms in the [[Plasmodium]] family. It begins with a bite from an infected female mosquito, which introduces the parasite through its saliva and into the infected host's circulatory system. It then travels through the bloodstream into the liver where it can mature and reproduce.<ref name=Lancet>{{Cite journal |first1=Brian M. |last1=Greenwood |first2=Kalifa |last2=Bojang |first3=Christopher J.M. |last3=Whitty |first4=Geoffrey A.T. |last4=Targett |title=Malaria |journal=The Lancet |date=23 April 2005 |volume=365 |pages=1487–1498 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66420-3 |pmid=15850634 |issue=9469|s2cid=208987634 }}</ref> The disease causes symptoms that typically include fever, headache, shaking chills, anemia, and in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

'About 3.2 billion people – nearly half of the world's population – are at risk of malaria. In 2015, there were roughly 214 million malaria cases and an estimated 438,000 malaria deaths.' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/malaria/en/|title=10 facts on malaria|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>

Climate is an influential driving force of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Malaria is especially susceptible to the effects of climate change because mosquitoes lack the mechanisms to regulate their internal temperature. This implies that there is a limited range of climatic conditions within which the pathogen (malaria) and vector (a mosquito) can survive, reproduce and infect hosts.<ref name=infectious/> Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, have distinctive characteristics that determine [[pathogenicity]]. These include the survival and reproduction rate of the vector, the level of vector activity (i.e. the biting or feeding rate), and the development and reproduction rate of the pathogen within the vector or host.<ref name=infectious>{{Cite journal |first1=S. |last1=Mia |first2=Rawshan A. |last2=Begum |first3=Ah-Choy |last3=Er |first4=Raja D.Z.R. Zainal |last4=Abidin |first5=Joy J. |last5=Pereira |title=Malaria and Climate Change: Discussion on Economic Impacts |journal=[[American Journal of Environmental Sciences]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=65–74 |doi=10.3844/ajessp.2011.73.82}}</ref> Changes in climate factors substantially affect reproduction, development, distribution and seasonal transmissions of malaria.

Mosquitoes have a small window for preferential conditions for breeding and maturation. The ultimate breeding and maturing temperature for mosquitoes ranges from 16 to 18 degrees Celsius.<ref name= commonwealth>{{cite report |last=Githeko |first=Andrew K. |title=Malaria and climate change |work=Commonwealth Health Ministers’ Update 2009/2010 |url=http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf |access-date=14 February 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61zHql3Vg?url=http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/44031/1/130440.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> If the temperature is decreased by 2 degrees, most of the insects will succumb to death. This is why malaria is unsustainable in places with cool winters. If a climate with an average of approximately 16 degrees Celsius experiences an increase of about two degrees, the mature bugs and the larvae flourish.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Female mosquitoes will need more food (human/animal blood) to sustain life and to stimulate production of eggs. This increases the chance of spread of malaria due to more human contact and a higher number of the blood sucking insects surviving and living longer. Mosquitoes are also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation and humidity. Increased precipitation can increase mosquito population indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply.<ref name=infectious2>{{Cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pates |first2=Christopher |last2=Curtis |title=Mosquito Behaviour and Vector Control |journal=[[Annual Review of Entomology]] |year=2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=57–70 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.50.071803.130439 |pmid=15355233}}</ref> These prime temperatures are creating large breeding grounds for the insects and places for the larvae to mature. Increased temperature is causing snow to melt and stagnant pools of water to become more common.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Bugs that are already carrying the disease are more likely to multiply and infect other mosquitoes causing a dangerous spread of the deadly disease.

Climate change has a direct impact on people's health in places where malaria was originally not prevalent. Mosquitoes are sensitive to temperature changes and the warming of their environment will boost their rates of production.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Paul R|date=2005|title=Climate Change and Human Health|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 353| issue =  14|pages=1433–1436|doi=10.1056/nejmp058079|pmid=16207843|pmc=2636266}}</ref> A fluctuation of two or three degrees is creating exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, for larvae to grow and mature mosquitoes carrying the virus to infect people that have never been exposed before.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> In communities living in the higher altitudes in [[Africa]] and [[South America]], people are at now at a higher risk for developing malaria because of increase in the average temperature of the surroundings. This is a severe problem because people in these communities have never been exposed to this disease, causing an increased risk for complications from malaria such as cerebral malaria (a type of malaria that causes mental disability, paralysis and has a high mortality rate) and death by the disease.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> Residents of these communities are being hit hard by malaria because they are unfamiliar with it; they do not know the signs and symptoms and have little to no immunity.

The population at risk of malaria in the absence of climate change is projected to double between 1990 and 2080 to 8820 million, however; unmitigated climate change would, by the 2080s, further increase the population at risk of malaria by another 257 to 323 million.<ref name=Goklany>{{Cite journal |first1=Indur M. |last1=Goklany |first2=Sir David A. |last2=King |title=Climate Change and Malaria |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2004 |volume=306 |issue=5693 |pages=55–57 |doi=10.1126/science.306.5693.55|pmid=15459370 |s2cid=29125732 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231205 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> Therefore, reducing the effects of climate change in the present would reduce the total by about 3.5%, saving tens of thousands of lives worldwide.

If there is a slight discrepancy in the normal temperature, the perfect conditions for the insects to multiply are created. People that have never been infected before are unknowingly at risk for this deadly disease and do not have the immunity to combat it.<ref name="The Mosquito's Bite" /> An increase in temperature has the potential to cause a widespread [[epidemic]] of the disease that has the capacity to wipe out entire populations of people. It is important to track the prevalence, species and number of insects carrying the disease as well as the number of humans infected in countries and places that have never seen malaria before. It is simple for the slightest of fluctuation in temperature to cause a catastrophic epidemic that has the possibility to end the lives of many innocent and unsuspecting people.<ref name= commonwealth/>

====Dengue fever====

[[Dengue fever]] is an infectious disease caused by [[dengue virus]]es known to be in the tropical regions.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue">{{cite web |title=Dengue and Severe Dengue, Fact Sheet |work=Media Centre |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2012}}</ref>   It is transmitted by the mosquito [[Aedes]], or A. aegypti.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Simmon |first1=Cameron |last2=Farrar |first2=Jeremy J. |last3=Chau |first3=Nguyen van Vinh |last4=Wills |first4=Bridget |title=Dengue |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |date=12 April 2012 |volume=366 |issue=15 |pages=1423–1432 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1110265 |pmid=22494122|url=http://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/11343/191104/1/Current%20Concepts%20-%20Dengue.pdf |hdl=11343/191104 }}</ref>

The cases of dengue fever have increased dramatically since the 1970s and it continues to become more prevalent.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue" /> The greater incidence of this disease is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gubler |first=DJ |title=Human and Medical Virology: Dengue Viruses |editor-last1=Mahy |editor-first1=Brian W.J. |editor-last2=van Regenmortel |editor-first2=Marc H.V. |encyclopedia=Desk Encyclopedia of Human and Medical Virology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsh48WKIbhQC&pg=PA372 |year=2010 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-378559-6 |pages=372–382}}</ref> The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of [[dengue hemorrhagic fever]]. There are four different types of viruses in dengue fever. If someone is infected with one type of dengue virus, he or she will have permanent immunity to that type of dengue virus, but will have short term immunity to the other type of dengue fever.<ref name="Dengue and Severe Dengue" /> Some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and skin rash.<ref name=denguefever>{{cite web |title=Dengue Fever |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002350/ |publisher=National Institutes of Health |access-date=24 November 2012}}</ref> There is no vaccine for dengue fever right now and there is no true treatment to get rid of it, but there are treatments to assist with some of the work of dengue, such as the use of oral or intravenous fluids for rehydration.<ref name=denguefever/>

Dengue fever used to be considered a [[tropical disease]], but [[climate change]] is causing dengue fever to spread. Dengue fever is transmitted by certain types of [[mosquitoes]], which have been spreading further and further north. This is because some of the climate changes that are occurring are increased heat, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] which create prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4/page/69 69]–71}}</ref> The hotter and wetter a climate is, the faster the mosquitoes can mature and the faster the disease can develop. Another influence is the changing [[El Nino]] effects that are affecting the climate to change in different areas of the world, causing dengue fever to be able to spread.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hopp |first1=Marianne J. |last2=Foley |first2=Jonathan A. |title=Global-Scale Relationships Between Climate and the Dengue Fever Vector, Aedes Aegypti |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |date=February 2001 |volume=48 |issue=2/3 |pages=441–463 |doi=10.1023/a:1010717502442|s2cid=150524898 }}</ref>

There are many things that can be done, both on a governmental level and on an individual basis. One improvement would be having a better system of detecting when dengue outbreaks may happen. This can be done by monitoring environments, such as temperatures, rainfall and humidity that would be attractive to these types of mosquitoes and help them to flourish. Another useful plan is to educate the public by letting them know when a dengue outbreak is occurring and what they can do to protect themselves. For example, people should create a living environment that is not attractive to mosquitoes (no standing water), dress in appropriate clothing (light colours, long sleeves), and wear insect repellent.

"Some 1.8 billion (more than 70%) of the population at risk for dengue worldwide live in member states of the WHO South-East Asia Region and Western Pacific Region, which bear nearly 75% of the current global disease burden due to dengue. The Asia Pacific Dengue Strategic Plan for both regions (2008--2015) has been prepared in consultation with member countries and development partners in response to the increasing threat from dengue, which is spreading to new geographical areas and causing high mortality during the early phase of outbreaks.

[[Leishmaniasis]] is a [[Neglected tropical diseases|neglected tropical disease]], caused by parasites of the genus ''[[Leishmania]]'' and transmitted by [[Sandfly|sandflies]]; it is distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, wherever the sand fly vector and reservoir hosts are present.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Report on Global Surveillance of Epidemic-prone Infectious Diseases - Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/CSR_ISR_2000_1leish/en/|access-date=25 November 2020|website=World Health Organization}}</ref> The disease can manifest in several ways depending on the infecting species of parasite: in [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]], ulcers develop on the skin often leaving [[Social stigma|stigmatizing]] scars, while in [[visceral leishmaniasis]] parasites invade internal organs and can be fatal if untreated.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=March 2020|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leishmaniasis|access-date=25 November 2020|website=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Burza|first1=S|last2=Croft|first2=S|last3=Boelaert|first3=M|date=September 2018|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31204-2/fulltext|journal=The Lancet|volume=392|issue=10151|pages=951–970|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31204-2|pmid=30126638|s2cid=208790410|via=Elsevier}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates 12 million people around the world are living with leishmaniasis,<ref name=":2" /> and the [[Risk factor|risk factors]] for this disease include poverty,<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Alvar|first1=J|last2=Yactayo|first2=S|last3=Bern|first3=C|date=2006|title=Leishmaniasis and poverty|url=https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922(06)00239-X|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=22|issue=12|pages=552–557|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2006.09.004|pmid=17023215|via=Cell Press}}</ref> urbanization,<ref name=":3" /> deforestation,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=de Almeida Rodrigues|first1=Maria Gabriela|last2=de Brito Sousa|first2=Jose Diego|last3= Barros Dias|first3=Adila Lilianes|last4=Monteiro|first4=Wuelton Marcelo|last5=de Souza Sampaio|first5=Vanderson|date=2019|title=The role of deforestation on American cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence: spatial-temporal distribution, environmental and socioeconomic factors associated in the Brazilian Amazon|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tmi.13196|journal=Tropical Medicine and International Health|volume=24|issue=3|pages=348–355|doi=10.1111/tmi.13196|pmid=30578585|s2cid=58488789}}</ref> and climate change.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=González|first1=Camila|last2=Wang|first2=Ophelia|last3=Strutz|first3=Stavana E.|last4=González-Salazar|first4=Constantino|last5= Sánchez-Cordero|first5=Víctor|last6=Sarkar|first6=Sahotra Sarkar|date=January 2010|title=Climate Change and Risk of Leishmaniasis in North America: Predictions from Ecological Niche Models of Vector and Reservoir Species|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=4|issue=1|page=e585|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000585|pmid=20098495|pmc=2799657}}</ref>

As in other [[Vector-borne disease|vector-borne diseases]], one of the reasons climate change can affect the incidence of leishmaniasis is the susceptibility of the sandfly vectors to changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity; these conditions will alter their range of distribution and seasonality.<ref name=":3" /> For example, modelling studies have predicted that climate change will increase suitable conditions for ''[[Phlebotomus]]'' vector species in Central Europe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=D|date=2011|title=Combining climatic projections and dispersal ability: a method for estimating the responses of sandfly vector species to climate change|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22140590/|journal=PLOS Negl Trop Dis|volume=5|issue=11|pages=e1407|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001407|pmid=22140590|pmc=3226457|via=Public Library of Science}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=L.K|last2=Kochmann|first2=J.|last3=Klimpel|first3=S.|last4=Cunze|first4=S.|date=2017|title=Modeling the climatic suitability of leishmaniasis vector species in Europe|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-13822-1|journal=Nature Scientific Reports|volume=7|issue=1|page=13325|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-13822-1|pmid=29042642|pmc=5645347|bibcode=2017NatSR...713325K|via=Springer Nature}}</ref> Another model that looked at the distribution of ''[[Lutzomyia longipalpis]]'', an important visceral leishmaniasis vector, suggested an increased range of this species in the Amazon Basin.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=Influences of climate change on the potential distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis sensu lato (Psychodidae: Phlebotominae)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002075191730200X|journal=International Journal for Parasitology|volume=47|pages=667–674|doi=10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.04.007|via=Elsevier|last1=Peterson|first1=A.

Parasite development inside the sandfly can also be affected by temperature changes. For instance, ''Leishmania peruviana'' infections were lost during sandfly defecation when the infected vector was kept at higher temperatures, whereas in the same experiment ''[[Leishmania infantum]]'' and ''[[Leishmania braziliensis]]'' temperature seemed to make no difference.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hlavacova|first=J.|last2=Votypka|first2=J.|last3=Volf|first3=P.|date=2013|title=The effect of temperature on Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) development in sand flies|journal=Journal of Medical Entomology|volume=50|pages=955–958|doi=10.1603/ME13053}}</ref>
==== Tick borne disease ====
A high humidity of greater than 85% is the best condition for a tick to start and finish its life cycle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Süss|first1=Jochen|last2=Klaus|first2=Christine|last3=Gerstengarbe|first3=Friedrich‐Wilhelm|last4=Werner|first4=Peter C.|date=1 January 2008|title=What Makes Ticks Tick?

Temperature is so important to overall survival that an average monthly minimum temperature of below -7&nbsp;°C in the winter can prevent an area from maintaining established populations.<ref name=":0" />

The effect of climate on the tick life cycle is one of the more difficult projections to make in relation to climate and vector-borne disease. Unlike other vectors, tick life cycles span multiple seasons as they mature from larva to nymph to adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://health2016.globalchange.gov/climate-and-health-assessment/vectorborne-diseases/boxes/life-cycle-blacklegged-ticks-ixodes|title=Life Cycle of Blacklegged Ticks, Ixodes scapularis {{!}} Climate and Health Assessment|last=USGCRP|website=health2016.globalchange.gov|language=en|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> Further, infection and spread of diseases such as Lyme disease happens across the multiple stages adding additional variables to consider. Infection of ticks happen in the larval/nymph stage (after the first blood meal) when they are exposed to borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease), but transmission to humans doesn't occur until the adult stages.

The expansion of tick populations are concurrent with global climatic change. Species distribution models of recent years indicate that the deer tick, known as ''I. scapularis,'' is pushing its distribution to higher latitudes of the Northeastern United States and Canada, as well as pushing and maintaining populations in the South Central and Northern Midwest regions of the United States.<ref name="Esteve-Gassent 38–64">{{Cite journal|last1=Esteve-Gassent|first1=Maria D.|last2=Castro-Arellano|first2=Ivan|last3=Feria-Arroyo|first3=Teresa P.|last4=Patino|first4=Ramiro|last5=Li|first5=Andrew Y.|last6=Medina|first6=Raul F.|last7=Pérez de León|first7=Adalberto A.|last8=Rodríguez-Vivas|first8=Roger Iván|date=May 2016|title=Translating ecology, physiology, biochemistry and population genetics research to meet the challenge of tick and tick-borne diseases in North America|journal=Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=92|issue=1|pages=38–64|doi=10.1002/arch.21327|issn=0739-4462|pmc=4844827|pmid=27062414}}</ref> Climate models project further expansion of tick habit north into Canada as progressing Northwest from the Northeastern United States.

Tick populations are not only spreading wider, but moving to higher elevations. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain wood tick known as ''D. andersoni'' is found along the front range and is want to feed, and consequently infect, human populations with tularemia (''Francisella tularensis''), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (''Rickettsia rickettsii''), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus). A case study testing climatic interaction affecting tick vector (''D. andersoni'') populations in Larimer County, Colorado indicated that an estimated increase of 1.2–2.0&nbsp;°C in summer temperatures would increase tick populations moving 100m upwards in elevation, increasing the range and susceptibility of tick-borne illnesses along the front range.

Initial symptoms of tick-borne infections are generally quite similar to that of other viral illnesses. This includes fever, headache, fatigue, and general malaise. This group of diseases can further be difficult to distinguish early on in the disease process due to these general symptoms in addition to most people (reported around 75%) not realizing they have been bitten or exposed to the tick vector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nadelman|first1=Robert B.|last2=Nowakowski|first2=John|last3=Forseter|first3=Gilda|last4=Goldberg|first4=Neil S.|last5=Bittker|first5=Susan|last6=Cooper|first6=Denise|last7=Aguero-Rosenfeld|first7=Maria|last8=Wormser|first8=Gary P.|date=May 1996|title=The clinical spectrum of early lyme borreliosis in patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(95)99915-9/pdf|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=en|volume=100|issue=5|pages=502–508|doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(95)99915-9|pmid=8644761|issn=0002-9343}}</ref> Unique to early Lyme disease is the development of the classic erythema migrans skin rash, also known as the “bull’s eye” or “target” rash, which occurs in about 80% of people diagnosed with Lyme disease.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Steere|first1=Allen C.|last2=Sikand|first2=Vijay K.|date=12 June 2003|title=The Presenting Manifestations of Lyme Disease and the Outcomes of Treatment|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=348|issue=24|pages=2472–2474|doi=10.1056/nejm200306123482423|pmid=12802042|issn=0028-4793}}</ref> This symptom can be an important distinguishing factor helping to make the diagnosis early.

Regardless of the specific diagnosis (Lyme, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Babesiosis etc.) the key to management and prevention of sequelae is early identification of disease and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. With regard to the effects of a warming world and the expansion of tick populations to previously unexposed areas, adaptive keys to prevention will include expansion of health care infrastructure and pharmacologic availability, as well as education of people and providers as to the risks of disease and preventive measures they can take.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-Chap15_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability|last1=Mimura|first1=Nobuo|last2=Pulwarty|first2=Roger|last3=Duc|first3=Do Minh|last4=Elshinnawy|first4=Ibrahim|last5=Redsteer|first5=Margaret|last6=Huang|first6=He-Qing|last7=Nkem|first7=Johnson|last8=Sanchez Rodriguez|first8=Roberto|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA|pages=869–898}}</ref>

In the face of these expanding threats, strong collaboration between government officials and environmental scientists is necessary for advancing preventive and reactive response measures. Without acknowledging the climate changes that make environments more habitable for disease carriers, policy and infrastructure will lag behind vector borne disease spread.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2018/08/06/21999/disease-bearing-ticks-head-north-weak-government-response-threatens-public-health|title=As disease-bearing ticks head north, weak government response threatens public health|work=Center for Public Integrity|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> The human cost associated with denying climate change science is one that concerns many governments.

==== Coronavirus ====
{{Further|Coronavirus disease 2019}}
According to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] the [[Coronavirus disease 2019]] is [[Zoonotic disease|zoonotic]], e.g., the virus passed from animals to humans. Such diseases are occurring more frequently in the latest decades, due to a number of factors, so, as for now, 75% of all emerging disease are zoonotic. Large part of the causes are environmental. One of the factors is climate change. Quick changes in temperature and humidity facilitate the spread of diseases. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] concludes that: "The most fundamental way to protect ourselves from zoonotic diseases is to prevent destruction of nature. Where ecosystems are healthy and biodiverse, they are resilient, adaptable and help to regulate diseases."<ref>{{cite web |title=Science points to causes of COVID-19 |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/science-points-causes-covid-19 |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |publisher=United Nations |access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref>

In April 2020 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published 2 short videos explaining the link between nature destruction (including from climate change), wildlife trade and [[COVID-19 pandemic]]<ref>{{cite web |title=A message from nature: coronavirus |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/video/message-nature-coronavirus |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How nature can protect us from pandemics |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/video/how-nature-can-protect-us-pandemics |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref> and created a section in its site dedicated to the issue.<ref>{{cite web |title=COVID-19 updates from the United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/covid-19-updates |website=United Nations Environment Programme |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

Part of the causes of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] can be environmental, like [[climate change]] and [[deforestation]]. According to the [[World Bank]] climate change can increase the risk of an epidemic like the coronavirus by a number of ways including by causing deforestation. Deforestation is responsible for 31% of the zoonotic diseases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=BOUKERCHE|first1=SANDRINE|last2=MOHAMMED-ROBERTS|first2=RIANNA|title=Fighting infectious diseases: The connection to climate change|url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/fighting-infectious-diseases-connection-climate-change|access-date=12 June 2020|website=World Banks Blogs|publisher=The World Bank}}</ref>

Climate change can increase migration of animals and connection between them and humans. This can facilitate the transmission of viruses from one animal to another and to humans. Viruses generally learn to coexist with their host and became more dangerous when they pass to another. The increase in humidity can also make the transmission easier,<ref>{{cite news |last1=HARRIS |first1=ROBBIE |title=Coronavirus and Climate Change |url=https://www.wvtf.org/post/coronavirus-and-climate-change?fbclid=IwAR10fGiZ7GexvygV8Ea7_ILMZSlJDw77-Lq56mPk4Q5CYaiocZk7HVR3apw#stream/0 |access-date=1 March 2020 |agency=WVTF |date=6 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus, climate change, and the environment |url=https://www.ehn.org/coronavirus-environment-2645553060.html |website=Environmental Health News |access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> even though there are suggestions that increase in humidity and temperature may decrease the expansion of the pandemic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ferrell |first1=Jesse |title=Analysis of new research paper tying coronavirus to weather |url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-blogs/weathermatrix/analysis-of-new-research-paper-tying-coronavirus-to-weather/703270 |access-date=22 March 2020 |agency=AccuWeather |date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

Climate change reduces the number of animals in populations, what lead to less genetic diversity. Such condition facilitates the spread of viruses. Scientists already linked a number of zoonotic diseases outbreaks to floods and droughts and their frequency will increase with climate change. Also, others impacts of climate change can make societies less stable - more wars, human migration, less effective medical and sanitation systems increase the risk of epidemics.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Sarah |title=Climate change affects everything — even the coronavirus |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/04/15/climate-change-affects-everything-even-coronavirus/?arc404=true |access-date=12 June 2020 |agency=Washington Post |date=15 April 2020}}</ref>

In July 2020 the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] and the [[International Livestock Research Institute]] published a report named: "[[Preventing the next pandemic - Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission]]. The report says that the frequency of zoonotic diseases like the coronavirus is increasing due to a number of causes, generally linked to nature destruction:  "high demand for animal protein, unsustainable agricultural practices and climate change" All those changes the way in which animals and humans interact.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coronavirus: Fear over rise in animal-to-human diseases |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53314432 |access-date=7 July 2020 |agency=BBC |date=6 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Preventing the next pandemic - Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission |url=https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and |website=United Nations Environmental Programm |publisher=United Nations |access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] created a special page dedicated to frequently asked questions about coronavirus and climate change, among other about the link between climate change and the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. On this page it summarized the current knowledge about the issue as follows: "There is no evidence of a direct connection between climate change and the emergence or transmission of COVID-19 disease. As the disease is now well established in the human population, efforts should focus on reducing transmission and treating patients.

However, climate change may indirectly affect the COVID-19 response, as it undermines environmental determinants of health, and places additional stress on health systems. More generally, most emerging infectious diseases, and almost all recent [[pandemics]], originate in [[wildlife]], and there is evidence that increasing human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Strengthening health systems, improved surveillance of infectious disease in wildlife, livestock and humans, and greater protection of [[biodiversity]] and the natural environment, should reduce the risks of future outbreaks of other new diseases."<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Climate change |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-climate-change#:~:text=Will%20climate%20change%20make%20COVID,reducing%20transmission%20and%20treating%20patients. |website=World Health Organiztion |publisher=World Health Organiztion |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref>

==== Extreme heat and disease ====
Increased heat, generated by the buildup of carbon, has been found to help disease-carrying organisms such as mosquitos thrive by producing stable environments for them. A research organization known as Climate Central states “The land area of the U.S. most suitable for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes is projected to increase from 5 percent to about 50 percent by 2100, putting 60 percent of the northeastern U.S.’ population at risk for the diseases carried by this mosquito, including West Nile virus, dengue and Zika.”<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces a Rise in Mosquito 'Disease Danger Days' |url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-faces-a-rise-in-mosquito-disease-danger-days-21903 |website=Climate Central |access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> An outbreak of diseases like the West Nile and Zika virus could trigger a crisis since it would cause severe illness in people as well as birth defects in infants. Less advanced countries would be especially affected as they may have very limited resources to combat an infestation.

==Impact on mental health{{anchor|Mental_health}}==

While the physical health impacts of [[climate change]] are well known, the impact on [[mental health]] has only begun to be recognized in the last decade.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chand |first1=Prabhat Kumar |last2=Murthy |first2=Pratima |title=Climate change and mental health |journal=Regional Health Forum |year=2008 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=43–48 |url=http://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/who44.pdf#page=51}}</ref> According to 2011 in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Clayton & Doherty, concluded that global climate change is bound to have substantial negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, effects which will primarily be felt by vulnerable [[populations]] and those with pre-existing serious [[mental illness]].<ref name=clayton>{{cite journal |last1=Doherty |first1=Susan |last2=Clayton |first2=Thomas J |title=The psychological impacts of global climate change |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |year=2011 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1037/a0023141 |pmid=21553952 |citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8333 }}</ref> Research done by Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom in 2008 found that climate change exposes populations to [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], which negatively impacts mental health in very serious ways.<ref name=berry>{{Cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=Helen|last2=Kathryn|first2=Bowen|last3=Kjellstrom|first3=Tord|title=Climate change and mental health: a causal pathways framework|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=2|pages=123–132|doi=10.1007/s00038-009-0112-0|pmid=20033251|year=2009|s2cid=22561555}}</ref>
Both the Clayton study and the Berry study identify three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change: direct, indirect, and psychosocial.<ref name=clayton/><ref name=berry/> The Clayton study claims that in order to appreciate these impacts on psychological wellbeing, one must recognize the different cultural narratives associated with climate change, as well as how climate change and global phenomena like increased population, are interrelated. Climate change does not impact everyone equally; those of lower [[economic]] and social status are at greater risk and experience more devastating impacts.<ref name=clayton/> A 2018 study of CDC data connected temperature rise to increased numbers of suicides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/817731002|publisher=USA Today|year=2018|title=Global warming risk: Rising temperatures from climate change linked to rise in suicides}}</ref> The study revealed that hotter days could increase suicide rates and could cause approximately 26,000 more suicides in the U.S. by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/high-temperatures-cause-suicide-rates-to-increase/565826/|title=Climate Change May Cause 26,000 More U.S. Suicides by 2050|website=The Atlantic|date=23 July 2018}}</ref>

=== Direct impacts ===
Direct impacts on mental health happen when a [[community]] experiences [[extreme weather]] and changed [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref name=clayton/> 
Direct impacts like landscape changes, impaired [[place attachment]], and [[psychological trauma]] are all immediate and localized problems resulting from extreme weather events and environmental changes.<ref name=clayton/> Extreme weather events cause negative changes to landscape and [[agriculture]]. This leads to communities facing economic aspects, especially for communities that use agriculture as a main source of income. After economic fall, communities face loss of livelihoods and [[poverty]]. Many communities will also face isolation, alienation, [[grief]], bereavement, and displacement from these effects.<ref name=berry/><ref name=portier>{{cite web|title=Mental Health and Stress-Related Disorders |url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |work=National Institute of Environment Health Services |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |date=1 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421191355/http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/climatereport2010.pdf |archive-date=21 April 2012 }}</ref> Individuals will have an increased rate of [[anxiety]] and emotional stress. The rate of effects on mental health increases in already-vulnerable communities.<ref name=portier/> Clayton reinforces that the more powerful the extreme weather event, and the more frequent these weather events are, the more damage is done to the mental health of the community.<ref name=clayton/>
Some of the extreme weather events responsible for these mental health changes include wildfires,<ref name=portier/> earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods,<ref name=berry/> and extreme heat.<ref name=worldhealth>{{cite web|last1=World Health Organization|title=Climate change and health|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs266/en/|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

A study published in April 2020 found that by the end of the 21st century people could be exposed to [[Climate change mitigation|avoidable]] indoor CO2 levels of up to 1400 ppm, which would be triple the amount commonly experienced outdoors today and, according to the authors, may [[Carbon dioxide#Toxicity|cut humans' basic decision-making ability indoors by ~25% and complex strategic thinking by ~50%]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rising carbon dioxide levels will make us stupider |journal=Nature |date=20 April 2020 |volume=580 |issue=7805 |pages=567 |doi=10.1038/d41586-020-01134-w |pmid=32317783 |bibcode=2020Natur.580Q.567. |s2cid=216075495 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rising CO2 causes more than a climate crisis—it may directly harm our ability to think |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-04-co2-climate-crisisit-ability.html |access-date=17 May 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Karnauskas |first1=Kristopher B. |last2=Miller |first2=Shelly L. |last3=Schapiro |first3=Anna C. |title=Fossil Fuel Combustion Is Driving Indoor CO2 Toward Levels Harmful to Human Cognition |journal=GeoHealth |date=2020 |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=e2019GH000237 |doi=10.1029/2019GH000237 |pmid=32426622 |pmc=7229519 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Indirect impacts ===
Indirect impacts on mental health occur via impacts on physical health and community well-being. Physical health and mental health have a reciprocal relationship.<ref name=berry/> If the physical health of an individual is negatively impacted, the decline in mental health will soon follow.<ref name=berry/> These impacts are more gradual and cumulative. They are threats to emotional wellbeing through concern and uncertainty about future risks.<ref name="clayton"/> They are also large-scale community and social effects, like conflicts related to [[Human migration|migration]] and subsequent shortages or adjustment after a disaster. Extreme weather events play a major role here; their impacts can be indirect, not just direct.<ref name=berry/> This is due to the effect on physical health from extreme weather events. Each extreme weather event affects humans in different ways, but they all lead to the decline of mental health.<ref name=berry/>
[[Heat]] indirectly causes mental health issues through physical health issues. The World Health Organization presents the fact that high extreme heat is directly related to certain ailments like [[cardiovascular disease]], [[respiratory disease]], and [[asthma]]. One piece of their evidence is that in summer 2003, during Europe's big heat wave, there were 70,000 recorded deaths related to the heat.<ref name=worldhealth/> Heat exhaustion also occurs during extreme heat. As climate change continues, heat will continue to rise and these problems will exacerbate. These physical problems lead to mental health problems. As physical health worsens and is less curable, mental stability starts to deteriorate.<ref name=berry/>

As extreme heat makes landscapes dry, nature is more prone to fire. Research shows that rising heat due to climate change has caused an increase in fires around the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westerling|first1=Anthony|title=Increasing western US forest wildfire activity: sensitivity to changes in the timing of spring|url=http://ulmo.ucmerced.edu/pdffiles/16RSTB_Westerling.pdf|publisher=University of California}}</ref> [[Burn]]s and smoke inhalation from the increasing number of fires lead to a decline in physical health, which leads to mental health problems. Deaths of family and friends cause individuals to suffer from stress and other conditions. Many suffering from loss of family and friends will internalize their emotions, feel extreme guilt and helplessness, and become paranoid. Others will develop fear of future loss and have an overall displacement of feelings that could last for years.<ref name=bowlby>{{Cite journal|last1=Lorna|first1=Bowlby-West|title=The impact of death on the family system|journal=Journal of Family Therapy|volume=5|issue=3|pages=279–294|doi=10.1046/j..1983.00623.x|year=1983}}</ref> Anderson published research in the American Psychological Association that shows the increase in murders in the United States directly correlates with the temperature increase. For every one-degree [[Fahrenheit]], there will be nine more murders in the country, which leads to an additional 24,000 murders or assaults per year in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/abstracts/2000-2004/01A.pdf|title=Heat and Violence|last=Anderson|first=C|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2001|location=Iowa|pages=33–38}}</ref>

There is also an increased risk in [[suicide]] in communities that suffer from extreme weather events. Studies show that suicide rates increase after extreme weather events. This is evidence for the decline in mental health.<ref name=epstein>{{cite book |last1=Epstein |first1=Paul R. |last2=Ferber |first2=Dan |title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it |url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4 |url-access=registration |year=2011 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> The increased suicide risk has been demonstrated in [[Australia]], where [[drought]] has resulted in [[crop]] failures and despair to the Australian countryside. After the event, farmers were left with almost nothing. They were forced to sell their belongings, reduce their stock, and borrow large sums of money to plant crops at the start of the next season.<ref name=epstein/> These consequences have caused a growing increase in [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[domestic violence]], and suicide. More than one hundred farmers in the Australian countryside had committed suicide by 2007.<ref name=epstein/> An individual's suicide often leads to mental health problems of loved ones. They face issues like those who have lost loved ones due to fire: grief, sadness, anger, [[paranoia]], and others.<ref name=bowlby/>

Some impacts pertaining to mental health are even more gradual and cumulative than the others, like [[Social relation|social interaction]], [[media (communication)|media]], and [[communication]].<ref name=clayton/> The social interaction between communities and within communities is greatly affected by migration. Communities choose to migrate, or are forced to migrate, due to stressors on limited resources. This is worsened by extreme weather events caused by climate change.<ref name=portier/> Common mental health conditions associated indirectly from these extreme weather events include [[Acute stress reaction|acute traumatic stress]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[complicated grief]], [[anxiety disorders]], sleep difficulties, and [[sexual dysfunction]]. [[Substance abuse|Drug abuse]] and [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] are also common aftereffects, and can lead to both physical and mental issues, [[addiction]] and substance reliance being the most common.<ref name=portier/>

The effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]], a past extreme weather event in [[New Orleans]], lead to a variety of mental health problems due to the destruction of resources<ref name=epstein/> Many people impacted by Hurricane Katrina were left [[homeless]], disenfranchised, stressed, and suffering physical illness. This strain on the [[public health]] system decreased access and availability of medical resources.<ref name=epstein/> Some [[climate change adaptation]] measures may prevent the need for displacement. However, some communities may be unable to implement adaptation strategies, and this will create added stress, further exacerbating already existing mental health issues.<ref name=portier/>  Extreme weather events and population displacement lead to limited availability of [[medications]], one of the primary resources required to meet psychological and physical needs of those affected by such events. Less medication and medical resources means fewer people can get the help they need to recover. Slowed recovery and lack of recovery worsen overall mental health.<ref name=portier/>

=== Psychological impacts ===
Psychological impacts are the effects that heat, [[drought]], migrations, and climate-related conflicts have on social life and community life. This includes post-disaster adjustment.<ref name=clayton/> Most of these effects are indirect instead of direct, but Clayton and Berry place them in a separate category because they deal with the relationships within a community.<ref name=berry/><ref name=clayton/> Many of the results are from how people use and occupy territory.<ref name=clayton/> Human migration of large communities causes discord within those communities because the already scarce resources are even more limited during migration.<ref name=portier/> Agriculture is severely impacted by the extreme weather events of climate change, the suitability of territory being the most notable kind of change.<ref name=clayton/> During and after migration, the geographical distribution of populations is altered.<ref name=clayton/> Children and parents may be separated at these times. The early separation of children from their parents can cause symptoms of grieving, depression, and detachment in both the young and old.<ref name=bowlby/>

The loss in resources can also lead to inter-community violence and aggression. Two groups may fight over remaining [[natural resources]]. A community may choose to migrate to find better resources, and encroach on another community's territory, either accidentally or purposefully.<ref name=clayton/> Civil unrest can occur when [[governments]] fail to adequately protect communities against the extreme weather events that cause these effects. When this happens, individuals lose confidence and trust in their government. A loss in trust can be the beginning of oncoming mental health problems.<ref name=bowlby/><ref>{{cite report |last=Abbott |first=Chris |title=An Uncertain Future: Law Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change |publisher=Oxford Research Group |date=January 2008 |url=http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/sites/default/files/uncertainfuture.pdf}}</ref> The disruption of a community when they are forced to relocate results in the deterioration of geographic and social connections. This leads to grief, anxiety, and an overall sense of loss.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Donald R. |last2=West |first2=Colin Thor |last3=Finan |first3=Timothy J. |title=Introduction to "In focus: Global change and adaptation in local places." |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |date=September 2009 |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=271–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01131.x}}</ref>

==Impact on natural resources==

===Drinking water===
[[Global Health Corps]] reports that when interruptions in the regular water supply, "forces rural and impoverished families to resort to drinking the dirty, sediment-and-parasite-laden water that sits in puddles and small pools on the surface of the earth."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghcorps.org/a-deadly-dinner-2/|title=A Deadly Dinner {{!}} Global Health Corps|website=ghcorps.org|access-date=6 August 2019}}</ref> Many are aware of the presence of contamination, but will drink from these sources nonetheless in order to avoid dying of dehydration. It has been estimated that up to 80% of human illness in the [[Developing country|developing world]] can be attributed to contaminated water.
<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2003/sgsm8707.doc.htm |title='Water-Related Diseases Responsible For 80 Per Cent Of All Illnesses, Deaths In Developing World', Says Secretary-General In Environment Day Message |access-date=6 August 2019
|date=16 May 2003|website=www.un.org}}</ref>

When there is an adequate amount of drinking water, humans drink from different sources than their livestock. However, when drought occurs and drinking water slowly disappears, catchment areas such as streams and depressions in the ground where water gathers are often shared between people and the livestock they depend on for financial and nutritional support, and this is when humans can fall seriously ill. Although some diseases that are transferred to humans can be prevented by boiling the water, many people, living on just a litre or two of water per day, refuse to boil, as it loses a certain percentage of the water to steam.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reports: Drought-Stricken Somalis Dying From Contaminated Water |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=31 October 2009 |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2006-03-22-voa28/324586.html}}</ref>

The sharing of water between livestock and humans is one of the most common factors in the transmission of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). NTM is carried in cattle and pig feces, and if this contaminates the drinking water supply, it can result in pulmonary disease, disseminated disease or localized lesions in humans with both compromised and competent immune systems.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Clovice |last1=Kankya |first2=Adrian |last2=Muwonge |first3=Berit |last3=Djønne |first4=Musso |last4=Munyeme |first5=John |last5=Opuda-Asibo |first6=Eystein |last6=Skjerve |first7=James |last7=Oloya |first8=Vigdis |last8=Edvardsen |first9=Tone B |last9=Johansen |display-authors=3 |title=Isolation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria from pastoral ecosystems of Uganda: Public Health significance |journal=BMC Public Health |date=16 May 2011 |volume=11 |issue=320 |pages=320 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-11-320 |pmid=21575226 |pmc=3123205}}</ref> During drought, water supplies are even more susceptible to harmful algal blooms and microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/health/climate/drought.asp |title=NRDC: Climate Change Threatens Health: Drought |work=nrdc.org}}</ref>  Algal blooms increase water turbidity, suffocating aquatic plants, and can deplete oxygen, killing fish. Some kinds of blue-green algae create neurotoxins, hepatoxins, cytotoxins or endotoxins that can cause serious and sometimes fatal neurological, liver and digestive diseases in humans. Cyanobacteria grow best in warmer temperatures (especially above 25 degrees Celsius), and so areas of the world that are experiencing general warming as a result of climate change are also experiencing harmful algal blooms more frequently and for longer periods of time. During times of intense precipitation (such as during the “wet season” in much of the tropical and sub-tropical world, including Australia and Panama), nutrients that cyanobacteria depend on are carried from groundwater and the earth's surface into bodies of water. As drought begins and these bodies gradually dry up, the nutrients are concentrated, providing the perfect opportunity for algal blooms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Hans W. |last1=Paerl |first2=Jef |last2=Huisman |title=Blooms Like It Hot |journal=Science |date=4 April 2008 |volume=320 |issue=5872 |pages=57–58 |doi=10.1126/science.1155398 |pmid=18388279 |citeseerx=10.1.1.364.6826 |s2cid=142881074 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) Blooms |work=California Department of Public Health |date=18 September 2013 |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx |access-date=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115131056/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/environhealth/water/Pages/bluegreenalgae.aspx |archive-date=15 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. Faces Era Of Water Scarcity |work=WaterNews |publisher=Circle of Blue |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2008/world/us-faces-era-of-water-scarcity/}}</ref>

===Fresh water===
As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. [[Freshwater]] resources are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate. Climate change is projected to affect water availability.  In areas where the amount of water in rivers and streams depends on snow melting, warmer temperatures increase the fraction of precipitation falling as rain rather than as snow, causing the annual spring peak in water runoff to occur earlier in the year. This can lead to an increased likelihood of winter [[flood]]ing and reduced late summer river flows. Rising sea levels cause saltwater to enter into fresh [[underground water]] and freshwater streams. This reduces the amount of freshwater available for drinking and farming. Warmer water temperatures also affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kathleen |last=Miller |title=Climate Change Impacts on Water |work=Climate Change and Water Research |publisher=Institute for the Study of Society and Environment (ISSE) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research |access-date=12 August 2016 |url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031172136/http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html |archive-date=31 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Impact on livestock==
Climate change is beginning to lead the global population into a food shortage, greatly affecting our [[livestock]] supply. Although the change in our climate is causing us to lose food, these sources are also contributing to climate change, essentially, creating a [[feedback loop]]. [[Greenhouse gases]], specifically from livestock, are one of the leading sources furthering global warming; these emissions, which drastically effect climatic change, are also beginning to harm our livestock in ways we could never imagine.

===Greenhouse gas effects===
Our agricultural food system is responsible for a significant amount of the greenhouse-gas emissions that are produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |title=The Food Gap: The Impacts of Climate Change on Food Production: a 2020 Perspective |date=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416214231/http://www.feu-us.org/images/The_Food_Gap.pdf |archive-date=16 April 2012 }}</ref><ref name=strategies>{{Cite journal |first1=Sharon |last1=Friel |first2=Alan D. |last2=Dangour |first3=Tara |last3=Garnett |first4=Karen |last4=Lock |first5=Zaid |last5=Chalabi |first6=Ian |last6=Roberts |first7=Ainslie |last7=Butler |first8=Colin D. |last8=Butler |first9=Jeff |last9=Waage |first10=Anthony J. |last10=McMichael |first11=Andy |last11=Haines |display-authors=3 |title=Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and agriculture |journal=The Lancet |year=2009 |volume=374 |issue=9706 |pages=2016–2025 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61753-0|pmid=19942280 |s2cid=6318195 }}</ref>

According to the [[IPCC]], it makes up between, at least, 10-12% of the emissions, and when there are changes in land due to the agriculture, it can even rise as high as 17%. More specifically, emissions from farms, such as [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]], are the main culprits, and can be held accountable for up to half of the greenhouse-gases produced by the overall food industry, or 80% of all emissions just within agriculture.<ref name="strategies" />

The types of farm animals, as well as the food they supply can be put into two categories: [[monogastric]] and [[ruminant]]. Typically, beef and dairy, in other words, ruminant products, rank high in greenhouse-gas emissions; monogastric, or pigs and poultry-related foods, are low. The consumption of the monogastric types, therefore, yield less emissions. This is due to the fact that these types of animals have a higher feed-conversion efficiency, and also do not produce any methane.<ref name="strategies" />

As lower-income countries begin, and continue, to develop, the necessity for a consistent meat supply will increase.<ref name="strategies" /><ref name=impact>{{Cite journal |first1=P.K. |last1=Thornton |first2=J. |last2=van de Steeg |first3=A. |last3=Notenbaert |first4=M. |last4=Herrero |title=The impacts of climate change on livestock and livestock systems in developing countries: A review of what we know and what we need to know |journal=Agricultural Systems |year=2009 |volume=101 |issue=3 |pages=113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.agsy.2009.05.002}}</ref> This means the cattle population will be required to grow in order to keep up with the demand, producing the highest possible rate of greenhouse-gas emissions.<ref name="strategies" />

There are many strategies that can be used to help soften the effects, and the further production of greenhouse-gas emissions. Some of these strategies include a higher efficiency in livestock farming, which includes management, as well as technology; a more effective process of managing manure; a lower dependence upon fossil-fuels and nonrenewable resources; a variation in the animals' eating and drinking duration, time and location; and a cutback in both the production and consumption of animal-sourced foods.<ref name="strategies" /><ref name="impact" /><ref>{{cite report |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kurukulasuriya |first2=Shane |last2=Rosenthal |title=Climate Change and Agriculture: A Review of Impacts and Adaptions |publisher=[[World Bank]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/~c-ciarn/documents/World_Bank_Paper.pdf}}</ref><ref name=who>{{cite report |first1=A.J. |last1=McMichael |first2=D.H. |last2=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=C.F. |last3=Corvalán |first4=K.L. |last4=Ebi |first5=A.K. |last5=Githeko |first6=J.D. |last6=Scheraga |first7=A. |last7=Woodward |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2003 |isbn=92-4-156248-X |url=https://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/climchange.pdf}}</ref>

===Heat stress===
[[Heat stress]] on livestock has a devastating effect on not only their growth and reproduction, but their food intake and production of dairy and meat. Cattle require a temperature range of 5-15 degrees Celsius, but upwards to 25&nbsp;°C, to live comfortably, and once climate change increases the temperature, the chance of these changes occurring increases.<ref name="impact" /> Once the high temperatures hit, the livestock struggle to keep up their metabolism, resulting in decreased food intake, lowered activity rate, and a drop in weight. This causes a decline in livestock productivity and can be detrimental to the farmers and consumers. Obviously, the location and species of the livestock varies and therefore the effects of heat vary between them. This is noted in livestock at a higher elevation and in the [[tropics]], of which have a generally increased effect from climate change. Livestock in a higher elevation are very vulnerable to high heat and are not well adapted to those changes.

==Impact on plant based food==
[[Climate change]] has many potential impacts on the production of food crops—from [[food scarcity]] and nutrient deficiency to possible increased food production because of elevated [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] levels—all of which directly affect [[human health]]. Part of this variability in possible outcomes is from the various [[climate change model]]s used to project potential impacts; each model takes into account different factors and so come out with a slightly different result.<ref name=Hertel>{{cite journal |last1=Hertel |first1=Thomas W. |last2=Rosch |first2=Stephanie D. |title=Climate Change, Agriculture, and Poverty |journal=[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]] |date=June 2010 |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=355–385 |doi=10.1093/aepp/ppq016|hdl=10986/3949 |s2cid=55848822 |url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/91437/files/Hertel_et_al._IATRC_Summer_2010.pdf }}</ref> A second problem comes from the fact that projections are made based on historical data which is not necessarily helpful in accurate forecasting as changes are occurring exponentially.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein">{{cite book|last1=Epstein|first1=Paul R.|last2=Ferber|first2=Dan|title=Changing Planet, Changing Health: How the Climate Crisis Threatens Our Health and what We Can Do about it|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c1j4|url-access=registration|year=2011|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26909-5}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref><ref name=Kul>{{cite journal |last=Kulshreshtha |first=Surendra N. |title=Climate Change, Prairie Agriculture and Prairie Economy: The new normal |journal=Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=March 2011 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=19–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01211.x}}</ref> As such, there are many different possible impacts—both positive and negative—that may result from climate change affecting global regions in different ways.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Canada>{{cite report |editor1-first=Donald S. |editor1-last=Lemmen |editor2-first=Fiona J. |editor2-last=Warren |title=Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective |publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] |date=2004 |isbn= 0-662-33123-0 |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/27428.pdf}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref>

===Food scarcity===
Food scarcity is a major key for many populations and is one of the prominent concerns with the changing climate. Currently, 1/6 of the [[global population]] are without adequate food supply.<ref name=Beddington>{{cite journal |last1=Beddington |first1=John R. |last2=Asaduzzaman |first2=Mohammed |last3=Clark |first3=Megan E. |last4=Bremauntz |first4=Adrian Fernández |last5=Guillou |first5=Marion D |last6=Jahn |first6=Molly M. |last7=Lin |first7=Erda |last8=Mamo |first8=Tekalign |last9=Negra |first9=Christine |last10=Nobre |first10=Carlos A. |last11=Scholes |first11=Robert J. |last12=Sharma |first12=Rita |last13=Van Bo |first13=Nguyen |last14=Wakhungu |first14=Judi |display-authors=3 |title=The role for scientists in tackling food insecurity and climate change |journal=Agriculture & Food Security |year=2012 |volume=1 |issue=10 |pages=10 |doi=10.1186/2048-7010-1-10|doi-access=free }}</ref> By 2050, the global population is projected to reach 9 billion requiring global food productions to increase by 50% to meet population demand.<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Chakra>{{cite journal |last1=Chakraborty |first1=S. |last2=Newton |first2=A.

===Extreme weather===

====Rising temperatures====
As the [[temperature]] changes and weather patterns become more extreme, areas which were historically good for farmland will no longer be as amicable.<ref name=Connor>{{cite journal |last1=Connor |first1=Jeffery D. |last2=Schwabe |first2=Kurt |last3=King |first3=Darran |last4=Knapp |first4=Keith |title=Irrigated agriculture and climate change: The influence of water supply variability and salinity on adaptation |journal=[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] |date=May 2012 |volume=77 |pages=149–157 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.021}}</ref><ref name=Sindhu>{{cite journal |last=Sindhu |first=J.S. |title=Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |journal=Indian Journal of Science and Technology |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=348–353 |doi=10.17485/ijst/2011/v4i3.32 |issn=0974-6846 |url=http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/view/29998/25953|doi-access=free }}</ref> The current prediction is for temperature increase and precipitation decrease for major [[arid]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions ([[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Southwest United States]], and [[Southern Europe]]).<ref name=Connor/><ref name=Tubiello>{{cite journal |last1=Tubiello |first1=Francesco N. |last2=Rosenzweig |first2=Cynthia |title=Developing climate change impact metrics for agriculture |journal=The Integrated Assessment Journal |year=2008 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=165–184 |url=http://journals.sfu.ca/int_assess/index.php/iaj/article/viewFile/276/240}}</ref> In addition, crop yields in [[tropical regions]] will be negatively affected by the projected moderate increase in temperature (1-2&nbsp;°C) expected to occur during the first half of the century.<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana">{{cite journal |last1=Tubiello |first1=Francesco N. |last2=Soussana |first2=Jean-François |first3= S.

There are, however, some positive possible aspects to climate change as well. The projected increase in temperature during the first half of the century (1-3&nbsp;°C) is expected to benefit crop and pasture yields in the [[temperate region]]s.<ref name=Hertel/><ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/><ref name="Tubiello & Van der Velde">{{cite report |last1=Tubiello |first1=F.N. |last2=van der Velde |first2=M. |title=Land and water use options for climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture |work=SOLAW Background Thematic Report - TR04A |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/solaw/files/thematic_reports/TR_04a_web.pdf}}</ref> This will lead to higher winter temperatures and more frost-free days in these regions; resulting in a longer [[growing season]], increased thermal resources and accelerated maturation.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Canada/> If the climate scenario results in mild and wet weather, some areas and crops will suffer, but many may benefit from this.<ref name=Hertel/>

====Drought and flood====
Extreme weather conditions continue to decrease crop yields in the form of [[droughts]] and [[floods]]. While these weather events are becoming more common, there is still uncertainty and therefore a lack of preparedness as to when and where they will take place.<ref name=Canada/><ref name=Kristjanson>{{cite journal |last1=Kristjanson |first1=Patti |last2=Neufeldt |first2=Henry |last3=Gassner |first3=Anja |last4=Mango |first4=Joash |last5=Kyazze |first5=Florence B. |last6=Desta |first6=Solomon |last7=Sayula |first7=George |last8=Thiede |first8=Brian |last9=Förch |first9=Wiebke |last10=Thornton |first10=Pphilip K. |last11=Coe |first11=Richard |display-authors=3 |title=Are food insecure smallholder households making changes in their farming practices? Evidence from East Africa |journal=Food Security |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=381–397 |doi=10.1007/s12571-012-0194-z|doi-access=free }}</ref> In extreme cases, floods destroy crops, disrupting agricultural activities and rendering workers jobless and eliminating food supply. On the opposite end of the spectrum, droughts can also wipe out crops. It is estimated that 35-50% of the world's crops are at risk of drought.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> [[Drought in Australia|Australia]] has been experiencing severe, recurrent droughts for a number of years, bringing serious despair to its farmers. The country's rates of [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[domestic violence]] are increasing and as of 2007, more than one hundred farmers had committed suicide as their thirsty crops slipped away.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> Drought is even more disastrous in the [[developing world]], exacerbating the pre-existing [[poverty]] and fostering [[famine]] and [[malnutrition]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/>

Droughts can cause farmers to rely more heavily on [[irrigation]]; this has downsides for both the individual farmers and the consumers. The equipment is expensive to install and some farmers may not have the financial ability to purchase it.<ref name=Connor/> The water itself must come from somewhere and if the area has been in a drought for any length of time, the rivers may be dry and the water must be transported from further distances. With 70% of “blue water” currently being used for global agriculture, any need over and above this could potentiate a [[water crisis]].<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/>  In [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], water is used to flood [[rice fields]] to control the weed population; with the projection of less precipitation for this area, this historical method of weed control will no longer be possible.<ref name=Rod10>{{cite journal |last1=Rodenburg |first1=Jonne |last2=Riches |first2=Charles R. |last3=Kayeke |first3=Juma M. |title=Addressing current and future problems of parasitic weeds in rice |journal=Crop Protection |year=2010 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2009.10.015}}</ref>

With more costs to the farmer, some will no longer find it financially feasible to farm. [[Agriculture]] employs the majority of the population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker layoffs or pay cuts.<ref name=Hertel/> Other farmers will respond by raising their [[food prices]]; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.<ref name=Beddington/>

===Financial===
Some research suggests that initially climate change will help developing nations because some regions will be experiencing more negative climate change effects which will result in increased demand for food leading to higher prices and increased wages.<ref name=Hertel/> However, many of the projected [[climate change scenario|climate scenarios]] suggest a huge financial burden. For example, the [[2003 European heat wave|heat wave that passed through Europe in 2003]] cost 13 billion euros in uninsured agriculture losses.<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana"/> In addition, during [[El Nino]] weather conditions, the chance of the Australian farmer's income falling below average increased by 75%, greatly impacting the country's [[GDP]].<ref name="Tubiello & Soussana"/> The agriculture industry in [[India]] makes up 52% of their employment and the [[Canadian Prairies]] supply 51% of Canadian agriculture; any changes in the production of food crops from these areas could have profound effects on the [[economy]].<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Sindhu/> This could negatively affect the affordability of food and the subsequent health of the population.

===Pests and pathogens===
Currently, {{CO2}} levels are 40% higher than they were in [[pre-industrial agriculture|pre-industrial]] times.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> This diminishes nutritional content for both human and insect consumption. Studies have shown that when {{CO2}} levels rise, [[soybean]] leaves are less nutritious; therefore plant-eating beetles have to eat more to get their required [[nutrients]].<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> In addition, soybeans are less capable of defending themselves against the predatory insects under high {{CO2}}. The {{CO2}} diminishes the plant's [[jasmonic acid]] production, an insect-killing poison that is excreted when the plant senses it's being attacked. Without this protection, beetles are able to eat the soybean leaves freely, resulting in a lower crop yield.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> This is not a problem unique to soybeans, and many plant species’ defense mechanisms are impaired in a high {{CO2}} environment.<ref name=Chakra/>

Currently, pathogens take 10-16% of the global harvest and this level is likely to rise as plants are at an ever-increasing risk of exposure to pests and pathogens.<ref name=Chakra/> Historically, cold temperatures at night and in the winter months would kill off [[insects]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. The warmer, wetter winters are promoting fungal plant diseases like [[soybean rust]] to travel northward. Soybean rust is a vicious plant pathogen that can kill off entire fields in a matter of days, devastating farmers and costing billions in agricultural losses. Another example is the [[Mountain Pine Beetle]] epidemic in [[BC, Canada]] which killed millions of pine trees because the winters were not cold enough to slow or kill the growing beetle larvae.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> The increasing incidence of flooding and heavy rains also promotes the growth of various other plant pests and diseases.<ref name=Rod11>{{cite journal |last1=Rodenburg |first1=J. |last2=Meinke |first2=H. |last3=Johnson |first3=D. E. |title=Challenges for weed management in African rice systems in a changing climate |journal=[[The Journal of Agricultural Science]] |date=August 2011 |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=427–435 |doi=10.1017/S0021859611000207|url=http://ecite.utas.edu.au/69596 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> On the opposite end of the spectrum, drought conditions favour different kinds of pests like [[aphids]], [[whiteflies]] and [[locusts]].<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/>

The competitive balance between plants and pests has been relatively stable for the past century, but with the rapidly shifting climate, there is a change in this balance which often favours the more biologically diverse [[weed]]s over the [[monocropping|monocrops]] most farms consist of.<ref name=Rod11/> Currently, weeds claim about one tenth of global crop yields annually as there are about eight to ten weed species in a field competing with crops.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> Characteristics of weeds such as their [[genetic diversity]], cross-breeding ability, and fast-growth rates put them at an advantage in changing climates as these characteristics allow them to adapt readily in comparison to most farm's uniform crops, and give them a biological advantage.<ref name="Ferber & Epstein"/> There is also a shift in the distribution of pests as the altered climate makes areas previously uninhabitable more uninviting.<ref name=Thomson/> Finally, with the increased {{CO2}} levels, [[herbicides]] will lose their efficiency which in turn increases the tolerance of weeds to herbicides.<ref name=Rod11/>

==Impact on nutrition==
	Another area of concern is the effect of climate change on the nutritional content of food for human consumption. Studies show that increasing atmospheric levels of {{CO2}} have an unfavourable effect on the nutrients in plants. As the [[carbon]] concentration in the plant's tissues increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the concentration of [[Chemical element|elements]] such as [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]] and [[iodine]]. Of significant concern is the [[protein]] content of plants, which also decreases in relation to elevating carbon content.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Chakra/><ref name="Effects of CO2">{{cite journal |last1=Taub |first1=Daniel R. |last2=Miller |first2=Brian |last3=Allen |first3=Holly |title=Effects of elevated {{CO2}} on the protein concentration of food crops: a meta-analysis |journal=[[Global Change Biology]] |date=March 2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01511.x}}</ref> 
	
Irakli Loladze explains that the lack of [[essential nutrients]] in crops contributes the problem of [[micronutrient malnutrition]] in society, commonly known as “hidden hunger”; despite adequate caloric intake, the body still is not nutritionally satisfied and therefore continues to be “hungry”.<ref name=Loladze>{{cite journal |last=Loladze |first=Irakli |title=Rising atmospheric {{CO2}} and human nutrition: toward globally imbalanced plant stoichiometry? |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |date=1 October 2002 |volume=17 |pages=457–461 |issue=10 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02587-9}}</ref> This problem is aggravated by the rising cost of food, resulting in a global shift towards diets which are less expensive, but high in [[calories]], [[fat]]s, and animal products. This results in [[undernutrition]] and an increase in [[obesity]] and diet-related [[chronic diseases]].<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Loladze/>
	
Countries worldwide are already impacted by deficiencies in micronutrients and are seeing the effects in the health of their populations. [[Iron deficiency]] affects more than 3.5 billion people; increasing [[maternal mortality]] and hindering [[cognitive development]] in children, leading to education losses. [[Iodine deficiency]] leads to ailments like [[goitre]], [[brain damage]] and [[cretinism]] and is a problem in at least 130 different countries.<ref name=Loladze/> Even though these deficiencies are invisible, they have great potential to impact human health on a global scale.
	
Small increases in {{CO2}} levels can cause a {{CO2}} fertilization effect where the growth and reproduction abilities of [[C3 carbon fixation|C<sub>3</sub>]] plants such as soybeans and [[rice]] are actually enhanced by 10-20% in laboratory experiments. This does not take into account, however, the additional burden of pests, pathogens, nutrients and water affecting the crop yield.<ref name="Effects of CO2"/><ref name=Gregory>{{cite journal |last1=Gregory |first1=Peter J. |last2=Johnson |first2=Scott N. |last3=Newton |first3=Adrian C. |last4=Ingram |first4=John S.I. |title=Integrating pests and pathogens into the climate change/food security debate |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2009 |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=2827–2838 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp080|pmid=19380424 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Adaptation and mitigation strategies==
While researchers acknowledge there are possible [[benefits of global warming]], most agree that the negative consequences of climate change will outweigh any potential benefits and instead the shifting climate will result in more benefits to developed countries and more detriments to developing countries; exacerbating the discrepancy between wealthy and impoverished nations.<ref name=Chakra/><ref name="Fischer & Shah" /><ref name=Gregory/>  By thoughtful and proactive efforts, climate change can be mitigated by addressing these issues with a [[multidisciplinary approach]] that works on a [[Earth|global]], national and community basis that recognizes the uniqueness of each country's situation.<ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Sindhu/> 
	
According to a study of [[East Africa]]’s [[smallholding|smallholder]] farms, impacts of climate change on agriculture are already being seen there resulting in changes to farming practices such as [[intercropping]], crop, soil, land, water and livestock management systems, and introduction of new technologies and seed varieties by some of the farmers.<ref name="Kristjanson"/> Some other suggestions such as eliminating [[supply chain]] and household [[food waste]], encouraging diverse and vegetable-rich diets, and providing global access to foods ([[food aid]] programs) have been suggested as ways to adapt.<ref name=Hertel/><ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Chakra/> Many researchers agree that agricultural innovation is essential to addressing the potential issues of climate change. This includes better management of soil, water-saving technology, matching crops to environments, introducing different crop varieties, crop rotations, appropriate [[fertilization]] use, and supporting community-based adaptation strategies.<ref name=Kul/><ref name=Beddington/><ref name=Sindhu/><ref name=Rod11/><ref name=IFPRI>{{cite report |last1=Nelson |first1=Gerald C. |first2=Mark W. |last2=Rosegrant |first3=Jawoo |last3=Koo |first4=Richard |last4=Robertson |first5=Timothy |last5=Sulser |first6=Tingju |last6=Zhu |first7=Claudia |last7=Ringler |first8=Siwa |last8=Msangi |first9=Amanda |last9=Palazzo |first10=Miroslav |last10=Batka |first11=Marilia |last11=Magalhaes |first12=Rowena |last12=Valmonte-Santos |first13=Mandy |last13=Ewing |first14=David |last14=Lee |display-authors=3 |title=Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation |publisher=[[International Food Policy Research Institute]] |date=October 2009 |location=Washington, DC |url=http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160505014731/http%3A//ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/16557/filename/16558.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  On a government and global level, research and investments into [[agricultural productivity]] and [[infrastructure]] must be done to get a better picture of the issues involved and the best methods to address them.

==Oceans and human health==

===Overview===
Perhaps one of the most recent adverse [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] to be explored is that of [[ocean acidification]]. Our [[oceans]] cover approximately 71 percent of the [[Earth]]'s surface and support a diverse range of [[ecosystems]], which are home to over 50 percent of all the [[species]] on the planet.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web |title=Oceans & Coasts |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |url=http://www.noaa.gov/oceans-coasts |access-date=12 August 2016}}</ref> Oceans regulate [[climate]] and [[weather]] as well as providing [[nutrition]] for a vast variety of species, humans included.<ref name=NOAA/> Covering such an extensive part of the planet has allowed the oceans to absorb a large portion of the [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] from the [[atmosphere]].<ref name=raven99>{{Cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J.A. |last2=Falkowski |first2=P.G. |date=June 1999 |title=Oceanic sinks for atmospheric {{co2}} |journal=[[Plant, Cell & Environment]] | volume=22 | issue=6 | pages=741–755 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1999.00419.x}}</ref> This process is part of the [[carbon cycle]] in which the fluxes of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in Earth's [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]] and [[lithosphere]] are described.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Carbon Cycle |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |access-date=29 November 2012 |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9020247}}</ref> Humans have drastically added to the amount of [[CO2 emissions|carbon dioxide ({{CO2}})]] in the atmosphere through the burning of [[fossil fuels]] and the process of [[deforestation]]. Oceans work as a sink absorbing excess [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}). As the oceans absorb [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) it breaks down into [[carbonic acid]], a mild acid, this neutralizes the normally [[alkaline]] ocean water. As a result, the pH in the oceans is declining. In the research surrounding global climate change we are only just beginning to realize that our oceans can sequester a finite amount of {{CO2}} before we start seeing impacts on marine life that could lead to devastating losses. Acidification of our oceans has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it - from [[extreme weather]] patterns and [[food scarcity]] to a loss of millions of species from the planet - all of these consequences hold the potential to directly affect [[human health]].

===Coral===
With degradation of protective coral reefs through acidic erosion, bleaching and death, salt water is able to infiltrate fresh ground water supplies that large populations depend on.<ref name="atoll">{{cite journal|last1=Terry|first1=James|last2=Chui|first2=Ting Fong May|date=May 2012|title=Evaluating the fate of freshwater lenses on atoll islands after eustatic sea-level rise and cyclone driven inundation: A modelling approach|journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=88–89|pages=76–84|bibcode=2012GPC....88...76T|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2012.03.008}}</ref><ref name="child">{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Aneire Ehmar|last2=Ireson|first2=Andrew|last3=Kovats|first3=Sari|last4=Mojumder|first4=Sontosh Kumar|last5=Khusru|first5=Amirul|last6=Rahman|first6=Atiq|last7=Vineis|first7=Paolo|display-authors=3|date=September 2011|title=Drinking Water Salinity and Maternal Health in Coastal Bangladesh: Implications of Climate Change|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|volume=119|issue=9|pages=1328–1332|doi=10.1289/ehp.1002804|pmc=3230389|pmid=21486720}}</ref> Nowhere is this more evident than atoll islands. These islands possess limited freshwater supplies, namely ground water lenses and rain fall. When the protective coral reefs surrounding them erodes due to higher temperatures and acidic water chemistry, salt water is able to infiltrate the lens and contaminate the drinking water supply.<ref name="atoll" /> In coastal Bangladesh it has been demonstrated that seasonal hypertension in pregnant women is connected with such phenomenon due to high sodium intake from drinking water.<ref name="child" /> Reef erosion, coupled with sea level rise, tends to flood low-lying areas more frequently during storm surges and weather events. Warming ocean waters generate larger and more devastating weather events that can decimate coastal populations especially without the protection of coral reefs.

===Human health===
The health of our oceans has a direct effect on the health humans.

===Food safety===
Our insatiable appetite for seafood of all types has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks to the point of collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called [[domoic acid]] which is responsible for [[amnesic shellfish poisoning]].<ref name=pseudo>{{cite journal |last1=Tatters |first1=Avery O. |first2=Fei-Xue |last2=Fu |first3=David A. |last3=Hutchins |title=High {{CO2}} and Silicate Limitation Synergistically Increase the Toxicity of ''Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta'' |journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |date=February 2012 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32116 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032116 |pmid=22363805 |pmc=3283721 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...732116T}}</ref>  The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater {{CO2}} concentrations associated with ocean acidification.<ref name=pseudo/>  Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; [[Ciguatera fish poisoning]], [[paralytic shellfish poisoning]], azaspiracid shellfish poisoning, [[diarrhetic shellfish poisoning]], [[neurotoxic shellfish poisoning]] and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.<ref name=pseudo/>

==Extreme weather events==
Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment. For example, malaria outbreaks have been strongly associated with the El Niño cycles of a number of countries (India and Venezuela, for example). [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] can lead to drastic, though temporary, changes in the environment such as temperature fluctuations and [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Epstein/> Because of global warming there has been a marked trend towards more variable and anomalous weather. This has led to an increase in the number and severity of extreme weather events. This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.<ref name=Epstein/>

===Drought===
Arguably one of the worst effects that drought has directly on human health is the destruction of food supply. Farmers who depend on weather to water their crops lose tons of crops per year due to drought. Plant growth is severely stunted without adequate water, and plant resistance mechanisms to fungi and insects weaken like human immune systems. The expression of genes is altered by increased temperatures, which can also affect a plant's resistance mechanisms. One example is wheat, which has the ability to express genes that make it resistant to leaf and stem rusts, and to the Hessian fly; its resistance declines with increasing temperatures.
A number of other factors associated with lack of water may actually attract pestilent insects, as well- some studies have shown that many insects are attracted to yellow hues, including the yellowing leaves of drought-stressed plants.
During times of mild drought is when conditions are most suitable to insect infestation in crops; once the plants become too weakened, they lack the nutrients necessary to keep the insects healthy. This means that even a relatively short, mild drought may cause enormous damage- even though the drought on its own may not be enough to kill a significant portion of the crops, once the plants become weakened, they are at higher risk of becoming infested.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mattson |first1=William J. |last2=Haack |first2=Robert A. |title=Role of Drought in Outbreaks of Plant-Eating Insects |journal=[[BioScience]] |date=February 1987 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=110–118 |url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=barkbeetles |doi=10.2307/1310365|jstor=1310365 }}</ref>

The results of the loss of crop yields affect everyone, but they can be felt most by the poorest people in the world. As supplies of corn, flour and vegetables decline, world food prices are driven up. Malnutrition rates in poor areas of the world skyrocket, and with this, dozens of associated diseases and health problems. Immune function decreases, so mortality rates due to infectious and other diseases climb. For those whose incomes were affected by droughts (namely agriculturalists and pastoralists), and for those who can barely afford the increased food prices, the cost to see a doctor or visit a clinic can simply be out of reach. Without treatment, some of these diseases can hinder one's ability to work, decreasing future opportunities for income and perpetuating the vicious [[cycle of poverty]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Christian |first=Parul |title=Impact of the Economic Crisis and Increase in Food Prices on Child Mortality: Exploring Nutritional Pathways |journal=[[Journal of Nutrition]] |date=January 2010 |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=177S–181S |pmc=2793127 |pmid=19923384 |doi=10.3945/jn.109.111708}}</ref>

===Floods===
[[Health]] concerns around the world can be linked to [[floods]]. With the increase in temperatures worldwide due to climate change the increase in flooding is unavoidable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vigran |first=Anna |title=With Climate Change Comes Floods |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=14 January 2008 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18022014}}</ref>  [[Floods]] have short and long term negative implications to peoples' health and well-being. Short term implications include [[Death|mortalities]], [[injuries]] and [[diseases]], while long term implications include [[non-communicable diseases]] and [[psychosocial]] health aspects.<ref name=alderman>{{cite journal |last1=Alderman |first1=Katarzyna |first2=Lyle R. |last2=Turner |first3=Shilu |last3=Tong |title=Floods and human health: A systematic review |journal=Environment International |date=June 2012 |volume=47 |pages=37–47 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2012.06.003|pmid=22750033 |url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:346602/UQ346602_OA.pdf }}</ref>

Mortalities are not uncommon when it comes to floods. The Countries with lower [[incomes]] are more likely to have more [[Death|fatalities]], because of the lack of [[resources]] they have and the supplies to prepare for a flood. This does depend on the type and properties of the flood. For example, if there is a [[flash flood]] it would not matter how prepared you are. Fatalities connected directly to floods are usually caused by [[drowning]]; the waters in a flood are very deep and have strong [[current (fluid)|currents]].<ref name=alderman/>  [[Deaths]] do not just occur from drowning, deaths are connected with [[dehydration]], [[heat stroke]], [[heart attack]] and any other [[illness]] that needs [[medical supplies]] that cannot be delivered.<ref name=alderman/> Due to flooding mud, grit or sand particles can be deposited into the lakes and rivers. These particles cause the water to become dirty and this becomes a problem as the dirty water leads to water related diseases. For example, cholera and guinea worm disease are caused by dirty water.<ref>thewaterproject.org brighter futures begins with clean water</ref>

Injuries can lead to an excessive amount of morbidity when a flood occurs. Victims who already have a [[chronic illness]] and then sustain a non-fatal injury are put at a higher risk for that non-fatal injury to become [[Death|fatal]]. Injuries are not isolated to just those who were directly in the flood, [[rescue]] teams and even people delivering supplies can sustain an injury. Injuries can occur anytime during the flood process; before, during and after.<ref name=alderman/>  Before the flood people are trying to [[emergency evacuation|evacuate]] as fast as they can, [[motor vehicle accidents]], in this case, are a primary source of injuries obtained post flood. During floods accidents occur with falling [[debris]] or any of the many fast moving objects in the water. After the flood rescue attempts are where large numbers injuries can occur.<ref name=alderman/>

[[Communicable diseases]] are increased due to many [[pathogens]] and [[bacteria]] that are being transported by the [[water]]. In floods where there are many fatalities in the water there is a [[hygienic]] problem with the handling of bodies, due to the [[panic]] stricken mode that comes over a town in distress.<ref name=alderman/>  There are many water [[contaminated]] diseases such as [[cholera]], [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis E]] and [[diarrheal diseases]], to mention a few. There are certain diseases that are directly correlated with floods they include any [[dermatitis]] and any [[wound]], [[nose]], [[throat]] or [[ear infection]]. [[Gastrointestinal disease]] and diarrheal diseases are very common due to a lack of clean water during a flood. Most of clean water supplies are contaminated when flooding occurs. Hepatitis A and E are common because of the lack of [[sanitation]] in the water and in living quarters depending on where the flood is and how prepared the [[community]] is for a flood.<ref name=alderman/>

[[Respiratory diseases]] are a common after the disaster has occurred. This depends on the amount of [[water damage]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that grows after an incident. [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector]] borne diseases increase as well due to the increase in still water after the floods have settled. The diseases that are vector borne are  [[malaria]], [[dengue]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], and [[yellow fever]].<ref name=alderman/>

Non-communicable diseases are a long-term effect of floods. They are either caused by a flood or they are worsened by a flood; they include [[cancer]], [[lung disease]] and [[diabetes]]. Floods have a huge impact on victims' psychosocial [[integrity]]. People suffer from a wide variety of losses and [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. One of the most treated illness in long-term health problems are [[depression (mood)|depression]] caused by the flood and all the [[tragedy]] that flows with one.<ref name=alderman/>

Over this time period the [[alpine glaciers|cirque and steep alpine glaciers]] were able to [[acclimatize]] to the new temperatures posed by climate change; large [[valley glacier]]s have not yet made this adjustment. This means the large valley glaciers are rapidly retreating, as their mass is attempting to achieve equilibrium with the current climate.  If regional [[snow line]]s stay constant, then the glaciers remain constant.<ref name=Chinn/> Today this is clearly not the case as global warming is causing mountain snow lines to rapidly retreat.

Not only are glaciers causing a rise in sea level, they are causing an increase in [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ESNO) and global temperature itself.<ref name=Chinn/>  Glacier loss adds to global heat rise through a decrease in what is called [[ice-albedo feedback]].  As more ice melts, there is less [[Solar reflectance|solar reflectivity]] and less heat is reflected away from the Earth, causing more heat to be absorbed, and retained in the atmosphere and soil <ref name=Epstein/> In addition to the El Niño events, glacial melt is contributing to the rapid turnover of [[sea surface temperatures]] <ref name=Chinn/> and ocean salt content by diluting the ocean water and slowing the [[Atlantic conveyor belt|Atlantic conveyor belt's]] usually swift dive because of a top layer of buoyant, cold, fresh water that slows the flow of warm water to the north.<ref name=Epstein/>

Fifty percent of the world's fresh water consumption is dependent glacial runoff.<ref name=Hall/>  Earth's glaciers are expected to melt within the next forty years, greatly decreasing fresh water flow in the hotter times of the year, causing everyone to depend on rainwater, resulting in large shortages and fluctuations in fresh water availability which largely effects agriculture, power supply, and human health and well-being.<ref name=Epstein/>  Many power sources and a large portion of agriculture rely on glacial runoff in the late summer.  “In many parts of the world, disappearing [[mountain glacier]]s and droughts will make fresh, clean water for drinking, bathing, and other necessary human (and livestock) uses scarce" and a valuable commodity.<ref name=Epstein/>

===Mountain pine beetle, forest ecosystems and forest fires===
[[File:Dendroctonus ponderosae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Adult mountain pine beetle]]

Climate change and the associated changing weather patterns occurring worldwide have a direct effect on biology, population ecology, and the population of eruptive insects, such as the [[mountain pine beetle]] (MPB).

As the Rockies have not adapted to deal with pine beetle [[infestations]], they lack the defenses to fight the beetles.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Warmer [[weather patterns]], [[drought]], and beetle defense mechanisms together dries out [[sap]] in [[pine trees]], which is the main mechanism of defense that trees have against the beetle, as it drowns the beetles and their eggs.<ref name=pinebeetle/> This makes it easier for the beetle to infest and release chemicals into the tree, luring other beetles in an attempt to overcome the weakened defense system of the pine tree. As a consequence, the host (forest) becomes more vulnerable to the disease-causing agent (the beetle).<ref name=pinebeetle/>

The whitebark forests of the Rockies are not the only forests that have been affected by the mountain pine beetle. Due to temperature changes and wind patterns, the pine beetle has now spread through the [[Continental Divide]] of the Rockies and has invaded the fragile [[boreal forest]]s of [[Alberta]], known as the “lungs of the Earth”.<ref name=pinebeetle/> These forests are imperative for producing [[oxygen]] through [[photosynthesis]] and removing [[carbon]] in the [[atmosphere]]. But as the forests become infested and die, [[carbon dioxide]] is released into the environment, and contributes even more to a warming climate. Ecosystems and humans rely on the supply of oxygen in the environment, and threats to this boreal forest results in severe consequences to our planet and human health.<ref name=pinebeetle/> In a forest ravaged by pine beetle, the dead logs and kindle which can easily be ignited by [[lightning]]. [[Forest fires]] present dangers to the environment, human health and the [[economy]].<ref name=pinebeetle/>  They are detrimental to [[air quality]] and [[vegetation]], releasing [[toxic]] and [[carcinogenic]] compounds as they burn.<ref name=pinebeetle/> Due to human induced [[deforestation]] and climate change, along with the pine beetle pandemic, the strength of forest ecosystems decrease. The infestations and resulting [[diseases]] can indirectly, but seriously, effect human health. As droughts and temperature increases continue, so does the frequency of devastating forest fires, [[insect]] infestations, forest diebacks, [[acid rain]], habitat loss, animal endangerment and threats to safe drinking water.<ref name=pinebeetle/>

Warming [[spring (season)|spring]] and [[summer]] temperatures increase [[flammability]] of materials that make up the forest floors.<ref name=westerling/> Warmer temperatures cause dehydration of these materials, which prevents [[rain]] from soaking up and dampening fires.

==Displacement/migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Slow onset phenomena, including effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihoods and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa's [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People |work=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |access-date=12 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233729/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888 |archive-date=5 January 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Extreme environmental events are increasingly recognized as a key driver of migration across the world. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.<ref name=bogumil>{{cite thesis |first=Bogumil |last=Terminski |title=Environmentally-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges |publisher=Centre d'Etude de l'Ethnicité et des Migrations, Université de Liège |date=2012 |url=http://labos.ulg.ac.be/cedem/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf}}</ref>

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.<ref name="beta">{{cite report|title=Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=2012 |url=http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 April 2015 |isbn=978-92-9092-611-5 }}</ref>

To reduce migration compelled by worsening environmental conditions, and to strengthen resilience of at-risk communities, governments should adopt policies and commit financing to social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure
development, and disaster risk management. Though every effort should be made to ensure that people can stay where they live, it is also important to recognize that migration can also be a way for people to cope with environmental changes. If properly managed, and efforts made to protect the rights of migrants, migration can provide substantial benefits to both origin and destination areas, as well as to the migrants themselves. However, migrants&nbsp;– particularly low-skilled ones&nbsp;– are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.<ref name="beta" />

The links between the gradual environmental degradation of climate change and displacement are complex: as the decision to migrate is taken at the household level, it is difficult to measure the respective influence of climate change in these decisions with regard to other influencing factors, such as [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.<ref name=bogumil/> This situates the debate on [[environmental migrant|environmental migration]] in a highly contested field: the use of the term 'environmental refugee', although commonly used in some contexts, is disrecommended by agencies such as the [[UNHCR]] who argue that the term 'refugee' has a strict legal definition which does not apply to environmental migrants.<ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology">{{cite report |last=Black |first=Richard |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality? |series=New Issues in Refugee Research |id=Working Paper No. 34 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |date=March 2001 |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf}}</ref> Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[The Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>
