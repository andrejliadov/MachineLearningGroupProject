'''Abortion in Bangladesh''' is illegal under most situations, but [[menstrual regulation]] is often used as a substitute. [[Bangladesh]] is still governed by the penal code from 1860, where induced abortion is illegal unless the woman in danger.<ref name="factsheet">{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Menstrual Regulation and Induced Abortion in Bangladesh|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/menstrual-regulation-and-induced-abortion-bangladesh|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 March 2017|date=September 2012}}</ref><ref name="un2002">{{cite book |title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/ | chapter=Bangladesh | chapter-url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/bangladesh1.doc |accessdate=14 March 2017 |year=2002 |publisher=United Nations Population Division |format=DOC }}</ref>

Historically, [[abortion]] has been prevalent, especially during the years following the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. For example, in 1972, the law allowed for abortion for those women who has been raped during the war.<ref name="un2002"/> In 1976, the Bangladesh National Population Policy unsuccessfully attempted to legalize abortion in the [[first trimester]].<ref name=danger>{{cite web|url=http://asap-asia.org/country-profile-bangladesh/ |title=Country Profile – Bangladesh |website=Asia Safe Abortion Partnership |accessdate=14 March 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111125657/http://asap-asia.org/country-profile-bangladesh/ |archive-date=11 November 2016 }}</ref>

Since 1979, [[menstrual regulation]] has been the favored alternative to induced abortion, and it is legally permitted because pregnancy cannot be established.<ref name=danger/><ref name="un2002"/> In 2012, the Drug Administration for Bangladesh legalised the combination of mifepristone and misoprotol for medical abortion.<ref name="Zaidi, Shahida 2014"/>

==Menstrual regulation==
Part of the family planning program in Bangladesh since 1979, [[menstrual regulation]] is a procedure that uses manual vacuum aspiration to make it impossible to be pregnant after missing a [[menstruation|period]].<ref name=factsheet/> It is simple and can be done with inexpensive equipment. Its procedure also goes without the use of [[anaesthesia]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Laufe |first1=Leonard E. |date=October 1977 |title=The Menstrual Regulation Procedure |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=253–256 |doi=10.2307/1966015 |jstor=1966015}}</ref>

A study about menstrual regulation in 2013 studied 651 consenting women from 10 different facilities in Bangladesh, who were seeking menstrual regulation and were about 63 days or less late of their menstrual cycle. They were given about 200&nbsp;mg of [[mifepristone]], followed later by 800&nbsp;mg of [[misoprostol]]. The researchers found that 93% of the women had evacuated the uterus without the use of the surgical intervention, and 92% of the women were satisfied with the pills and the rest of the treatment.<ref name="Alam, Anadil 2013">{{cite journal |last1=Alam |first1=Anadil |last2=Bracken |first2=Hillary |last3=Johnson |first3=Heidi Bart |last4=Raghavan |first4=Sheila |last5=Islam |first5=Noushin |last6=Winikoff |first6=Beverly |last7=Reichenbach |first7=Laura |date=June 2013 |title=Acceptability and Feasibility of Mifepristone-Misoprostol For Menstrual Regulation in Bangladesh |journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=79–87 |jstor=41959959|doi=10.1363/3907913 |pmid=23895884 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Although menstrual regulation centers are centralized and free of charge, many women still lack access due to socioeconomic barriers and social stigma.<ref name="Alam, Anadil 2013"/> Centers charge additional fees if the pregnancy is beyond 10 weeks, and many women are unaware of menstrual regulation or face male opposition to the procedure. As a result, some women turn to illegal abortions.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://aphanew.confex.com/apha/132am/techprogram/paper_80263.htm |title=Evaluation of reported induced abortion in Bangladesh: Evidence from the recent DHS |last1= Islam |first1=Mohammad Amirul |last2=Padmadas |first2=Sabu S. |last3=Kabir |first3=Mohammad |date=6–10 November 2004 |conference=132nd Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association }}</ref>

== Abortion ==
An abortion can be legally performed by a physician in a hospital, if it is necessary to save the life of the mother. A person who performs an abortion under any other circumstances, including a woman who [[self-induced abortion|self-aborts]], can be punished by a fine and imprisonment.<ref name="un2002"/>

Menstrual regulation allows a woman to terminate within 10 weeks of her last period, but unsafe methods to terminate pregnancy are widespread. In response, a hotline was created for women to get information about fertility control, including menstrual regulation.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/safe-abortion-hotline-launched-for-menstrual-regulation-in-bangladesh/ |title=Safe Abortion Hotline Launched for Menstrual Regulation in Bangladesh |publisher=International Campaign for Women's Right to Safe Abortion |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-10-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024055955/http://www.safeabortionwomensright.org/safe-abortion-hotline-launched-for-menstrual-regulation-in-bangladesh/ |archive-date=2014-10-24 }}</ref>

According to an article by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], which studied the rural district of [[Matlab, Bangladesh|Matlab]], illegal abortion is becoming increasingly prevalent despite the availability of safer methods of fertility control.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=In Bangladesh, Unsafe Abortion is Common Despite Availability of Safer Pregnancy Termination Procedure |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2014/bangladesh-unsafe-abortion-common-despite-availability-safer-pregnancy-termination |publisher=Guttmacher Institute |date=22 September 2014 |access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref>

A study by Mizanur Rahman and Julie DaVanzo showed that between 2000 and 2008, a woman was more likely to die from the complications of unsafe abortion than from childbirth itself, and that [[maternal death|death rates from childbirth]] were similar of the death rates for the complications of menstrual regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DaVanzo |first1=Julie |last2=Rahman |first2=Mizanur |date=September 2014 |title=Pregnancy Termination in Matlab, Bangladesh: Trends And Correlates of Use of Safer and Less-Safe Method s|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=119–126 |doi=10.1363/4011914|pmid=25271647 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Another study in [[Matlab, Bangladesh|Matlab]] found that between 1982 and 1998, abortion about 35 times more prevalent among unmarried adolescent girls than among married adolescent girls, and it was much higher among who were less than 18 years of age and those who passed or had more than primary education.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ahmed |first1=M.

== Statistics ==
{{As of|2014}}, the national rate that women participate in menstrual regulation as a post-contraceptive way to control their fertility was 10 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. The national rate for induced abortion was 29 per 1,000 women in the same age interval.<ref name=factsheet/> The United Nations estimated that in 2000, the abortion rate was 4.0 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44.<ref name="un2013">{{Cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 14 March 2017}}</ref>

Only 42% of facilities that were expected to provide menstrual regulation services actually did so. Of the Union Health and Family Welfare Centres, which are especially relied upon in rural areas, half provided these services.<ref name=factsheet/> According to Guttmacher, about 27% of women (about 105,000) are turned away annually. In addition, in 2014, about 50% of ever-married Bangladeshi women had not heard of menstrual regulation.<ref name = factsheet/>

In 2014, it was estimated that between 523,808 and 769,269 abortions occurred per year in Bangladesh.<ref name="Zaidi, Shahida 2014">{{cite journal |last1=Zaidi |first1=Shahida |last2=Begum |first2=Ferdousi |last3=Tank |first3=Jaydeep |last4=Chaudhury |first4=Pushpa |last5=Yasmin |first5=Haleema |last6=Dissanayake |first6=Mangala |date=2014 |title=Achievements of the FIGO Initiative for the Prevention of Unsafe Abortion and its Consequences in South-Southeast Asia |journal=International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics |volume=126 |pages=S20–S23 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.03.015|pmid=24743025 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
