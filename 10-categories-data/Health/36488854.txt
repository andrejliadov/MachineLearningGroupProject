'''Consciousness after death''' is a common theme in [[society]] and [[culture]] in the context of [[Afterlife|life after death]]. [[Science|Scientific]] [[research]] has established that the [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the [[brain]], the cessation of which defines [[brain death]]. However, many believe in some form of [[Afterlife|life after death]], which is a feature of many [[religion]]s.

==Neuroscience==
[[Neuroscience]] is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the [[premise]] that all of [[behavior]] and all of the [[mental function|cognitive processes]] that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the [[nervous system]], especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.<ref>Kandel, ER; Schwartz JH; Jessell TM; Siegelbaum SA; Hudspeth AJ.

There are multiple lines of [[scientific evidence|evidence]] that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.

* '''Neuroanatomical correlates''': In the field of [[neuroimaging]], [[neuroscientist]]s can use various [[functional neuroimaging]] methods to measure an aspect of brain function that correlates with a particular mental state or process.
* '''Experimental manipulations''': Neuroimaging correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of mental processes ([[correlation does not imply causation]]) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary or sufficient]] for such processes to occur. Identification of [[causality|causation]] and necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit [[Experiment|experimental manipulation]] of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes [[consciousness]], then a causal role for that brain activity can be [[Inference|inferred]].<ref name="Murphy">{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609}}</ref><ref>Max Velmans, Susan Schneider.

In a loss-of-function (also called "necessity") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called "sufficiency") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal.<ref>Matt Carter, Jennifer C.

::'''Pharmacological manipulation''' using various [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] which alter neural activity by interfering with [[neurotransmission]], resulting in alterations in [[perception]], [[mood (psychology)|mood]], consciousness, cognition, and behavior. Psychoactive drugs are divided into different groups according to their pharmacological effects; [[euphoriants]] which tend to induce feelings of [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], [[stimulant]]s that induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions, [[depressant]]s that depress or reduce arousal or stimulation and [[hallucinogen]]s which can cause [[hallucinations]], perception anomalies, and other substantial subjective changes in thoughts, emotion, and consciousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
::'''Electrical and magnetical stimulations''' using various [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical methods]] and techniques like [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. In a comprehensive review of electrical brain stimulation (EBS) results obtained from the last 100 years neuroscientist Aslihan Selimbeyoglu and neurologist Josef Parvizi compiled a list of many different subjective experiential phenomena and behavioral changes that can be caused by electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex or subcortical nuclei in awake and conscious human subjects.<ref>Aslihan Selimbeyoglu, Josef Parvizi.

* '''[[brain injury|Symptoms of brain damage]]''': Examining case studies (like the case of [[Phineas Gage]]) and [[lesion]] studies are the only sources of knowledge regarding what happens to the mind when the brain is damaged. Various symptoms have been documented.<ref>[http://www.traumaticbraininjury.com/symptoms-of-tbi/severe-tbi-symptoms/, "Severe TBI Symptoms"]</ref><ref>[http://www.braininjury.com/symptoms.shtml "Symptoms of Brain Injury"]</ref> 
* '''[[cognitive development|Mental development]]/[[neural development|brain development]] correlation''': The brain grows and develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages, and this development is correlated with the development of various mental capabilities.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GOxrtYzmixcC "Cognitive Development and Aging: A Life Span Perspective"]</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/teenbrain/work/adolescent.html "Adolescent Brains Are A Work In Progress"]</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/9616794 "Blossoming brains"]</ref> Impairments in the growth and development of the brain also result in various [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s.

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness|disorders of consciousness}}
Death is the permanent cessation of all [[biological process|biological functions]] that sustain a living [[organism]]. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to "brain death" or "biological death" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).<ref name="enc bd">{{cite web|url=http://www.deathreference.com/Bl-Ce/Brain-Death.html |title=Brain death| website=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying| accessdate= 25 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-brain-death?source=search_result&search=brain+death&selectedTitle=1~37 | title=Diagnosis of brain death| last=Young | first= G Bryan| website=UpToDate|accessdate=25 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4103/0972-5229.53108| pmid = 19881172| title = The diagnosis of brain death| journal = Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 7–11| year = 2009| last1 = Goila | first1 = A. | last2 = Pawar | first2 = M. | pmc = 2772257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4081/ni.2010.e2| pmid = 21577338| pmc = 3093212| title = Diagnosis of brain death| journal = Neurology International| volume = 2| issue = 1| year = 2010| last1 = Machado | first1 = C.| pages=2}}</ref>

==Near-death experience (NDE)==
{{Main|Near-death experience}}
A near-death experience (NDE) is a personal experience associated with impending [[death]], encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a [[hallucination|hallucinatory state]] caused by various neurological factors such as [[cerebral anoxia]], [[Hypercapnia|hypercarbia]], abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s and [[brain damage]].<ref>[[Olaf Blanke]], Sebastian Dieguez.
