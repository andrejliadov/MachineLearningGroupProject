==Efficacy==
=== Heterosexual men ===
{{asof|2020}}, circumcision is well-established as being effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection in heterosexual men.<ref name=farley/>

The [[number needed to treat]], to prevent one HIV infection during ten years, is between five and fifteen men.  The UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA Expert Group on Modelling the Impact and Cost of Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention found "large benefits" of circumcision in settings with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision prevalence.  The Group estimated "one HIV infection being averted for every five to fifteen male circumcisions performed, and costs to avert one HIV infection ranging from US$150 to US$900 using a 10-y time horizon".{{old fact|2020|8|13}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hankins C, Hargrove J, Williams B, Abu Raddad L, Auvert B, Bollinger L, Dorrington R, Ghani A, Gray R, Hallett T, Kahn JG | display-authors = 6 | collaboration = UNAIDS/WHO/SACEMA Expert Group on Modelling the Impact and Cost of Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention | title = Male circumcision for HIV prevention in high HIV prevalence settings: what can mathematical modelling contribute to informed decision making? | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e1000109 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19901974 | pmc = 2731851 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000109 | type = Review }}</ref> The World Health Organisation states that circumcision is "highly cost-effective" in comparison to other HIV interventions when data from the South African trial are used, but less cost-effective when data from the Ugandan trial are used.<ref name="WHO-GTPDSA" />

A 2008 meta-analysis of gay and bisexual men (52% circumcised) found that the rate of HIV infection was not lower among men who were circumcised.<ref name="Millett">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan T, Fitzpatrick T, Ko NY, Cai Y, Chen Y, Zhao J, Li L, Xu J, Gu J, Li J, Hao C, Yang Z, Cai W, Cheng CY, Luo Z, Zhang K, Wu G, Meng X, Grulich AE, Hao Y, Zou H | display-authors = 6 | title = Circumcision to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men: a systematic review and meta-analysis of global data | journal = The Lancet.

==Recommendations==
{{synthesis|section|date=October 2020}}
In 2007, the WHO reviewed the totality of evidence concerning male circumcision and HIV, and issued joint recommendations with [[UNAIDS]].<ref name="WHOpr0307"/> The recommendations included that male circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention and that the promotion of male circumcision is an additional strategy for the prevention of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men.<ref name="WHO-C&R" /> Kim Dickson, coordinator of the working group that authored the report, commented in part that circumcision "would have greatest impact" in countries with relatively high heterosexual HIV transmission rates (greater than 15%) and low circumcision rates (less than 20%). She further commented that circumcision is not full protection and that other methods of HIV prevention are still important in circumcised males.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11481 | title = WHO hails circumcision as vital in HIV fight | access-date = 2008-09-18 | date = March 28, 2007 | magazine = [[New Scientist]]}}</ref>

{{quote|text=Although these results demonstrate that male circumcision reduces the risk of men becoming infected with HIV, the UN agencies emphasize that it does not provide complete protection against HIV infection. Circumcised men can still become infected with the virus and, if HIV-positive, can infect their sexual partners.

Because the evidence that circumcision prevents HIV mainly comes from studies conducted in Africa, the [[Royal Dutch Medical Association]] (KNMG) has questioned the applicability of those studies to [[developed countries]]. Circumcision has not been included in their HIV prevention recommendations. The KNMG policy statement says that the relationship between HIV transmission and circumcision is unclear, and that behavioral factors seem to have more of an effect on HIV prevention than circumcision. The KNMG also recommends that the choice of circumcision should be put off until an age when a possible HIV risk reduction would be relevant, so that boys can decide for themselves whether to undergo the procedure or choose other prevention alternatives. This KNMG circumcision policy statement was endorsed by several [[Netherlands|Dutch]] medical associations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors - KNMG Viewpoint|url=https://www.knmg.nl/zoekresultaten.htm?keyword=circumcision%20of%20male%20minors&start=0&show_pdf_files=true&facet_creation_date=all-data&facet_creation_date_from=&facet_creation_date_to=}}</ref>

In the [[United States]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) led a 2012 task force which included the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC). The  task force policy statement, found that circumcision may be helpful for the prevention of HIV in the United States. The AAP task force policy was endorsed by the ACOG.<ref name=AAP_2012>{{cite journal |author=American Academy of Pediatrics Task Force on Circumcision |title=Technical Report |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=e756–e785 |issn=0031-4005 |pmid=22926175 |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1990 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756.full |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920054623/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756.full |archive-date=2012-09-20 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The CDC expressed uncertainty if circumcision would help in the United States, stating the transmission patterns in the U.S. vary from those studied in the primary studies examined, namely the U.S. has a higher prevalence of MSM transmission. In line with the AAP task force, the CDC 2018 position on circumcision and HIV recommended that circumcision should continue to be offered to parents who are [[informed consent|informed]] of the benefits and risks, including a potential reduction in risk of HIV transmission.<ref name="CDC2018" /> The CDC says that circumcision can be done in adulthood, when the man can make a decision for himself. Circumcision conducted after sexual debut can result in missed opportunities for HIV prevention.<ref name="CDC2018">{{cite web |title=Information for providers counseling male patients and parents regarding male circumcision and the prevention of HIV infection, STIs, and other health outcomes |url=https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/58456 |website=CDC stacks |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control]] |access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref>

== Process ==
The WHO recommends voluntary medical male circumcision, as opposed to circumcision by traditional healers or untrained individuals. 

Newly circumcised men must refrain from sexual activity until the wounds are fully healed. Some circumcised men might have a false sense of security that could lead to increased risky sexual behavior.<ref>

Valiere Alcena, in a 1986 letter to the ''New York State Journal of Medicine,'' noted that low rates of circumcision in parts of Africa had been linked to the [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|high rate of HIV infection]].<ref name="taken">{{cite journal |type= Comment | vauthors = Alcena V |title = AIDS in Third World countries |journal= PLOS Medicine |date = 19 October 2006| volume = 86 | issue = 8 | page = 446 | pmid = 3463895 |url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=15231}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |type = Letter | vauthors = Alcena V |title = AIDS in Third World countries |journal = New York State Journal of Medicine |volume = 86 |issue = 8 |pages = 446 |date=August 1986 | pmid = 3463895 |url = http://www.popline.org/node/363663}}</ref> Aaron J.

A 2005 review of 37 observational studies expressed reservations about the conclusion because of possible [[confounding factor]]s, since all studies to date had been observational as opposed to [[randomized controlled trial]]s. The authors stated that three randomized controlled trials then underway in Africa would provide "essential evidence" about the effects of circumcision on preventing HIV.<ref name="Siegfried2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegfried N, Muller M, Deeks J, Volmink J, Egger M, Low N, Walker S, Williamson P | display-authors = 6 | title = HIV and male circumcision--a systematic review with assessment of the quality of studies | journal = The Lancet.

In 2009, a [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane review]] which included the results of the three 2000s trials found "strong" evidence that the acquisition of HIV by a man during sex with a woman was decreased by 38% and 66% over 24 months if the man was circumcised.
