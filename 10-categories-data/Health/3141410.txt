'''Child mortality''' is the [[mortality rate|mortality]] of [[child]]ren under the age of five.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Child mortality and causes of death|website=WHO|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The '''child mortality rate''', also '''under-five mortality rate''', refers to the probability of dying between birth and exactly five years of age expressed per 1,000 live births.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup1.html|title=UNICEF - Definitions|website=www.unicef.org|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>

It encompasses [[neonatal mortality]] and infant mortality (the probability of death in the first year of life).<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality">{{cite web |url= https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/ |title=UNICEF Child Mortality Statistics|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> 

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. Target 3.2 is "b''y 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce … under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births."''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|title=Health|last=Martin|website=United Nations Sustainable Development|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>

Rapid progress has resulted in a significant decline in preventable child deaths since 1990, with the global under-5 mortality rate declining by over half between 1990 and 2016.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> While in 1990, 12.6 million children under age five died, in 2016 that number fell to 5.6 million children.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> However, despite advances, there are still 15,000 under-five deaths per day from largely preventable causes.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> About 80 per cent of these occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and just 6 countries account for half of all under-five deaths: China, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> 45% of these children died during the first 28 days of life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L, Oza S, Hogan D, Chu Y, Perin J, Zhu J, Lawn JE, Cousens S, Mathers C, Black RE | display-authors = 6 | title = Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000-15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals | journal = Lancet | volume = 388 | issue = 10063 | pages = 3027–3035 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27839855 | pmc = 5161777 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31593-8 }}</ref> Death rates were highest among children under age 1, followed by children ages 15 to 19, 1 to 4, and 5 to 14.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/infant-child-and-teen-mortality |title=Infant, Child, and Teen Mortality }}</ref>

Many child deaths go unreported for a variety of reasons, including lack of death registration and lack of data on child migrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/resources/snapshot-civil-registration-sub-saharan-africa/|title=A Snapshot of Civil Registration in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2017-12-05|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/resources/child-child-protecting-children-move-violence-abuse-exploitation/|title=A Child is a Child: Protecting children on the move from violence, abuse and exploitation|date=2017-05-18|publisher=UNICEF|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> Without accurate data on child deaths, we cannot fully discover and combat the greatest risks to a child's life.

== Measurement ==

Child mortality refers to number of child deaths under the age of 5 per 1000 live births. However, the child mortality could be simplified into more specific terms such as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]], [[Prenatal development|perinatal]], [[Neonatal]], [[Infant|infancy]] and [[Under 5 Infant Mortality|under 5]]. Prenatal: child death before the birth, Perinatal: child death before one week of birth, Neonatal: child death before 28 days of birth, Infancy: child death before 1st birthday, and child mortality under 5 refer to any deaths from birth to the 5th birthday.<ref name=":13">{{cite book|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues | last = Weeks | first = John Robert | name-list-style = vanc |isbn=9781305094505|edition=Twelfth |location=Boston, MA|oclc=884617656|date=2015-01-01}}</ref>

Perinatal mortality rate: Number of child deaths within first week of birth/ total number of birth<ref name=":13"/>

Neonatal mortality rate: number of child deaths within first 28 days of life/ total number of birth<ref name=":13"/>

== Causes ==
[[File:Leading cause of child mortality.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|leading cause of child mortality]]
{{Further|Infant mortality}}
The leading causes of death of children under five include:

* [[Preterm birth]] complications (18%)
* [[Pneumonia]] (16%)
* Interpartum-related events (12%)
*[[Neonatal sepsis]] (7%)
*[[Diarrhea]] (8%)
*[[Malaria]]  (5%)
*[[Undernutrition in children|Malnutrition]] and Under nutrition

There is variation of child mortality around the world. Countries that are in the second or third stage of the Demographic Transition Mode ([[Demographic transition model|DTM]]) have higher rates of child mortality than countries in the fourth or fifth stage. [[Chad]] infant mortality is about 96 per 1,000 live births, compared to only 2.2 per 1,000 live births in [[Japan]].<ref name=":13"/> In 2010, there was a global estimate of 7.6 million child deaths with most occurring in [[Developing country|less developed countries]]. Among those, 4.7<ref name=":0">{{cite document |title=Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000|id = {{ProQuest|1023015914}}}}</ref> million died from infection and disorder.<ref name=":0" /> Child mortality is not only caused by infection and disorder: it is also caused by premature birth; birth defect; new born infection; birth complication; and diseases like [[malaria]], sepsis, and diarrhea.<ref name=":22">{{cite news|url=https://www.worldvision.org/health-news-stories/child-mortality-causes-solutions|title=Child mortality: Top causes, best solutions {{!}} World Vision|date=2016-01-13|work=World Vision|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> In less developed countries, [[malnutrition]] is the main cause of child mortality.<ref name=":22"/> Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria together are the cause of 1 out of every 3 deaths before the age of 5 while nearly half of under-five deaths globally are attributable to under-nutrition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-survival/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref>

{{More citations needed|date=June 2015}}

Child survival is a field of [[public health]] concerned with reducing child mortality. Child survival 
interventions are designed to address the most common causes of child deaths that occur, which include [[diarrhea]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and neonatal conditions.  Of the portion of children under the age of 5 alone, an estimated 5.6 million children die each year mostly from such preventable causes.<ref name="data.unicef.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.data.unicef.org/child-mortality/under-five|title=UNICEF STATISTICS|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref>

The child survival strategies and interventions are in line with the fourth [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which focused on reducing child mortality by 2/3 of children under five before the year 2015. In 2015, the MDGs were replaced with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), which aim to end these deaths by 2030. In order to achieve SDG targets, progress must be accelerated in more than 1/4 of all countries (most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa) in order to achieve targets for under-5 mortality, and in 60 countries (many in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia) to achieve targets for neonatal mortality.<ref name="data.unicef.org" /> Without accelerated progress, 60 million children under age 5 will die between 2017 and 2030, about half of which would be newborns. China achieved its target of reduction in under-5 mortality rates well ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite web | title = MDGs Global Report 2015 | url = http://www.cn.undp.org/content/china/en/home/library/mdg/mdg-report-2015.html | work = United Nations Development Programme }}</ref>

=== Low-cost interventions ===
Two-thirds of child deaths are preventable.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index.html UNICEF - Young child survival and development].</ref> Most of the children who die each year could be saved by low-tech, evidence-based, cost-effective measures such as [[vaccine]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, micronutrient supplementation, insecticide-treated bed nets, improved family care and [[breastfeeding]] practices,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.unicef.org/mdg/childmortality.html|title=UNICEF - Goal: Reduce child mortality|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref> and [[oral rehydration therapy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/release35/en/ |title=WHO - New formula for oral rehydration salts will save millions of lives|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref> Empowering women, removing financial and social barriers to accessing basic services, developing innovations that make the supply of critical services more available to the poor and increasing local accountability of health systems are policy interventions that have allowed health systems to improve equity and reduce mortality.<ref name="UN Child Mortality Report 2012">{{cite web |url= http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2012.pdf |title=Surveys - UNICEF MICS |website=www.childinfo.org }}</ref>

In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and [[diarrheal diseases]] can be reduced by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with soap. This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis V, Cairncross S | title = Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 275–81 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12726975 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6 }}</ref>

Proven, cost-effective interventions can save the lives of millions of children per year. The UN Vaccine division as of 2014 supported 36% of the world's children in order to best improve their survival chances, yet still, low-cost immunization interventions do not reach 30 million children despite success in reducing [[polio]], [[tetanus]], and [[measles]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jadhav S, Gautam M, Gairola S | title = Role of vaccine manufacturers in developing countries towards global healthcare by providing quality vaccines at affordable prices | journal = Clinical Microbiology and Infection | volume = 20 Suppl 5 | pages = 37–44 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24476201 | doi = 10.1111/1469-0691.12568 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Measles and tetanus still kill more than 1 million children under 5 each year. Vitamin A supplementation costs only $0.02 for each capsule and given 2–3 times a year will prevent blindness and death. Although vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 12 to 24 per cent, only 70 per cent of targeted children were reached in 2015.<ref name="data.unicef.org" /> Between 250,000 and 500,000 children become blind every year, with 70 percent of them dying within 12 months. [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is an effective treatment for lost liquids through diarrhea; yet only 4 in 10 (44 per cent) of children ill with diarrhea are treated with ORT.<ref name="data.unicef.org" />

Essential newborn care - including immunizing mothers against tetanus, ensuring clean delivery practices in a hygienic birthing environment, drying and wrapping the baby immediately after birth, providing necessary warmth, and promoting immediate and continued breastfeeding, immunization, and treatment of infections with antibiotics - could save the lives of 3 million newborns annually. [[Improved sanitation]] and access to clean [[drinking water]] can reduce childhood infections and diarrhea. Over 30% of the world's population does not have access to basic [[sanitation]], and 844 million people use unsafe sources of drinking water.<ref name="UNICEF WASH">{{cite web | title = Water, sanitation and hygiene overview | url = https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/overview/ | work = UNICEF }}</ref>

=== Efforts ===
Agencies promoting and implementing child survival activities worldwide include [[UNICEF]] and [[non-governmental organization]]s; major child survival donors worldwide include the [[World Bank]], the British Government's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]]. In the United States, most non-governmental child survival agencies belong to the [[CORE Group]], a coalition working, through collaborative action, to save the lives of young children in the world's poorest countries.

Child mortality has been dropping as each country reaches a high stage of DTM. From 2000 to 2010, child mortality has dropped from 9.6 million to 7.6 million. In order to reduce child mortality rates, there needs to be better education, higher standards of healthcare and more caution in childbearing. Child mortality could be reduced by attendance of professionals at birth and by breastfeeding and through access to clean water, sanitation, and immunization.<ref name=":22"/> In 2016, the world average was 41 (4.1%), down from 93 (9.3%) in 1990.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> This is equivalent to 5.6 million children less than five years old dying in 2016.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" />

===Variation===

Huge disparities in under-5 mortality rates exist. Globally, the risk of a child dying in the country with the highest under-5 mortality rate is about 60 times higher than in the country with the lowest under-5 mortality rate.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest under-5 mortality rates in the world: All six countries with rates above 100 deaths per 1,000 live births are in sub-Saharan Africa, with [[Somalia]] having the highest under-5 mortality rates.<ref>{{cite web | title = Under-five mortality | url = https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/ | work = UNICEF }}</ref><ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" />

Furthermore, approximately 80% of under-5 deaths occur in only two regions: sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> 6 countries account for half of the global under-5 deaths, namely, [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[China]].<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> India and Nigeria alone account for almost a third (32 per cent) of the global under-five deaths.<ref name="UNICEF-child-mortality" /> Within low- and middle-income countries, there is also substantial variation in child mortality rates across [[administrative division]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Golding N, Burstein R, Longbottom J, Browne AJ, Fullman N, Osgood-Zimmerman A, Earl L, Bhatt S, Cameron E, Casey DC, Dwyer-Lindgren L, Farag TH, Flaxman AD, Fraser MS, Gething PW, Gibson HS, Graetz N, Krause LK, Kulikoff XR, Lim SS, Mappin B, Morozoff C, Reiner RC, Sligar A, Smith DL, Wang H, Weiss DJ, Murray CJ, Moyes CL, Hay SI | display-authors = 6 | title = Mapping under-5 and neonatal mortality in Africa, 2000-15: a baseline analysis for the Sustainable Development Goals | language = en | journal = Lancet | volume = 390 | issue = 10108 | pages = 2171–2182 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28958464 | pmc = 5687451 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31758-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burstein R, Henry NJ, Collison ML, Marczak LB, Sligar A, Watson S, etal | title = Mapping 123 million neonatal, infant and child deaths between 2000 and 2017 | journal = Nature | volume = 574 | issue = 7778 | pages = 353–358 | date = October 2019 | pmid = 31619795 | pmc = 6800389 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-019-1545-0 | bibcode = 2019Natur.574..353B }}</ref>

Likewise, there are disparities between wealthy and poor households in developing countries. According to a [[Save the Children]] paper, children from the poorest households in [[India]] are three times more likely to die before their fifth birthday than those from the richest households.<ref>[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm Inequalities in child survival: looking at wealth and other socio-economic disparities in developing countries] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607200429/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_12286.htm |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref> A systematic study reports for all the low- and middle-income countries (not including China), the children among the poorest households are twice as likely to die before the age of 5 years old compare to those in the richest household.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chao | first=Fengqing | last2=You | first2=Danzhen | last3=Pedersen | first3=Jon | last4=Hug | first4=Lucia|last5=Alkema|first5=Leontine | title = National and regional under-5 mortality rate by economic status for low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic assessment | language = en | journal = Lancet Global Health | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e535–e547 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29653627 | pmc = 5905403 | doi = 10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30059-7 }}</ref>

The child survival rate of nations varies with factors such as [[fertility rate]] and [[income distribution]]; the change in distribution shows a strong correlation between child survival and income distribution as well as fertility rate, where increasing child survival allows the average income to increase as well as the average fertility rate to decrease.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Child & Infant Mortality | url = https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality | journal = Our World in Data | date = 10 May 2013 | last1 = Dadonaite | first1 = Bernadeta | last2 = Ritchie | first2 = Hannah | last3 = Roser | first3 = Max }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Hans Rosling shows the best stats you've ever seen |url= http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html |work=TED talks |publisher=TED Conferences |access-date=23 May 2012 |date=February 2006 }}</ref>
