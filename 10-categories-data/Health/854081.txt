[[Echinoderms]] (such as the sea star), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of [[autotomy]], for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture.

==Ecosystems==
{{main|regeneration (ecology)}}

Ecosystems can be regenerative. Following a disturbance, such as a fire or pest outbreak in a forest, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].<ref name="Dietze08">{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | vauthors = Dietze MC, Clark JS | title=Changing the gap dynamics paradigm: Vegetative regenerative control on forest response to disturbance | journal=Ecological Monographs | volume=78 | issue=3 | pages=331–347 | url=http://coweeta.uga.edu/publications/10300.pdf | year=2008}}</ref><ref name="Bailey02">{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(01)00564-3 | vauthors = Bailey J, Covington WW | title=Evaluation ponderosa pine regeneration rates following ecological restoration treatments in northern Arizona, USA | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | volume=155 | issue = 1–3 | pages=271–278 | url= http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/index/assoc/HASH0e9a.dir/doc.pdf | year=2002}}</ref>

==Cellular molecular fundamentals==
Pattern formation in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by [[Regulation of gene expression|genetic induction factors]] that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as [[GAP-43]], [[tubulin]], [[actin]], an array of novel [[neuropeptide]]s, and [[cytokines]] that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage.<ref name="Fu97">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu SY, Gordon T | title = The cellular and molecular basis of peripheral nerve regeneration | journal = Molecular Neurobiology | volume = 14 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 67–116 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9170101 | doi = 10.1007/BF02740621 | s2cid = 13045638 }}</ref> Many of the genes that are involved in the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process.

"Strategies include the rearrangement of pre-existing tissue, the use of adult [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[stem cells]] and the dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of cells, and more than one mode can operate in different tissues of the same animal.<ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/> All these strategies result in the re-establishment of appropriate tissue polarity, structure and form."<ref name="Alvarado06">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sánchez Alvarado A, Tsonis PA | title = Bridging the regeneration gap: genetic insights from diverse animal models | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 873–84 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17047686 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1923 | s2cid = 2978615 | url = http://planaria.neuro.utah.edu/publications/NRG2006.pdf }}</ref>{{rp|873}} During the developmental process, genes are activated that serve to modify the properties of [[Cell potency|cell]] as they differentiate into different tissues.

How prominent morphallactic regeneration is in [[oligochaetes]] is currently not well understood. Although relatively under-reported, it is possible that morphallaxis is a common mode of inter-segment regeneration in annelids. Following regeneration in ''L. variegatus'', past posterior segments sometimes become anterior in the new body orientation, consistent with morphallaxis.

Following amputation, most annelids are capable of sealing their body via rapid muscular contraction. Constriction of body muscle can lead to infection prevention. In certain species, such as ''[[Limnodrilus]]'', [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] can be seen within hours after amputation in the [[ectoderm]] and [[mesoderm]]. Amputation is also thought to cause a large migration of cells to the injury site, and these form a wound plug.

Similar to the physiological regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers in order to repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage. Typically, seasonal changes that are associated with breeding seasons will prompt a hormonal signal for birds to begin regenerating feathers.

MRL mice are not protected against [[myocardial infarction]]; heart regeneration in adult mammals ([[neocardiogenesis]]) is limited, because heart muscle cells are nearly all [[G0 phase|terminally differentiated]].

{{main|Regeneration in humans}}

The regrowth of lost tissues or organs in the human body is being researched. Some tissues such as skin regrow quite readily; others have been thought to have little or no capacity for regeneration, but ongoing research suggests that there is some hope for a variety of tissues and organs.<ref name="Birbrair 2298–2314"/><ref name=CompleteRegen2>{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 = Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-style = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation.

As are all metazoans, humans are capable of physiological regeneration (i.e. the replacement of cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen.<ref>{{cite book | title = Principles of Regenerative Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/principlesregene00carl | url-access = limited | vauthors = Carlson BM | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/principlesregene00carl/page/n45 25]–26 | isbn = 978-0-12-369439-3 }}</ref> Another example of physiological regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferenczy A, Bertrand G, Gelfand MM | title = Proliferation kinetics of human endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 133 | issue = 8 | pages = 859–67 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 434029 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(79)90302-8 }}</ref>

However, humans are limited in their capacity for reparative regeneration, which occurs in response to injury. One of the most studied regenerative responses in humans is the hypertrophy of the liver following liver injury.<ref name="Michalopoulos_1997">{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalopoulos GK, DeFrances MC | title = Liver regeneration | journal = Science | volume = 276 | issue = 5309 | pages = 60–6 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9082986 | doi = 10.1126/science.276.5309.60 | s2cid = 2756510 }}</ref><ref name="Taub_2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Taub R | title = Liver regeneration: from myth to mechanism | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 836–47 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15459664 | doi = 10.1038/nrm1489 | s2cid = 30647609 }}</ref> For example, the original mass of the liver is re-established in direct proportion to the amount of liver removed following partial hepatectomy,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawasaki S, Makuuchi M, Ishizone S, Matsunami H, Terada M, Kawarazaki H | title = Liver regeneration in recipients and donors after transplantation | journal = Lancet | volume = 339 | issue = 8793 | pages = 580–1 | date = March 1992 | pmid = 1347095 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(92)90867-3 | s2cid = 34148354 }}</ref> which indicates that signals from the body regulate liver mass precisely, both positively and negatively, until the desired mass is reached. This response is considered cellular regeneration (a form of compensatory hypertrophy) where the function and mass of the liver is regenerated through the proliferation of existing mature hepatic cells (mainly [[hepatocyte]]s), but the exact morphology of the liver is not regained.<ref name="Taub_2004" /> This process is driven by growth factor and cytokine regulated pathways.<ref name="Michalopoulos_1997" /> The normal sequence of inflammation and regeneration does not function accurately in cancer. Specifically, cytokine stimulation of cells leads to expression of genes that change cellular functions and suppress the immune response.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology & Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}</ref>

Adult neurogenesis is also a form of cellular regeneration. For example, hippocampal neuron renewal occurs in normal adult humans at an annual turnover rate of 1.75% of neurons.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Spalding KL, Bergmann O, Alkass K, Bernard S, Salehpour M, Huttner HB, Boström E, Westerlund I, Vial C, Buchholz BA, Possnert G, Mash DC, Druid H, Frisén J | title = Dynamics of hippocampal neurogenesis in adult humans | journal = Cell | volume = 153 | issue = 6 | pages = 1219–1227 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23746839 | pmc = 4394608 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.05.002 }}</ref> Cardiac myocyte renewal has been found to occur in normal adult humans,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergmann O, Bhardwaj RD, Bernard S, Zdunek S, Barnabé-Heider F, Walsh S, Zupicich J, Alkass K, Buchholz BA, Druid H, Jovinge S, Frisén J | title = Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5923 | pages = 98–102 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19342590 | pmc = 2991140 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164680 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324...98B }}</ref> and at a higher rate in adults following acute heart injury such as infarction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beltrami AP, Urbanek K, Kajstura J, Yan SM, Finato N, Bussani R, Nadal-Ginard B, Silvestri F, Leri A, Beltrami CA, Anversa P | title = Evidence that human cardiac myocytes divide after myocardial infarction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 23 | pages = 1750–7 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11396441 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200106073442303 }}</ref> Even in adult [[myocardium]] following infarction, proliferation is only found in around 1% of myocytes around the area of injury, which is not enough to restore function of [[cardiac muscle]]. However, this may be an important target for regenerative medicine as it implies that regeneration of cardiomyocytes, and consequently of myocardium, can be induced.

Another example of reparative regeneration in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after phalange amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McKim LH | title = Regeneration of the distal phalanx | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 549–50 | date = May 1932 | pmid = 20318716 | pmc = 402335 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneoka K, Allan CH, Yang X, Lee J, Han M | title = Mammalian regeneration and regenerative medicine | journal = Birth Defects Research.

Yet another example of regeneration in humans is [[vas deferens]] regeneration, which occurs after a [[vasectomy]] and which results in vasectomy failure.<ref>{{cite web |author=Korin Miller |date=September 11, 2017 |url=https://www.self.com/story/what-happens-when-a-vasectomy-fails |title=Here's What Happens When a Vasectomy Fails |publisher=SELF |accessdate=2019-03-16}}</ref>
