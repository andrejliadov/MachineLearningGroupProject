'''Exercise''' is any [[Human body|bodily]] activity that enhances or maintains [[physical fitness]] and overall [[health]] and wellness.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors= Kylasov A, Gavrov S| year = 2011 | title = Diversity Of Sport: non-destructive evaluation| location = Paris| publisher = UNESCO: Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|pages = 462–91|isbn = 978-5-89317-227-0}}</ref>

It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing [[senescence|aging]], developing [[muscle]]s and the [[cardiovascular system]], honing [[sport|athletic]] skills, [[weight loss]] or maintenance, improving health<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389|title=7 great reasons why exercise matters|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2 November 2018|language=en}}</ref> and also for enjoyment.

In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person.  Even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/|title=Exercise|date=2018-04-26|website=UK NHS Live Well|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:<ref name="phy_active">{{Cite web

* [[Aerobic exercise]] is any [[physical activity]] that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more [[oxygen]] than it would while resting.<ref name="phy_active" /> The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase [[cardiovascular]] [[endurance]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wilmore J. |author2=Knuttgen H. | year = 2003 | title = Aerobic Exercise and Endurance Improving Fitness for Health Benefits | journal = The Physician and Sportsmedicine | volume = 31 | issue = 5|pages=45–51 | doi=10.3810/psm.2003.05.367|pmid=20086470 |s2cid=2253889 }}</ref> Examples of aerobic exercise include [[running]], [[cycling]], [[human swimming|swimming]], brisk [[walking]], [[skipping rope]], [[rowing (sports)|rowing]], [[hiking]], dancing, playing [[tennis]], [[continuous training]], and [[long slow distance|long distance]] running.<ref name="phy_active" />
* [[Anaerobic exercise]], which includes [[Strength training|strength]] and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, [[Balance (ability)|balance]], and [[Motor coordination|coordination]].<ref name="phy_active" /> Examples of strength exercises are [[push-ups]], [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-ups]], [[Lunge (exercise)|lunges]], squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes [[weight training]], [[functional training]], [[Eccentric Training|eccentric training]], [[interval training]], [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]], and [[high-intensity interval training]] which increase short-term muscle strength.<ref name="phy_active" /><ref>{{cite journal |author1=De Vos N. |author2=Singh N. |author3=Ross D. |author4=Stavrinos T. | year = 2005 | title = Optimal Load for Increasing Muscle Power During Explosive Resistance Training in Older Adults | journal = The Journals of Gerontology | volume = 60A | issue = 5| pages = 638–47 | doi=10.1093/gerona/60.5.638|pmid=15972618 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. 'Dynamic' exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the [[diastole|diastolic]] blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the [[systole (medicine)|systolic]] pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2010|title=Intra-Arterial Blood Pressure Response in Hypertensive Subjects during Low- and High-Intensity Resistance Exercise|journal=Clinics|volume=65|issue=3|doi=10.1590/S1807-59322010000300006| pmc=2845767 |pmid=20360917|vauthors=de Souza Nery S, Gomides RS, da Silva GV, de Moraes Forjaz CL, Mion D Jr, Tinucci T|pages=271–77}}</ref><!--

Early motor skills and development is also related to physical activity and performance later in life.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
{{Main|Cardiovascular fitness}}
The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well documented. There is a direct correlation between physical inactivity and cardiovascular mortality, and physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Low levels of physical exercise increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mortality.<ref name="aha2017">{{cite web|url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/American-Heart-Association-Recommendations-for-Physical-Activity-in-Adults_UCM_307976_Article.jsp#.Wu3boogvxnJ|title=American Heart Association Recommendations for Physical Activity in Adults|publisher=American Heart Association|date=14 December 2017|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref>

The greatest potential for reduced mortality is seen in sedentary individuals who become moderately active. Studies have shown that since heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, regular exercise in aging women leads to healthier cardiovascular profiles. Most beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through moderate-intensity activity (40–60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on age). Persons who modify their behavior after myocardial infarction to include regular exercise have improved rates of survival. Persons who remain sedentary have the highest risk for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.94.4.857 |pmid=8772712 |title=Statement on Exercise: Benefits and Recommendations for Physical Activity Programs for All Americans: A Statement for Health Professionals by the Committee on Exercise and Cardiac Rehabilitation of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=857–62 |year=1996 |last1=Fletcher |first1=G.F |last2=Balady |first2=G |last3=Blair |first3=S.N. |last4=Blumenthal |first4=J |last5=Caspersen |first5=C |last6=Chaitman |first6=B |last7=Epstein |first7=S |last8=Froelicher |first8=E.S.S |last9=Froelicher |first9=V.F. |last10=Pina |first10=I.L |last11=Pollock |first11=M.L |url=https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1345&context=sph_epidemiology_biostatistics_facpub }}</ref> According to the [[American Heart Association]], exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref name=aha2017 />

=== Immune system ===
Although there have been hundreds of studies on physical exercise and the [[immune system]], there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness.<ref name="Gleeson2007" /> [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human [[immune system]]; an effect which is modeled in a [[J curve]]. Moderate exercise has been associated with a 29% decreased incidence of [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence.<ref name="Gleeson2007" /> However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections.

It may seem difficult for one to reconcile that acute provision of CaHMB, in the absence of exogenous nutrition (i.e. EAA's) and following an overnight fast, is still able to elicit a robust, perhaps near maximal stimulation of MPS, i.e. raising the question as to where the additional AA's substrates required for supporting this MPS response are coming from. It would appear that the AA's to support this response are derived from endogenous intracellular/plasma pools and/or protein breakdown (which will increase in fasted periods).&nbsp;... To conclude, a large single oral dose (~3&nbsp;g) of Ca-HMB robustly (near maximally) stimulates skeletal muscle anabolism, in the absence of additional nutrient intake; the anabolic effects of Ca-HMB are equivalent to FA-HMB, despite purported differences in bioavailability (Fig. 4).| year = 2018 }}</ref><ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review">{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Adv.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and multiple anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=BK|title=Muscle as a secretory organ|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|date=July 2013|volume=3|issue=3|pages=1337–62|pmid=23897689|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|isbn=978-0-470-65071-4}}</ref> Exercise reduces levels of [[cortisol]], which causes many health problems, both physical and mental.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen S, Williamson GM| title = Stress and infectious disease in humans | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 109 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | year = 1991 | pmid = 2006229 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.109.1.5 }}</ref> Endurance exercise before meals lowers [[Blood_sugar_level|blood glucose]] more than the same exercise after meals.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Borer KT, Wuorinen EC, Lukos JR, Denver JW, Porges SW, Burant CF| title = Two bouts of exercise before meals but not after meals, lower fasting blood glucose | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 1606–14 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19568199 | doi = 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31819dfe14 }}</ref> There is evidence that vigorous exercise (90–95% of [[VO2 max|VO<sub>2</sub> max]]) induces a greater degree of physiological [[cardiac hypertrophy]] than moderate exercise (40 to 70% of VO<sub>2</sub> max), but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wisløff U, Ellingsen Ø, Kemi OJ|s2cid = 25057561| title = High=Intensity Interval Training to Maximize Cardiac Benefit of Exercise Taining? | journal =  Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews| volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 139–46 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19550205 | doi = 10.1097/JES.0b013e3181aa65fc }}</ref> Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training).

=== Central nervous system ===
{{Further|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Neuroplasticity}}
The effects of physical exercise on the [[central nervous system]] are mediated in part by specific [[neurotrophic factor]] [[myokine|hormones that are released into the blood stream by muscles]], including [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]], [[insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF-1]], and [[vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]].<ref name="Exercise – neurotrophic factors + basal ganglia">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paillard T, Rolland Y, de Souto Barreto P | title = Protective Effects of Physical Exercise in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease: A Narrative Review | journal = J Clin Neurol | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 212–219 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26174783 | pmc = 4507374 | doi = 10.3988/jcn.2015.11.3.212 | quote = Aerobic physical exercise (PE) activates the release of neurotrophic factors and promotes angiogenesis, thereby facilitating neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which in turn improve memory and cognitive functions.&nbsp;...

The aim of the current meta-analysis was to provide an estimate of the strength of the association between exercise and increased BDNF levels in humans across multiple exercise paradigms. We conducted a meta-analysis of 29 studies (N = 1111 participants) examining the effect of exercise on BDNF levels in three exercise paradigms: (1) a single session of exercise, (2) a session of exercise following a program of regular exercise, and (3) resting BDNF levels following a program of regular exercise. Moderators of this effect were also examined. Results demonstrated a moderate effect size for increases in BDNF following a single session of exercise (Hedges' g = 0.46, p < 0.001). Further, regular exercise intensified the effect of a session of exercise on BDNF levels (Hedges' g = 0.59, p = 0.02). Finally, results indicated a small effect of regular exercise on resting BDNF levels (Hedges' g = 0.27, p = 0.005).&nbsp;...

In addition to BDNF, the actions of IGF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (54) are considered essential for the angiogenic and neurogenic effects of exercise in the brain. Although the action of exercise on brain angiogenesis has been known for many years (10), it is not until recently that neurovascular adaptations in the hippocampus have been associated with cognitive function (29). Exercise enhances the proliferation of brain endothelial cells throughout the brain (113), hippocampal IGF gene expression (47), and serum levels of both IGF (178) and VEGF (63). IGF-1 and VEGF, apparently produced in the periphery, support exercise induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis, as corroborated by blocking the effects of exercise using antibodies against IGF-1 (47) or VEGF (63).| isbn = 978-0-470-65071-4 }}</ref><ref name="Cerebral hemodynamics and AD">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarumi T, Zhang R | title = Cerebral hemodynamics of the aging brain: risk of Alzheimer disease and benefit of aerobic exercise | journal = Front Physiol | volume = 5 | pages = 6 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24478719 | pmc = 3896879 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00006 | quote = Exercise-related improvements in brain function and structure may be conferred by the concurrent adaptations in vascular function and structure. Aerobic exercise increases the peripheral levels of growth factors (e.g., BDNF, IFG-1, and VEGF) which cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and stimulate neurogenesis and angiogenesis (Trejo et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Fabel et al., 2003; Lopez-Lopez et al., 2004). Consistent with this, exercise-related enlargement of hippocampus was accompanied by increases in cerebral blood volume and capillary densities (Pereira et al., 2007). Enhanced cerebral perfusion may not only facilitate the delivery of energy substrates, but also lower the risk of vascular-related brain damages, including WMH and silent infarct (Tseng et al., 2013). Furthermore, regular aerobic exercise is associated with lower levels of Aβ deposition in individuals with APOE4 positive (Head et al., 2012), which may also reduce the risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds (Poels et al., 2010).}}</ref>

=== Social and cultural variation ===
[[File:Nordic walking Sauvakävelyä Vallilassa edited.jpg|thumb|"[[Nordic walking]]" combining poles and walking in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], 2008]]
Exercising looks different in every country, as do the motivations behind exercising.<ref name="Fitness for Foreigners" /> In some countries, people exercise primarily indoors, while in others, people primarily [[Outdoor fitness|exercise outdoors]]. People may exercise for personal enjoyment, health and well-being, social interactions, competition or training, etc. These differences could potentially be attributed to a variety of reasons including geographic location and social tendencies.

In Colombia, for example, citizens value and celebrate the outdoor environments of their country. In many instances, they utilize outdoor activities as social gatherings to enjoy nature and their communities. In Bogotá, Colombia, a 70-mile stretch of road known as the Ciclovía is shut down each Sunday for bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders and other exercisers to work out and enjoy their surroundings.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hernandez|first1=Javier|title=Car-Free Streets, a Colombian Export, Inspire Debate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24streets.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Ciclov%C3%ADa&st=cse|website=NY Times|publisher=NY Times|date=24 June 2008}}</ref>

Similarly to Colombia, citizens of [[Cambodia]] tend to exercise socially outside. In this country, public gyms have become quite popular. People will congregate at these outdoor gyms not only to utilize the public facilities, but also to organize aerobics and dance sessions, which are open to the public.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Nicky|title=Gyms|url=https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/cambodia/phnom_penh_and_surrounds/phnom_penh/phnom_penh/2235|website=Travel Fish|publisher=Travel Fish|access-date=8 December 2016}}</ref>

Sweden has also begun developing outdoor gyms, called ''utegym''. These gyms are free to the public and are often placed in beautiful, picturesque environments. People will swim in rivers, use boats, and run through forests to stay healthy and enjoy the natural world around them. This works particularly well in Sweden due to its geographical location.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tatlow|first1=Anita|title=When in Sweden...making the most of the great outdoors!|url=http://www.stockholmonashoestring.com/when-in-sweden-making-the-most-of-the-great-outdoors/|website=Stockholm on a Shoestring|publisher=Stockholm on a Shoestring|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

Exercise in some areas of China, particularly among those who are retired, seems to be socially grounded. In the mornings, dances are held in public parks; these gatherings may include Latin dancing, ballroom dancing, tango, or even the jitterbug. Dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact, allowing for both health and social benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Langfitt|first1=Frank|title=Beijing's Other Games: Dancing In The Park|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93503524|website=National Public Radio|publisher=National Public Radio|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

These sociocultural variations in physical exercise show how people in different geographic locations and social climates have varying motivations and methods of exercising. Physical exercise can improve health and well-being, as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty.<ref name="Fitness for Foreigners" />

== Nutrition and recovery ==
Proper [[nutrition]] is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of [[Macronutrient (nutrition)|macronutrients]] while providing ample [[micronutrient]]s, in order to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kimber N. |author2=Heigenhauser G. |author3=Spriet L. |author4=Dyck D. | year = 2003 | title = Skeletal muscle fat and carbohydrate metabolism during recovery from glycogen-depleting exercise in humans | journal =  The Journal of Physiology| volume = 548 | issue = 3| pages = 919–27 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2002.031179|pmid=12651914 |pmc=2342904 }}</ref>

Active recovery is recommended after participating in physical exercise because it removes [[lactic acid|lactate]] from the blood more quickly than inactive recovery. Removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature, which can also benefit the immune system, as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise.<ref name="pmid16195010">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reilly T, Ekblom B | title = The use of recovery methods post-exercise | journal = J.

The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was [[Cicero|Marcus Cicero]], Roman politician and lawyer, who stated: "It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inspirational-quotes-and-quotations.com/quotes-about-exercise.html |title=Quotes About Exercise Top 10 List }}</ref> Exercise was also seen to be valued later in history during the [[Early Middle Ages]] as a means of survival by the [[Germanic peoples]] of Northern Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/history.html|title=History of Fitness|website=www.unm.edu|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>

More recently, exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century. After 1860, Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford and instituted a training regimen for 12 military officials at the university.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physical-culture#toc249304|title=physical culture|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref> This regimen was assimilated into the training of the [[British Army]], which formed the [[Royal Army Physical Training Corps|Army Gymnastic Staff]] in 1860 and made sport an important part of military life.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUJHMQAACAAJ|title=Fit to Fight: A History of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps 1860–2015|last=Bogdanovic|first=Nikolai|date=2017-12-19|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|isbn=978-1-4728-2421-9|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-m_CwAAQBAJ|title='The Army Isn't All Work': Physical Culture and the Evolution of the British Army, 1860–1920|last=Campbell|first=James D.|date=2016-03-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-04453-6|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuRw08WgowQC|title=Sport and the Military: The British Armed Forces 1880–1960|last1=Mason|first1=Tony|last2=Riedi|first2=Eliza|date=2010-11-04|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-78897-7|language=en}}</ref> Several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well. The first and most significant of these in the UK was the Women's League of Health and Beauty, founded in 1930 by [[Mary Bagot Stack]], that had 166,000 members in 1937.<ref name=FitnessLeague>{{cite web|title=The Fitness League History |url=http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |website=The Fitness League |access-date=8 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729135514/http://www.thefitnessleague.com/about-us/the-fitness-league-history |archive-date=29 July 2009 }}</ref>

The link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was further established in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by [[Jerry Morris]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The man who invented exercise|newspaper=Financial Times|date=11 September 2009|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e6ff90ea-9da2-11de-9f4a-00144feabdc0.html|access-date=12 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="Morris1953">{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris JN, Heady JA, Raffle PA, Roberts CG, Parks JW | title = Coronary heart-disease and physical activity of work | journal = Lancet | volume = 262 | issue = 6795 | pages = 1053–57 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13110049 | pmc = <!--none--> | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(53)90665-5 }}</ref> Dr. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease.<ref name="Morris1953" />

Studies of animals indicate that physical activity may be more adaptable than changes in food intake to regulate [[energy homeostasis|energy balance]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zhu | first1 = S. | last2 = Eclarinal | first2 = J. | last3 = Baker | first3 = M.S. | last4 = Li | first4 = G. | last5 = Waterland | first5 = R.A. | year = 2016 | title = Developmental programming of energy balance regulation: is physical activity more "programmable" than food intake? | journal = Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 73–77 | doi=10.1017/s0029665115004127| pmid = 26511431| doi-access = free }}</ref>
