During the 1980s and again in the 1990s it was suggested at times that the process of making asbestos cement could "neutralize" the asbestos, either via chemical processes or by causing cement to attach to the fibers and changing their physical size; subsequent studies showed that this was untrue, and that decades-old asbestos cement, when broken, releases asbestos fibers identical to those found in nature, with no detectable alteration.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2007/hsl0711.pdf Investigation of the chrysotile fibres in an asbestos cement sample (2006) - HSL/2007/11], p.26 onward</ref>

==Risks==
Exposure to asbestos in the form of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is [[friable]], or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. However, in general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.

According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], "A history of asbestos exposure at work is reported in about 70 percent to 80 percent of all cases. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos."<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/images/Documents/67e63bef-d6e0-4c0f-9c7a-e8aa56ed969c/fs6_36.pdf Mesothelioma: Questions and Answers], National Cancer Institute</ref> A paper published in 1998, in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, concurs, and comments that asbestosis has been reported primarily in asbestos workers, and appears to require long-term exposure, high concentration for the development of the clinical disease. There is also a long latency period (the time taken between harmful contact and emergence of the actual resulting illness) of about 12 to 20 years,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Asbestosis and Silicosis |pmid=9603153|year=1998|last1=Mossman|first1=BT|last2=Churg|first2=A|volume=157|issue=5 Pt 1|pages=1666–80|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.157.5.9707141|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/143a/4d1348def50c03d904494f46235ff0f7f220.pdf}}</ref> and potentially up to 40 years.

===Asbestos-related diseases===
{{main|Asbestos-related diseases}}
Diseases commonly associated with asbestos include:

*'''[[Asbestosis]]''': Progressive fibrosis of the lungs of varying severity, progressing to bilateral fibrosis, honeycombing of the lungs on radiological view with symptoms including rales and wheezing. Individuals who have been exposed to asbestos via home, environment, or work should notify their doctors about exposure history.
*'''Asbestos warts''': caused when the sharp fibers lodge in the skin and are overgrown causing benign [[callus]]-like growths.
*'''[[Pleural plaques]]''': discrete fibrous or partially calcified thickened area which can be seen on [[X-ray]]s of individuals exposed to asbestos. Although pleural plaques are themselves asymptomatic, in some patients this develops into pleural thickening.
*'''[[Pleural thickening|Diffuse pleural thickening]]''': similar to above and can sometimes be associated with asbestosis. Usually no symptoms shown but if exposure is extensive, it can cause [[lung]] impairment.
*'''[[Pneumothorax]]''': Some reports have also linked the condition of pneumothorax to asbestos related diseases.
*'''[[Malignant mesothelioma]]''': an aggressive and incurable tumour arising from mesothelial cells of the [[pleura]] (the lining of the thoracic cavity).

==Safety and exposure prevention==
Asbestos exposure becomes an issue if asbestos containing materials become airborne, such as due to deterioration or damage. Building occupants may be exposed to asbestos, but those most at risk are persons who purposely disturb materials, such as maintenance or construction workers. Housekeeping or custodial employees may be at an increased risk as they may potentially clean up damaged or deteriorated asbestos containing materials without knowing that the material contains asbestos. Asbestos abatement or remediation workers and emergency personnel such as firefighters may also become exposed.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/asbestos_in_schools.html Asbestos in Schools]. US EPA (28 June 2006). Retrieved 10 January 2012.</ref> Asbestos-related diseases have been diagnosed in asbestos workers' family members, and in residents who live close to asbestos mines or processing plants.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos/health_effects/ Asbestos – Health Effects] ATSDR – Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (1 April 2008). Retrieved 4 June 2013.</ref>

===Common building materials containing asbestos===
Currently in the United States, several thousand products manufactured and/or imported today still contain asbestos.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In many parts of the industrialized world, particularly the European Union, asbestos was phased out of building products beginning in the 1970s with most of the remainder phased out by the 1980s. Even with an asbestos ban in place, however, asbestos may be found in many buildings that were built and/or renovated from the late 1800s through the present day.

Residential building materials containing asbestos include a variety of products, such as: stipple used in textured walls and ceilings; [[drywall joint filler compound]]; asbestos contaminated [[vermiculite]], [[vinyl floor tile]]; vinyl sheet flooring; window [[putty]]; mastic; [[cement board]]; asbestos cement pipes and flues; furnace tape; and [[stucco]]. Asbestos is widely used in roofing materials, mainly corrugated asbestos cement roof sheets and asbestos shingles sometimes called [[transite]]. Other sources of asbestos-containing materials include [[fireproofing]] and [[Architectural acoustics|acoustic materials]].<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/help.html#health Basic Information | Asbestos | [[US EPA]]] (28 June 2006). Retrieved 10 January 2012.</ref>

===Identification and assessment===
A fiber cannot be identified or ruled out as asbestos, either using the naked eye or by simply looking at a fiber under a regular microscope. The most common methods of identifying asbestos fibers are by using [[polarized light microscopy]] (PLM) or [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM). PLM is less expensive, but TEM is more precise and can be used at lower concentrations of asbestos.

If asbestos abatement is performed, completion of the abatement is verified using visual confirmation and may also involve air sampling. Air samples are typically analyzed using [[phase contrast microscopy]] (PCM). PCM involves counting fibers on a filter using a microscope. Airborne occupational exposure limits for asbestos are based on using the PCM method.

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] has a recommended Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for asbestos of 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8-hour shift. OSHA in the United States and occupational health and safety regulatory jurisdictions in Canada use 0.1 fibers/mL over an 8-hour shift as their exposure limits.<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos_exposure_health/detecting.html ATSDR – Asbestos – Detecting asbestos-related health problems]. Atsdr.cdc.gov (1 April 2008). Retrieved 10 January 2012.</ref>

===Environmental asbestos===
Asbestos can be found naturally in the air outdoors and in some drinkable water, including water from natural sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html|title=Centre for disease control article on asbestos |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100114012400/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts61.html| archivedate= 14 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Even nonoccupationally exposed members of the human population have tens to hundreds of thousands of asbestos fibers per gram of dry lung tissue, equivalent to millions of fibers in each lung.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/422880|title=Medscape article on asbestos |publisher=Medscape.com|date=14 February 2002|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120827003359/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/422880| archivedate=27 August 2012| url-status= live}}</ref>

Asbestos from natural geologic deposits is known as "naturally occurring asbestos" (NOA). Health risks associated with exposure to NOA are not yet fully understood, and current US federal regulations do not address exposure from NOA. Many populated areas are in proximity to shallow, natural deposits which occur in 50 of 58 California counties and in 19 other US states. In one study, data was collected from 3,000 mesothelioma patients in California and 890 men with [[prostate cancer]], a malignancy not known to be related to asbestos. The study found a correlation between the incidence of mesotheliomas and the distance a patient lived from known deposits of rock likely to include asbestos; the correlation was not present when the incidence of prostate cancer was compared with the same distances. The risk of mesothelioma declined by 6% for every {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} that an individual had lived away from a likely asbestos source.<ref name=Raloff>{{cite journal|last=Raloff|first=Janet|title=Dirty Little Secret|doi=10.2307/4017077|pages=26–28|volume=170|issue=2|journal=Science News|year=2006|jstor=4017077}}</ref>

Portions of [[El Dorado County, California]] are known to contain natural amphibole asbestos formations at the surface.<ref name=Raloff/><ref>"[http://motherjones.com/environment/2007/05/not-their-back-yard Not in Their Back Yard]", ''Mother Jones'', May/June 2007.</ref> The [[USGS]] studied amphiboles in rock and soil in the area in response to an EPA sampling study and subsequent criticism of the EPA study. The EPA study was refuted by its own peer reviewers and never completed or published. The study found that many amphibole particles in the area meet the counting rule criteria used by the EPA for chemical and morphological limits, but do not meet morphological requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos. The executive summary pointed out that even particles that do not meet requirements for commercial-grade-asbestos may be a health threat and suggested a collaborative research effort to assess health risks associated with "Naturally Occurring Asbestos."

However, the main criticism pointed at EPA was that their testing was conducted in small isolated areas of El Dorado where there were no amphibole asbestos deposits, thus the language regarding amphibole, nonfibrous "particles". Actual surface amphibole deposits in residential areas were ignored for testing purposes. Because of this, no final findings were published by ATSDR.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=G.P.|last2=Lowers|first2=H.A.|last3=Swayze|first3=G.A.|last4=Van Gosen|first4=B.S.|title=Mineralogy and Morphology of Amphiboles Observed in Soils and Rocks in El Dorado Hills, California|date=December 2006|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2006/1362/|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|last5=Stutley|first5=S.J.|last6=Brownfield|first6=I.K.}}</ref>

A great deal of [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] was also found to be underlaid with tremolite. The county monitored air quality at construction sites, controlled soil taken from affected areas, and required freshly developed sites to lay {{convert|6|in|mm}} of clean, stable material over the ground.<ref name=Raloff/>

Globally, samples collected from Antarctic ice indicate chrysotile asbestos has been a ubiquitous contaminant of the environment for at least 10,000 years. Snow samples in Japan have shown ambient background levels are one to two orders of magnitude higher in urban than in rural areas. Higher concentrations of airborne asbestos fibers are reported in urban areas where there is more ACM (asbestos containing materials) and mechanisms of release (vehicles braking and weathering of asbestos cement materials); concentrations in the range of 1–20&nbsp;ng/m<sup>3</sup> have been reported. Fibers longer than 5μm are rarely found in rural areas. Ambient concentrations using [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] analysis have been based on mass measurements.<ref name="godish40"/>

==Biological interactions==

===Mechanisms of carcinogenicity===
Stanton and Layard hypothesized in 1977–78 that toxicity of fibrous materials is ''not'' initiated by ''chemical'' effects;<ref>Stanton, M.F. and Layard, M. (1978). ''The carcinogenicity of fibrous minerals''. National Bureau of Standards Special Publication 506 – from Gaitherburg conference of July 1977.</ref> that is, any trigger-effects of asbestos must presumably be ''physical'', such as mechanical damage which might disrupt normal cell activity—especially [[mitosis]].

There is experimental evidence that very slim fibers (<60&nbsp;nm, <0.06 μm in breadth) tangle destructively with chromosomes (being of comparable size).<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3109/10915819009078762| title = Mechanisms of Asbestos Carcinogenicity| journal = International Journal of Toxicology| volume = 9| issue = 5| pages = 541–550| year = 1990| last1 = Voytek | first1 = P. | last2 = Anver | first2 = M. | last3 = Thorslund | first3 = T. | last4 = Conley | first4 = J. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = E. | citeseerx = 10.1.1.823.6195 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author = Toyokuni S|year = 2009|title = Mechanisms of asbestos-induced carcinogenesis|journal = Nagoya J. Med. Sci.|volume = 71|issue = 1–2| pages = 1–10|pmid = 19358470}}</ref> This is likely to cause the sort of mitosis disruption expected in cancer.

===Chemistry===
[[File:Anthophyllite asbestos SEM.jpg|thumb|right|Asbestos fibers ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] micrograph)]]
Individual asbestos fibers are invisible to the unaided [[human eye]] because their size is about 3–20&nbsp;μm wide and can be as slim as 0.01&nbsp;μm. Fibers ultimately form because when these minerals originally cooled and crystallized, they formed by the polymeric molecules lining up parallel with each other and forming oriented [[crystal structure|crystal lattices]]. These crystals thus have three [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage planes]], and in this case, there are two cleavage planes which are much weaker than the third. When sufficient force is applied, they tend to break along their weakest directions, resulting in a linear fragmentation pattern and hence a fibrous form. This fracture process can keep occurring and one larger asbestos fiber can ultimately become the source of hundreds of much thinner and smaller fibers.

When fibers or asbestos structures from asbestos containing materials (ACM) become airborne, the process is called primary release. Primary release mechanisms include [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], [[wikt:impaction|impaction]], fallout, air [[erosion]], vibration, and fire damage. Secondary release occurs when settled asbestos fibers and structures are resuspended as a result of human activities. In unoccupied buildings or during unoccupied periods, fiber release typically occurs by fallout or is induced by vibration or air erosion.<ref name="godish40">{{cite book|last=Godish|first=Thad|title=Indoor Environmental Quality|year=2001|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56670-402-1|page=40}}</ref>

Friability of a product containing asbestos means that it is so soft and weak in structure that it can be broken with simple finger crushing pressure. Friable materials are of the most initial concern because of their ease of damage. The forces or conditions of usage that come into intimate contact with most non-friable materials containing asbestos are substantially higher than finger pressure.

===Smoking and asbestos===
Smoking has a supra-additive effect in increasing the risk of lung cancer in those exposed to asbestos.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Asbestos, asbestosis, smoking, and lung cancer. New findings from the North American insulator cohort |doi=10.1164/rccm.201302-0257OC|pmid=23590275|year=2013|last1=Markowitz|first1=SB.|last2=Levin|first2=SM.|last3=Miller|first3=A|journal=[[Am J Respir Crit Care Med]]|volume=188|issue=1|pages=90–96}}</ref> Studies have shown an increased risk of lung cancer among [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] who are exposed to asbestos compared to nonsmokers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Combined Effect Of Asbestos Exposure And Smoking On Mortality From Lung Cancer In Factory Workers |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(72)91867-3|year=1972|last1=Berry|first1=G.|last2=Newhouse|first2=Muriell.|last3=Turok|first3=Mary|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=300|issue=7775|pages=476–479}}</ref>

==History of health concerns and regulation==
''For additional chronological citations, see also, [[List of asbestos disease medical articles]]''

===Until 1900===
Early concern in the modern era on the health effects of asbestos exposure can be found in several sources. Among the earliest were reports in Britain. The annual reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories in 1898 included a report from [[Lucy Deane Streatfeild|Lucy Deane]] which stated that asbestos had "easily demonstrated" health risks.<ref>Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, "Annual Report of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops for the Year 1898", 1899, cited in Tweedale referenced below</ref><ref name=DeaneReport>{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Lucy|title="Report on the health of workers in asbestos and other dusty trades" in HM Chief Inspector of Factories and Workshops, 1899, Annual Report for 1898|year=1899|publisher=HMSO London|pages=171–172}}</ref>

At about the same time, what was probably the first study of mortality among asbestos workers was reported in France.<ref>Auribault, D. (1906) "Note sur l'Hygiène et la Sécurité des Ouvriers dans les Filatures et Tissages d'Amianté (On hygiene and security of the workers in the spinning and weaving of asbestos)" in Le Bulletin de l'Inspection du Travail, pp 120–132. This summary was given by Brodeur and roughly confirmed by Merewether & Price in the report cited below.</ref> While the study describes the cause of death as [[chalicosis]], a generalized pneumoconiosis, the circumstances of the employment of the fifty workers whose death prompted the study suggest that the root cause was asbestos or mixed asbestos-cotton dust exposure.

===1900s–1910s===
[[File:Ferruginous body.jpg|thumb|right|[[Micrograph]] demonstrating [[asbestosis]] of the lung ([[ferruginous bodies]]). [[H&E stain]].]]
Awareness of asbestos-related diseases can be found in the early 1900s, when London doctor H. Montague Murray conducted a post mortem exam on a young asbestos factory worker who died in 1899. Dr. Murray gave testimony on this death in connection with an industrial disease compensation hearing. The post-mortem confirmed the presence of asbestos in the lung tissue, prompting Dr. Murray to express as an expert opinion his belief that the inhalation of asbestos dust had at least contributed to, if not actually caused, the death of the worker.<ref>Murray, H. M. (1907) testimony before the Departmental Committee on Compensation for Industrial Diseases "Minutes of Evidence, Appendices and Index", p. 127 cited and summarized in Merewether & Price (1930).</ref>

The record in the United States was similar. Early observations were largely anecdotal in nature and did not definitively link the occupation with the disease, followed by more compelling and larger studies that strengthened the association. One such study, published in 1918, noted:

:All of these processes unquestionably involve a considerable dust hazard, but the hygienic aspects of the industry have not been reported upon. It may be said, in conclusion, that in the practice of American and Canadian [[life insurance]] companies, asbestos workers are generally declined on account of the assumed health-injurious conditions of the industry.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hoffman, F. L. |year=1918|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/3865 |title=Mortality from Respiratory Diseases in Dusty Trades|journal= Bulletin of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|volume= 231|pages=176–180}} Mr. Hoffman was a professional statistician, employed by Prudential with an international reputation on public health matters.</ref>

===1920s–1930s===
Widespread recognition of the occupational risks of asbestos in Britain was reported in 1924 by a Dr. Cooke, a pathologist, who introduced a case description of a 33-year-old female asbestos worker, [[Nellie Kershaw]], with the following: "Medical men in areas where asbestos is manufactured have long suspected the dust to be the cause of chronic bronchitis and fibrosis&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cooke, W. E. |title=Fibrosis of the Lungs Due to the Inhalation of Asbestos Dust|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3317.147|year=1924|pmc=2304688|pmid=20771679|issue=3317|pages=147–140.2}}</ref> Dr. Cooke then went on to report on a case in 1927 involving a 33-year-old male worker who was the only survivor out of ten workers in an asbestos [[carding]] room. In the report he named the disease "asbestosis".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cooke|first1=W. E.|title=Pulmonary Asbestosis|journal=BMJ|volume=2|year=1927|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3491.1024|issue=3491|pmid=20773543|pmc=2525313|pages=1024–5}}</ref>

Dr. Cooke's second case report was followed, in the late 1920s, by a large public health investigation (now known as the Merewether report after one of its two authors) that examined some 360 asbestos-textile workers (reported to be about 15% of the total comparable employment in Britain at the time) and found that about a quarter of them suffered from pulmonary fibrosis.<ref>Merewether, E.R.A. and Price, C.

The first known U.S. workers' compensation claim for asbestos disease was in 1927. In 1930, the first reported autopsy of an asbestosis sufferer was conducted in the United States and later presented by a doctor at the [[Mayo Clinic]], although in this case the exposure involved mining activities somewhere in South America.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mills, R.

In 1930, the major asbestos company Johns-Manville produced a report, for internal company use only, about medical reports of asbestos worker fatalities.<ref name="Castleman"/> In 1932, a letter from U.S. Bureau of Mines to asbestos manufacturer [[Eagle-Picher]] stated, in relevant part, "It is now known that asbestos dust is one of the most dangerous dusts to which man is exposed."<ref name=Brodeur>{{cite book|author=Brodeur, Paul|title=Outrageous Misconduct: The Asbestos Industry on Trial|edition=1st|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0-394-53320-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/outrageousmiscon00brod}}</ref>

In 1933, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. doctors found that 29% of workers in a Johns-Manville plant had asbestosis.<ref name="Castleman"/> Likewise, in 1933, Johns-Manville officials settled lawsuits by 11 employees with asbestosis on the condition that the employees' lawyer agree to never again "directly or indirectly participate in the bringing of new actions against the Corporation."<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1934, officials of two large asbestos companies, Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan, edited an article about the diseases of asbestos workers written by a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company doctor. The changes downplayed the danger of asbestos dust.<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1935, officials of Johns-Manville and Raybestos-Manhattan instructed the editor of ''Asbestos'' magazine to publish nothing about asbestosis.<ref name=Brodeur/> In 1936, a group of asbestos companies agreed to sponsor research on the health effects of asbestos dust, but required that the companies maintain complete control over the disclosure of the results.<ref name="Castleman"/>

===1940s===
In 1942, an internal Owens-Corning corporate memo referred to "medical literature on asbestosis&nbsp;... scores of publications in which the lung and skin hazards of asbestos are discussed."<ref name="Castleman">[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 195.</ref> Testimony given in a federal court in 1984 by Charles H. Roemer, formerly an employee of Unarco, described a meeting in the early 1940s between Unarco officials, J-M President [[Lewis H. Brown]] and J-M attorney Vandiver Brown. Roemer stated, "I'll never forget, I turned to Mr. Brown, one of the Browns made this crack (that Unarco managers were a bunch of fools for notifying employees who had asbestosis), and I said, 'Mr. Brown, do you mean to tell me you would let them work until they dropped dead?' He said, 'Yes. We save a lot of money that way.'"<ref>Testimony of Charles H.

===1950s===
In 1951, asbestos companies removed all references to cancer before allowing publication of research they sponsored.<ref>[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 71.</ref> In 1952, Dr. Kenneth Smith, Johns-Manville medical director, recommended (unsuccessfully) that warning labels be attached to products containing asbestos. Later, Smith testified: "It was a business decision as far as I could understand&nbsp;... the corporation is in business to provide jobs for people and make money for stockholders and they had to take into consideration the effects of everything they did and if the application of a caution label identifying a product as hazardous would cut into sales, there would be serious financial implications."<ref>[[#Castleman|Castleman]], p. 666</ref>

In 1953, National Gypsum's safety director wrote to the Indiana Division of Industrial Hygiene, recommending that [[acoustic plaster]] mixers wear respirators "because of the asbestos used in the product." Another company official noted that the letter was "full of dynamite" and urged that it be retrieved before reaching its destination. A memo in the files noted that the company "succeeded in stopping" the letter, which "will be modified."<ref>[[#Castleman|Castleman]], pp. 669–70.</ref>

===1960s–1980s===
Through the 1970s, asbestos was used to fireproof roofing and flooring, for heat insulation, and for a variety of other purposes. The material was used in fire-check partitioning and doors on North Sea Oil Production Platforms and Rigs.

During the mid-to late 1980s, public health concern focused on potential asbestos fiber exposures of building occupants and workers in buildings containing asbestos containing building materials (ACBM) and their risks of developing lung cancer or mesothelioma. As a consequence, the Health Effects Institute (Cambridge, MA) convened a panel to evaluate the lifetime cancer risk of general building occupants as well as service workers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100322222814/http://www.asbestos-institute.ca/reviews/hei-ar/hei-ar.html Asbestos in Public and Commercial Buildings: A Literature Review and Synthesis of Current Knowledge (1991)]. asbestos-institute.ca</ref>

In 1989 the EPA issued the Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule but in 1991, asbestos industry supporters challenged and overturned the ban in a landmark lawsuit: ''Corrosion Proof Fittings v. the Environmental Protection Agency''. Although the case resulted in several small victories for asbestos regulation, the EPA ultimately did not put an end to asbestos use. This ruling leaves many consumer products that can still legally contain trace amounts of asbestos.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, blue and brown asbestos materials were banned outright in 1985 while the import, sale and second hand reuse of white asbestos was outlawed in 1999. The 2012 Control of Asbestos Regulations state that owners of non-domestic buildings (e.g., factories and offices) have a "duty to manage" asbestos on the premises by making themselves aware of its presence and ensuring the material does not deteriorate, removing it if necessary. Employers, e.g. construction companies, whose operatives may come into contact with asbestos must also provide annual asbestos training to their workers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm |title=Control of Asbetstos Regulations 2012 |publisher=Health and Safety Executive (HSE) |accessdate=2012}}</ref>

North-west of Nelson, in the Upper Takaka Valley is New Zealand's only commercially harvested asbestos mine.  A low-grade Chrysotile was mined here from 1908 to 1917 but only 100 tons was washed and taken out by packhorse. A new power scheme enabled work to renew and between 1940 and 1949, 40 tons a month was mined by the Hume Company. This continued to 1964, when, due to the short length of its fibre, the limited commercial viability forced mining to cease.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=GRA18980108.2.14|title=National Library of New Zealand|work=Grey River Argus, Volume LVII, Issue 9871, 8 January 1898, Page 4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Cobb : the history of the Cobb River hydro-electric power scheme|last=Blair|first=AK|publisher=Cadsonbury Publications, Christchurch, 1998|year=1994|isbn=978-0477016995|location=Christchurch, New Zealand|pages=67–69, 71–72, 100–101}}</ref>

===Delayed recognition===
[[File:Russian made asbestos, after 1983.jpg|thumb|Soviet made asbestos, after 1983. No EHS information.]]
In a 1998 paper, medical historian Peter Bartrip examines why awareness and legislation appear to have lagged unduly, compared to evidence of the risks of asbestos.<ref name="bartrip">{{Cite journal|title=Too little, too late? The home office and the asbestos industry regulations, 1931|last=Bartrip|first=Peter|journal=Med. Hist.|volume=42|issue=4|pages=421–438|year=1998|publisher=The Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|location=London|issn=0025-7273|pmid=10505397|pmc=1044071|doi=10.1017/s0025727300064334}}</ref> The paper concludes by agreeing with a previous paper ('Asbestos: a chronology of its origins and health effects', British Journal of Independent Medicine, 1990) and the 1930 report of Edward Mereweather (a factory medical inspector involved in the legislative investigations of the time), that despite theories suggesting a [[coverup]] and historical evidence that could be cobbled together after the fact, it is more likely that the issue was one of [[hindsight]].

According to Bartrip, Mereweather's 1930 report identified six relevant issues:<ref name="bartrip" />{{rp|p.422}}
# Significant commercial exploitation of asbestos was still relatively new.
# The industry was small and employed comparatively few workers, particularly in dusty processes.
# The disease developed slowly and unobtrusively.
# The disease was easily confused with tuberculosis.
# Affected workers left the industry and therefore fell out of sight of Factory Inspectors. (Gee, below, states that studies "focused on factories, rather than users")
# Medical research had concentrated on dusts containing free silica.

There had been earlier discussion, notably a few brief comments by Factory Inspectors Adelaide Anderson and Edgar Collis during 1898–1911, described by Bartrip as minor reports of no great substance in otherwise very large reports about factory workers.<ref name="bartrip" />{{rp|p.423–424}} As a result, he concludes that between 1898 and the late 1920s, all that can be said is that, "the dangers of the material were slowly beginning to be appreciated".<ref name="bartrip" />{{rp|p.423–424}} As of 1927, the Senior Medical Inspector had reported that the effect of asbestos dust inhalation "was as yet imperfectly understood".<ref name="bartrip" />{{rp|p.422–423}}

A second paper, by Gee & Greenberg, noted additional factors:<ref name="gee">{{Cite journal|title=Asbestos: from 'magic' to malevolent mineral|last1=Gee|first1=David|last2=Greenberg|first2=Morris|journal=Late Lessons from Early Warnings: The Precautionary Principle 1896–2000|publisher=[[European Environment Agency|EEA]]|location=Copenhagen|date=9 January 2002|issue=22|pages=52–63|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental_issue_report_2001_22/issue-22-part-05.pdf|isbn=978-92-9167-323-0|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>
#  The discovery of carcinogenicity of smoking at approximately the same time as the 1950s asbestos studies, had made it far harder to prove a proposed [[causative]] link for asbestos.
# [[Anecdotal evidence]] and [[hearsay]] noted by local doctors and inspectors, was not pursued or taken seriously.
# "Negative" cancer studies were used, which are poor at detecting statistically significant pathology rates unless they include follow-up for around 30 years.
# A "latency lacuna" exists and contributes to complacency (also reported by Knox 1965) – as the consequences of exposure take decades to arise, by the time they occur it is possible to argue convincingly that "standards have improved" and that therefore the risk is eliminated; however this in turn is not confirmed for another 30 years by which time the same argument can be raised again. Compared to short-term needs, a "speculative" risk not yet confirmed may carry less weight, until long after the time when action could be taken.
# Long term surveys and sanction regimes failed to match short term pressures within politics, nor those within industry; in the case of asbestos they were inadequate.
# [[fallacy|Fallacious]] arguments were used, such as the observation that many asbestos workers remained healthy into old age as evidence of lack of risk or lack of harm. As even the most harmful occupation can have numerous apparent healthy survivors this is an example of "absence of evidence" being interpreted as "evidence of absence".
# As late as 1967, even ''[[The Lancet]]'' was capable of writing that "it would be ludicrous to outlaw this valuable and often irreplaceable material in all circumstances (as) asbestos can save more lives than it can possibly endanger".

==Litigation==
{{globalize|section|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Asbestos and the law}}
Litigation related to asbestos is regarded as one of the largest litigation cases in legal history in terms of duration, claim size, and scope. Factors responsible for this include:
# ''Asbestos use was extremely widespread:'' It was used across many sectors, countries, industries and uses. It was also widespread in society itself, being used not in limited "niche" areas but within many everyday products, in housing, fire protection, and even decorative material such as [[Artex]], as well as numerous other ways. Over 50% of homes in some countries contained asbestos even after its ban there.<ref name="guardian2011">Don, Andrew (1 May 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/may/01/asbestos-hidden-health-hazard Asbestos: the hidden health hazard in millions of homes]. ''The Guardian''.</ref> So it was somewhat ubiquitous;
# ''Knowledge or suspicion of health issues existed for a long time:'' The health issues related to asbestos were known, suspected, or reported, for decades, with modern medical coverage dating back to the 19th century.
# ''Impact was severe, and included factors that tend to lead to high claims:'' serious and fatal disease; also apart from death the costs include long term care and disability, care costs, lifetime loss of income, and other high value compensations.
# ''Relatively easy to be at risk:'' asbestos-related diseases are caused by inhaling tiny airborne fibers, therefore any activity related to asbestos that led to loose dust or fibers could potentially cause disease (''Secondary asbestosis''). As a result, illness occurred not only in the widespread primary industries using asbestos, such as the asbestos mining and processing businesses, but also across industries that might handle their products (construction and demolition, repairs, fire safety), persons who disturbed asbestos products in their homes or workplaces, and even those who laundered clothing used by asbestos workers.<ref>[http://www.mesothelioma-attorney.com/asbestos/exposure-to-asbestos/secondary-exposure Household Members of Asbestos-Exposed Workers at Risk of Secondary Exposure]. mesothelioma-attorney.com</ref>
# ''Illnesses arise long after exposure:'' asbestos related diseases can arise decades after actual exposure.
# ''Asbestos industry alleged misconduct:'' alleged concealing, distorting, and suppressing of risk related information, by asbestos related businesses.

{{As of|1999}}, trends indicate that the worldwide rate at which people are diagnosed with asbestos-related diseases will likely increase through the next decade.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bianchi|first1=C|last2=Bianchi|first2=T|title=Malignant mesothelioma: global incidence and relationship with asbestos|url=http://www.jniosh.go.jp/en/indu_hel/pdf/379_Bianchi.pdf|journal=Industrial Health|volume=45|issue=3|pages=379–87|year=2007|pmid=17634686|doi=10.2486/indhealth.45.379|access-date=2017-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105437/http://www.jniosh.go.jp/en/indu_hel/pdf/379_Bianchi.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-22|url-status=dead}}.

In the United States, asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass [[tort]] in U.S. history, involving more than 8,400 defendants and 730,000 claimants as of 2002 according to the [[RAND Corporation]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG162.html|title=Asbestos Litigation|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8330-3078-8|publisher=Rand.org|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> and at least one defendant reported claim counts in excess of $800,000 in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131738&p=irol-sec&secCat01Enhanced.1_rs=41&secCat01Enhanced.1_rc=10#4485611|title=Enpro Public Filings|publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>

The federal legal system in the United States has dealt with numerous counts of asbestos-related suits, which often included multiple plaintiffs with similar symptoms. In 1999 there were 200,000 related cases pending in the federal court system of the United States.<ref>United States. Cong. Hearing: Asbestos Litigation. 107th Cong., 2nd sess. HRG.107-993. Washington: GPO, 2002.</ref> Further, it is estimated that within the next 40 years, the number of cases may increase to 700,000. These numbers help explain how there are thousands of current pending cases. Litigation of asbestos materials has been slow. Companies sometimes counter saying that health issues do not currently appear in their worker or workers, or sometimes are settled out of court.<ref>Carroll, Stephen J., Deborah Hensler, Allan Abrahamse, Jennifer Gross, Michelle White, Scott Ashwood, and Elizabeth Sloss (2002). Asbestos Litigation Costs and Compensation. Santa Monica,CA: RAND.</ref>

The volume of the asbestos liability has concerned manufacturers and [[insurance industry|insurers and reinsurers]].<ref>American Academy of Acturaries' Mass Torts Subcommittee (August 2007) [http://www.actuary.org/pdf/casualty/asbestos_aug07.pdf "Overview of Asbestos Claims Issues and Trends"]. pp. 7–8</ref> The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

In 1999 the United States considered but did not enact the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act.<ref name = "lxkrvq">United States. Cong. Senate. Finding Solutions to the Asbestos Litigation Problem: the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999. 106th Cong., 1st sess. S.758. Washington: GPO, 1999.</ref> Between 1981 and the present, many asbestos companies have filed for bankruptcy.<ref>[http://www.crowell.com/pdf/AsbestosChart1.pdf Chart of Bankrupt Asbestos manufacturers and distributors]. crowell.com</ref> While companies filed for bankruptcy, this limited payouts to those who were actually affected by the material. [[Christopher Edley, Jr.]] commented what the 1999 act ultimately would have done if passed would be to "limit punitive damages that seek retribution for the decisions of long-dead executives for conduct that took place decades ago."<ref name = "lxkrvq"/>

Litigation exists outside the United States in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] among other nations (though the amounts awarded in these countries are not as large as in the US). See the [[Asbestos and the law|companion article]] for further information.

In Australia a significant and controversial case was brought against the industrial building materials company [[James Hardie]], which had mined and sold asbestos related products for many years.

==Criticisms of asbestos regulation==
Criticisms of regulation include the discredited suggestion by [[Dixy Lee Ray]] that the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] disintegrated because the maker of [[O-ring]] putty was pressured by the EPA into ceasing production of asbestos-laden putty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehr|first=Jay H., editor|title=Rational Readings on Environmental Concerns |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |year=1992 |page=119 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LsXmMHOT8VsC&pg=PA119 |isbn=978-0-442-01146-8}}</ref><ref name=Challenger>{{cite web|url=http://info-pollution.com/challenger.htm |title=Asbestos and Challenger Disaster |publisher=Info-pollution.com|date=9 February 1986|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> However, the putty used in ''Challenger''{{'}}s final flight contained asbestos, and failures in the putty were not responsible for the failure of the O-ring that led to loss of the shuttle.<ref name=Challenger/><ref>Oberg, James (25 January 2011) [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11031097 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster]. NBC News</ref>

Asbestos was also used in the first forty floors of the World Trade Center north tower causing an airborne contamination among lower Manhattan after the towers collapsed in the [[September 11 attacks]], causing  [[Steven Milloy]] of the [[libertarian]] [[Cato Institute]] to suggest that the World Trade Center towers could still be standing or at least would have stood longer had a 1971 ban not stopped the completion of the asbestos coating above the 64th floor.<ref>Milloy, Steven (18 January 2007) [http://prwatch.org/prwissues/2001Q4/junkman.html The Junkman's Answer to Terrorism: Use More Asbestos] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513041843/http://prwatch.org/prwissues/2001Q4/junkman.html |date=2013-05-13 }}. prwatch.org. 2001</ref><ref>Milloy, Steven (18 January 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120110014532/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244698,00.html Asbestos Fireproofing Might Have Prevented World Trade Center Collapse]. Fox News Channel.</ref> This was not considered in the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s report on the towers' collapse, on the basis that all fireproofing materials, regardless of their construction, are required to obtain a [[fire-resistance rating]] prior to installation, and all fiber-based lightweight commercial spray fireproofing materials are vulnerable to the [[wikt:dispersion|dispersive]] effects of [[kinetic energy|high speed/high energy impacts]], as these are outside the [[fire test]]ing upon which all ratings are based. Therefore, asbestos would have made little or no difference in preventing the towers' collapse, if used as fireproofing, and upon collapse any asbestos, however used, would still have been largely dispersed into the air within the massive dust cloud.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031210161931/http://info-pollution.com/wtc.htm Asbestos and the WTC collapse]. info-pollution.com</ref><ref>Wright, R.
