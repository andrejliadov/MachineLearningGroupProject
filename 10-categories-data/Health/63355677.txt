====Justin Turner controversy====
During the 2020 MLB season, teams endured multiple outbreaks. In their handling of positive tests, many teams complied with updated protocols, making sure that infected team members were not spreading the virus to other players, coaching staff, and members of the organization. Compliance lapsed when one of the players, [[2020 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] third baseman [[Justin Turner]], who had a positive COVID-19 case, stormed the field after the Dodgers won the [[2020 World Series]]. After being ordered into isolation and failing to comply with the rules - by running onto the field, taking photos, and hugging players - Turner, the Dodgers, and MLB received unwanted backlash from fans and the media around the world.<ref name=":110">{{Cite web|last=Williams Davis|first=Bradford|date=28 October 2020|title=Justin Turner and the Dodgers ruined their title celebration with reckless behavior|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/ny-20201028-jlpdxlwoh5eytcr6avn6jgso2u-story.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=New York Daily News}}</ref>

After an MLB investigation, no further action was taken against Turner or the Dodgers; however, there were reportedly five positive tests among other members of the organization.

Turner's diagnosis was announced late in the Dodgers' Game 6 eventual win.  It has been speculated that the World Series would have faced significant delays if the [[2020 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] had won and forced a Game 7.

The ''Tapology'' website, which tracks MMA fights worldwide, reported that the worldwide number of sanctioned MMA fights dropped by over 80% from 2019 to 2020, as measured from 1 March to 1 September of each year. The U.S. saw an even greater drop in total fights during that time frame. During the March–September 2019 period, [[Zuffa]], the parent company of UFC, accounted for 4.4% of U.S. MMA fights. The company was responsible for more than 20% of U.S. MMA fights during the same period in 2020—despite only running [[UFC 248|one event]] in the country in March, April, or July. Boxing also saw slightly less dramatic declines in the same period; the ''BoxRec'' website reported a drop in total bouts of over 65% worldwide and over 55% in the U.S.<ref name=Raimondi/>

On 1 December, the [[Norwegian Ski Federation]] (NSF) announced that they would not send any skiers to take part in the World Cup events in [[Davos]], Switzerland, and [[Dresden]], Germany, in December, and possibly not take part in the [[Tour de Ski]], which is planned to begin on 1 January 2021. [[Espen Bjervig]], manager of the NSF's cross-country section said the decision was based on "the risk of travelling, we have experienced that keeping distance and avoiding close contact in the World Cup arena is more demanding than we first assumed”, and that "endurance athletes have their lungs as a tool, and we do not know the after-effects of COVID-19. Therefore, we must take precautions".<ref>{{cite web |last1=O’Connor |first1=Philip |title=Norway pull out of World Cup events over COVID-19 fears |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-nordic-skiing-worldcup/norway-pull-out-of-world-cup-events-over-covid-19-fears-idUKKBN28B5O6 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date=3 December 2020 |date=1 December 2020}}</ref>

On 2 December, the Swedish Ski Association and the [[Finnish Ski Association]] announced that they would mirror Norway's decision, and not send any skiers to the events in Davos and Dresden.

If it's not given it's going to be hard to find (competition) arrangers in the future", and added that "Of course all nations must make their own decisions.

On 16 April 2020, the PGA Tour announced a condensed schedule for a proposed resumption of play on 11 June with the [[Charles Schwab Challenge]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. It aims to play most of the remaining tournaments of the [[2019–20 PGA Tour|2019–20 season]] (preserving at least three quarters of the original schedule in total), concluding with the [[FedEx Cup Playoffs]] and the season-ending [[Tour Championship]] on [[Labor Day]] weekend, followed immediately by the beginning of the 2020–21 season (which will have a modified early-season schedule to accommodate the rescheduled majors) with the [[Safeway Open]]. Officials planned the events behind closed doors, although most events were held at courses with residences and/or rental units, and residents were allowed to "attend" the events from their yards on their property, or in the case of the RBC Heritage, from boats traveling the Calibogue Sound.

In July 2020, the [[Big Ten Conference]] and [[Pac-12 Conference]] — two of the "[[Power Five conferences|Power Five]]" [[List of college athletic conferences in the United States|conferences]] in Division I FBS — announced that if fall sports and the [[2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2020 season]] were played, all games would be played against conference opponents only. Other Power Five conferences have been expected to potentially follow suit. In the second level of Division I football, the [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS), the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], [[Ivy League]], [[MEAC]], and [[Patriot League]] have cancelled all fall semester sports (although the CAA is still allowing teams to compete independently if they so choose).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gantt|first=Darin|date=17 July 2020|title=CAA suspends fall football, but some schools may try to play|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/07/17/caa-suspends-fall-football-but-some-schools-may-try-to-play/|access-date=18 July 2020|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Scarborough |first=Alex |date=13 July 2020 |title=Patriot League cancels fall sports due to coronavirus |url=https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/29455357/source-patriot-league-cancel-fall-sports |access-date=17 July 2020 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715020826/https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/29455357/source-patriot-league-cancel-fall-sports |archive-date=15 July 2020}}</ref><ref name=":02">{{cite web |date=11 July 2020 |title=What do Pac-12 and Big Ten decisions mean for college football? |url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29442565/what-do-pac-12-big-ten-decisions-mean-college-football |access-date=11 July 2020 |website=ESPN.com |language=en |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713071837/https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29442565/what-do-pac-12-big-ten-decisions-mean-college-football |archive-date=13 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=MEAC-SWAC 2020 football matchups in Atlanta canceled|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/meac-swac-2020-football-matchups-in-atlanta-canceled/TSNUIF3BUFFR3FE5F34K6EQVQA/|access-date=18 July 2020|website=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|language=English}}</ref>

The [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|FBS independent]] [[2020 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] cancelled its [[Emerald Isle Classic]] game in Ireland [[Navy–Notre Dame football rivalry|against]] [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]], rescheduling it at [[Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]] before it was eventually canceled outright. It also saw three marquee games cancelled due to the Big Ten and Pac-12 restrictions, including a [[Notre Dame–USC football rivalry|long-running rivalry game against USC]]); Notre Dame's head coach [[Brian Kelly (American football coach)|Brian Kelly]] stated that the team was evaluating alternatives, and hinted at the possibility of playing additional games against trams from the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), where Notre Dame is a member outside of football and ice hockey (as part of its membership, Notre Dame usually schedules five games per-season against ACC opponents).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Brian Kelly: 'there's plenty of games for us to play'|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Brian-Kelly-Notre-Dame-Fighting-Irish-says-there-are-plenty-of-games-for-them-to-play-in-the-2020-college-football-season-conference-only-schedule-ACC--149176687/|access-date=17 July 2020|website=247Sports|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2 June 2020|title=Notre Dame-Navy game moved from Ireland|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/29254539/notre-dame-navy-game-moving-ireland-maryland|accessdate=14 June 2020|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref>

The [[2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season]] became bifurcated, with schools in the ACC, [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], and [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] committing to play their usual fall seasons with the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing.  In addition, Notre Dame is playing a full schedule of ACC games (plus one non-conference contest), with the ACC scrapping its usual division structure.

However, a dramatic series of events occurred in September:
*The Big Ten announced on 16 September that it would indeed play in the fall, with the first game set for 23 October.<ref>{{cite web|date=16 September 2020|title=Big Ten football to announce 2020 season will start on October 24 with daily rapid testing|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-ten-football-to-announce-2020-season-will-start-oct-24-with-daily-rapid-testing/?ftag=SPM-16-10abi8e|accessdate=18 September 2020|website=CBSSports.com|language=en}}</ref>  Each team will play eight games.
*Presidents of Pac-12 colleges voted on 24 September to move up its football season to fall, with a seven-game schedule per school starting on 6 November.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilner|first=Jon|date=24 September 2020|title=Pac-12 football returns: CEOs vote to restart 2020 season|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/24/pac-12-football-returns-ceos-vote-to-restart-2020-season/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_content=tw-mercnews&utm_medium=social|accessdate=26 September 2020|website=San Jose Mercury News|language=en}}</ref>
*On the same day, the [[Mountain West Conference]] agreed to advance its football season to the fall.  The first games are scheduled for 24 October and each team will play seven games.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 September 2020|title=Mountain West Football Season to Begin on October 24|url=https://themw.com/news/2020/9/25/2020-mountain-west-football-season-to-begin-on-october-24.aspx|accessdate=26 September 2020|website=Mountain West Conference|language=en}}</ref>
*On 25 September, the [[Mid-American Conference]] also revealed its plan to go ahead with fall games starting on 4 November and with six games per team.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 September 2020|title=MACtion is Back!|url=https://getsomemaction.com/news/2020/9/25/football-maction-is-back.aspx|accessdate=26 September 2020|website=Mid-American Conference|language=en}}</ref>
*In all instances, the only opponents are within each conference.

That left only three FBS programs with no plans to play during the usual season: [[UConn Huskies football|Connecticut]], [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]], and [[Old Dominion Monarchs football|Old Dominion]].

The NCAA is considering a plan in which any team could be eligible to play in a [[bowl game|postseason]], regardless of team records, and allowing games to honour contracts with conferences since the six-win threshold would have been reached by some teams with non-conference games that were cancelled, and thereby making it based on conference records.<ref>{{cite web|date=24 September 2020|title=Waiving bowl qualification requirements recommended|url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/waiving-bowl-qualification-requirements-recommended|accessdate=26 September 2020|website=NCAA.com|language=en}}</ref>

As of 16 December 114 regular-season games were postponed or canceled due to COVID-19 outbreaks throughout the season.{{efn|That does not include the game between [[2020 Utah State Aggies football team|Utah State]] and [[2020 Colorado State Rams football team|Colorado State]] that was not played when USU refused to travel as a political protest against their school president.  In addition, the game between [[2020 Appalachian State Mountaineers football team|Appalachian State]] and [[2020 Marshall Thundering Herd football team|Marshall]] was incorrectly reported as postponed; it was played on 19 September.}}  The highest for a single week was 18, in the week before the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]] holiday.  The [[2020 Houston Cougars football team|University of Houston program]] was the most affected, with eight games postponed, canceled, or rescheduled.  The worst outbreak by program was at [[2020 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], which had 27 combined cases, including players and head coach [[Paul Chryst]], and had consecutive games canceled.  Later, a third Badger game was scrapped - the [[Paul Bunyan's Axe|Battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe]] against [[2020 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] - making them ineligible to participate in the [[Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten championship game]].  (The game was later rescheduled for 19 December; otherwise, this would have been the first season since 1906 in which the game was not played.) The school was investigated for possible violations of the conference protocol regarding COVID-19, but no violations were found.<ref>{{Cite web|date=29 October 2020|title=Badgers report 16 active cases of COVID-19|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/30219261/wisconsin-badgers-football-program-16-active-cases-covid-19|access-date=7 December 2020|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref>  Later that season, the [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry|rivalry game]] between [[2020 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] and [[2020 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] was scrapped due to a large number of cases in the Wolverines' program; the last time that game wasn't played was 1916.  That should have made the Buckeyes ineligible to play in the Big Ten title game; however, the conference later changed its rule to allow the Buckeyes to represent the East Division in the game, with [[2020 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] being the opponent.  The [[Old Oaken Bucket]] game between [[2020 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue]] and [[2020 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]] was canceled on 13 December due to outbreaks at both schools; the last year the game wasn't played was 1919.

In the U.S., horse racing gained an increased following as a form of live sports content on television, with efforts by the [[New York Racing Association]] and [[TVG Network]] (which also reached agreements with [[Fox Sports 1]] and [[NBCSN]] respectively to help fill schedules with simulcast programming) to try and attract new viewers and customers for [[off-track betting]] at tracks still in operation. Mainstream attention to horse racing in the United States is usually focused upon the Triple Crown, and to a lesser degree the Breeders' Cup. Simulcasts also increased the prominence of lesser-known venues such as [[Fonner Park]] in [[Grand Island, Nebraska]] — which saw its average daily [[Parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] handle surpass its previous single-day record of US$1.2 million on a regular basis.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|title=Minnesota-fed horse racing network seizes moment almost all its own|url=https://www.startribune.com/horse-racing-network-seizes-a-moment-nearly-all-its-own/569364752/|website=Star Tribune|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=":16">{{Cite web|title=Fonner Park, in the heart of Nebraska, is now the center of the horse racing world|url=https://www.theindependent.com/news/local/fonner-park-in-the-heart-of-nebraska-is-now-the-center-of-the-horse-racing/article_ad3bbef6-8afe-11ea-9e21-bf815b9059f0.html|website=The Grand Island Independent|language=en|access-date=24 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title="The Only Game in Town": Horse Racing Handle Up 176% Per Day in April|url=https://www.actionnetwork.com/horse-racing/horse-racing-betting-handle-surge-coronavirus|last=|first=|date=7 May 2020|website=The Action Network|language=en-US|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>
