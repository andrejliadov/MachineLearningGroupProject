[[Dance]] is a health-promoting [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] which many people worldwide incorporate into their lifestyles today. This physical activity appeals to some who may not typically be active and therefore may be another alternative of exercise.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Ravelin|first1=Teija|last2=Kylmä|first2=Jari|last3=Korhonen|first3=Teija|title=Dance in mental health nursing: a hybrid concept analysis|journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing|date=2006|volume=27|issue=3|pages=307–317|doi=10.1080/01612840500502940|pmid=16484172}}</ref> Dance for health has become an important factor in the prevention, treatment and management in several health circumstances.

==Uses  of dance==
===Physical health and fitness===
[[File:Ellsworth Zumba demo.JPG|thumb|Ellsworth Zumba demo.]]
Dancing can be a way to stay fit for people of all ages, shapes and sizes, having a wide range of physical, and mental benefits including improved condition of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s, increased [[muscular strength]], [[endurance]] and motor fitness, increased aerobic fitness, improved [[muscle tone]] and [[Physical strength|strength]], weight management, stronger bones and reduced risk of [[osteoporosis]], better coordination, [[agility]] and flexibility, improved balance and spatial awareness, increased physical confidence, improved [[Mind|mental]] functioning, improved general and [[psychological]] well being, greater [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], and better social skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/dance-health-benefits|title=Dance - health benefits|first=Department of Health & Human|last=Services}}</ref>
Most forms of dance may be considered [[aerobic exercise]] and as such can also reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], help [[weight control]], [[stress reduction]], and bring about other benefits commonly associated with [[physical fitness]]. In addition, studies have demonstrated a considerable correlation between dancing and psychological well-being. A large amount of governmental, health, and educational information is available extolling the benefits of dance for health.<ref>[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ Dance and health: The benefits for people of all ages.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121061245/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ |date=21 January 2016 }} Jointly from the British National Health Service and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport</ref>

'''Benefits of Cultural dance'''
Physical activity has many physical and mental health outcomes; however, physical inactivity continues to be common. Dance, specifically cultural dance, is a type of physical activity that may appeal to some who are not otherwise active and can be a form of activity that is more acceptable than others in certain cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olvera|first1=Anna E.|title=Cultural Dance and Health|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=2008|volume=39|issue=6|pages=353–359|doi=10.1080/19325037.2008.10599062}}</ref>

For those with [[Hypercholesterolemia|hypercholesterolaemia]], dancing - in conjunction with diet and medication such as [[statin]]s - can provide positive health benefits. As an [[aerobic exercise]] abridged levels of total blood cholesterol, especially in [[LDL cholesterol]], acknowledged as bad and helps boost levels of HDL or good [[cholesterol]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://whatisusa.info/10-benefits-of-dance-for-health/|title=Ten biggest benefits of dancing|publisher=What is USA News|date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=2013-11-19}}</ref> Dancing in general increases muscle strength and flexibility, which in turn, improves overall range of motion. Dance also increases core strength which can improve balance, coordination, and posture (which can, in turn, reduce mechanical back pain).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Sheila A.|title=Health and the Power of Dance|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation & Dance|date=2008|volume=79|issue=4|pages=33–36|doi=10.1080/07303084.2008.10598161}}</ref>

===Mental health===
Dance has been repeatedly shown to positively impact a person's [[mental health]]. A 2013 [[randomised control trial]] focusing on whether dance intervention influenced self-rated health for adolescent girls with internalizing problems found that ''"... despite problems such as stress and other potential challenges in being an adolescent girl, dance can result in high adherence and a positive experience for the participants"''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Duberg A |author2=Hagberg L |author3=Sunvisson H |author4=Möller M |title=Influencing Self-rated Health Among Adolescent Girls With Dance Intervention |journal=JAMA Pediatrics |date=2013 |pages=27–31 |volume=167 |issue=1 |doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.421|pmid=23403597 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The girls who took the dance classes were more likely to report improved mental health and a boost in mood than those who did not, and positive effects lasted up to eight months after the classes ended.

Additionally, a 2009 study explored the use of [http://www.wutaodance.com Wu Tao Dance] as a therapy for people with dementia. It was shown that Wu Tao dance helped to reduce symptoms of agitation in people with dementia.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/mental-health-nurses/exploring-dance-as-a-therapy-for-symptoms-and-social-interaction-in-a-dementia-care-unit-30-07-2009/ |title=Exploring dance as a therapy for symptoms and social interaction in a dementia care unit |date=30 July 2009 |publisher=nursingtimes.net}}</ref> The complex mental coordination involved with dancing activates both sensory and motor circuits. Therefore, when one dances, one's brain is both stimulated by the sound of the music and by the dance movements themselves. PET imaging has shown brain regions that become activated during dance learning and performance, including the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/brain-newsletter/and-brain-series/dancing-and-brain|title=Dancing and the Brain - Department of Neurobiology|website=neuro.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Secondary source, with primary source not cited.|date=January 2020}} The benefits of dancing on the brain includes [[memory improvement]] and strengthened neural connections. Consequently, not only can dance help to reduce symptoms experienced by those with dementia, but it can also reduce the risk of developing dementia in the first place, as shown in a 2003 study in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' by researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Verghese|first1=Joe|last2=Lipton|first2=Richard B.|last3=Katz|first3=Mindy J.|last4=Hall|first4=Charles B.|last5=Derby|first5=Carol A.|last6=Kuslansky|first6=Gail|last7=Ambrose|first7=Anne F.|last8=Sliwinski|first8=Martin|last9=Buschke|first9=Herman|s2cid=2729699|date=2003-06-19|title=Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=348|issue=25|pages=2508–2516|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa022252|issn=0028-4793|pmid=12815136}}</ref>

In addition to improving symptoms of dementia and preventing dementia, frequent dancing can even lead to increased cognitive acuity for individuals of all ages. However, not all kinds of dancing has this power. Those dance styles that allow for the most split-second decisions are the most beneficial; those dance styles with the same, memorized patterns are the least beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/smarter.htm|title=Dancing Makes You Smarter|website=socialdance.stanford.edu}}</ref> For the same reason, those who take the Follow role have a higher opportunity for improving their cognitive acuity since they must make constant split-second decisions as they follow their partner's lead. The key for improving cognitive acuity is to create new neural connections to increase the complexity of our neuronal synapses. Another important consideration is that the frequency of dancing matters. The more frequent an individual dances, the greater the cognitive improvement.

Furthermore, many cultures agree that there is a mind and body connection, and many cultures use dance to heal this often damaged connection. During the African diaspora, individuals used dance therapy to treat the trauma that resided from their situations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Monteiro|first1=Nicole M.|last2=Wall|first2=Diana J.|title=African Dance as Healing Modality Throughout the Diaspora: The Use of Ritual and Movement to Work Through Trauma|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|date=2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=234–252|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251237748}}</ref> Dance therapy is suggested for patients today as treatment for emotional and therapeutic support, as dance allows individuals to connect with their inner-self.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/dance-therapy|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine - American Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.org}}</ref>

==Damage of dance==
There are various health risks of professional dance, as it can be very demanding. As well as [[sports injuries]], [[repetitive strain injury]], and chronic [[workplace stress]]. Dancers risk injury within the course of their career, many retiring from active performance in their mid to late 30s. Since dance is a [[performance art]] with emphasis on [[aesthetics]], dancers are also at a higher risk of [[body image]] problems and [[eating disorders]] such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia]].<ref>

Some dances, such as ballet, are very strenuous on the body. Research shows that dancers in elite pre-professional companies have 1.38 injuries per 1000 hours of dancing, with dancers averaging about 30.3 hours per week. The most common injury was to the lower extremities, with ankle being the most common. The injuries on average took about 7 days to heal with foot injuries taking the longest at 14 days and thigh injuries being the lowest at 2 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ekegren|first1=Christina L.|last2=Quested|first2=Rachele|last3=Brodrick|first3=Anna|title=Injuries in pre-professional ballet dancers: Incidence, characteristics and consequences|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date=2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=271–275|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.013|pmid=23988783}}</ref> Another risk dancers face are eating disorders.  They are constantly judged based on their looks and expected to have toned, slim bodies.  This can lead to a lot of health risks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://au-di-tions.com/anorexia-and-dance-looking-for-the-perfect-body-in-dance/|title=Anorexia and Dance.

Many dance [[Movement (music)|movements]], and particularly [[ballet technique]]s, such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] of the hips and rising on the toes ([[en pointe]]), test the limits of the range of movement of the human body. Dance movements can place stress on the body when not performed correctly; even if perfect form is used, over-repetition can cause [[repetitive strain injury]]. The most common injuries for ballet dancers is snapping hip syndrome and foot and ankle injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-teacher.com/2010/08/10-common-dance-injuries/|title=How to Prevent These 10 Common Dance Injuries|date=2 January 2018}}</ref> Foot and ankle injuries are vulnerable to a wide range of injuries including, stress fractures, tendon injuries, sprains and strains. Much of this is due to not only the emphasis of footwork in dance but also the foot wear. Dancers either wear pointe shoes, bare feet, a soft shoe of some kind or heels, all of which offer no support. Shoulder injuries can be common in male dancers due to lifting, partnering and floor work that is commonly seen in modern dance. The periscapular muscles assist in keeping the shoulder still and steady, these muscles are at greater risk for injuries among dancers.<ref>Kotraba, Robert. "Shoulder Injuries in Dancers". Recovery Physical Therapy, Recovery Physical Therapy, 22 June 2014, www.recoverypt.com/shoulder-injuries-in-dancers/. Accessed 3 Nov.</ref>

Examined in the ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', dancers often put off consultation from doctors or physical therapists in the effort to stay employed by a dance company or to stay in rehearsals. When in fact those dancers that "work through" their pain more often than not end up worsening their symptoms and prolonging their recovery. Eighty percent of professional dancers will be injured in some way during their careers; 50 percent of dancers from large ballet companies and 40 percent from small companies will miss performances due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|last=Machleder |first=Elaine |year=2000 |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |title=Avoiding Injury: It's A Science |publisher=Dance Spirit Magazine |accessdate=2006-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092055/http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |archivedate=19 March 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Overwork and poor [[occupational health and safety]] conditions, a (non-[[sprung floor|sprung]]) hard floor, a cold studio or theater, or dancing without sufficient [[warm up]] also increases risk of injury. To minimize injury, dance training emphasizes strength building and forming appropriate [[Habit (psychology)|habit]]s. Choreographers and dance instructors will often put certain demands on their students and dancers without taking into consideration that each dancer is faced with different anatomical limitations. Dancers will strive to achieve the ideal aesthetic in their respective dance technique by over compensating for their limitations and thus presenting themselves with a higher risk for injury. Damage may also result from having a student perform movements for which they are not prepared, care must be taken that the student is not "pushed" inappropriately.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance and health|url=http://pole-acrobatics.info/lexicon/dance-and-health.html|website=Pole-acrobatics.info|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>

A dancer put [[pointe technique|en pointe]] at an age where his or her bones have not completely [[ossified]] may develop permanent damage; even past the point of ossification, ankle injuries can result if a dancer goes en pointe without sufficient strength. According to a study conducted by Rachele Quested and Anna Brodrick, the lower extremities are the most vulnerable to injury. The most common injury is to the ankle, then leg, foot, knee, hip and finally the thigh. Dancers are trained from a very young age to avoid injury by using plie, turn out, and other means to protect their bodies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ekegren|first1=Christina L.|last2=Quested|first2=Rachele|last3=Brodrick|first3=Anna|title=Injuries in pre-professional ballet dancers: Incidence, characteristics and consequences|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date=2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=271–275|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.013|pmid=23988783}}</ref>

Keeping dancers free of injury is a crucial aspect and will help a lifetime of healthy [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and can prevent injuries in the future. By being taught a few simple techniques by parents, teachers, and medical professionals can avert injuries from occurring.

===Stress ===
Professional dancers may experience [[chronic stress|chronic]] [[workplace stress]] due to uncertain work security and shifting work environments. The average income for a ballet dancer is low,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edonline.com/collegecompass/oohb0107.htm | title=Occupational Overview for Dancers and Choreographers | publisher=College Compass}}</ref> and competition for jobs is very high.

=== Body image and disordered eating ===
As with other activities (such as [[jockey|horse jockeying]]) where weight is a factor, dancers are at a higher risk for developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maloney MJ |title=Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in dancers. Accurate diagnosis and treatment planning |journal=Clin Sports Med |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=549–55 |date=November 1983 |pmid=6580964 }}</ref> According to research, dancers about 12% of dancers have eating disorders and 16.4% of ballet dancers have eating disorders.<ref name=":3">Arcelus, Jon; Witcomb, Gemma; Mitchell, Alex (2014): Prevalence of eating disorders amongst dancers: a systemic review and meta-analysis.

Inadequate nutrition in adolescent females has been linked to development of scoliosis, due to decreased oestrogen production and subsequent reduced bone density. A dancer with poor nutrition is at a higher risk for injuries and long-term health problems. A malnourished dancer's performance will be altered and weaken as his or her body starts to break down muscle and bone in order to fuel itself. This puts the dancer at risk for injury and slows healing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance|url=http://orthopedics.childrenscolorado.org/sports-medicine--injuries/sports-injuries-we-treat/dance|publisher=Children's Hospital of Colorado: Orthopedics Institute|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>

==Scientific study of dance==
[[Dance science]] is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health. Dance requires a high degree of interpersonal and motor skills, and yet seems built into humans. It has therefore increasingly become the subject of [[neuroscience|neurological]] studies.

==Uses  of dance==
===Physical health and fitness===
[[File:Ellsworth Zumba demo.JPG|thumb|Ellsworth Zumba demo.]]
Dancing can be a way to stay fit for people of all ages, shapes and sizes, having a wide range of physical, and mental benefits including improved condition of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s, increased [[muscular strength]], [[endurance]] and motor fitness, increased aerobic fitness, improved [[muscle tone]] and [[Physical strength|strength]], weight management, stronger bones and reduced risk of [[osteoporosis]], better coordination, [[agility]] and flexibility, improved balance and spatial awareness, increased physical confidence, improved [[Mind|mental]] functioning, improved general and [[psychological]] well being, greater [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], and better social skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/dance-health-benefits|title=Dance - health benefits|first=Department of Health & Human|last=Services}}</ref>
Most forms of dance may be considered [[aerobic exercise]] and as such can also reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], help [[weight control]], [[stress reduction]], and bring about other benefits commonly associated with [[physical fitness]]. In addition, studies have demonstrated a considerable correlation between dancing and psychological well-being. A large amount of governmental, health, and educational information is available extolling the benefits of dance for health.<ref>[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ Dance and health: The benefits for people of all ages.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121061245/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ |date=21 January 2016 }} Jointly from the British National Health Service and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport</ref>

'''Benefits of Cultural dance'''
Physical activity has many physical and mental health outcomes; however, physical inactivity continues to be common. Dance, specifically cultural dance, is a type of physical activity that may appeal to some who are not otherwise active and can be a form of activity that is more acceptable than others in certain cultures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Olvera|first1=Anna E.|title=Cultural Dance and Health|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=2008|volume=39|issue=6|pages=353–359|doi=10.1080/19325037.2008.10599062}}</ref>

For those with [[Hypercholesterolemia|hypercholesterolaemia]], dancing - in conjunction with diet and medication such as [[statin]]s - can provide positive health benefits. As an [[aerobic exercise]] abridged levels of total blood cholesterol, especially in [[LDL cholesterol]], acknowledged as bad and helps boost levels of HDL or good [[cholesterol]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://whatisusa.info/10-benefits-of-dance-for-health/|title=Ten biggest benefits of dancing|publisher=What is USA News|date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=2013-11-19}}</ref> Dancing in general increases muscle strength and flexibility, which in turn, improves overall range of motion. Dance also increases core strength which can improve balance, coordination, and posture (which can, in turn, reduce mechanical back pain).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Sheila A.|title=Health and the Power of Dance|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation & Dance|date=2008|volume=79|issue=4|pages=33–36|doi=10.1080/07303084.2008.10598161}}</ref>

===Mental health===
Dance has been repeatedly shown to positively impact a person's [[mental health]]. A 2013 [[randomised control trial]] focusing on whether dance intervention influenced self-rated health for adolescent girls with internalizing problems found that ''"... despite problems such as stress and other potential challenges in being an adolescent girl, dance can result in high adherence and a positive experience for the participants"''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Duberg A |author2=Hagberg L |author3=Sunvisson H |author4=Möller M |title=Influencing Self-rated Health Among Adolescent Girls With Dance Intervention |journal=JAMA Pediatrics |date=2013 |pages=27–31 |volume=167 |issue=1 |doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.421|pmid=23403597 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The girls who took the dance classes were more likely to report improved mental health and a boost in mood than those who did not, and positive effects lasted up to eight months after the classes ended.

Additionally, a 2009 study explored the use of [http://www.wutaodance.com Wu Tao Dance] as a therapy for people with dementia. It was shown that Wu Tao dance helped to reduce symptoms of agitation in people with dementia.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.nursingtimes.net/roles/mental-health-nurses/exploring-dance-as-a-therapy-for-symptoms-and-social-interaction-in-a-dementia-care-unit-30-07-2009/ |title=Exploring dance as a therapy for symptoms and social interaction in a dementia care unit |date=30 July 2009 |publisher=nursingtimes.net}}</ref> The complex mental coordination involved with dancing activates both sensory and motor circuits. Therefore, when one dances, one's brain is both stimulated by the sound of the music and by the dance movements themselves. PET imaging has shown brain regions that become activated during dance learning and performance, including the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/brain-newsletter/and-brain-series/dancing-and-brain|title=Dancing and the Brain - Department of Neurobiology|website=neuro.hms.harvard.edu}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Secondary source, with primary source not cited.|date=January 2020}} The benefits of dancing on the brain includes [[memory improvement]] and strengthened neural connections. Consequently, not only can dance help to reduce symptoms experienced by those with dementia, but it can also reduce the risk of developing dementia in the first place, as shown in a 2003 study in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' by researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Verghese|first1=Joe|last2=Lipton|first2=Richard B.|last3=Katz|first3=Mindy J.|last4=Hall|first4=Charles B.|last5=Derby|first5=Carol A.|last6=Kuslansky|first6=Gail|last7=Ambrose|first7=Anne F.|last8=Sliwinski|first8=Martin|last9=Buschke|first9=Herman|s2cid=2729699|date=2003-06-19|title=Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=348|issue=25|pages=2508–2516|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa022252|issn=0028-4793|pmid=12815136}}</ref>

In addition to improving symptoms of dementia and preventing dementia, frequent dancing can even lead to increased cognitive acuity for individuals of all ages. However, not all kinds of dancing has this power. Those dance styles that allow for the most split-second decisions are the most beneficial; those dance styles with the same, memorized patterns are the least beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/smarter.htm|title=Dancing Makes You Smarter|website=socialdance.stanford.edu}}</ref> For the same reason, those who take the Follow role have a higher opportunity for improving their cognitive acuity since they must make constant split-second decisions as they follow their partner's lead. The key for improving cognitive acuity is to create new neural connections to increase the complexity of our neuronal synapses. Another important consideration is that the frequency of dancing matters. The more frequent an individual dances, the greater the cognitive improvement.

Furthermore, many cultures agree that there is a mind and body connection, and many cultures use dance to heal this often damaged connection. During the African diaspora, individuals used dance therapy to treat the trauma that resided from their situations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Monteiro|first1=Nicole M.|last2=Wall|first2=Diana J.|title=African Dance as Healing Modality Throughout the Diaspora: The Use of Ritual and Movement to Work Through Trauma|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|date=2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=234–252|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251237748}}</ref> Dance therapy is suggested for patients today as treatment for emotional and therapeutic support, as dance allows individuals to connect with their inner-self.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/dance-therapy|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine - American Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.org}}</ref>

==Damage of dance==
There are various health risks of professional dance, as it can be very demanding. As well as [[sports injuries]], [[repetitive strain injury]], and chronic [[workplace stress]]. Dancers risk injury within the course of their career, many retiring from active performance in their mid to late 30s. Since dance is a [[performance art]] with emphasis on [[aesthetics]], dancers are also at a higher risk of [[body image]] problems and [[eating disorders]] such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia]].<ref>

Some dances, such as ballet, are very strenuous on the body. Research shows that dancers in elite pre-professional companies have 1.38 injuries per 1000 hours of dancing, with dancers averaging about 30.3 hours per week. The most common injury was to the lower extremities, with ankle being the most common. The injuries on average took about 7 days to heal with foot injuries taking the longest at 14 days and thigh injuries being the lowest at 2 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ekegren|first1=Christina L.|last2=Quested|first2=Rachele|last3=Brodrick|first3=Anna|title=Injuries in pre-professional ballet dancers: Incidence, characteristics and consequences|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date=2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=271–275|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.013|pmid=23988783}}</ref> Another risk dancers face are eating disorders.  They are constantly judged based on their looks and expected to have toned, slim bodies.  This can lead to a lot of health risks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://au-di-tions.com/anorexia-and-dance-looking-for-the-perfect-body-in-dance/|title=Anorexia and Dance.

Many dance [[Movement (music)|movements]], and particularly [[ballet technique]]s, such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] of the hips and rising on the toes ([[en pointe]]), test the limits of the range of movement of the human body. Dance movements can place stress on the body when not performed correctly; even if perfect form is used, over-repetition can cause [[repetitive strain injury]]. The most common injuries for ballet dancers is snapping hip syndrome and foot and ankle injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-teacher.com/2010/08/10-common-dance-injuries/|title=How to Prevent These 10 Common Dance Injuries|date=2 January 2018}}</ref> Foot and ankle injuries are vulnerable to a wide range of injuries including, stress fractures, tendon injuries, sprains and strains. Much of this is due to not only the emphasis of footwork in dance but also the foot wear. Dancers either wear pointe shoes, bare feet, a soft shoe of some kind or heels, all of which offer no support. Shoulder injuries can be common in male dancers due to lifting, partnering and floor work that is commonly seen in modern dance. The periscapular muscles assist in keeping the shoulder still and steady, these muscles are at greater risk for injuries among dancers.<ref>Kotraba, Robert. "Shoulder Injuries in Dancers". Recovery Physical Therapy, Recovery Physical Therapy, 22 June 2014, www.recoverypt.com/shoulder-injuries-in-dancers/. Accessed 3 Nov.</ref>

Examined in the ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', dancers often put off consultation from doctors or physical therapists in the effort to stay employed by a dance company or to stay in rehearsals. When in fact those dancers that "work through" their pain more often than not end up worsening their symptoms and prolonging their recovery. Eighty percent of professional dancers will be injured in some way during their careers; 50 percent of dancers from large ballet companies and 40 percent from small companies will miss performances due to injury.<ref>{{cite web|last=Machleder |first=Elaine |year=2000 |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |title=Avoiding Injury: It's A Science |publisher=Dance Spirit Magazine |accessdate=2006-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092055/http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |archivedate=19 March 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Overwork and poor [[occupational health and safety]] conditions, a (non-[[sprung floor|sprung]]) hard floor, a cold studio or theater, or dancing without sufficient [[warm up]] also increases risk of injury. To minimize injury, dance training emphasizes strength building and forming appropriate [[Habit (psychology)|habit]]s. Choreographers and dance instructors will often put certain demands on their students and dancers without taking into consideration that each dancer is faced with different anatomical limitations. Dancers will strive to achieve the ideal aesthetic in their respective dance technique by over compensating for their limitations and thus presenting themselves with a higher risk for injury. Damage may also result from having a student perform movements for which they are not prepared, care must be taken that the student is not "pushed" inappropriately.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance and health|url=http://pole-acrobatics.info/lexicon/dance-and-health.html|website=Pole-acrobatics.info|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref>

A dancer put [[pointe technique|en pointe]] at an age where his or her bones have not completely [[ossified]] may develop permanent damage; even past the point of ossification, ankle injuries can result if a dancer goes en pointe without sufficient strength. According to a study conducted by Rachele Quested and Anna Brodrick, the lower extremities are the most vulnerable to injury. The most common injury is to the ankle, then leg, foot, knee, hip and finally the thigh. Dancers are trained from a very young age to avoid injury by using plie, turn out, and other means to protect their bodies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ekegren|first1=Christina L.|last2=Quested|first2=Rachele|last3=Brodrick|first3=Anna|title=Injuries in pre-professional ballet dancers: Incidence, characteristics and consequences|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date=2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=271–275|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.013|pmid=23988783}}</ref>

===Stress ===

=== Body image and disordered eating ===
As with other activities (such as [[jockey|horse jockeying]]) where weight is a factor, dancers are at a higher risk for developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maloney MJ |title=Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in dancers.

Inadequate nutrition in adolescent females has been linked to development of scoliosis, due to decreased oestrogen production and subsequent reduced bone density. A dancer with poor nutrition is at a higher risk for injuries and long-term health problems. A malnourished dancer's performance will be altered and weaken as his or her body starts to break down muscle and bone in order to fuel itself. This puts the dancer at risk for injury and slows healing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance|url=http://orthopedics.childrenscolorado.org/sports-medicine--injuries/sports-injuries-we-treat/dance|publisher=Children's Hospital of Colorado: Orthopedics Institute|accessdate=13 June 2013}}</ref>

==Scientific study of dance==
[[Dance science]] is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health. Dance requires a high degree of interpersonal and motor skills, and yet seems built into humans. It has therefore increasingly become the subject of [[neuroscience|neurological]] studies. The July 2008 edition of Scientific American contains a summary of recent studies and further questions.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-neuroscience-of-dance] So You Think You Can Dance?: PET Scans Reveal Your Brain's Inner Choreography. Stephen Brown and Lawrence M. Parsons Scientific American July 2008 vol 299 No. 1 58-63</ref>

shows that dance in Jamaica seems to show evidence of sexual selection and to reveal important information about the dancer.<ref>http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dance-symmetry/ Dance Symmetry Project</ref><ref>[http://anthro.rutgers.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=166 Dance reveals symmetry especially in young men.] Brown, William M., Lee Cronk, Amy Jacobson, Keith Grochow, C.
