The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) estimates that, as of late March 2020, '''the 2019–2020 United States flu season''' had caused at least 39 million flu illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm|title=Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report|date=2020-03-07|access-date=2020-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref> In January 2020, the Director of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases]], Dr. [[Anthony Fauci]] expected the 2019-2020 flu season to be one of the worst in several years, at least as severe as the [[2017–2018 United States flu season|2017-2018 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=2019-2020 Flu Season on Track to Be Especially Severe, New CDC Data Suggests|url=https://time.com/5758953/flu-season-2019-2020/|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref> By the third week in February the seasonal flu was near its peak with over 26 million people sickened, 250,000 hospitalized, and 14,000 who died.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Flu Season That's Sickened 26 Million May Be at Its Peak|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-02-21/flu-season-thats-sickened-26-million-may-be-at-its-peak|last=Thompson|first=Dennis|date=21 February 2020|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref> Experts said that the flu came in two waves, with a hard impact on children. The season began in October, earlier than usual, with the expected wave of influenza B virus. The number of children who died, 105, was higher in late February than any season for the past ten years with about 67% associated with influenza B viruses. The second wave came with the influx of influenza A viruses, such as H1N1.<ref name=":0" /> According to preliminary burden estimates for the 2019-2020 flu season (October 1, 2019 through April 4, 2020) there were between 39 and 56 million flu cases; 18-26 million doctor visits; 410,000 to 740,000 hospitalizations, and between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. Due to higher than average testing this year because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], preliminary estimates may be adjusted down when the flu season is officially closed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Preliminary In-Season 2019-2020 Flu Burden Estimates|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm|last=CDC|date=2020-04-17|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> The unusually abrupt decline in cases by April 2020 was attributed to the effects of widespread social distancing and lockdowns aimed at COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How coronavirus lockdowns stopped flu in its tracks|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01538-8|last=Jones|date=2020-05-21|website=Nature|language=en-us|access-date=2020-08-10}}</ref>
