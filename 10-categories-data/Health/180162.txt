Numerous [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], but few are absolute. These stances span a broad spectrum, based on numerous teachings, deities, or religious print, and some of those views are highlighted below.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC "Religion and Ethics"] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.</ref><ref>[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014915/http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html |date=2011-10-05 }} Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.</ref>

==Baháʼí Faith==
Abortion, for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, and permanent sterilization are generally forbidden by the [[Baháʼí Faith]], unless there is some medical reason for it. At present, Baháʼís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Baháʼí writings.<ref>{{cite book| last =Bahá'u'lláh | author2 =Abdu'l-Bahá |author3=Shoghi Effendi |author4=Universal House of Justice |editor-last =Hornby| editor-first = Helen| title =Lights of Guidance: A Baháʼí Reference File | publisher =New Delhi: Baháʼí Publishing Trust | year =1983 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&chapter=2#n1154 }}</ref>

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative", but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&m=12&p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}</ref>

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.<ref name="Harvey"/> Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus.<ref name="Harvey"/> While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.<ref name="Harvey"/>

There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the "Old Testament" or "New Testament" books of the [[Christian Bible]]. Some scholars have concluded that early Christians took a nuanced stance on what is now called abortion, and that at different times, and in separate places, early Christians have taken different stances.<ref name=autogenerated3>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBN6r3cC6v0C&pg=PA110 When Children Became People: the birth of childhood in early Christianity] by Odd Magne Bakke</ref><ref>[http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm "Abortion and Catholic Thought: The Little-Told History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218195040/http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}</ref><ref name=universityofcalifornia>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SZnZTSQV9EC&pg=PA12 Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood] by Kristin Luker, University of California Press</ref> Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was<ref name="prejudices"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VXGkAhyNGAEC&pg=PA166 Ana S.

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." The BBC goes on to state, "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'."<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] "Hinduism and abortion"</ref> Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.<ref>Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S.

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam and abortion}}
Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins, and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a foetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible.<ref name=PewForum>The Pew Forum. September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.</ref> Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.<ref name=PewForum/><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]</ref>

Some schools of [[Sharia|Muslim law]] permit abortion in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow it in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The [[Quran]] states to not have an abortion for fear of poverty. All schools accept abortion as a means to save the mother's life.<ref>{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Islam: Abortion|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}</ref>

However, while there is no explicit prohibition in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] or the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]], abortion is generally viewed by some Sikhs as forbidden because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]</ref> Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female foetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, "...<nowiki>[the]</nowiki> right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families".<ref>[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904064958/http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml |date=2009-09-04 }}</ref> The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that should be free from interference by the state or politicians.<ref>Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006</ref>
