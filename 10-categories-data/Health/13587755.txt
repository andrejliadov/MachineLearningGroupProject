==Work that poses special risks for young workers==
[[File:Teen Workers - Real Jobs, Real Risks (Mallory's Story) (2009).webm|thumb|A young worker describing a severe occupational injury]]
Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and [[child labor laws]] prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.

[[Child labor]] is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of [[public education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during [[industrialization]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[worker's rights|workers']] and [[children's rights]]. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.<ref name=Furlong>{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=236}}</ref>

===Work in agriculture===
There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrinewspubs.com/Content/Default/Machinery/Article/Keep-kids-safe-on-farm-/-3/102/13392|title=Keep kids safe on farm - AgriNews|website=www.agrinewspubs.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>  About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://southwestfarmpress.com/equipment/farm-related-childhood-deaths-are-down-still-too-many|title=Farm-related childhood deaths are down, but still too many|website=southwestfarmpress.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>  In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the [[agriculture]] sector.<ref name=pop>{{cite journal|last = Windau|first = Janice|author2=Samuel Meyer  |title = Occupational injuries among young workers|journal = Monthly Labor Review|pages = 11–23|date=October 2005|url = http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/10/art2full.pdf|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}</ref> About two thirds of these [[death|fatalities]] could be attributed to [[transportation]] [[accidents]].<ref name=pop/> According to the "Occupational injuries among young workers" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002.<ref name=pop/> For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002.<ref name=pop/> There are fewer [[child labor]] restrictions on family-owned or operated [[farm]]s; workers as young as 13 can legally operate [[tractor]]s on farms if their family owns it or operates it.<ref name=pop/>

Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html|title=Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com|website=CNN|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>

===Work in construction===
Between the years 1998 and 2002, [[construction]] accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities,<ref name=pop/> making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not [[Legal (disambiguation)|legally]] authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site;<ref name=pop/> if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department.<ref name=pop/> Additionally, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector.<ref name=pop/> Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.<ref>{{cite web|last = U.S. Census Bureau|title = Population of the United States by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin, Census 2000 and July 1, 2005| work = National Population Estimates|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| year = 2007|url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762156.html|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}</ref>

===Work in retail trades===
The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the [[retail trade]]s (e.g., [[restaurants]] and retail stores).<ref name="pop" /> Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to [[assaults]] and violent acts, most of which were [[homicides]]. Homicide associated with [[robbery]] is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.<ref>Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999.</ref> Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].<ref>NIOSH [1996a]. Current intelligence bulletin 57: Violence in the workplace; risk factors and prevention strategies. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96–100.</ref>

In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.<ref>Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316–323.</ref> Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.<ref>NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.</ref>
In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current [[child labor laws]] are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], independence, or maturity,<ref>Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens. Newsletter from the teens at work: injury surveillance and prevention project. Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program.</ref> or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.

==U.S. federal and state programs==

===OSHA===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.

=== U.S. Public Health Service ===
The [[U.S. Public Health Service]] has a [[Healthy People 2010|Healthy People 2020]] objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Occupational-Safety-and-Health/objectives#5044|title=Occupational Safety and Health {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>

===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) within the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.

The NIOSH funds the [[National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://youth.gov/federal-links/national-childrens-center-rural-and-agricultural-health-and-safety|title=National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshfieldresearch.org/nccrahs|title=Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation - National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety|website=www.marshfieldresearch.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>

===Federal child labor laws===
A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|a}} The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.

===State child labor laws===

States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|b}}
