'''Fitkid''' (also ''FitKid'', ''Fit Kid'' or ''Fit-Kid'') is a type of children's sport combining [[gymnastics]], [[dance]] and [[acrobatics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fitkid.hu/01/index.php/fitkid-tortenete |title=Fitkid története |access-date=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517072108/http://www.fitkid.hu/01/index.php/fitkid-tortenete |archive-date=2015-05-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It originated in Europe in the 1990s, and is meant to engage children 8–18 years of age in fun individual and group exercise, free of the extremes of more strenuous [[aerobics]] or traditional gymnastics. International competitions are organized regularly by the ''International FitKid Division'', in addition to national competitions. A routine stands of four types of elements: strength, flexibility, acrobatics, and jumps. All elements are graded by difficulty from A to H. {{not a typo|A}} elements being worth 0.1 points, B 0.2, C 0.3, and so on until H which is worth 0.8. Routines get evaluated in three categories: technique, artistry, and content (execution of elements). Competition is divided by age groups (I. to IX. (or Senior in A category)), and categories ( which are based on knowledge). There three categories (from hardest to easiest) A, B, and C, also called Dance. In each categories there are group and individual routines. In C Category (here group routines are also called Dance Show) team member can go from 4 to 8. In A and B category there are duos, small groups (3-4), and big groups (5-6). In C category, individually 4 elements have to be performed ( one from each type), A or B difficulty, and in groups, two are optional. In B category individually  8 elements need to be performed ( two from each type) A-D difficulty ( but max. two elements can be D), and in groups 4 (same as C category individual). In A category team and individual, 8 elements need to be performed (same as B category) and an acrobatic connection is optional. Skills in A category can be any difficulty. <ref>[http://fitkiddivision.org/?page_id=70 Competitions]</ref>
