<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Frostbite''' occurs when exposure to low temperatures causes [[freezing]] of the skin or other tissues.<ref name=Han2017/> The initial symptom is typically numbness.<ref name=Han2017/> This may be followed by clumsiness with a white or bluish color to the skin.<ref name=Han2017/> Swelling or blistering may occur following treatment.<ref name=Han2017/> The hands, feet, and face are most commonly affected.<ref name=Fer2018>{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2018 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323529570|page=502|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGclDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA502|language=en}}</ref> Complications may include [[hypothermia]] or [[compartment syndrome]].<ref name=Mc2014/><ref name=Han2017/>

<!-- Prevention and treatment -->
Prevention is through wearing proper clothing, maintaining [[management of dehydration|hydration]] and nutrition, avoiding low temperatures, and staying active without becoming exhausted.<ref name=Mc2014/> Treatment is by rewarming.<ref name=Mc2014/> This should be done only when refreezing is not a concern.<ref name=Han2017/> Rubbing or applying snow to the affected part is not recommended.<ref name=Mc2014/> The use of [[ibuprofen]] and [[tetanus vaccine|tetanus toxoid]] is typically recommended.<ref name=Han2017/> For severe injuries [[iloprost]] or [[thrombolytic]]s may be used.<ref name=Han2017/> Surgery is sometimes necessary.<ref name=Han2017/> Amputation, however, should generally be delayed for a few months to allow determination of the extent of injury.<ref name=Mc2014>{{Cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=Scott E.|last2=Opacic|first2=Matthew|last3=Freer|first3=Luanne|last4=Grissom|first4=Colin K.|last5=Auerbach|first5=Paul S.|last6=Rodway|first6=George W.|last7=Cochran|first7=Amalia|last8=Giesbrecht|first8=Gordon G.|last9=McDevitt|first9=Marion|date=2014-12-01|title=Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2014 update|journal=Wilderness & Environmental Medicine|volume=25|issue=4 Suppl|pages=S43–54|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2014.09.001|issn=1545-1534|pmid=25498262}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Frostbite.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Frostbite]]
Areas that are usually affected include cheeks, ears, nose and fingers and toes. Frostbite is often preceded by frostnip.<ref name=Mc2014/> The symptoms of frostbite progress with prolonged exposure to cold. Historically, frostbite has been classified by degrees according to skin and sensation changes, similar to burn classifications. However, the degrees do not correspond to the amount of long term damage.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/926249-clinical|title=Frostbite Clinical Presentation|website=emedicine.medscape.com|access-date=2017-03-02|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113905/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/926249-clinical|archive-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> A simplification of this system of classification is superficial (first or second degree) or deep injury (third or fourth degree).<ref name=Zaf2012 />

===First degree===
* First degree frostbite is superficial, surface skin damage that is usually not permanent.
* Early on, the primary symptom is loss of feeling in the skin. In the affected areas, the skin is numb, and possibly swollen, with a reddened border. 
* In the weeks after injury, the skin's surface may slough off.<ref name=":2" />

===Second degree===
* In second degree frostbite, the skin develops clear [[blister]]s early on, and the skin's surface hardens.
* In the weeks after injury, this hardened, blistered skin dries, blackens, and peels.
* At this stage, lasting cold sensitivity and numbness can develop.<ref name=":2" />

===Third degree===
* In third degree frostbite, the layers of tissue below the skin freeze.
* Symptoms include blood blisters and "blue-grey discoloration of the skin".<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Zonnoor B | title = What are the characteristics of third-degree frostbite? | publisher = Medscape | date = 29 July 2019 | url = https://www.medscape.com/answers/926249-117029/what-are-the-characteristics-of-third-degree-frostbite | access-date = 10 May 2020}}</ref>  {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* In the weeks after injury, pain persists and a blackened crust ([[eschar]]) develops.
* There can be longterm [[ulcer]]ation and damage to [[Epiphyseal plate|growth plates]].

=== Fourth degree ===
[[File:Human toes, 12 days post-frostbite.jpg|thumb|Frostbite 12 days later]]
* In fourth degree frostbite, structures below the skin are involved like muscles, tendon, and bone.
* Early symptoms include a colorless appearance of the skin, a hard texture, and painless rewarming.
* Later, the skin becomes black and [[Mummy|mummified]]. The amount of permanent damage can take one month or more to determine. [[Autoamputation]] can occur after two months.<ref name=":2" />

==Causes==
===Risk factors===
The major risk factor for frostbite is exposure to cold through geography, occupation and/or recreation. Inadequate clothing and shelter are major risk factors. Frostbite is more likely when the body's ability to produce or retain heat is impaired. Physical, behavioral, and environmental factors can all contribute to the development of frostbite. Immobility and physical stress (such as malnutrition or dehydration) are also risk factors.<ref name=Han2014/> Disorders and substances that impair circulation contribute, including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Raynaud syndrome|Raynaud's phenomenon]], [[tobacco]] and [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] use.<ref name=Zaf2012 /> Homeless individuals and individuals with some mental illnesses may be at higher risk.<ref name=Han2014/>

==Mechanism==
===Freezing===

In frostbite, cooling of the body causes narrowing of the blood vessels ([[vasoconstriction]]). Temperatures below {{convert|−4|C|F}} are required to form ice crystals in the tissues.<ref name=Zaf2012 /> The process of freezing causes ice crystals to form in the tissue, which in turn causes damage at the cellular level. Ice crystals can damage [[cell membrane]]s directly.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Christoph|last2=Lehnhardt|first2=Marcus|last3=Daigeler|first3=Adrien|last4=Goertz|first4=Ole|date=2017-03-01|title=The Triaging and Treatment of Cold-Induced Injuries|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International|volume=112|issue=44|pages=741–747|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2015.0741|issn=1866-0452|pmc=4650908|pmid=26575137}}</ref> In addition, ice crystals can damage small blood vessels at the site of injury.<ref name=Zaf2012>{{Cite journal|last=Zafren|first=Ken|s2cid=3036889|title=Frostbite: Prevention and Initial Management|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|volume=14|issue=1|pages=9–12|doi=10.1089/ham.2012.1114|pmid=23537254|year=2013}}</ref> [[Scar|Scar tissue]] forms when [[fibroblast]]s replace the dead cells.<ref name=":0" />

===Rewarming===

Rewarming causes tissue damage through [[reperfusion injury]], which involves vasodilation, swelling (edema), and poor blood flow (stasis). [[Platelet|Platelet aggregation]] is another possible mechanism of injury. Blisters and spasm of blood vessels ([[vasospasm]]) can develop after rewarming.<ref name=Zaf2012 />

===Non-freezing cold injury===

The process of frostbite differs from the process of non-freezing cold injury (NFCI). In NFCI, temperature in the tissue decreases gradually. This slower temperature decrease allows the body to try to compensate through alternating cycles of closing and opening blood vessels ([[vasoconstriction]] and [[vasodilation]]). If this process continues, inflammatory [[mast cell]]s act in the area. Small [[Thrombus|clots]] (microthrombi) form and can cut off blood to the affected area (known as [[ischemia]]) and damage nerve fibers. Rewarming causes a series of inflammatory chemicals such as [[prostaglandin]]s to increase localized clotting.<ref name=":0" />

===Pathophysiology===
The pathological mechanism by which frostbite causes body tissue injury can be characterized by four stages: Prefreeze, freeze-thaw, vascular stasis, and the late ischemic stage.<ref name = "WildernessMedical">{{cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=SE|last2=Opacic|first2=M|last3=Freer|first3=L|last4=Grissom|first4=CK|last5=Auerbach|first5=PS|last6=Rodway|first6=GW|last7=Cochran|first7=A|last8=Giesbrecht|first8=GG|last9=McDevitt|first9=M|last10=Imray|first10=CH|last11=Johnson|first11=EL|last12=Dow|first12=J|last13=Hackett|first13=PH|last14=Wilderness Medical|first14=Society.|title=Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of frostbite: 2014 update.|journal=Wilderness & Environmental Medicine|date=December 2014|volume=25|issue=4 Suppl|pages=S43-54|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2014.09.001|pmid=25498262}}</ref>

# Prefreeze phase: involves the cooling of tissues without ice crystal formation.<ref name="WildernessMedical" />
# Freeze-thaw phase: ice-crystals form, resulting in cellular damage and death.<ref name="WildernessMedical" />
# Vascular stasis phase: marked by blood [[coagulation]] or the leaking of blood out of the vessels.<ref name="WildernessMedical" />
# Late ischemic phase: characterized by inflammatory events, [[ischemia]] and tissue death.<ref name="WildernessMedical" />

== Diagnosis ==
Frostbite is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms as described above, and by [[Medical history|patient history]]. Other conditions that can have a similar appearance or occur at the same time include:
* Frostnip is similar to frostbite, but without ice crystal formation in the skin. Whitening of the skin and numbness reverse quickly after rewarming. 
* [[Trench foot]] is damage to nerves and blood vessels that results exposure to wet, cold (non-freezing) conditions. This is reversible if treated early. 
* [[Chilblains|Pernio]] or chilblains are inflammation of the skin from exposure to wet, cold (non-freezing) conditions. They can appear as various types of ulcers and blisters.<ref name=":2" />
* [[Bullous pemphigoid]] is a condition that causes itchy blisters over the body that can mimic frostbite.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.visualdx.com/visualdx/diagnosis/frostbite?diagnosisId=51593&moduleId=8|title=VisualDx - Frostbite|work=VisualDx|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123454/https://www.visualdx.com/visualdx/diagnosis/frostbite?diagnosisId=51593&moduleId=8|archive-date=2017-03-03}}</ref> It does not require exposure to cold to develop. 
* [[Levamisole-induced vasculitis|Levamisole toxicity]] is a [[vasculitis]] that can appear similar to frostbite.<ref name=":4" /> It is caused by contamination of cocaine by [[levamisole]]. Skin lesions can look similar those of frostbite, but do not require cold exposure to occur.

People who have [[hypothermia]] often have frostbite as well.<ref name=":2" /> Since hypothermia is life-threatening this should be treated first. [[Technetium-99m|Technetium-99]] or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MR]] scans are not required for diagnosis, but might be useful for prognostic purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/997.html|title=Frostbite|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304193415/http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/997.html|archive-date=2017-03-04}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
The [[Wilderness Medical Society]] recommends covering the skin and scalp, taking in adequate nutrition, avoiding constrictive footwear and clothing, and remaining active without causing exhaustion. Supplemental oxygen might also be of use at high elevations. Repeated exposure to cold water makes people more susceptible to frostbite.<ref name="pmid26857732">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fudge J | title = Preventing and Managing Hypothermia and Frostbite Injury | journal = Sports Health | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–9 | date = 2016 | pmid = 26857732 | pmc = 4789935 | doi = 10.1177/1941738116630542 }}</ref> Additional measures to prevent frostbite include:<ref name=Mc2014 />
* Avoiding temperatures below −15&nbsp;°C (5&nbsp;°F)
* Avoiding moisture, including in the form of [[Perspiration|sweat]] and/or skin [[Moisturizer|emollients]]
* Avoiding alcohol and drugs that impair circulation or natural protective responses
* Layering clothing
* Using chemical or electric warming devices
* Recognizing early signs of frostnip and frostbite<ref name=Mc2014 />

==Treatment==

Individuals with frostbite or potential frostbite should go to a protected environment and get warm fluids. If there is no risk of re-freezing, the extremity can be exposed and warmed in the groin or underarm of a companion. If the area is allowed to refreeze, there can be worse tissue damage. If the area cannot be reliably kept warm, the person should be brought to a medical facility without rewarming the area. Rubbing the affected area can also increase tissue damage. [[Aspirin]] and [[ibuprofen]] can be given in the field<ref name=Han2014 /> to prevent clotting and inflammation. Ibuprofen is often preferred to aspirin because aspirin may block a subset of [[prostaglandins]] that are important in injury repair.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heil|first1=K|last2=Thomas|first2=R|last3=Robertson|first3=G|last4=Porter|first4=A|last5=Milner|first5=R|last6=Wood|first6=A|title=Freezing and non-freezing cold weather injuries: a systematic review.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=March 2016|volume=117|issue=1|pages=79–93|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldw001|pmid=26872856|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The first priority in people with frostbite should be to assess for [[hypothermia]] and other life-threatening complications of cold exposure. Before treating frostbite, the [[Human body temperature|core temperature]] should be raised above 35&nbsp;°C. Oral or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous (IV)]] fluids should be given.<ref name=Han2014 />

Other considerations for standard hospital management include:
* [[History of wound care|wound care]]: [[blister]]s can be drained by needle aspiration, unless they are bloody ([[Bleeding|hemorrhagic]]). [[Aloe vera]] gel can be applied before breathable, protective [[Dressing (medical)|dressings]] or bandages are put on. 
* [[antibiotics]]: if there is trauma, skin infection ([[cellulitis]]) or severe injury
* [[Tetanospasmin|tetanus toxoid]]: should be administered according to local guidelines. Uncomplicated frostbite wounds are not known to encourage tetanus. 
* pain control: [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIDs]] or [[opioid]]s are recommended during the painful rewarming process.

=== Rewarming ===
If the area is still partially or fully frozen, it should be rewarmed in the hospital with a warm bath with [[Povidone-iodine|povidone iodine]] or [[chlorhexidine]] [[antiseptic]].<ref name=Han2014 /> Active rewarming seeks to warm the injured tissue as quickly as possible without burning. The faster tissue is thawed, the less tissue damage occurs.<ref name="mistovich506">{{cite book|title=Prehospital Emergency Care|last2=Haffen|first2=Brent|last3=Karren|first3=Keith|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2004|isbn=0-13-049288-4|location=Upsaddle River, NJ|pages=506|last1=Mistovich|first1=Joseph}}</ref>  According to Handford and colleagues, "The Wilderness Medical Society and State of Alaska Cold Injury Guidelines recommend a temperature of 37–39&nbsp;°C, which decreases the pain experienced by the patient whilst only slightly slowing rewarming time." Warming takes 15 minutes to 1 hour. Rewarming can be very painful, so pain management is important.<ref name=Han2014 />

=== Medications ===
People with potential for large amputations and who present within 24 hours of injury can be given [[Tissue plasminogen activator|TPA]] with [[heparin]].<ref name=Han2017/> These medications should be withheld if there are any contraindications. [[Bone scintigraphy|Bone scans]] or [[Computed tomography angiography|CT angiography]] can be done to assess damage.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite|title=Frostbite|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2017-03-03|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304120126/https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite|archive-date=2017-03-04}}</ref>

Blood vessel dilating medications such as [[iloprost]] may prevent blood vessel blockage.<ref name=Han2014 /> This treatment might be appropriate in grades 2–4 frostbite, when people get treatment within 48 hours.<ref name=":6" /> In addition to vasodilators, [[sympatholytic]] drugs can be used to counteract the detrimental peripheral [[vasoconstriction]] that occurs during frostbite.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=C|last2=Lehnhardt|first2=M|last3=Daigeler|first3=A|last4=Goertz|first4=O|title=The Triaging and Treatment of Cold-Induced Injuries.|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt International|date=30 October 2015|volume=112|issue=44|pages=741–7|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2015.0741|pmid=26575137|pmc=4650908}}</ref>

===Surgery===

Various types of surgery might be indicated in frostbite injury, depending on the type and extent of damage. [[Debridement]] or amputation of [[Necrosis|necrotic]] tissue is usually delayed unless there is [[gangrene]] or systemic infection ([[sepsis]]).<ref name=Han2014 /> This has led to the adage "Frozen in January, amputate in July".<ref name=2008rev>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Golant | first1 = A | last2 = Nord | first2 = RM | last3 = Paksima | first3 = N | last4 = Posner | first4 = MA | title = Cold exposure injuries to the extremities. | journal = J Am Acad Orthop Surg | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 704–15 |date=Dec 2008 | pmid = 19056919 | doi = 10.5435/00124635-200812000-00003 }}</ref> If symptoms of [[compartment syndrome]] develop, [[fasciotomy]] can be done to attempt to preserve blood flow.<ref name=Han2014 />

== Prognosis ==
[[File:Human toes, 3 weeks post-frostbite.jpg|thumb|3 weeks after initial frostbite]]
Tissue loss and [[autoamputation]] are potential consequences of frostbite. Permanent nerve damage including loss of feeling can occur. It can take several weeks to know what parts of the tissue will survive.<ref name=Zaf2012 /> Time of exposure to cold is more predictive of lasting injury than temperature the individual was exposed to. The classification system of grades, based on the tissue response to initial rewarming and other factors is designed to predict degree of longterm recovery.<ref name=Han2014/>

=== Grades ===
Grade 1: if there is no initial lesion on the area, no amputation or lasting effects are expected

Grade 2: if there is a lesion on the distal body part, tissue and fingernails can be destroyed

Grade 3: if there is a lesion on the intermediate or near body part, autoamputation and loss of function can occur

Grade 4: if there is a lesion very near the body (such as the carpals of the hand), the limb can be lost. Sepsis and/or other systemic problems are expected.<ref name=Han2014 />

A number of long term sequelae can occur after frostbite.  These include transient or permanent changes in sensation, [[paresthesia]], increased sweating, cancers, and bone destruction/[[arthritis]] in the area affected.<ref name="marx1866">{{harvnb|Marx|2010|p=1866}}</ref>

== Epidemiology ==
There is a lack of comprehensive statistics about the [[epidemiology]] of frostbite. In the United States, frostbite is more common in northern states. In Finland, annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] was 2.5 per 100,000 among civilians, compared with 3.2 per 100,000 in Montreal. Research suggests that men aged 30–49 are at highest risk, possibly due to occupational or recreational exposures to cold.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-02-02|title=Frostbite: Background, Pathophysiology, Etiology |website=Medscape |publisher=Medscape, LLC|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/926249-overview#a5 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302112845/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/926249-overview#a5 |archive-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>

== History ==
Frostbite has been described in military history for millennia. The Greeks encountered and discussed the problem of frostbite as early as 400 BCE.<ref name=Zaf2012 /> Researchers have found evidence of frostbite in humans dating back 5,000 years, in an Andean mummy. Napoleon's Army was the first documented instance of mass cold injury in the early 1800s.<ref name=Han2014 /> According to Zafren, nearly 1 million combatants fell victim to frostbite in the First and Second World Wars, and the Korean War.<ref name=Zaf2012 />
