The following list encompasses notable medicine contamination and adulteration incidents.

*1937 [[Elixir sulfanilamide incident]]: [[S. E. Massengill Company]] used [[diethylene glycol]] as the solvent, it led to the 1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Medicine: Post-Mortem |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758704,00.html |quote=Then, two months ago, fatality knocked at its door.

*1942, [[Pasteur pipette|Nose droppers]] were found to be contaminated by users to the detriment of subsequent users.  Bacterial growth was found in all [[ephedrine]] and [[Phenylephrine|neosynephrin]] solutions that were examined.<ref>Gompertz, John and Michael, Paul.

*[[1982 Chicago Tylenol murders]]: [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] pain-relief capsules were laced with [[potassium cyanide]], leading to seven deaths.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rachael Bell |title = The Tylenol Terrorist| publisher= [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/index.html TruTV Crime Library]| url= http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/terrorists/tylenol_murders/index.html}}</ref>
*2007 Panamanian [[Eduardo Arias]] discovered that toothpaste sold in his country was labeled as containing [[diethylene glycol]], the same ingredient that had tainted cough syrup and killed 138 Panamanians in 2006.  Panamanian officials discovered that the toothpaste had come from China and initiated a global response.<ref>Bogdanich, W.; McLean,  R.

Fast action by the Ministry of Health, and notification through the media, prevented poisonings due to this product.  This event was linked to the death sentence of a former pharmaceuticals control officer in China, as the Costa Rican newspaper ''La Nación'' reported on its issue of May 30.<ref>China sentencia a muerte al exjefe de control de fármacos.

In June 2007, counterfeit [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] toothpaste imported from China was found to be contaminated with DEG, and several people in the eastern US reported experiencing headaches and pain after using the product.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=alerts_recalls&id=5399483 |title=7online.com: Toothpaste recall expands 6/18/07<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2009-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706085804/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=alerts_recalls&id=5399483 |archive-date=2007-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The same occurred in Spain with a false Colgate toothpaste, which contained 6% DEG. The tainted products could be identified by the claim to be manufactured in South Africa by Colgate-Palmolive South Africa LTD; they were 5 oz/100 ml tubes (a size which Colgate does not sell in the United States) and their packaging contained numerous misspellings on the labels. Colgate-Palmolive claimed it does not import  products from South Africa into the United  States or Canada and that DEG is never and was never used in any of its products anywhere in the world. These counterfeit products were found in smaller [[mom and pop]] stores, dollar stores, and discount stores in at least four states.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19214360 Toothpaste labeled Colgate recalled - More health news - nbcnews.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In July 2007, diethylene glycol was found in counterfeit Sensodyne toothpaste, on sale at a car boot sale in Derbyshire, England.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/6896182.stm | work=BBC News | title=Toxin found in fake UK toothpaste | date=2007-07-12 | accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

*2012-2018: From 2012-2018 massive amounts of generic versions of an entire class of angiotensin II inhibitor blood pressure medications (collectively called "sartans") were made with contaminated ingredients.  Patients receiving these drugs were exposed to genotoxic and carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) from 2012 until the drugs were recalled from the world drug market in 2018.  The problem began in 2012, when the process for making [[tetrazole]], a chemical intermediate in the production of various angiotensin II inhibitor medications for [[hypertension]] (popularly known by their common drug name suffix "[[sartan]]") was changed by generic drug manufacturers in favor of several cheaper and more efficient processes.  These changes caused drugs made with tetrazole to be contaminated with  [[N-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA) and [[N-nitrosodiethylamine]] (NDEA), which cause genetic damage and cancer. <ref name="Sorgel">{{Cite news |url=https://www.gmp-compliance.org/gmp-news/valsartan-what-caused-the-contamination |title=Valsartan: what caused the contamination? - ECA Academy |access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> This contamination was not detected until 2018.   The incident, according to medicinal chemist and pharmaceutical industry blogger Dr. [[Derek Lowe (chemist)|Derek Lowe]], points to a greater problem. Generic drug manufacturers often change the way in which prescription drug ingredients are made in order to lower costs of making them, so this kind of contamination may be more widespread and undetected in generic drugs.  <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/01/04/the-sartan-contamination-story |title=The Sartan Contamination Story |last=Lowe |first=Derek |last2=2019 |date=2019-01-04 |website=In the Pipeline |language=en-US |access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>
