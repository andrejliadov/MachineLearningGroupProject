'''Health care''', '''health-care''', or '''healthcare''' is the maintenance or improvement of [[health]] via the [[preventive healthcare|prevention]], [[diagnosis]], [[therapy|treatment]], recovery, or [[cure]] of [[disease]], [[illness]], [[injury]], and other [[disability|physical and mental impairments]] in people. Health care is delivered by [[health professional]]s and [[allied health professions|allied health fields]]. [[Physicians]] and physician associates are a part of these health professionals. [[Dentistry]], [[pharmacy]], [[midwifery]], [[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[optometry]], [[audiology]], [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[athletic training]] and other [[health profession]]s are all part of health care. It includes work done in providing [[primary care]], [[secondary care]], and [[tertiary care]], as well as in [[public health]].

Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as [[health policy|health policies]]. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/2009/chapter/2|title=Access to Health Care in America|publisher=The National Academies Press, US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine| date=1993|doi=10.17226/2009|pmid=25144064|isbn=978-0-309-04742-5|author1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Monitoring Access to Personal Health Care Services|last2=Millman|first2=M.}}</ref> Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with healthcare providers, poor health literacy, low income).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/healthcare-access|title=Healthcare Access in Rural Communities Introduction|publisher=Rural Health Information Hub|date=2019|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).

[[Health care system]]s are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid [[Health Human Resources|workforce]], reliable information on which to base decisions and [[health policy|policies]], and well maintained [[health facilities]] to deliver quality medicines and technologies.<ref name= "WHO">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/topics/health_systems/en/ |title= Health Topics: Health Systems |publisher= World Health Organization |website= www.who.int |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>

An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's [[Economic system|economy]], development, and [[industrialization]]. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]] and [[well-being]] of people around the world. An example of this was the worldwide [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of [[smallpox]] in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first [[disease]] in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.<ref>World Health Organization. ''Anniversary of smallpox eradication.'' Geneva, 18 June 2010.</ref>

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.<ref name="Cookie">Thomas-MacLean R et al.

'''Primary care''' refers to the work of [[health professionals]] who act as a first point of consultation for all [[patients]] within the [[Health Care System|health care system]].<ref name="Cookie"/><ref>World Health Organization. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110303183810/http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/45B45060-A38E-496F-B2C1-BD2DC6C04C52/0/44Definitionofterms2009.pdf ''Definition of Terms.''] Retrieved 26 August 2014.</ref> Such a professional would usually be a [[primary care physician]], such as a [[general practitioner]] or [[Family medicine|family physician]]. Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a [[physiotherapist]], or a non-physician primary care provider such as a [[physician assistant]] or [[nurse practitioner]]. Depending on the locality, health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a [[pharmacist]] or [[nurse]]. Depending on the nature of the health condition, [[patient]]s may be [[Referral (medicine)|referred]] for secondary or tertiary care.

Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community. It can be provided in different settings, such as [[Urgent care]] centers that provide same-day appointments or services on a walk-in basis.

Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all [[socioeconomic]] and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal [[health]], and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, [[mental health|mental]] and social health issues, including [[Polypharmacy|multiple chronic diseases]]. Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas. [[Transitional care#continuity|Continuity]] is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and [[preventive medicine|preventive care]], [[health education]], and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem. The [[International Classification of Primary Care]] (ICPC) is a standardized tool for understanding and analyzing information on interventions in primary care based on the reason for the patient's visit.<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/adaptations/icpc2/en/index.html ''International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition (ICPC-2)''.] Geneva. Accessed 24 June 2011.</ref>

Common chronic illnesses usually treated in primary care may include, for example: [[hypertension]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[back pain]], [[Osteoarthritis|arthritis]] or [[Thyroid disease|thyroid dysfunction]]. Primary care also includes many basic [[maternal health|maternal]] and child health care services, such as [[family planning]] services and [[vaccination]]s. In the United States, the 2013 [[National Health Interview Survey]] found that skin disorders (42.7%), osteoarthritis and joint disorders (33.6%), back problems (23.9%), disorders of lipid metabolism (22.4%), and upper respiratory tract disease (22.1%, excluding asthma) were the most common reasons for accessing a physician.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=St Sauver JL, Warner DO, Yawn BP, etal |title=Why patients visit their doctors: assessing the most prevalent conditions in a defined American population |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=56–67 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23274019 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.08.020 |pmc=3564521}}</ref>

In the United States, primary care physicians have begun to deliver primary care outside of the managed care (insurance-billing) system through [[direct primary care]] which is a subset of the more familiar [[concierge medicine]]. Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office. Examples of direct primary care practices include [[Foundation Health]] in Colorado and [[Qliance]] in Washington.

In context of global [[population aging]], with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic [[non-communicable disease]]s, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries.<ref>World Health Organization.

===Secondary care===
'''Secondary care''' includes [[acute care]]: necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury, or other health condition. This care is often found in a [[hospital]] [[emergency department]]. Secondary care also includes skilled attendance during [[childbirth]], [[intensive care medicine|intensive care]], and [[medical imaging]] services.

The term "secondary care" is sometimes used synonymously with "hospital care". However, many secondary care providers, such as [[psychiatrists]], [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]], [[occupational therapists]], most [[dental specialties]] or [[physiotherapist]]s, do not necessarily work in hospitals. Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organization and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a [[referral (medicine)|referral]] before they can access secondary care.

In countries that operate under a [[mixed market]] health care system, some [[physician]]s limit their practice to secondary care by requiring patients to see a primary care provider first. This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group [[health insurance]] plans. In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred.

In other countries patient self-referral to a [[medical specialist]] for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from [[Health insurance|private insurance schemes]] or [[national health insurance]].

[[Allied health professions|Allied health professionals]], such as [[physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[respiratory therapists]], [[occupational therapist]]s, [[Speech and language pathology|speech therapists]], and [[dietitians]], also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral.

===Tertiary care===
[[File:NationalNeurologyHospital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery]] in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] is a specialist neurological hospital.]]
{{See also|Medicine}}
'''Tertiary care''' is specialized consultative health care, usually for [[inpatient]]s and on referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced [[medicine|medical]] investigation and treatment, such as a [[tertiary referral hospital]].<ref>Johns Hopkins Medicine. [http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/patient_care/pay_bill/insurance_footnotes.html ''Patient Care: Tertiary Care Definition''.] Accessed 27 June 2011.</ref>

Examples of tertiary care services are [[cancer]] management, [[neurosurgery]], [[cardiac surgery]], [[plastic surgery]], treatment for severe [[burn]]s, advanced [[neonatology]] services, palliative, and other complex medical and surgical interventions.<ref name="Emory">Emory University. [http://www.em.emory.edu/hospital_eu.html School of Medicine.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423081310/http://www.em.emory.edu/hospital_eu.html |date=2011-04-23 }} Accessed 27 June 2011.</ref>

=== Quaternary care ===
The term '''quaternary care''' is sometimes used as an extension of tertiary care in reference to advanced levels of medicine which are highly [[Medical specialist|specialized]] and not widely accessed. [[Clinical research|Experimental medicine]] and some types of uncommon [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] or [[surgery|surgical]] procedures are considered quaternary care. These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.<ref name="Emory"/><ref>Alberta Physician Link.

===Home and community care===
{{See also|Public health}}
Many types of health care interventions are delivered outside of health facilities. They include many interventions of [[public health]] interest, such as [[food safety]] surveillance, distribution of [[condom]]s and [[needle-exchange programme|needle-exchange programs]] for the prevention of transmissible diseases.

They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of [[self-care]], [[home care]], [[long-term care]], [[assisted living]], treatment for [[substance use disorder]]s among other types of health and social care services.

Community [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] services can assist with mobility and independence after the loss of limbs or loss of function. This can include [[prosthesis|prostheses]], [[orthotics]], or [[wheelchair]]s.

Many countries, especially in the west, are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes. There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor's appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being. Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts. This state of affairs presents a challenge for the design of ICT (information and communication technology) for home care.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Ratings===
{{Main|Health care ratings}}
[[Health care ratings]] are ratings or [[evaluation]]s of health care used to evaluate the process of care and health care structures and/or outcomes of health care services. This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media. This evaluation of quality is based on measures of:
* hospital quality
* [[health plan]] quality
* physician quality
* quality for other health professionals
* of [[patient experience]]

==Related sectors==
Health care extends beyond the delivery of services to patients, encompassing many related sectors, and is set within a bigger picture of financing and governance structures.

===Health system===
{{Main|Health system|Health care systems by country}}
A '''health system''', also sometimes referred to as '''health care system''' or '''healthcare system''' is the organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to populations in need.

===Health care industry===
{{See also|Health care industry|Health economics}}
The [[health care industry]] incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and "other human health activities." The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates<ref>{{cite web | title=Patient advocacy services ensure optimum health outcomes | author=Dorothy Kamaker | date=2015-09-21 | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/patient-advocacy-20150920-gjr53j.html | accessdate=2015-09-26}}</ref> or other [[allied health professions]].

In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]], health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including [[biotechnology]], diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery.

For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States.<ref name="Europe">{{cite web|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry in Figures|year=2007|url=http://www.efpia.eu/|accessdate=February 15, 2010|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="PHRMA">{{cite web |title=2008 Annual Report|work=[[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]]}}</ref> The United States dominates the [[biopharmaceutical]] field, accounting for three-quarters of the world's biotechnology revenues.<ref name="Europe"/><ref name="EFPIA">{{cite web|url=http://www.efpia.org/content/Default.asp?PageID=388|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823030103/http://www.efpia.org/content/Default.asp?PageID=388|archive-date=23 August 2009 |title=Europe's competitiveness|work=[[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]]|accessdate= February 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Health care research===
{{main|Medical research|Nursing research}}
{{For outline|Healthcare science}}
The quantity and quality of many health care interventions are improved through the results of science, such as advanced through the [[medical model]] of health which focuses on the eradication of [[illness]] through [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and effective treatment. Many important advances have been made through health research, [[biomedical research]] and [[pharmaceutical research]], which form the basis for [[evidence-based medicine]] and [[evidence-based practice]] in health care delivery. Health care research frequently engages directly with patients, and as such issues for who to engage and how to engage with them become important to consider when seeking to actively include them in studies. While single best practice does not exist, the results of a systematic review on patient engagement suggest that research methods for patient selection need to account for both patient availability and willingness to engage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Domecq|first1=Juan Pablo|last2=Prutsky|first2=Gabriela|last3=Elraiyah|first3=Tarig|last4=Wang|first4=Zhen|last5=Nabhan|first5=Mohammed|last6=Shippee|first6=Nathan|last7=Brito|first7=Juan Pablo|last8=Boehmer|first8=Kasey|last9=Hasan|first9=Rim|last10=Firwana|first10=Belal|last11=Erwin|first11=Patricia|date=2014-02-26|title=Patient engagement in research: a systematic review|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=14|issue=1|pages=89|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-89|pmid=24568690|pmc=3938901|issn=1472-6963|doi-access=free}}</ref>

# [[social insurance|social health insurance]]
# voluntary or private [[health insurance]]

# [[donation]]s to health [[charities]]

In most countries, there is a mix of all five models, but this varies across countries and over time within countries. Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on healthcare. For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on healthcare. In [[OECD]] countries for every extra $1000 spent on healthcare, life expectancy falls by 0.4 years.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} A similar correlation is seen from the analysis carried out each year by Bloomberg.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/u-s-near-bottom-of-health-index-hong-kong-and-singapore-at-top|title=These Are the Economies With the Most (and Least) Efficient Health Care|website=BloombergQuint|access-date=2019-01-14}}</ref> Clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health system's performance, but equally, the notion that more funding is better is not supported.

In 2011, the [[health care industry]] consumed an average of 9.3 percent of the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] or [[United States dollar|US$]] 3,322 ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]]) per capita across the 34 members of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries. The US (17.7%, or US$ PPP 8,508), the [[Netherlands]] (11.9%, 5,099), [[France]] (11.6%, 4,118), [[Germany]] (11.3%, 4,495), [[Canada]] (11.2%, 5669), and [[Switzerland]] (11%, 5,634) were the top spenders, however [[life expectancy|life expectancy in total population at birth]] was highest in Switzerland (82.8 years), [[Japan]] and [[Italy]] (82.7), [[Spain]] and [[Iceland]] (82.4), France (82.2) and [[Australia]] (82.0), while OECD's average exceeds 80 years for the first time ever in 2011: 80.1 years, a gain of 10 years since 1970. The US (78.7 years) ranges only on place 26 among the 34 OECD member countries, but has the highest costs by far. All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and [[Mexico]].<ref name="OECDHealthGlance">{{cite web |url= http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Health-at-a-Glance-2013-Chart-set.pdf|title=Health at a Glance 2013 - OECD Indicators|publisher=OECD|date=2013-11-21|id= ([http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/health-at-a-glance.htm link]) |pages=5, 39, 46, 48 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref><ref name="OECDLifeExpectancy">{{cite web |url= http://stats.oecd.org//Index.aspx?QueryId=51904 |title= OECD.StatExtracts, Health, Health Status, Life expectancy, Total population at birth, 2011 |publisher=OECD's iLibrary |year=2013 |format=online statistics |website= stats.oecd.org/ |accessdate= 2013-11-24}}</ref> (see also [[Health system#International comparisons|international comparisons]].)

===Administration and regulation===
{{See also|Health professional requisites}}
The [[Health administration|management and administration of health care]] is vital to the delivery of health care services.
