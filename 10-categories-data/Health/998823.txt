{{USC CSKA Sofia}}
'''CSKA''' ({{lang-bg|ЦСКА}}) is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in [[Sofia]] and currently competing in the country's premier football competition, the [[First Professional Football League|First League]]. ''CSKA'' is an abbreviation for ''Central Sports Club of the Army'' ({{lang-bg|Централен Спортен Клуб на Армията}}).

Officially established on 5 May 1948, CSKA's roots date back to an army officers' club founded in 1923.<ref>[http://www.dnes.bg/sport/2009/10/21/sydyt-prizna-cska-e-naslednik-na-as-23.79567 Court: CSKA is the Official Successor to AS-23] (in Bulgarian) ''Dnes.bg'' Retrieved 24 October 2017.</ref> The club has won a record 31 [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|Bulgarian titles]] and 20 [[Bulgarian Cup]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bgclubs.eu/ranking/points|title=Вечна ранглиста на А група " Спечелени точки|first=Български футбол|last=ЕООД|date=|website=bgclubs.eu|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d Europe's Club of the Century] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120524184019/http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d |date=24 May 2012 }} ''International Federation of Football History and Statistics.''

CSKA's home colors are red and white and its home ground is the [[Stadion Balgarska Armia|Bulgarian Army Stadium]]. The club's biggest rivals are [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]] and matches between the two sides are known as "[[The Eternal Derby]] of Bulgaria".

== History ==
=== 1923–1948 ===
In October 1923, football clubs ''Athletic Sofia'' and ''Slava Sofia'' merged to form [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], short for ''Officer's Sports Club Athletic Slava 1923'', under the patronage of the Ministry of War, which provided the equipment. In 1931, [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]] won their first Bulgarian championship and The Tsar's Cup, followed by another Tsar's Cup in 1941. The club's stadium (completed in 1938) was named Athletic Park and was situated where the [[Stadion Balgarska Armia|Bulgarian Army Stadium]] now resides.

On 9 November 1944, with the support of Mihail Mihaylov, an accountant at the Ministry of War and a patron of Shipka Sofia, a unifying agreement was signed, merging [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], ''Shipka'', and ''Spartak'' (Poduene) to form [[Chavdar Sofia]]. Gen. [[Vladimir Stoychev]] from [[AS 23 Sofia|AS-23]], who at the time was fighting on the front in World War II, was appointed (by [[Telegraphy#Telegram_services|telegram]]) as the new club's chairman. Lawyer [[Ivan Hristov Bashev|Ivan Bashev]], a future Bulgarian foreign minister, was appointed club secretary and the person in charge of football.<ref name="sport1-43745">[http://www.sport1.bg/sport1/node/43745 With Horns Against History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420195010/http://www.sport1.bg/sport1/node/43745 |date=20 April 2012 }} (in Bulgarian) ''Sport1.bg'' 12 February 2007. Retrieved 5 April 2010.</ref>

=== 1948–1962 ===
[[File:Unifying protocol of Chavdar (Sofia).jpg|thumb|The unifying protocol of Chavdar Sofia (1944)]]
With the help of Mihail Mihaylov again, in February 1948, Chavdar became the departmental club of the Central House of the Troops ("Centralnia Dom na Voiskata") and took on the name of CDV. Looking for ways to stop the club's decline, CDV's administrators sought to merge it with another club. In May 1948, an agreement was reached between CDV and [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] (which had already earned a place in the play-offs) for uniting the clubs under the name "Septemvri pri CDV" (Septemvri at CDV). The contract was signed on 5 May 1948, which is officially considered the club's date of foundation.

The club's played its first official match on 19 May 1948 against [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] at Yunak Stadium, a 1–1 draw. Septemvri pri CDV eliminated Aprilov ([[Gabrovo]]) and [[PFC Spartak 1918|Spartak Varna]] en route to the final, where it faced [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]], losing 1–2 in the first leg. The decisive second match occurred on 9 September 1948. Septemvri pri CDV's lineup consisted of: Stefan Gerenski, Borislav Futekov, [[Manol Manolov]], Dimitar Cvetkov, Nikola Aleksiev, Nako Chakmakov (captain), [[Dimitar Milanov]], Stoyne Minev, [[Stefan Bozhkov]], Nikola Bozhilov and Kiril Bogdanov. The score was 3–3 on aggregate, as Septemvri pri CDV led 2–1 near the end of regulation time, when a last-minute goal by Nako Chakmakov gave the club its first ever title.

In 1950, the word "''Narodna''" ("Peoples" in English) was added to the name of the Central House of the Troops, changing it to '''Central House of the People's Troops''' ("Centralen Dom na Narodnata Voiska" in English), or C.D.N.V. for short, also effectively changing the club's name. The following two years, C.D.N.V. won two consecutive titles. In 1951, the Army club clinched their first double. In [[A PFG 1953|1953]], the club was again renamed by the authorities, this time to '''Otbor na Sofiyskiya Garnizon''' ("Team of the Sofia Garrison"), and most of the key players were illegally transferred out. The title was lost undeservedly.

The following year, the club was renamed to '''CDNA''' ('''Central House of the People's Army''), and the years between 1954 and 1962 marked one of the most successful periods for ''the Reds'', who won nine consecutive titles (an unprecedented achievement in Bulgarian football to this day) and, in 1956, took part in the second installment of the newly created [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] competition.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1956/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1956/57&nbsp;– History&nbsp;– CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref>

=== 1960s ===
In 1962, CDNA was united with DSO Cherveno Zname to form '''CSKA Cherveno Zname''' ("CSKA Red Flag"). The Central House of the People's Troops ceased its affiliation with the club, which was taken over by the Ministry of People's Defense. CSKA finished third after [[FC Spartak Plovdiv|Spartak Plovdiv]] and [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]] in the [[A PFG 1962-63|1962–63 season]]. The [[1963–64 A PFG|following season]], CSKA had its worst performance in the [[A PFG|Bulgarian championship]] to date, finishing 11th in the final table, only three points from relegation. This led to the sacking of legendary coach [[Krum Milev]] after 16 years. CSKA did not recapture the title until [[1965–66 A PFG|1966]]. However, during the [[1966–67 A PFG|1966–67 season]], CSKA recorded its first major international achievement after reaching the semi-finals of the [[1966–67 European Cup|European Cup]] for the first time, where they faced Italian giants [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]. After two hard-fought 1–1 draws, a third decisive match was played, which CSKA lost 0–1.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1966/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1966/67&nbsp;– History&nbsp;– CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref>

The next two seasons were unmemorable for the ''Army Men'', as they finished in fifth and second place respectively. In 1968, CSKA underwent another merger, joining with [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] and taking the name '''CSKA Septemvriysko Zname''' ("CSKA September Flag"). The club clinched the title in [[1968–69 A PFG|1969]] with the help of the recent acquisition of [[Petar Zhekov]], who would go on to become the top Bulgarian goalscorer of all time&nbsp;– a record he still holds today.

=== 1970s ===
[[File:CSKA Sofia team 1973.jpg|thumb|CSKA Sofia in 1973]]
The 1970s are widely considered the period when CSKA made its name on the European stage. The club began the decade modestly, claiming second place domestically and reaching the round of 16 in [[1970–71 European Cup Winners' Cup]], where they fell to English side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 0–2 on aggregate.<ref>[http://www.bounder.friardale.co.uk/Match%20Reports/1970/19701104.jpg Webb Forces a Chelsea Victory] ''The Daily Mirror'' 5 November 1970. Retrieved 20 December 2011.</ref> However, from 1971 to 1973, CSKA won three consecutive titles and delivered one of the biggest surprises in European football when it eliminated reigning three-time European champion [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]&nbsp;– considered the finest team of all-time&nbsp;– 2–1 on aggregate in the [[1973–74 European Cup]].<ref>[https://www.si.com/soccer/2011/11/29/bate-whatifworldcup What if the FIFA World Cup had been played in a different year] ''Sports Illustrated'' 29 November 2011. Retrieved 13 September 2017.</ref> They then faced German champions [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the quarter-finals. After losing 1–4 in the first leg in [[Munich]], CSKA bowed out of the competition following a 2–1 win at home.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1973/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1973/74&nbsp;– History&nbsp;– CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref> Between 1975 and 1979, the club won two more domestic titles.

=== 1980s ===
The [[1980–81 A PFG|1980–81 season]] was again a memorable one for CSKA Sofia, winning the Bulgarian title once more and twice beating European champion [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], both times with 1–0 scorelines, before being stopped by the future European champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] with a 6–1 defeat on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the European Cup.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/liverpool-v-cska-sofia-classic-match Liverpool v CSKA Sofia: Classic Match] ''Liverpoolfc.tv'' 26 February 2004.

Retrieved 20 December 2011.</ref> The next season, CSKA reached their second-straight European Cup semi-final, eliminating Spanish champions [[Real Sociedad]], [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] and Liverpool after losing 0–1 in England and winning 2–0 at home with two goals by [[Stoycho Mladenov]]. In the semi-final, the ''Reds'' again faced Bayern Munich. The first leg was held in Sofia and started with a full dominance over Bayern, as by the 16th minute, CSKA were leading 3–0 in front of 85,000 jubilant spectators who saw the European final in their dreams. But the final result was 4–3 for CSKA. In Munich, the club suffered a 4–0 defeat, ending what is still the deepest run by a Bulgarian side in the European Cup or UEFA Champions League.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1981/clubs/club=50076/matches/index.html UEFA Champions League 1981/82&nbsp;– History&nbsp;– CSKA Sofia] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 22 December 2011.</ref> In the domestic league, CSKA did not let go of the title until the [[1984–85 A PFG|1984–85 season]], where they finished second behind arch-rivals Levski Sofia, but still managed to reach the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final.

On 18 June 1985, the final for the Bulgarian Cup was held at the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] between CSKA and Levski Sofia. The match was marked by many questionable referee decisions and saw several brutal fights, including an assault on a referee by some of Levski's players. CSKA won the match 2–1, even though they had missed a penalty when the score was 2–0. By decree of the Central Committee of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]], both teams were disbanded and re-founded under new management. CSKA was renamed '''Sredets''' while Levski was renamed ''Vitosha''. Several players were banned from participating in official matches for varying periods of time, including [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and [[Kostadin Yanchev]] from CSKA. One year later, the committee's decision was reversed and the players were reinstated.

As Sredets, the club finished in fourth place in the [[1985–86 A PFG|1985–86 season]]. In 1987, the club was renamed '''CFKA Sredets''' ("Central Football Club of the Army Sredets"), and the following three years were marked by a formidable performance, even as [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]] ended their 20-year partnership with CFKA in 1988 and became an independent club again. Coached by [[Dimitar Penev]], CFKA won the title in 1987 and 1989 and reached the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] semi-finals against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1989. In reaching this stage, CFKA had eliminated [[Roda JC Kerkrade|Roda JC]] after penalty kicks following a 2–1 win at home and a 1–2 loss away. Barcelona, coached by former Dutch international [[Johan Cruyff]], won both matches (4–2 in [[Barcelona]] and 2–1 in Sofia) and CFKA were eliminated, but Cruyff did notice the talent of Hristo Stoichkov and decided to bring him to Barcelona the following year, effectively launching Stoichkov's international career.

=== 1990s ===
The decade, immediately following the [[fall of communism]], brought turbulent changes to Bulgarian football, and the club was not spared. The  '''CSKA''' name was restored starting with the [[1989–90 A PFG|1989–90 season]] and they won the title again. In March 1991, former footballer and administrator [[Valentin Mihov]] was chosen as president of CSKA. The club bought some of the most talented Bulgarian players, including [[Yordan Letchkov]], [[Ivaylo Andonov]] and [[Stoycho Stoilov]], among others. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense concluded their affiliation with the club. Despite the uncertainty and the numerous problems that followed, CSKA won the title again in 1992. They were later eliminated in the first round of the [[1992–93 UEFA Champions League]] by [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]] after losing 1–3 in [[Vienna]] and winning 3–2 in Sofia.

In the meantime, [[Valentin Mihov]] was appointed president of the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] and Petar Kalpakchiev was chosen to replace him at the helm of CSKA. However, Kalpakchiev wrangled with the club's administration over their decisions to replace several coaches, one of which was [[Gjoko Hadžievski]], considered to be leading the club in the right direction, and eventually he was fired. The owner of the [[Multigroup]] conglomerate, [[Iliya Pavlov]], took over as president, but ultimately his sponsorship proved insufficient to overcome the club's ineffective management. Five coaches were changed in just one season, with Tsvetan Yonchev being coach for just one day. In Europe, CSKA nevertheless defeated [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] 3–2 in the first round of the [[1994–95 UEFA Cup]], but the result was annulled by [[UEFA]] because of the delayed player-indexing of forward [[Petar Mihtarski]], and Juventus were awarded a 3–0 victory by default. In the second leg in [[Turin]], CSKA succumbed to a 5–1 defeat.

In the summer of 1995, CSKA made a strong selection and eventually the club included half of the youth national football team of Bulgaria. [[Plamen Markov]] was appointed head coach, but after a disappointing first half of the season, he was replaced by [[Georgi Vasilev (footballer, born 1946)|Georgi Vasilev]], who had previously won three Bulgarian titles (one with [[FC Etar Veliko Tarnovo|Etar Veliko Tarnovo]] and two with Levski Sofia). Vasilev managed to win a double with CSKA for the [[1996–97 A PFG|1996–97 season]], entering the second qualifying round of the Champions League against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]]. After a dramatic 3–3 in [[Bucharest]], CSKA fell 0–2 at home. Vasilev was unexpectedly released from the club at the beginning of the second half of the [[1996–97 A PFG|1997–98 season]] after a 3–0 win over [[PFC Spartak Pleven|Spartak Pleven]]. Coach [[Petar Zehtinski]] took his place. That year, the club saw the return of Hristo Stoichkov, [[Emil Kostadinov]] and [[Trifon Ivanov]], but the three of them challenged each other for the captain's band. Stoichkov played in only four matches and left CSKA right before the derby with Levski to play for a club in Saudi Arabia. After the end of the season, Ivanov also left the club. CSKA finished the season in third place.

In the summer of 1998, Dimitar Penev took the lead as coach for a second time. CSKA reached the second round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and won the Bulgarian Cup, but disappointed in the domestic league, finishing in fifth place in [[1998–99 A PFG|1999]]. That season, the young talents of [[Martin Petrov]], [[Stilian Petrov]], [[Dimitar Berbatov]] and [[Vladimir Manchev]] started to play a bigger role in the team. There were problems with player-indexing due to some unpaid obligations to [[PFC Naftex Burgas|Neftochimik]]. In the domestic championship, CSKA had only 16 players registered for the [[1999–2000 A PFG|1999–2000 season]] and some un-indexed players took part in official UEFA games. Consequently, at the shareholders meeting at the end of 1999, the club ownership was transferred to businessman Vasil Bozhkov, who became majority owner.

=== 2000s ===
After the first two fixtures in the spring of 2000, Dimitar Penev was relieved as coach because of the consecutive losses and in his place was appointed [[Georgi Dimitrov (footballer born 1959)|Georgi Dimitrov&nbsp;– Jacky]], who was later replaced by [[Spas Dzhevizov]]. After a 1–1 draw with [[PFC Pirin Blagoevgrad (1922)|Pirin]] at [[Stadion Balgarska Armia|Bulgarian Army Stadium]], Dzhevizov handed in his resignation and [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] took his place. Even though at times CSKA had fallen as far as nine points behind league leaders Levski, the club shortened the difference to only two points before the decisive match for the title at [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium]]. CSKA dominated Levski for most of the match, as Dimitar Berbatov made several serious misses, but a last-minute goal from [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer, born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]] secured the title for Levski. In the summer of 2000, the Italian Enrico Catuzzi was retained as head coach, who managed to revive the team. However, even though the ''Army Men'' played attractive matches under his leadership, Catuzzi resigned in the winter, citing family problems. [[Aleksandar Stankov (manager)|Aleksandar Stankov]] was appointed as coach again, but was replaced by Catuzzi again after two losses from Litex for the cup and the championship. ''The Reds'' finished second, seven points behind Levski.

To start the [[2001–02 A PFG|2001–02 season]], CSKA's head coach was [[Asparuh Nikodimov]], however he would be fired during the winter break, as CSKA was situated two points behind Levski. He was replaced by another Italian, [[Luigi Simoni]]. Simoni failed to make CSKA champions as the club finished third and lost the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final to Levski. Simoni left at the end of the season.

In the summer of 2002, former player Stoycho Mladenov was appointed as head coach. With him, the team set a record with 13 consecutive wins in 13 matches in the Bulgarian Championship and CSKA became champions for the first time since 1997. However, Mladenov was fired the following season after losing to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the qualifying rounds of the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League]] and after giving a less than impressive performance in the first round of the [[2003–04 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], where the club lost on penalty kicks to [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]]. Immediately after, two of the new arrivals, [[Léo Lima]] and [[Rodrigo de Souza Cardoso|Rodrigo Sousa]], purchased for 3 million dollars the year before, left the club on the grounds they had not received two monthly salaries. [[FIFA]] decided they had the right to leave and that CSKA had to pay them and return the players to their former club, [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]]. Alexander Stankov was temporarily appointed as head coach until the winter break, when [[Ferario Spasov]] officially took over the position. In the end of 2004, Spasov was replaced by Serbian coach [[Miodrag Ješić]], despite the team finishing as champions in the league. Notwithstanding the club's selection issues, CSKA won their record 30th domestic title in 2005.

For the [[2005–06 UEFA Champions League]], after eliminating [[KF Tirana|Tirana]] in the second qualifying round, CSKA were paired against reigning European champions Liverpool. The club lost 1–3 in the first match in Sofia, but surprisingly won the second leg 1–0 away at [[Anfield]], though CSKA was still eliminated on aggregate.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=51536 CSKA Claim Amazing 1–0 over Liverpool] ''Novinite.com'' 23 August 2005. Retrieved 2 April 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=51537 Liverpool: CSKA Turned into Real Struggle] ''Novinite.com'' 23 August 2005. Retrieved 2 April 2010.</ref> For the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], ''the Reds'' eliminated [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] (with Dimitar Berbatov in the team) with two 1–0 wins and entered the group stage, where they finished fifth with three points from four matches and were eliminated. During the winter break of the [[2005–06 A PFG|2005–06 season]], the club was in first position, seven points ahead of Levski. However, during the spring, CSKA lost the seven-point advantage and ultimately finished second, three points behind Levski. Club president Vasil Bozhkov blamed head coach Miodrag Ješić for the failure to capture the title and fired him, while some supporters blamed Bozhkov instead.

Former CSKA head coach Plamen Markov was appointed in Ješić's place. Bozhkov then announced that he would restrict the finances of the club and that during the upcoming season CSKA will not be aiming at the title. In December 2006, Bozhkov sold the club to Indian steel tycoon and owner of [[Kremikovtzi AD]], [[Pramod Mittal]], brother of [[ArcelorMittal]]'s [[Lakshmi Mittal]]. Former Bulgarian politician [[Aleksandar Tomov (politician)|Aleksandar Tomov]] became president of the club and assured the supporters that CSKA would, in fact, be aiming at both the championship and the cup. After two draws in the beginning of the spring half of [[2006–07 A PFG|2006–07]], CSKA found themselves six points behind Levski. As a result, Plamen Markov was replaced by Stoycho Mladenov, who returned to lead the club after three-and-a-half years. CSKA finished second.

During the beginning of the [[2007–08 A PFG|2007–08]] season, CSKA purchased players for more than €2&nbsp;million. The team was unluckily eliminated from the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in the first round by French side [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] after a 96th-minute goal from [[André-Pierre Gignac]] in the second leg for 1–1. CSKA was also eliminated from the [[Bulgarian Cup]] in the round of 16 by Lokomotiv Plovdiv. The match was engulfed in a scandal because of three CSKA players who at the time were on loan at Lokomotiv ([[Stoyko Sakaliev]], [[Aleksandar Branekov]] and [[Ivan Ivanov (footballer, born 1988)|Ivan Ivanov]]). The players had clauses in their contracts restricting them from playing matches against CSKA, but Lokomotiv's management used the players anyway. At the end of the season, the ''Army Men'' secured the title in advance, finishing 16 points ahead of second-placed rivals Levski without losing a match from 30 championship matches. On 5 May 2008, the club marked its 60th anniversary with big celebrations organized by the management. An alley of fame was built, comprising the names of the most successful current and former players of CSKA. On 24 May 2008, an exhibition match was played between the current squad and a mixed team of Bulgarian and foreign football stars. The mixed team was coached by former [[Germany national football team|German international]] [[Lothar Matthäus]], who was a special guest for the anniversary celebrations. The match ended 6–6.

In June 2008, only days after CSKA won its 31st title, UEFA notified the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] (BFU) that the club would not receive a license for participating in the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League]] because of unpaid obligations.<ref>[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=93746 Bulgaria FC CSKA Without License, Out of Champions' League] ''Novinite.com'' 3 June 2008.

The problems with the license exposed the club's weak financial situation and led to chaos and panic, prompting many of the key players to flee, including head coach Stoycho Mladenov himself, who left saying he was not happy with the fire sale of so many important players. The future of CSKA looked grim, its status as a professional club hanging in the balance. In the midst of the crisis, Dimitar Penev was given the head coach's job for the third time and burdened with the task of saving the club. With almost all senior players gone, Penev was left to rely on members of the CSKA youth squad. Ultimately, CSKA managed to fulfill all licensing requirements set by the BFU and was allowed to compete in A Group.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bfunion.bg/index.php?request=news&set_month=8&news_id=1009 | publisher=(in Bulgarian) BFUnion.bg | title=Съобщение на Лицензионната комисия при БФС | accessdate=5 August 2008}}</ref> Despite all the difficulties, and to the surprise of the whole football community, Penev's young squad claimed the [[Bulgarian Supercup]] in August 2008, overcoming Litex 1–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football24.bg/?gg=3&hh=4&ii=140&jj=6&ll=8725&mm=140|publisher=Football24.bg | title=CSKA won the Supercup Final|accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref>

At the beginning of the [[2008–09 A PFG|2008–09 season]], the club managed to strengthen their ranks by signing Bulgarian internationals [[Zdravko Lazarov]] and [[Vladimir Manchev]].

=== 2010s ===
[[File:Cska with cup of bulgaria 2011.JPG|thumb|upright|CSKA with the [[Bulgarian Cup]] in [[2011 Bulgarian Cup Final]]]]
In the summer of 2010, the club hired [[Pavel Dochev]] as head coach, but after a string of unsatisfactory results, including a 0–1 loss to Levski Sofia and a 1–2 loss to Chernomorets Burgas, he was fired. His place was taken by the relatively unknown Macedonian manager [[Gjore Jovanovski]], who kept his job for just three months before being replaced by his assistant [[Milen Radukanov]]. Under Radukanov, CSKA won the [[2011 Bulgarian Cup Final|2011 Bulgarian Cup]] and the [[Bulgarian Super Cup|Bulgarian SuperCup]], beating league champions Litex Lovech 3–1.

CSKA started 2011–12 with eight-straight league victories, but after a 1–2 defeat against Slavia Sofia and a 0–0 draw against [[PFC Cherno More Varna|Cherno More Varna]], Radukanov was unexpectedly fired by chairman Dimitar Borisov. Dimitar Penev was appointed as a temporary manager with [[Adalbert Zafirov]] as his assistant. In the spring, Stoycho Mladenov was again hired as head coach, and he led the club to a second-place league finish, a single point behind champions [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]] after losing on the final day of the season.

==== 2012–2013 ====
CSKA began the season by being surprisingly eliminated from international football by Slovenian football dwarf [[ND Mura 05|Mura 05]]. While the first leg in Slovenia ended in a 0–0 draw, a 1–1 tie at home eliminated the ''Reds'' from the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League]] in the second qualifying round. The start of the domestic championship was unimpressive as well&nbsp;–- a 0–1 loss to Litex, in which the club had no right to use its new signings due to administrative restrictions. However, in the middle of the autumn half of the season, CSKA achieved some significant wins, defeating Levski 1–0 in the Eternal Derby and eliminating Ludogorets Razgrad in the round of 32 of the Bulgarian Cup.

In late December 2012, head coach Stoycho Mladenov was abruptly fired by the club owners for "disciplinary" reasons, and Miodrag Ješić was appointed in his place. During the winter transfer window, CSKA made several signings, such as Bulgarian internationals [[Martin Kamburov]] and [[Spas Delev]], in addition to South-American players [[Márcio de Souza Gregório Júnior|Marcinho]] and [[Ignacio Lores Varela|Ignacio Varela]]. After managing the team for only two matches in the spring, Ješić was sacked and replaced by fan favourite Milen Radukanov, with whom the club managed to finish the season with the bronze medals.

In June 2013, former [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] winner Hristo Stoichkov was released from Litex Lovech to replace Radukanov on the bench, but the poor financial condition of the club forced him to leave shortly after his arrival without even having signed a contract. Most of the key players left CSKA while speculations about the club's bankruptcy circled in the media.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/07/08/uk-soccer-bulgaria-cska-stoichkov-idUKBRE96710F20130708 CSKA Sofia Find New Owners as Stoichkov Quits] ''Reuters'' 8 Jul 2013. Retrieved 29 Jul 2013.</ref> After the serious financial problems led to CSKA's withdrawal from the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League]], igniting multiple fan protests, the club was ultimately declared for sale. On 10 July 2013, it was officially purchased by the Red Champions Group, a union of businessmen and club legends. The leader of the group was Aleksandar Tomov, former club president widely blamed for CSKA's financial crisis in 2008. Stoycho Mladenov was hired back as manager by the new owners.

==== 2013–2014 ====
The club made several major signings for the new season, bringing in former team captains [[Valentin Iliev]], [[Emil Gargorov]] and [[Todor Yanchev]]. [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]'s national goalkeeper [[Rais M'Bolhi]] and ex-[[Premier League]] stars [[Mamady Sidibe]] and Martin Petrov were also brought on board. On 19 October 2013, the reborn CSKA crushed city rivals Levski 3–0 and were given the nickname ''The Phoenixes''. By the end of the season, CSKA smashed Levski three more times and finished in second place, behind Ludogorets Razgrad.

On 21 March 2014, as part of the plan to reduce debt and make the club's finances more transparent, CSKA became the first club from Eastern Europe to be publicly traded by listing itself on the [[Bulgarian Stock Exchange - Sofia|Bulgarian Stock Exchange]].<ref>[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-troubled-cska-sofia-seek-raise-6-3-161137528--finance.html Troubled CSKA Sofia Seek to Raise $6.3 mln from IPO] ''Reuters'' 5 March 2014.

==== 2014–2015 ====
Before the start of the new season, a few key players were no longer part of the club. Goalkeeper Raïs M'Bolhi was transferred to [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) side [[Philadelphia Union]] after an impressive performance at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]; young talent [[Ivaylo Chochev]] joined [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]]; club legends Martin Petrov and Todor Yanchev retired; and the team's leading scorer, [[Emil Gargorov]], left due to conflict with the managing board. CSKA were surprisingly eliminated by the Moldovan side [[FC Zimbru Chișinău|Zimbru Chișinău]] in the [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League]]'s [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round#Second qualifying round|second qualifying round]], but performed well in the domestic league during the first half of the season, beating rivals Levski twice more and being on the top of the table ahead of Ludogorets before the winter break. However, after the season resumed, CSKA lost three-straight matches without scoring a goal, prompting the resignation of head coach Stoycho Mladenov. Former team captain and youth team's coach [[Galin Ivanov (footballer, born 1975)|Galin Ivanov]] was appointed as the new head coach,<ref>[http://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=539141 Галин Иванов е новият треньор на ЦСКА] sportal.bg 24 March 2015.

Following a series of unfavourable results in the championship, Hristo Yanev resigned as head coach. Early next week, the son of former Romanian football legend [[Anghel Iordănescu]], [[Edward Iordănescu]], was appointed as head coach. However, on 27 November, following a 1–1 home draw against [[FC Vereya|Vereya]] and several poor results, he resigned as head coach.

In September, the club officially announced a sponsorship with the largest telecommunications company in Bulgaria, [[Mtel (Bulgaria)|Mtel]]. The team also signed a contract with Bulgarian gambling company WinBet.

== Club crest ==
The main element in the current club crest is the red five-pointed star&nbsp;– symbol of glory and power. Red was the colour of the uniform of the Roman legions, associated with love, freedom and aggression. The six oak leaves above the star symbolise strength, endurance and traditions. CSKA's name and year of foundation (1948) can be seen below the star, between two Bulgarian flags. The circle form of the crest symbolises infinity and eternity.

After CSKA won its 30th national title in 2005, three golden stars were added to the logo.<ref>[http://redhearts.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=17&layout=default&date=2013-01-01 Емблемата] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829205045/http://redhearts.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=17&layout=default&date=2013-01-01 |date=29 August 2017 }} redhearts.eu 10 July 2015.

== Club kits ==
[[File:Tengarinya in Sofia.JPG|thumb|The general director Ventsislav Zhivkov presents the new signing [[Bernardo Tengarrinha]]. This game is also the introduction of the new equipment, which has a mark LEGEA.]]
After the merger between Chavdar Sofia and [[FC Septemvri Sofia|Septemvri Sofia]], it was accepted the club's home colour would be red. White became the club's away colour.

In previous years, black was also used, mainly for away or third kits. Other colours of the CSKA kits that can be seen are grey, yellow, orange and green, but only in rarely occasions and only in the colour scheme of the third kits. In the 2009–10 season, and for the first time in club history, CSKA used gold for their away kits.

After the 2011–12 season in which CSKA used equipment of the Italian company [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]], from June 2012 the club has new kit supplier, Italian company [[Legea]]. The team used the new equipment for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Moscow side [[FC Torpedo Moscow|Torpedo Moscow]], ended 1–2. The kits were sample and they were with a different outfit and a different spot where the team badge was placed. The official presentation of the new kits was before the friendly match against Macedonian side [[FK Drita|Drita]] on 14 July 2012 (2–0), played at the Bulgarian Army Stadium.

== Club anthem ==
The official anthem of CSKA Sofia is the song "Sartsa cherveni" ("Red hearts") by the famous Bulgarian singer Yordanka Hristova. The song is written in 1999 by composer Evgeni Dimitrov and lyricist Ivaylo Valchev, authors of many of the hits of [[Slavi Trifonov]] and [[Ku-Ku Band]].<ref>[http://www.prosport.bg/news/18034/Данчето-подари-Сърца-червени-на-ЦСКА Данчето подари "Сърца червени" на ЦСКА] prosport.bg 6 June 2015.
