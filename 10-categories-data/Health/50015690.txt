==History of Attachment Theory==
{{main|History of attachment theory}} {{see also|Attachment Theory}}

===Infant attachment===
[[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed attachment theory in the 1960s while investigating the effects of [[Maternal deprivation|maternal separation]] on infant development.<ref name="bretherton1992">{{cite journal|last1=Bretherton|first1=Inge|title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1992|volume=28|issue=5|pages=759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}</ref> The development of the [[Strange Situation]] task in 1965 by Ainsworth and Wittig allowed researchers to systematically investigate the attachment system operating between children and their parents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mary|first1=Ainsworth|title=Patterns of attachment : a psychological study of the strange situation|date=1978|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89859-461-4}}</ref> The Strange Situation involves separating infant-parent dyads and observing infant behaviours upon reunion. Infant behaviour tended to follow patterns, leading to the development of three attachment categories: Secure, Anxious-Avoidant, and Anxious-Resistant. In 1990, Ainsworth added a new category, championed by [[Mary Main]], called Disorganized/Disoriented attachment, characterized by its less reliable pattern of behaviour.<ref>Main, M., & Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of a new, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern. In M. Yogman & T. B. Brazelton (Eds.), Affective development in infancy (pp. 95–124). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.</ref>

Bowlby believed attachment to be a primary biological drive to achieve proximity with a caregiver that transforms across child development to also encompass a psychological drive to find security by achieving a preferred interpersonal distance with an important caregiver he called an attachment figure.<ref name="bretherton1992" /> Insecure attachment patterns develop when caregivers are experienced as inconsistent or unpredictable, which necessitates the development of different strategies to achieve a sense of comfort and safety within an interpersonal setting. Furthermore, he posited that attachment figures function as a ''secure base'' that facilitate environmental eexploration and that ''attachment behaviours'' are triggered by perceived stress, danger or pain, and are thus ''state dependent''.<ref name="fonagy2001">{{cite book|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis|date=2001|publisher=Other Press|last1=Fonagy|first1=P}}</ref>

===Adult attachment===
{{main|Attachment in adults}}

In the late 1980s Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult romantic relationships based on observations of the interactions between adult romantic partners.☃☃ They noticed that romantic partners often prefer to be physically close, become anxious when they are separated and that stressful situations can be buffered by the presence of a romantic partner. Three main methods of measuring adult attachment have been developed (see [[attachment measures]]), with slightly different purposes and variable amounts of concordance between them.<ref name= eagle2013 /> Some aim to categorize attachment style while others rate degrees of attachment anxiety and avoidance.

==Attachment Styles==
Attachment styles refer to characteristic patterns of thought concerning the ability of self and others to help an individual achieve security. Longitudinal studies have suggested attachment is fairly stable from childhood to adulthood.<ref name="Weinfield2000">{{cite journal|last2=Sroufe|first2=LA|last3=Egeland|first3=B|date=2000|title=Attachment from infancy to early adulthood in a high-risk sample: continuity, discontinuity, and their correlates.|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=695–702|pmid=10953936|last1=Weinfield|first1=NS|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00178}}</ref><ref name="waters2000">{{cite journal|last2=Merrick|first2=S|last3=Treboux|first3=D|last4=Crowell|first4=J|last5=Albersheim|first5=L|date=2000|title=Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: a twenty-year longitudinal study|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=684–9|pmid=10953934|last1=Waters|first1=E|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.384}}</ref> When shifts do occur it is usually with good reason, with shifts away from secure attachment due to increased hardship and shifts towards secure related to finding partners in adulthood or finding symbolic attachments (God, places, pets) <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=DL|last2=Needham|first2=TN|last3=Coolidge|first3=FL|title=Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment|journal=International Journal of Aging & Human Development|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=119–32|pmid=19960862|doi=10.2190/ag.69.2.c|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7765|s2cid=12358487}}</ref>

===Secure===
Securely attached people generally have positive views about themselves and about others. They tend to agree with statements "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me."<ref name="bartholomew&horowitz1991">{{cite journal|last2=Horowitz|first2=LM|date=August 1991|title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–44|pmid=1920064|last1=Bartholomew|first1=K|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}</ref>

===Insecure===
'''Anxious-preoccupied''' people tend to view themselves less positively than they view others. They are more likely to become highly anxious when they are away from their attachment partners and are at risk of becoming, or seeming, dependent. They tend to agree with statements such as “I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." <ref name="bartholomew&horowitz1991" />

'''Avoidant-dismissive''' people tend to have a positive view of themselves and a less positive view of others. They often highly value independence and become uncomfortable in, or resist, situations where they become dependent on others. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is very important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." This is considered to be roughly equivalent to the anxious-avoidant style in children.<ref name="bartholomew&horowitz1991" />

'''Fearful-avoidant''' people tend to have conflicted, and often negative, views of themselves and of others. They often desire to have emotional relationships but feel uncomfortable when others get too close. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others."<ref name="bartholomew&horowitz1991" /> People with loss or trauma in childhood are at greater risk of developing this style of attachment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byun|first1=S|last2=Brumariu|first2=LE|last3=Lyons-Ruth|first3=K|title=Disorganized Attachment in Young Adulthood as Partial Mediator of Relations Between Severity of Childhood Abuse and Dissociation |journal=Journal of Trauma & Dissociation|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26836233|pmc=5004628|doi=10.1080/15299732.2016.1141149|volume=17|issue=4|pages=460–79}}</ref>

===Insecure Attachment Styles in Healthcare Settings===

'''Anxious-Preoccupied'''
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment tend to be hypervigilant to signs of danger and to worry or catastrophize about symptoms. In health care appointments, their narrative is full of intense negative emotion but relatively sparse in the specific detail desired by health care providers. This presentation can readily be perceived as “needy” or “dramatic”. If the healthcare provider pulls away in response it may reinforce the patient’s need to articulate their distress, creating a cycle of distress-withdrawal-distress.<ref name="maunder&hunter2015">{{cite book|last1=Maunder|first1=R|last2=Hunter|first2=J|title=Love, Fear and Health: How our attachments to others shape health and health care|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name="hunter&maunder2015">{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=J|last2=Maunder|first2=R|title=Improving Patient Treatment with Attachment Theory: a guide for primary care providers and specialists|date=2015|publisher=Springer}}</ref>

'''Avoidant-Dismissive'''
People with avoidant dismissive attachment emphasizetheir independence and minimizing expressing distress. They may delay seeking healthcare (see healthcare utilization), minimize reporting symptoms and disclose limited personal information.<ref name="maunder&hunter2015" /><ref name="hunter&maunder2015" />

'''Fearful-Disorganized'''
People with fearful attachment often avoid routine healthcare, but present in a crisis with volatile, intense, negative emotions. Due to their degree of distress, they can present a disorganized narrative that is difficult for providers to follow and interpret diagnostically.<ref name="maunder&hunter2015" /><ref name="hunter&maunder2015" />

==Working Model== 
Working models are representatives of the cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], or psychological structure (often unconscious), which underlie the different attachment classifications.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=P|title=Structure and functions of internal working models of attachment and their role for emotion regulation|journal=Attachment & Human Development|date=December 1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=291–306|pmid=11708228|doi=10.1080/14616739900134161}}</ref> Working models develop in children over time based on their experiences with their attachment figures. The cognitive schema for attachment consists of views of the efficacy of self and other to create security in times of distress.

===Bartholomew and Horowitz Model===
Bartholomew and Horowitz proposed and verified a working model based on two dimensions; the view of the self (self-esteem) and the view of others (sociability)<ref name="bartholomew&horowitz1991" />
*Secure- Positive view of self, Positive view of other 
*Dismissive- Positive view of self, Negative view of other
*Preoccupied- Negative view of self, Positive view of other
*Fearful- Negative view of self, Negative view of other

===Prototype-Insecurity Classification Model===
In 2012 Maunder and Hunter<ref name="maunder&hunter2012">{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=RG|last2=Hunter|first2=JJ|title=A prototype-based model of adult attachment for clinicians|journal=Psychodynamic Psychiatry|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=4|pages=549–73|pmid=23216396|doi=10.1521/pdps.2012.40.4.549}}</ref> combined the internal working model with the attitudes, behaviours and emotional expression of the different styles to create a prototype based classification that included severity of insecurity. This model was designed to be clinically useful, allowing healthcare providers to identify and predict the behaviours of patients whose attachment systems were activated by pain and illness.

They distinguish the different attachment styles by; 1) attachment anxiety, the discomfort someone feels when separated, 2) attachment avoidance, which is discomfort associated with closeness and 3) severity of insecurity 
*Secure- Low anxiety, low avoidance, low severity of insecurity 
*Dismissive- Low anxiety, high avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Preoccupied- High anxiety, low avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Fearful- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity 
*Disorganized- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity. The difference between disorganized and fearful is that people with disorganized attachment do not use a consistent strategy to find security.

==Attachment and health outcomes==
Attachment and health interact on multiple levels. Attachment is a biologically based system tied to our response to distress and attachment styles appear to confer differences in stress physiology. Illness and pain themselves act as an “activating signal” for attachment systems, and health care providers act as attachment figures in their role addressing illness and pain. Accordingly, attachment styles influence patient perception of illness, health care utilization, medication compliance and treatment response.<ref name="hunter&maunder2001" /><ref name="feeney2000">{{cite journal|last1=Feeney|first1=J A|title=Implications of attachment style for patterns of health and illness|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|date=July 2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=277–288|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2214.2000.00146.x|pmid=10931068}}</ref>

===Physical health===
While strong social support has been linked to greater resilience to stress and lower medical morbidity and mortality, the mechanism behind this association is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ozbay|first1=F|last2=Fitterling|first2=H|last3=Charney|first3=D|last4=Southwick|first4=S|title=Social support and resilience to stress across the life span: a neurobiologic framework|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=August 2008|volume=10|issue=4|pages=304–10|pmid=18627668|doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7|s2cid=34039857}}</ref> In the late 1990s, Paul Ciechanowski investigated the role of attachment styles in patients managing diabetes, finding that individuals with an avoidant-dismissive style were less likely to be compliant with treatment recommendations and had less well-controlled disease as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin.<ref name="ciechanowski2004">{{cite journal|last2=Russo|first2=J|last3=Katon|first3=W|last4=Von Korff|first4=M|last5=Ludman|first5=E|last6=Lin|first6=E|last7=Simon|first7=G|last8=Bush|first8=T|date=2004|title=Influence of patient attachment style on self-care and outcomes in diabetes|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|issue=5|pages=720–8|pmid=15385697|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=P|doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000138125.59122.23|volume=66|s2cid=17506824|url=https://zenodo.org/record/896972}}</ref> Larger scale evidence comes from a large American survey of self-reported attachment styles and physical illness conducted by McWilliams and Bailey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McWilliams|first1=Lachlan A.|last2=Bailey|first2=S.

Specifically, they found preoccupied individuals reported more heart disease, and dismissive individuals more pain conditions. A prospective study followed children until the age of 32 and found a similar pattern of results. They found that people with anxious-resistant (dismissive) styles of attachment reported vague, [[non-specific symptoms]] more often, and those with anxious-preoccupied classification had a higher rate of inflammation-based illnesses. This prospective study was particularly important because of the difficulty assigning causation in the often observed relationship between chronic pain and insecure attachment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=K.

Causal relationships between insecure attachment and mental illness may be complex.<ref name="fonagy2001" /><ref name="eagle2013" /><ref name="hunter&maunder2015" /> Some risk factors for insecure attachment such as loss of parental figure, and sexual or physical abuse, are also risk factors for mental health disorders.<ref name="eagle2013" >{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=M.|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis: Theory, research and clinical|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}</ref> Self-report measures of attachment may be biased by mental health conditions.

==Mechanisms by which Attachment Influences Health==
Maunder and Hunter outline 3 ways in which insecure attachment can serve as a risk factor for health problems: 1) it may increase one’s susceptibility to stress by changing stress physiology, 2) it may be related to potentially harmful behaviours undertaken to regulate affect, and 3) it may change the way people interact with the healthcare system.<ref name="hunter&maunder2001" />

===Attachment and Stress===
See also: [[stress (biology)]], [[stress (psychological)]]
The stress response in humans is largely governed by the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) and [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The HPA axis has garnered particular attention from attachment researchers because it is known to be activated by social stressors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa M.|title=Contributions of Psychophysiology to Research on Adult Attachment: Review and Recommendations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=November 2001|volume=5|issue=4|pages=276–295|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_1|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.2676|s2cid=11179189}}</ref> The normal response for this system is to release stress hormones, particularly cortisol, for a brief duration and then shut itself off due to negative feedback, resulting in a short, strong release of cortisol. The HPA axis also follows a [[circadian rhythm]], with highest release within about 30 minutes to 1 hour upon awakening, called the cortisol response to awakening (CRA), and a slow taper throughout the day. Researchers have looked at both cortisol response to stress (CRS) and CRA to determine if attachment anxiety and avoidance underlie individual differences in HPA activity.

Findings in the field have inconsistent. The evidence suggests that (a) individuals with high attachment anxiety perceive a higher degree of distress when faced with a stressor and have higher baseline anxiety compared to those low in attachment anxiety,<ref name="ditzen2008">{{cite

Another related biological system that regulates stress response is the [[autonomic nervous system]]. In general, the sympathetic system is activated during times of stress and the parasympathetic system acts to decrease physical readiness for stress. These systems are sometimes called the “fight-or-flight” and “rest-or-digest” systems, respectively, and operate in a balance, as opposed to being totally on or off. Researchers can approximate the relative balance by looking at skin conductance, blood pressure and heart rate. Studies of this kind provided hard evidence that avoidant infants were truly distressed during the strange situation task<ref name="gander2015">{{cite journal|last1=Gander|first1=Manuela|last2=Buchheim|first2=Anna|title=Attachment classification, psychophysiology and frontal EEG asymmetry across the lifespan: a review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=19 February 2015|volume=9|pages=79|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00079|pmid=25745393|pmc=4333768}}</ref> despite their minimally distressed appearance as they showed elevations in heart rate when caregivers were away and took longer to return to baseline when the caregiver returned in comparison to securely attached infants. Studies of skin conductance and heart rate in adults have shown that those with avoidant attachment and anxious attachment will show markers of increased distress during attachment and non-attachment stressors compared to those securely attached.<ref name="maunder2006" /><ref name="gander2015" />

===Health behaviours===
According to attachment theory people with insecure attachment have less effective strategies for dealing with negative emotions compared to people with secure attachment. One way in which insecurely individuals may try to regulate their distress is by using strategies or behaviours that are attractive for their short term relief but may have deleterious risks over years like eating, drug use or risky sex. 
In a survey of 356 primary care patients in Toronto, rates of smoking, harmful drinking and obesity, were all found to be highest in those with the most severe anxious and avoidant attachment.<ref name="hunter&maunder2015" /> Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have been linked in separate studies to increasing the risk of eating disorders and substance use in adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=O'Kearney|first1=R|title=Attachment disruption in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: a review of theory and empirical research.|journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=September 1996|volume=20|issue=2|pages=115–27|pmid=8863063|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199609)20:2<115::aid-eat1>3.0.co;2-j}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Andreas|last2=Bröning|first2=Sonja|title=A Review on Attachment and Adolescent Substance Abuse: Empirical Evidence and Implications for Prevention and Treatment|journal=Substance Abuse|date=25 November 2014|volume=36|issue=3|pages=304–313|doi=10.1080/08897077.2014.983586|pmid=25424652}}</ref>

'''Sex'''
Risky sexual behaviour is defined as sexual contact with an increased risk of either unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. In a study aimed at evaluating the evidence supporting six major risky sex theories, Leslie Simons and her colleagues found that only the social support and attachment theory had strong empirical support.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=Leslie Gordon|last2=Sutton|first2=Tara E.|last3=Simons|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Gibbons|first4=Frederick X.|last5=Murry|first5=Velma McBride|title=Mechanisms That Link Parenting Practices to Adolescents' Risky Sexual Behavior: A Test of Six Competing Theories|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2015|volume=45|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0409-7|pmid=26718543|s2cid=25063290}}</ref> In the attachment theory model, risk is enhanced in insecurely attached individuals due to negative working models of relationships, reduced closeness in intimate relationships and through decreased self-control. In terms of conscious motivations for sex, attachment anxiety is related to many attachment-related motivations including using sex for desire for emotional closeness, reassurance, self-esteem enhancement, stress reduction, the experience and exertion of power, elicitation of caregiving from a partner, protection from a partner’s anger or bad moods.<ref name="davis2004">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Deborah|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip R.|last3=Vernon|first3=Michael L.|title=Attachment Style and Subjective Motivations for Sex|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 August 2004|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1076–1090|doi=10.1177/0146167204264794|pmid=15257790|s2cid=30814969}}</ref> Those high in attachment avoidance report using sex for power or partner manipulation and endorse a desire to use sex as a way of avoiding emotional closeness.<ref name="davis2004" /> Accordingly, there is evidence that attachment avoidance is associated with positive attitudes towards casual sex, a higher number of casual sex partners, and an interest in emotionless sex and one-night stands.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beaulieu-Pelletier|first1=Genevieve|last2=Philippe|first2=Frederick L.|last3=Lecours|first3=Serge|last4=Couture|first4=Stéphanie|title=The role of attachment avoidance in extradyadic sex|journal=Attachment & Human Development|date=2011|volume=13|issue=3|pages=293–313|doi=10.1080/14616734.2011.562419|pmid=21506032|s2cid=25846568}}</ref>

===Healthcare utilization===
Attachment theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance and people high in attachment anxiety would display different utilization of health care resources based on their prototypical behavioural responses when stressed.<ref name="maunder&hunter2015" /> The theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance, when faced with an illness, are likely to minimize their symptoms, and wait longer to see a health care provider, since they view their own distress as a sign of unacceptable vulnerability and also because their internal working model dictates that other people are not useful in helping them manage distress. For those high in attachment anxiety, they would have higher distress when faced with an illness, less perceived ability to manage it on their own, and thus visit health care services more frequently to try to attain security. For those with high anxiety and high avoidance, or fearful attachment, they would be predicted to present less frequently than those with secure attachment, but show up in a crisis when they do, which may interfere with optimal care. Research findings have generally been supportive of these predictions.
