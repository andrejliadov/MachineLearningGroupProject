'''Alliesthesia''' (from {{lang-grc|{{GreekFont|ἀλλοῖος}}|translit=alloios}} – be changed, and {{GreekFont|αἴσθησις}} (''aísthēsis'') – sensation, perception; thus "changed sensation"; {{lang-fr|alliesthésie|links=no}}, {{lang-de|Alliästhesie|links=no}}) is a [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] [[phenomenon]] (not to be confused with the [[pathology|pathologic]] [[symptom]] of [[allesthesia]]) that describes the dependent relationship between the internal state of an organism and the perceived pleasure or displeasure of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954|bibcode=1971Sci...173.1103C|s2cid=38234571}}</ref> The internal state of an organism is in constant change, and any stimulus that can help to correct an error or need will be pleasantly perceived. For example, food will be more pleasant when hungry compared to when an organism is [[satiety|satiated]]. The sensation aroused therefore depends not only on the quality or on the intensity of the stimulus, but also on the internal state of the organism as sensed by internal [[Sensory receptor|receptors]]. The relationship between the [[Perception|perceptual system]] and [[physiology]] is [[subjectivity|subjective]] and studied by [[psychophysics]][[Subjectivity|.]]

== Forms ==

* ''thermal'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the thermic perception (heat and cold), which contributes fundamentally to [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[thermoregulation]]. It is an aspect of [[thermal comfort]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Parkinson|first1=Thomas|last2=de Dear|first2=Richard|date=2014-12-15|title=Thermal pleasure in built environments: physiology of alliesthesia|journal=Building Research & Information|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=288–301|doi=10.1080/09613218.2015.989662|s2cid=109419103|issn=0961-3218}}</ref>
* ''olfactory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[olfaction]] (sense of [[Olfaction|smell]])
* ''gustatory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[taste]] – see [[taste|primary tastes]] (sweet, salty, bitter, acid, [[umami]] and "[[calcium]])"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tordoff | first1 = MG | year = 2008 | title = Gene discovery and the genetic basis of calcium consumption | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 94 | issue = 5| pages = 649–659 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.04.004 | pmid=18499198 | pmc=2574908}}</ref>
* olfacto-gustatory alliesthesia or '''alimentary alliesthesia''': alliesthesia of tastes/flavors pertaining to [[food intake]]
* ''visual''/optic alliesthesia: alliesthesia of [[Visual perception|vision]]
* ''auditory'' alliesthesia: alliesthesia of the [[Hearing (sense)|sense of hearing]]

Each of these forms of alliesthesia exists in two opposite tendencies:
* ''negative'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from pleasure to displeasure.
* ''positive'' alliesthesia: shift of sensation from displeasure to pleasure.

The phenomenon of ''alliesthesia'' was first described by the French physiologist [[Michel Cabanac]]. The first scientific publication from 1968<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Minaire | first2 = Y | last3 = Adair | first3 = ER | year = 1968 | title = Influence of internal factors on the pleasantness of a gustative sweet sensation | journal = Commun Behav Biol A | volume = 1 | pages = 77–82 }}</ref> was succeeded by over 40 publications in international journals, for example: 1970 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Duclaux | first2 = R | year = 1970 | title = Specificity of internal signals in producing satiety for taste stimuli | journal = Nature | volume = 227 | issue = 5261| pages = 966–7 | doi=10.1038/227966a0| pmid = 4915408 | bibcode = 1970Natur.227..966C | s2cid = 4193888 }}</ref> and 1971 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cabanac|first=Michel|date=1971-09-17|title=Physiological Role of Pleasure|journal=Science|language=en|volume=173|issue=4002|pages=1103–1107|doi=10.1126/science.173.4002.1103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5098954|bibcode=1971Sci...173.1103C|s2cid=38234571}}</ref> The term ''alliesthesia'' was first mentioned in the annex of ''Physiological Role of Pleasure'' and was further elaborated in collaboration with the coauthor [[Stylianos Nicolaïdis]]. Originally, alliesthesia was demonstrated in [[experiment]]s with human subjects, and later confirmed in rats (''[[Rattus norvegicus]]'').<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cabanac | first1 = M | last2 = Lafrance | first2 = L | year = 1990 | title = Postingestive alliesthesia: the rat tells the same story. | journal = Physiology & Behavior | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 539–43 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90123-L| pmid = 2359766 | s2cid = 37735253 }}</ref>
