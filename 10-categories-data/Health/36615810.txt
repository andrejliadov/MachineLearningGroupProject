'''Asia Catalyst''' is an independent organization that builds strong civil society and advances the right to health for [[marginalized]] groups in Asia. It trains community-based organizations (CBOs) to meet high standards of effective and democratic governance, to establish a stable foundation for future growth, and to conduct rigorous human rights research and advocacy. It is an independent organization that places the needs of marginalized communities at the center of national, regional, and international policy making.

Since its founding in 2006 by [[Sara L.M. Davis]], the organization has opened offices in [[New York City|New York]] (United States), [[Beijing]] (China), and [[Bangkok]] (Thailand).

== Focus on marginalized groups ==
Asia Catalyst works with community-based organizations (CBOs) from marginalized groups that work on the [[right to health]]. Its partners come from communities that often experience severe and systemic rights violations, and are unable to or unaware of how to conduct effective advocacy around these issues. Partner groups include people living with HIV ([[HIV-positive people|PLHIV]]) and [[Hepatitis]], lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) people and men who have sex with men (MSM), [[sex worker]]s, and people who use [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].

=== Definition of a CBO ===
Asia Catalyst defines a community-based organization (CBO) as a civil society group that operates within a specific community or groups of communities. Asia Catalyst works only with CBOs that represent marginalized communities. It requires that partner organizations have at least one member of the marginalized community in a decision-making position within the organization. This is meant to "ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard, and that Asia Catalyst's work focuses on the real, and most pressing, rights violations experienced."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » WHO WE WORK WITH|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/who-we-are-2/who-we-work-with/|website = asiacatalyst.org|access-date = 3 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Partner geography ===
Over the course of Asia Catalyst's history, it has partnered with hundreds of CBOs in 11 Asian countries, including [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]], [[Nepal]], [[Philippines|The Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Papua New Guinea|PNG]].

== Programs ==
Asia Catalyst supports civil society development and empowerment through tailored capacity building, research, and advocacy on issues of most concern to marginalized communities in Asia.

Asia Catalyst uses an innovative, responsive model to "ensure community voice and need is at the heart of all programming."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » WHAT WE DO|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/|website = AsiaCatalyst.org|access-date = 3 September 2015}}</ref>  It incorporates a training-of-trainers methodology into all long-term programs to ensure sustainability, and continuously evaluates and adjusts its program approach to maximize impact and quality.

Asia Catalyst has four main program areas: CBO Catalyst, Regional Rights Training, tailored coaching, and advocacy.

=== CBO Catalyst ===
Asia Catalyst believes that [[Community-based organizations|community based organizations]] (CBOs) are best positioned to conduct their own advocacy as they have a unique understanding of the circumstances in which they work and the communities they represent.

Asia Catalyst’s seminal program, the CBO Catalyst,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » CBO CATALYST|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/cbo-catalyst/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref> is a capacity building program for CBO leaders from marginalized groups in Asia. Over the course of one year, Asia Catalyst convenes a group of CBO leaders for capacity building workshops that merge organizational management skills with rights-based advocacy. Participants form lasting coalitions and conduct effective advocacy on their communities’ priority issues.

=== Regional Rights Training ===
Asia Catalyst's Regional Rights Training Program<ref>{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » REGIONAL RIGHTS TRAINING|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/regional-rights-training/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref> builds strong coalitions of like-minded CBOs '''through capacity building and implementation of human rights analysis, documentation and advocacy on a single thematic issues uniting CBOs across Asia.'''

In 2015 Asia Catalyst was supporting 16 representatives from eight CBOs from [[Cambodia]], [[China]], [[Myanmar]], and [[Vietnam|Viet Nam]] to work on ending [[Discrimination|discrimination in health care settings]] against [[people living with HIV]] (PLHIV) across the region.

=== Tailored coaching ===
Asia Catalyst provides specialized, issue-specific training to individual organizations and small '''groups''' '''with a specific skill-set need''', such as strategic planning, fundraising, or volunteer management. Tailored Coaching<ref>{{Cite web|title = Asia Catalyst  » TAILORED COACHING|url = http://asiacatalyst.org/what-we-do/tailored-coaching/|website = asiacatalyst.org|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref> for CBOs typically consist of two three-day workshops with Asia Catalyst over a period of 3–6 months. Between workshops, participant organizations complete assignments aimed at implementing the knowledge they have gained at workshops, with Asia Catalyst providing additional mentor support throughout the process.

Tailored coaching focuses especially on groups from marginalized communities, such as [[sex workers]], drug users, [[LGBT]] people, and people living with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. Much of the work has focused on grassroots groups in the [[People’s Republic of China]], as well as groups in [[Korea]], [[Thailand]], and [[Myanmar]] (Burma). Asia Catalyst’s approach uses tools that have been developed in the field with input from their marginalized groups, and helps each group to develop strategic plans, project timelines, budgets, and volunteer management systems. Once this foundation is established, groups may be assisted in developing rights documentation and advocacy projects, working on such issues as discrimination, criminalization and access to health services. Asia Catalyst trains groups to advocate with local and national officials, the [[United Nations]], and to participate in international meetings.

=== Advocacy and research ===
Asia Catalyst partners with local groups in China to conduct qualitative research to document [[human rights abuses]] that affect the [[right to health]]. These reports draw on international human rights standards and local laws to make policy recommendations. Asia Catalyst’s advocacy work has focused on compensation for victims of the HIV blood disaster, as well as discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and rights issues facing people who use drugs and sex workers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Sara L.M|title=Police crackdowns in China: The Health and Human Rights of Sex Workers|url=http://www.hhropenforum.org/tag/asia-catalyst/|access-date=}}</ref>

Advocacy projects have been successful in achieving media attention. Asia Catalyst's December 2013 report on Custody and Education, an arbitrary detention system for female sex workers in China, was featured on the front page of the ''New York Times'',<ref>{{Cite news|title = For Prostitutes Jailed in China, Forced Labor With No Recourse|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/world/asia/for-prostitutes-in-china-jail-with-no-recourse.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-01-01|access-date = 2015-09-03|issn = 0362-4331|first = Andrew|last = Jacobs}}</ref> as well as in prominent Asian and international newspapers including ''The Guardian'', ''The Wall Street Journal'',<ref>{{Cite web|date=10 December 2013|title = Advocacy Group Calls China to Shut Labor Camps for Sex Workers|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/12/10/advocacy-group-calls-china-to-shut-labor-camps-for-sex-workers/|website = WSJ Blogs - China Real Time Report|access-date = 3 September 2015}}</ref> The South China Morning Post,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Prostitutes face harsh detention, says rights group|url = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1377814/prostitutes-face-harsh-detention-says-rights-group|access-date = 3 September 2015}}</ref> and The Taipei Times.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A new year, an old occupational hazard for Chinese prostitutes - Taipei Times|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2014/01/06/2003580626|website = www.taipeitimes.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref> Its December 2014 research on the living conditions of transgender female sex workers in Beijing and Shanghai was also published in the LGBTQ Policy Journal at the Harvard Kennedy School.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcing the Release of the 2015 LGBTQ Policy Journal {{!}} LGBTQ Policy Journal|url = http://www.hkslgbtq.com/announcing-the-release-of-the-2015-lgbtq-policy-journal/|website = www.hkslgbtq.com|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}</ref>
