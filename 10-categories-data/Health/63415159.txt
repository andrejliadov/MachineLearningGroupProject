The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] was confirmed by diagnostic test to have reached the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Bermuda]] on Wednesday, the 18 of March 2020; and the individuals arrived from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[United States|US]]. Those individuals had been traced to back to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Wednesday, 18 March|fourth and sixth of March]]. This was the first it was confirmed and some believe that COVID-19 could have been on island undetected with asymptomatic individuals before that time.

The Government of Bermuda has pushed to keep its people safe from COVID-19 and to reduce social media rumors. To assist in the reduced rumors on social media, the official government website (to the left) was updated with a [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Media Links|direct link for information relating to Bermuda]]. They also used WhatsApp to communicate with the general public. Therefore, due to the size of Bermuda and limited published worldwide data the below data can be verified via the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Media Links|media links]] below.

The Ministry of Health also did not report on some data information until the identifications of individuals could be protected. Bermuda is a small community and using process of elimination identities could be revealed when numbers are small. Therefore, data regarding details, flights, race, and age did not get published until privacy could be maintained.

== Response ==
The government announced a 14-day 24-hour "Shelter in Place" starting [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Saturday, 04 April|4 April]], where residents were only allowed to leave home for groceries, pharmaceuticals, or medical emergencies. On 14 April, it was announced that the "Shelter in Place" would be extended 14 more days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McWhirter |first1=Fiona |title=Under siege: island braces for 24-hour lockdown {{!}} The Royal Gazette:Bermuda News |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/health/article/20200402/under-siege-island-braces-for-24-hour-lockdown |accessdate=6 April 2020 |work=The Royal Gazette}}</ref>

Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) had been designated and those locations had prohibited access as the general public was not permitted. Individuals who had been required to stay at these facilities had been restricted to their rooms and once departures had been completed the sites had been cleaned thoroughly using standards as approved by the department of health. These facilities are being used until technology based tools, similar to that used in Hong Kong (CITV Bermuda press conference broadcast dated 2020-05-20 on YouTube) could be used to ensure people comply with the quarantine orders to stay at home. Due to the sensitive nature of COVID-19, the facilities have not been identified in this article, it will only state that one to three sites had been used at different times during the pandemic.

The head of KEMH announced on Wednesday, 20 May 2020 that they are prepared to use convalescent plasma therapy and have six treatments in stock. (CITV Bermuda press conference broadcast dated 2020-05-20 on YouTube)

==== Saturday, 04 April ====
Shelter in Place, also known as '[[lockdown]]' in the general public and other [[jurisdictions]] at the time, started at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. that Saturday morning for a period of fourteen (14) days until Saturday, 18 April 2020 at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. The legislation, the legal 'cease to have effect' date was on Wednesday, 15 April 2020 at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. unless extended, which it was extended until [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Monday, 06 April|Saturday, 18 April 2020 at 6:00 p.m.]] and again to [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Sunday, 19 April|Saturday, 02 May 2020 at 6:00 p.m.]]

==== Tuesday, 14 April ====

==== Thursday, 16 April ====
There were 83 cases on the island out of which 26 were imported, 45 were community spread, 12 were pending investigation, and 35 of those cases were recovered.

==== Monday, 20 April ====
The legislation "Emergency Powers" was amended a second time, to assist the country and its people to allow further assistance regarding grocery shopping and food for pets, it also identified what days people can go to the grocery stores.<ref>http://www.bermudalaws.bm/laws/Annual%20Laws/2020/Statutory%20Instruments/Emergency%20Powers%20(COVID-19%20Shelter%20in%20Place)%20Amendment%20(No.%202)%20Regulations%202020.pdf</ref> Shopping days at this time changed to all those with a surname beginning with the letter shown below, can proceed to shop or get needed supplies.
* Monday and Thursday (A to F)
* Tuesday and Friday (G to Q)
* Wednesday and Saturday (R to Z)
* Sundays (Persons aged 55 years and over, the disabled, and essential workers)
It was also allowed that anyone who was able to move/shop on Sunday will also be allowed to do so in accordance with their surname. This was in part due to the observation and encouragement for family to assist those who live alone and needed assistance. This was a change from the previous name structure, see above 4 April, as it was noticed to be less efficient and added stress to individuals.

==== Tuesday, 21 April ====

''The above information can be verified by watching the CITV Bermuda press releases for each day, the data is read at the beginning of each press meeting.''

==== Saturday, 02 May ====
Government of [[Bermuda]] has moved to a phased reopening approach. This will be done in four parts as shown in the image below. Phase One will start at 6:00&nbsp;a.m. as the official end of "Shelter In Place". Legislation passed to move into this phased approach, with the hours for curfew during Phase 1 to be 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m. each night.<ref>http://www.bermudalaws.bm/laws/Annual%20Laws/2020/Statutory%20Instruments/Emergency%20Powers%20(COVID-19%20Continuing%20Precautions)%20Regulations%202020.pdf</ref> The closure of some business still mandatory while others are on restricted hours. It was made clear in the press conference that this Phased approached does not have any dates and it is subject to change, the priority of this Government is the protection of the people. Also, this is when the term 'social distancing' was changed to ''Physical distancing'' to reflect what was actually trying to be achieved.

==== Friday, 08 May ====
Racial reporting started to identify the number of persons who contracted COVID-19 based on race. This was becoming more important as it was being reported that race may have an impact on COVID-19 patients.

The Continuing Precautions Regulations was amended a first time,<ref>http://www.bermudalaws.bm/laws/Annual%20Laws/2020/Statutory%20Instruments/Emergency%20Powers%20(COVID-19%20Continuing%20Precautions)%20Amendment%20Regulations%202020.pdf</ref> to add money service business which are needed as individuals/families have overseas persons that they cannot send funds and to provide cash chequeing abilities to those who do not have access to a banking facility (no bank account holders). The regulations also prohibit scuba diving as all oxygen was being restricted for use at the hospital and should an accident occur, the hyperbaric chamber would need to use the oxygen in stock.

==== Thursday, 14 May ====
Reporting format for the data changed from just "Local Transmission" to "Local Transmission Known Contact/Source" and "Local Transmission Unknown Contact/Source". This data change has been reflected in the table above for May.

==== Saturday, 16 May ====

===== Bermuda Hospitals Board =====
[[Bermuda Hospitals Board|BHB]] announced the following information. Admissions to King Edward VII Hospital (KEMH) for COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic to date are 37. The highest number of COVID-19 patients at any one time was 16. BHB also confirmed that no cases of COVID-19 have been found at Mid-Atlantic Wellness Institute to date. There have been 60 surgeries (emergency, urgent and cancer-related) performed over the last four weeks and 53 babies have been born between Wednesday, 1 April and Tuesday, 12 May.

==== Wednesday, 20 May ====
Public bus service returns with restrictions, all passengers must wear a face mask and maintain a minimum of one meter (3 feet) distance when seated. Maximum capacity will be 17 passengers with no standing allowed, the number was reduced in a meeting on the Monday, 18 May and is currently unknown. Normal seating is about 40/42 and standing allowed to fill the bus. [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Economey|Details for passes here.]]

Further issues with public transportation was expressed in the press conference today (20 May) when the press presented a question regarding the drivers will stop work if minibuses are used and that they are allowing only nine people onto the bus; no answer was given at the time because the Minister of Tourism and Transport was not in attendance. After review of some comments regarding new articles on this topic, the general public is not happy with the concerns. Reasons given include, but not limited to, drivers had been paid for a service that was not been running for over a month with money paid for by the tax payers/public funds. Also, that like other industries, restaurants, bars, and hotels they should be laid off or have furlough days and apply for the government financial assistance if they do not wish to work. Others pointed out that cashiers, tellers, and supermarket personnel are working and they cannot understand why they did not work. These concerns have validity and have come from a history of work stoppages made by the public transportation works, many times inconveniencing the general public to a point were the general support in this regard has been reducing. It has reduced to the point that some online comments have outright said to fire them all.

It was also confirmed that KEMH had found a positive case of COVID in the Cooper Ward of a patient recently. They quarantined the ward and started testing and found another individual was positive, a nurse. No further cases have developed at this time however, both of these individuals had been a systematic, showing no symptoms.

Premier of Bermuda added that 1015 antibody test had been completed to date and provided details of that fact. (CITV Bermuda press conference broadcast dated 2020-05-20 on YouTube)

The head of KEMH also was pleased with the physical distancing people are doing as they are seeing a flat curve, related to the number of cases.

Announced press conference meetings will be changed starting next week to twice a week.

== Community ==
Many events had to be cancelled or postponed during the pandemic, to many to mention however, some of the most notable are:
* Bermuda Day Friday, 29 May
* Carnival Monday, 15 June
* Cup March is currently be watch and a decision will be published once made.
* End-to-End Saturday, 4 May
* Graduation Ceremonies

To observe physical distancing one school, Warwick Academy, prepared a bus that went around the island to many if not all of their students to make the event memorable with photographs with the school mascot. This was a creative and 'out of the box' type of thinking that was needed during the pandemic.<ref>http://bernews.com/2020/05/photos-warwick-academy-graduation/</ref>

== Economy ==
With the forced closures starting on the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bermuda#Saturday, 21 March|21 March]], the Bermuda economy started a slowdown. Many business had struggled to stay open, especially those in the service industry like restaurants and hotels.

=== Government ===

==== Unemployment Benefit ====
The Government created a temporary unemployment benefit<ref>http://www.bermudalaws.bm/laws/Annual%20Laws/2020/Statutory%20Instruments/Public%20Treasury%20(Administration%20and%20Payments)%20(Temporary%20Unemployment%20Benefit)%20Regulations%202020.pdf</ref> to assist people financially who had been unemployed as a result of COVID-19. This legislation was amended as time went on to assist as many as possible and even those who did not pay taxes in the past on the condition they register with the tax office. The aim was to be a bridge between the financial assistance program and the loss of employment during these times, as you have to be unemployed for twelve weeks before you can apply for financial assistance. More than two thousand payments had been processed however, some have still not received payments (15 May 2020) due to the processes within the government offices and the inability to clearly identify individual identities.

First payments had been paid out the last week of March (30 March to 3 April) with some 819 completed application as of Wednesday, 31 March. Usually payments are made on the Thursday and Friday of each week. As of Wednesday, 20 May it was reported that approximately nine thousand individuals had been paid and twenty-three million paid out in relation to the unemployment benefit, with 1241 payments made for the first time last week.

==== Government Plans ====
A further 150 million in a financing agreement by the government with a local institution to public funds.
