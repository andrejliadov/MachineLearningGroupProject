{{Short description|Overview of homeschooling during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic}}
There was a resurgence of '''homeschooling during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic'''. Variations of [[homeschooling]] include micro schools and educational family co-ops. The first usually involves hired professionals to teach a small group of kids (similar to one-room schoolhouses). The second is a parent-organized co-operative where families take turns educating and minding their kids during the week. 'Pandemic pod' is the fashionable term used to describe one of these arrangements where all group members agree to participate under well-defined and strictly enforced health rules.

The [[impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education]] included school closures around the world.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gonser |first=Sarah |date=2020-04-08 |title=What Past Education Emergencies Tell Us About Our Future |url=https://www.edutopia.org/article/what-past-education-emergencies-tell-us-about-our-future |work= edutopia |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Coronavirus Impact: Cancellations, closures related to COVID-19 in San Francisco Bay Area |url=https://abc7news.com/coronavirus-in-bay-area-cases-corona-virus-california/5990803/ |work=abc7news |date=2020-07-16 |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> Parents are left to manage their children and it is causing economic,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Psacharopoulos |first1=George |last2=Patrinos |first2=Harry |last3=Collis |first3=Victoria |last4=Vegas |first4=Emiliana |date=2020-04-29 |title=The COVID-19 cost of school closures |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2020/04/29/the-covid-19-cost-of-school-closures/ |work= Brookings |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lindzon |first=Jared |date=2020-03-20 |title=School closures are starting, and they'll have far-reaching economic impacts |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90476445/school-closures-are-starting-and-theyll-have-far-reaching-economic-impacts |work= Fast Company |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> educational,<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Dana |date=2020-06-05 |title=Research Shows Students Falling Months Behind During Virus Disruptions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/coronavirus-education-lost-learning.html |work= The New York Times |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> political<ref>{{cite news |last=Peek |first=Liz |date=2020-07-17 |title=Dems, Teacher Unions Playing Politics With School Closures |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/07/17/dems_teacher_unions_playing_politics_with_school_closures_517471.html |work= Real Clear Politics |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Perper |first=Rosie |date=2020-07-07 |title=Trump is pushing to reopen schools, which he claims are closed for political reasons and not to curb the coronavirus' spread |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pushes-to-reopen-schools-claims-closures-are-political-2020-7 |work= Business Insider |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2020-07-14 |title=Growing number of districts decide to start the school year online |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-pushes-to-reopen-schools-claims-closures-are-political-2020-7 |work= EdSource |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> and psychological distress.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2020-04-14 |title=Mental health effects of school closures during COVID-19 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(20)30109-7/fulltext  |work=The Lancet |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref> A [[University of California, San Francisco]] study states that schools can't open safely until COVID-19 transmission in a general population is under control.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vaziri |first=Aidin |date=2020-08-25 |title=Coronavirus in the classroom?

To mitigate the pain of school closures, multiple educational structures have been proposed. These terms are used interchangeably and this makes it confusing for parents who are trying to figure out how to organize their lives this fall as most schools will only offer virtual instruction. But basically there are three distinct ideas: pandemic pods, micro schools, and family co-ops.<ref>{{cite web |last=Werby |first=Olga |date=2020-07-24 |title=Micro Schools, Pandemic Pods, & Educational Family Co-ops |url=https://supermarketscience.com/micro-schools-pandemic-pods-educational-family-co-ops/ |work=Supermarket Science |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Dani|first=Blum|last2=Miller|first2=Farah|date=August 18, 2020|title=What Parents Need to Know About Learning Pods|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/article/learning-pods-coronavirus.html?surface=home-living-vi&fellback=false&req_id=834961991&algo=identity&imp_id=349011736&action=click&module=Smarter%20Living&pgtype=Homepage|url-status=live|access-date=August 22, 2020}}</ref>

==Pandemic pod==
A pandemic pods is a small group of people who are all taking similar precautions against catching the virus. A family unit living together is a natural pandemic pod — everyone is taking responsibility for everyone else's health outcomes. This is also true of roommates and housemates. If one person in a pandemic pod catches the virus, chances are high that the other members of the pandemic pod will get it too.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2020-08-03 |title=Clinical Questions about COVID-19: Questions and Answers |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html |work=CDC |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref>

==Family co-op==
A family co-op is not a pandemic-related entity. Most family co-ops form to ease the economic pressures of child care among several families. Several families get together and agree to share afterschool care of all the kids on certain days. This arrangement frees each set of parents from childcare several times per week. If five families are involved, then each family can take responsibility for all kids once per week. Instead of money, this social arrangement trades in time. Family co-ops is a very old arrangement that has been extensively studied in academic literature.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Coontz |first=E.

==Canadian family bubble==
In early April 2020, Canadian authorities actively encouraged the formation of family bubble — two families (usually with kids) who would join together and share responsibility for each other.<ref>{{cite news |last=Coletta |first=Amanda |date=2020-05-08 |title=Canadian provinces allow locked-down households to pair up — threatening hurt feelings all around |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/coronavirus-canada-new-brunswick-newfoundland-double-bubble/2020/05/07/78e08960-8eec-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html |work=The Washington Post |access-date=2020-08-03}}</ref>

==Micro school==
{{main article|Micro-schooling}}
A micro school is some variation on the one-room school where parents hire a teacher to educate their children. Micro schools can be as small as just one family hiring a teacher or a group of parents makes arrangements for all of their children together, splitting the costs of such endeavor. The biggest advantage of micro schools is that parents have total control over their children's education, including the choice of teachers. Micro Schools can vary significantly in costs.<ref>{{cite news |last=McDonald |first=Kerry |date=2019-10-21 |title=Micro-School Network Expands Learning Options

Some parents created "school pods" of multiple families or hired tutors to instruct students by zoom.<ref>{{cite news |last=Spiller |first=Penny |date=2020-08-04 |title=Coronavirus: How pandemic pods and zutors are changing home-schooling

== Pandemic educational family co-op ==
A pandemic educational family co-op is the cross of all three structures: the micro schools, the family co-ops, and the Pandemic pods. Pandemic educational family co-ops function just like the educational family co-ops but in addition to all of the rest, the pandemic version stresses pandemic precautions within the group. This is the most economical solution for parents that are stuck without "brick and mortar" schools to send their kids during the week. <ref>{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Ellen |date=2020-08-09 |title=In 2020, back-to-school shopping means frantically searching for other families to 'bubble up' with |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/in-2020-back-to-school-shopping-means-frantically-searching-for-other-families-to-bubble-up-with/2020/08/08/bae0f2fa-d78f-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_story.html |work= The Washington Post |access-date=2020-08-09}}</ref>
