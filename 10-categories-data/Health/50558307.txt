The '''Adverse Childhood Experiences movement''' is an initiative to revolutionize national awareness, and understanding of the health impacts of [[adverse childhood experiences]] (ACEs), and toxic stress, and to implement programs and protocols to prevent, recognize, and address them when they have occurred.<ref name="CDC">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childabuseandneglect/acestudy/aboutace.html|title=About Adverse Childhood Experiences {{!}}Violence Prevention{{!}}Injury Center{{!}}CDC|date=2019-10-22|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Adverse childhood experiences are defined as potentially traumatic experiences that can occur between the ages of 0 and 17.<ref name="CDC"/> The movement is being driven by pediatric clinicians, educators, parents, policymakers and other child-serving professionals and advocates who are working to implement universal screening for adverse childhood experiences.<ref name="CDC"/>

Adverse childhood experiences can involve [[Sexual abuse|sexual]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]], or [[physical abuse]]. ACEs have been linked to premature death as well as to various health conditions, including those of [[mental disorders]].<ref name="CDC" /><ref name="Harvard">{{cite web |title=What Are ACEs? And How Do They Relate to Toxic Stress? |url=https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/aces-and-toxic-stress-frequently-asked-questions/ |website=Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Resulting [[toxic stress]] has also been linked to childhood maltreatment, which is related to a number of neurological changes in the structure of the brain and its function. The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences Study]] was the first large scale study to look at the relationship between ten categories of adversity in childhood and health outcomes in adulthood.<ref name=":1" />

Psychologists, politicians, therapists, educators, and countless other professionals interested in advocating for universal screening for ACEs while creating awareness of ACEs and possible treatments for their residual effects has resulted in the launching of a public health campaign ''Stress Health Public Education Campaign'' to bring greater attention to the problems implicated by stress and toxic stress in childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centerforyouthwellness.org/building-a-movement/|title=Building a Movement|website=Center for Youth Wellness|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref><ref name="StressHealth">{{cite web |title=JOIN THE MOVEMENT |url=https://www.stresshealth.org/join-the-movement/ |website=Stress Health |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>

== Start of the ACE-aware movement ==
The ACE aware movement arose out of the need for a bidirectional effort to create a public health change, with both individuals and institutions/ government systems.<ref name="aceaware">{{cite web |title=ACE-Aware |url=http://aceawarescotland.com |website=ACE Aware Scotland |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Change on the individual level is essential, because individual change is self-directed.<ref name="CDC"/> The institutions and government systems engagement is essential, because without the structure surrounding individuals changing, the very systems that are intended to help, can perpetuate the cycle of trauma.

== International adoption of the ACEs model==
The U.S. ACEs list was created in 1997 when a study was conducted to examine different childhood traumas. From 1995-1997, the CDC Kaiser ACE study involved more than 17,000 people sharing their stories about their unforgettable childhood trauma experiences. They used this study to make a list of ACEs to determine and examine how these traumatizing experiences can lead to health issues and stunt developmental growth. ACEs are divided into three categories: abuse, household challenges, and neglect. Examples of ACEs include being exposed to abuse and neglect, violence in the family, mental illness, parental divorce or substance abuse. It is said to disrupt a child's development, leading to poor health outcomes and low life expectancy.<ref name=":2" />

In the UK in 2017 a study was made based on the original US study and presented together with recommendations for early intervention to the UK parliament.<ref name="Parliament">{{cite web |title=Evidence-based early years intervention - Science and Technology Committee - House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/506/50605.htm |website=publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>

The [[World Health Organization]] has designed a far more extensive screening questionnaire than the original US version, designed to be used internationally in order to relate adverse conditions to future developments in the hope of possible preventive interventions. In addition to the ACEs identified in the US questionnaire it includes questions related to such adverse experiences as warfare. The questionnaire is titled the [[Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ)]].<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |title=WHO {{!}} Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) |url=https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/activities/adverse_childhood_experiences/en/ |website=WHO |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>

== ACEs score ==
To determine someone's ACEs score, they answer the 10 Adverse Childhood Experiences questions relating to events prior to their eighteenth birthday.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acesconnection.com/blog/got-your-ace-resilience-scores|title=Got Your ACE, Resilience Scores?|last=Stevens|first=Jane|date=1 January 2017|website=acesconnection.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> The questions are:

:1. Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often... Swear at you, insult you, put you down, or humiliate you? or act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt?
:2. Did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often... Push, grab, slap, or throw something at you? or Ever hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured?
:3. Did an adult or person at least 5 years older than you ever... Touch or fondle you or have you touch their body in a sexual way? or Attempt or actually have oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse with you?

:8. Did you live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic, or who used street drugs?
:9. Was a household member depressed or mentally ill, or did a household member attempt suicide?
:10. Did a household member go to prison?

== Long term effects of ACEs ==
According to the Center for Youth Wellness website, "Exposure without a positive buffer, such as a nurturing parent or caregiver, can lead to a Toxic Stress Response in children, which can, in turn, lead to health problems like asthma, poor growth and frequent infections, as well as learning difficulties and behavioral issues. In the long term, exposure to ACEs can also lead to serious health conditions like heart disease, stroke, and cancer later in life."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://centerforyouthwellness.org/health-impacts/|title=How ACEs Affect Health|website=Center for Youth Wellness|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>

Adverse child experiences are equal to various stresses, and a serious adversity is defined as a trauma.<ref name="Pearce">{{cite journal |last1=Pearce |first1=J |last2=Murray |first2=C |last3=Larkin |first3=W |title=Childhood adversity and trauma: experiences of professionals trained to routinely enquire about childhood adversity. |journal=Heliyon |date=July 2019 |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=e01900 |doi=10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01900 |pmid=31372522|pmc=6658729 |doi-access=free }}</ref>
[[The World Health Organization]] (WHO) recognises that prolonged stress in childhood can have life-long implications for the development of many diseases. Moreover ACEs can disrupt early brain development leading to the possible development of several disorders. WHO has designed a screening questionnaire to be used internationally in order to list adverse effects, and relate them to future developments in the hope of possible preventive interventions. The questionnaire is titled the [[Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ)]].<ref name="WHO">{{cite web |title=WHO {{!}} Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ) |url=https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/activities/adverse_childhood_experiences/en/ |website=WHO |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>

Sandra Bloom and Brian Farragher's book ''Destroying Sanctuary'' states in its introduction that 17th century philosophers like [[Ren√© Descartes|Descartes]] took apart the person and "turned over the body to physicians and the mind to philosophers and clergy," and in the ACEs movement society is now trying to bring them back together.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofzdFRgzxpUC&pg=PR3&q=descartes|title=Destroying Sanctuary: The Crisis in Human Service Delivery Systems|last=Bloom|first=Sandra L.|last2=Farragher|first2=Brian|date=2010-10-28|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199830848}}</ref>
