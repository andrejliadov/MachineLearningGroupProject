The '''health effects of chocolate''' are the possible positive and negative effects on health of eating [[chocolate]].

Unconstrained consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity, increases the risk of [[obesity]]. Raw chocolate is high in [[cocoa butter]], a fat removed during chocolate refining, then added back in varying proportions during  manufacturing. Manufacturers may add other fats, [[sugar]]s, and [[powdered milk]] as well.

Although considerable research has been conducted to evaluate the potential health benefits of consuming chocolate, there are insufficient [[clinical research|studies]] to confirm any effect and no medical or regulatory authority has approved any health claim.

==History==

''[[Theobroma cacao]]'', the cacao tree, produces seeds containing [[flavanol]]s. The seeds have been used to make beverages for some 2000 years in [[Aztec]], [[Olmec]], and [[Maya civilization]]s in central and south America. The drinks were ascribed a wide variety of curative and stimulant properties, unsupported by experimental evidence. In the 19th century, chocolate as a solid was invented, and milk and sugar were added to create milk chocolate, high in fat and sugar. Doubtful research, sometimes funded by the chocolate industry, has at times made suggestions of possible health benefits for these products.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Nic|title=The dark truth about chocolate|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/25/chocolate-the-dark-truth-is-it-good-for-you-health-wellbeing-blood-pressure-flavanols|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 March 2018}}</ref>

==Research==

===Addiction===
Food, including chocolate, is not typically viewed as [[addiction|addictive]].<ref name=Rogers2000>{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=Peter J |last2=Smit |first2=Hendrik J |title=Food Craving and Food 'Addiction' |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |year=2000 |pmid=10837838 |doi=10.1016/s0091-3057(00)00197-0 }}</ref> Some people, however, may want or crave chocolate,<ref name=Rogers2000/> leading to a self-described term, [[chocoholic]].<ref name=Rogers2000/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/the-chocoholics-survival-guide|title=The Chocoholic's Survival Guide|last=Skarnulis|first=Leanna|work=webmd.com|accessdate=14 April 2013}}</ref>

===Weight gain===
The effect of chocolate on [[body weight]] is unclear. A concern is that excessive consumption of chocolate may promote high [[calorie]] intake and weight gain, a risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease.<ref name=Lat2013>{{cite journal|last1=Latif|first1=R|title=Chocolate/cocoa and human health: a review.|journal=The Netherlands Journal of Medicine|date=March 2013|volume=71|issue=2|pages=63–8|pmid=23462053}}</ref> As a consequence, consuming large quantities of dark chocolate in an attempt to protect against cardiovascular disease is likely to add excessive calories and induce weight gain.<ref name=Lat2013/>

===Mood===
By some [[Urban legend|popular myths]], chocolate is considered to be a [[mood (psychology)|mood enhancer]], such as by increasing [[aphrodisiac|sex drive]] or stimulating [[cognition]], but there is little scientific evidence that such effects are consistent among all chocolate consumers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=G|last2=Parker|first2=I|last3=Brotchie|first3=H|title=Mood state effects of chocolate|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=June 2006|volume=92|issue=2–3|pages=149–59|pmid=16546266|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2006.02.007}}</ref><ref name="Scholey">{{cite journal | last=Scholey | first=Andrew | last2=Owen | first2=Lauren | title=Effects of chocolate on cognitive function and mood: a systematic review | journal=Nutrition Reviews | volume=71 | issue=10 | year=2013 | issn=0029-6643 | doi=10.1111/nure.12065 | pages=665–681|pmid=24117885}}</ref> If mood improvement from eating chocolate occurs, there is not enough research to indicate whether it results from the favorable flavor or from the [[stimulant]] effects of its constituents, such as [[caffeine]], [[theobromine]], or their parent molecule, [[xanthine|methylxanthine]].<ref name=Scholey/>

==Polyphenol and theobromine content==

==Other animals==

{{Main|Theobromine poisoning}}
In sufficient amounts, the theobromine found in chocolate is [[toxic]] to animals such as cats, dogs, horses, parrots, and small rodents because they are unable to [[metabolize|metabolise]] the chemical effectively.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smit HJ |year=2011 |title=Theobromine and the pharmacology of cocoa |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol |volume=200 |issue= 200|pages=201–34 |doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-13443-2_7|pmid=20859797 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=978-3-642-13442-5 }}</ref> If animals are fed chocolate, the theobromine may remain in the circulation for up to 20&nbsp;hours, possibly causing [[epileptic seizure]]s, [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[internal bleeding]], and eventually death. Medical treatment performed by a [[veterinarian]] involves inducing [[vomiting]] within two hours of ingestion and administration of [[benzodiazepine]]s or [[barbiturate]]s for seizures, [[antiarrhythmic agents|antiarrhythmics]] for [[cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmias]], and [[forced diuresis|fluid diuresis]].

A typical {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog will normally experience great intestinal distress after eating less than {{convert|240|g|oz}} of dark chocolate, but will not necessarily experience [[bradycardia]] or [[tachycardia]] unless it eats at least a half a kilogram (1.1&nbsp;lb) of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate has 2 to 5 times more theobromine and thus is more dangerous to dogs. According to the [[Merck Veterinary Manual]], approximately 1.3&nbsp;grams of baker's chocolate per kilogram of a dog's body weight (0.02&nbsp;oz/lb) is sufficient to cause symptoms of toxicity. For example, a typical {{convert|25|g|oz|adj=on}} baker's chocolate bar would be enough to bring about symptoms in a {{convert|20|kg|lb|adj=on}} dog. Of course, [[baking chocolate]] is rarely consumed directly due to its unpleasant taste, but other dark chocolates' canine toxicities may be extrapolated based on this figure. Given access, dogs frequently consume chocolate at toxic levels because they like the taste of chocolate products and are capable of finding and eating quantities much larger than typical human servings. There are reports that [[mulch]] made from cacao bean shells is dangerous to dogs and livestock.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=R |last2=Arendt |first2=TD |last3=Stowe |first3=CM |title=Cacao bean shell poisoning in a dog |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=185 |issue=8 |pages=902 |year=1984 |pmid=6501051 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blakemore |first1=F |last2=Shearer |first2=GD |title=The poisoning of livestock by cacao products |journal=Veterinary Record |year=1943 |volume=55 |issue=15 |pages=165 }}</ref>
