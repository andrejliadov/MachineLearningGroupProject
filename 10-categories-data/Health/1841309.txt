The '''10/90 gap''' is the term adopted by the [[Global Forum for Health Research]] to highlight the finding by the [[Commission on Health Research for Development]] in 1990, that less than 10% of worldwide resources devoted to health research were put towards health in [[Developing Countries]], where over 90% of all preventable deaths worldwide occurred.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.globalforumhealth.org/about1090-gap/|title = 10/90 gap|date = 2011|access-date = April 16, 2015|website = Global Forum for Health Research}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Every year, the spread of disease suffered in both rich and poor countries converges. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), the most prevalent diseases consist of [[cardiovascular disease]], [[cancer]] and [[diabetes]].  These diseases now{{When|date=June 2016}} account for 45% of the global health burden and is the culprit for up to 85% of deaths in low-income countries. The 10/90 Gap focuses on joining organisations together to reduce these statistics.<ref>Luchetti, M. (2014). Global health and the 10/90 gap. British Journal of Medical Practitioners, 7(4), 4.</ref>

==Disease and the 10/90 gap==

A substantial portion of diseases, most prevalent in impoverished or developing countries, are those which are preventable and/or treatable.<ref name=Currat>Currat, L.J., Francisco, A., Al-Tuwaijri, S., Ghaffar, A., & Jupp, S. (2004). 10/90 report on health research 2003-2004. WHO Drug Information, 18(3), 243. Retrieved from http://announcementsfiles.cohred.org/gfhr_pub/assoc/s14789e/s14789e.pdf</ref> The World Health Organization (2004) stated in their world health report that an estimated eight million individuals die prematurely, from diseases and conditions that can be cured, every year. These deaths contribute to approximately one third of all human deaths in the world, each year.<ref name=Currat/> Table 1 lists several of these curable diseases.

==Strategies for change==

Global health organisations across the globe have explicitly made research into health their priority. In 2000, World Health Organization established the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, who in their 2001 report, verified the relationship between poverty and disease and discussed the benefit of investment on the economic climates of developing countries.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hotez P.J. |author2=Ferris M.T. | year = 2006 | title = The antipoverty vaccines | journal = Vaccine | volume = 26 | issue = 24| pages = 31–31 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.008 }}</ref> Possible strategies that can be implanted to help reduce the 10/90 gap are, policies prioritizing funding for health research, also developing capacities of credible public and private health research institutions.<ref>Haines, A., Kuruvilla, S., & Borchert, M. (2004). Bridging the implementation gap between knowledge and action for health. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 82(10), 724–732.</ref> Also activities of international NGOs to undertake research aimed at resolving the gap, and the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kilama W. L. | year = 2009 | title = The 10/90 gap in sub-saharan africa: Resolving inequities in health research | journal = Acta Tropica | volume = 112 | pages = S8–S15 | doi = 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.08.015 }}</ref> However, given the number of diseases that are preventable, other factors that are blocking the access of patients to these products, such as cost of treatments to the individual, also need to be addressed, rather that just focusing on developing new drugs.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Diseases of Poverty and the 10/90 Gap|last = Stevens|first = Philip|publisher = International Policy Network|year = 2004|location = London, UK.|pages = 7–8}}</ref> There is also a need to build the [[primary health care]] sector in developing countries. It has been shown that early detection and effective management of disease can be provided by appropriately-trained, non-physician, healthcare workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Global health: Noncommunicable diseases|last = Hunter|first = D.J.|date = 2013|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1109345|last2 = Reddy|first2 = K.S.|volume=369|pages=1336–1343}}</ref>

==Health expenditure==

The gap between financial needs and financial means in low income countries can only be filled by donations. The average health expenditure per capita in western countries is estimated at $947 compared to $20 per capita in low income countries. To assist the world's poorest, health expenditure between $44–60 per capita is placed as a target.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |title=Global Health and the 10/90 gap |last=Luchetti |first=Marco |date=2014 |journal=British journal of medical practitioners |issn=1757-8515 |access-date=10 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326005313/http://www.bjmp.org/content/global-health-and-1090-gap |archive-date=2015-03-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> This target is achieved by the contribution of 0.1% of  advanced western countries gross national production (GNP) to fund global health, this recommendation was set by the WHO in 2001 and is estimated to save 8 million lives per year.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development|url = https://archive.org/details/macroeconomicshe00sach|url-access = limited|last = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|year = 2001|location = Geneva|pages = [https://archive.org/details/macroeconomicshe00sach/page/n17 7]–11}}</ref>

== Global research and development ==

Among other efforts to address this issue are recent proposals for a Global Research and Development ([[Research and development|R&D]]) [[treaty]], and the creation of the nonprofit [[Pharmacology|pharmaceutical]] company [[Institute for OneWorld Health|OneWorld Health]] which develops new and affordable medicines for neglected diseases. A treaty creates a system that allows health research to come from contributions by all and therefore the sharing of benefits for all, improving the fairness and sustainability of global research and development.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Innovation and Access to Medicines for Neglected Populations: Could a Treaty Address a Broken Pharmaceutical R&D System?|last = Moon|first = Suerie|date = 15 May 2012|journal = PLOS Medicine|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001218|pmid = 22615544|pmc=3352855|volume=9|pages=e1001218}}</ref> In a positive development for the closing of the gap, in the 2012 [[London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases]] many parties, including governments, funding organisations and drug companies, agreed to work towards the eradication of [[neglected tropical diseases]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Development assistance for neglected tropical diseases: Progress since 2009|last = Liese|first = Bernhard H|date = 2014|journal = International Health|doi = 10.1093/inthealth/ihu052|last2 = Houghton|first2 = Natalia|last3 = Teplitskaya|first3 = Lyubov|issue = 3|volume = 6|pages = 162–171|doi-access = free}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Despite the findings of the World Health Organization, and the disparity of curable diseases throughout developing and developed countries, some people{{weasel inline|date=April 2019}} believe the 10/90 gap is a myth.<ref name=Vidyasagar>{{cite journal|last1=Vidyasagar|first1=D|title=Global notes: The 10/90 gap disparities in global health research|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=55–56|doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211402}}</ref> They criticise the fact that simple medicines which stop curable and treatable conditions such as diarrhoea and malaria are available to these countries. The issue is not with the medicine, but with the ability for the affected to access it. Access to medicine can be inhibited by many circumstances such as poverty, strict government regime and inadequate healthcare systems and infrastructure.<ref name=Vidyasagar/>
