'''Collaborative Care''' is a [[healthcare]] philosophy and movement that has many names, models, and definitions that often includes the provision of mental health, behavioral health and substance use services in primary care.  Similar ideas include: [[Integrated care]], [[Primary Care Behavioral health|Primary Care Behavioral Health]], [[Integrated care system]]s, and [[shared care]].  

The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) published an overview of many different models and the [[research]] that supports them.<ref>Butler M, Kane RL, McAlpine D, Kathol, RG, Fu SS, Hagedorn H, Wilt TJ. Integration of Mental Health/Substance Abuse and Primary Care No. 173 (Prepared by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-02-0009.) AHRQ Publication No. 09-E003. Rockville, MD. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. October 2008.</ref>  The key features of Collaborative Care models are:<br />
*Integration of [[mental health professional]]s in [[primary care]] medical settings<br />
*Close collaboration between [[mental health]] and medical/[[nursing]] providers<br />
*Focus on treating the whole person and whole family.

There are organisations in many countries promoting these ideas such as the American [[Collaborative Family Healthcare Association]].
