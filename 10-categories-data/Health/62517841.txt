In an article in ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'', Basken explained that part of the mission of Pediatric Congenital Heart Association is to empower families because "Families deserve to be empowered with essential information to support shared decision-making with their providers."<ref name=":2" /> The association developed the [https://www.conqueringchd.org/guided-questions-tool/ guided question tool] with families to help them navigate the health care system when their child is diagnosed with congenital heart disease. Several children's hospitals in the USA, including [[Lurie Children's Hospital]] and [[Children's Hospital Colorado]], now produce information for families that is based on the guided question tool and designed to address the Pediatric Congenital Heart Association's call for transparency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.childrenscolorado.org/doctors-and-departments/departments/heart/resources/hlhs-resources/|title=HLHS Resources for Families|website=www.childrenscolorado.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/childrens-hospitals-pediatric-congenital-heart-183000377.html|title=Children's Hospitals and Pediatric Congenital Heart Association Call for Transparency In Cardiac Surgical Outcomes|website=finance.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/specialties-conditions/heart-center/volumes-outcomes/transparency-in-reporting-outcomes/|title=Transparency in Reporting Outcomes|website=www.luriechildrens.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref> She is also leading Pediatric Congenital Heart Association's efforts to build better web resources for families to interpret published surgery outcomes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snntv.com/story/41179159/childrens-hospitals-and-pediatric-congenital-heart-association-call-for-transparency-in-cardiac-surgical-outcomes|title=Children's Hospitals and Pediatric Congenital Heart Association Call for Transparency In Cardiac Surgical Outcomes|website=www.snntv.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conqueringchd.org/makingsensecongenitalheartsurgerydata/|title=Making sense of congenital heart surgery data|date=2017-08-30|website=PCHA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>
