'''Adolf Hitler's health''' has long been a subject of popular controversy. Both his physical and mental health have come under scrutiny. Part of this is because Hitler was extremely [[inbred]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/alois-hitler|title=Origins Of Evil: The Rage-Filled Story Of Alois Hitler|first=Gina|last=Dimuro|date=June 11, 2018|website=All That's Interesting}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vernon |first1=W.

==Syphilis==
[[Adolf Hitler]]'s tremor and irregular heartbeat during the last years of his life could have been symptoms of tertiary (late stage) [[syphilis]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2842819.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hitler syphilis theory revived | date=2003-03-12 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> which would mean he had a syphilis infection for many years. However, syphilis had become curable in 1910 with Dr. [[Paul Ehrlich]]'s introduction of the drug [[Arsphenamine|Salvarsan]].

The author [[Deborah Hayden]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XM4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PT220 |page=220 |title=Pox|isbn=9780786724130|last1=Hayden|first1=Deborah|date=4 August 2008}}</ref>
has written extensively regarding Hitler and syphilis.<ref>See a [https://archive.org/stream/TothePeo1944/TothePeo1944_edit.mp4 documentary video file] produced by the Armed Forces in the late 1940s about the very serious number of cases of the disease reported in Europe and the United States in the early part of the century.</ref>

In his biography of Doctor [[Felix Kersten]] called ''The Man with the Miraculous Hands,''<ref>Kessel, Joseph. ''The Man With the Miraculous Hands: The Fantastic Story of Felix Kersten, Himmler's Private Doctor''. Classics of War Series. Springfield, NJ: Burford Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1580801226}}.</ref> journalist and [[Académie française]] member [[Joseph Kessel]] wrote that in the winter of 1942, Kersten heard of Hitler's medical condition. Consulted by his patient, Himmler, as to whether he could "assist a man who suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and insomnia", Kersten was shown a top-secret 26-page report. It detailed how Hitler had contracted syphilis in his youth and was treated for it at a hospital in [[Pasewalk]], [[Germany]]. However, in 1937, symptoms re-appeared, showing that the disease was still active, and by the start of 1942, signs were evident that progressive syphilitic paralysis (''[[Tabes dorsalis]]'') was occurring. Himmler advised Kersten that [[Theodore Morell|Morell]] (who in the 1930s claimed to be a specialist [[Venereology|venereologist]]) was in charge of Hitler's treatment, and that it was a state secret. The book also relates how Kersten learned from Himmler's secretary, [[Rudolf Brandt]], that at that time, probably the only other people privy to the report's information were [[Nazi Party]] chairman [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Hermann Göring]], the head of the [[Luftwaffe]].

==Monorchism==
{{See also|Hitler Has Only Got One Ball|Adolf Hitler's possible monorchism}}
It has been alleged that Hitler had [[monorchism]], the medical condition of having only one [[testicle]]. In 2008, a British newspaper reported that, in 1916, a German doctor named Johan Jambor had encountered an injured Hitler during the [[Battle of the Somme]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last1=Jamieson |first1=Alastair |title=Nazi leader Hitler really did have only one ball |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3481932/Nazi-leader-Hitler-really-did-have-only-one-ball.html |work=The Telegraph |date=19 November 2008 }}</ref> Jambor allegedly asserted that Hitler—who is known to have suffered a groin injury in the battle—had in fact lost a testicle. Jambor had supposedly described the dictator's condition to a priest, who later wrote down what he had been told.<ref name=":0" />

Soviet doctor Lev Bezymensky, allegedly involved in the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Soviet autopsy]], stated in a 1967 book that Hitler's left testicle was missing. Bezymensky later admitted that the claim was falsified.<ref>Bezymensky L. A. ''Operatsija "Mif" ili skolko raz choronili Gitlera.'' Moscow 1995</ref> 

Hitler was routinely examined by many doctors throughout his childhood, military service and later political career, and no clinical mention of any such condition has ever been discovered. Eduard Block, Hitler’s childhood doctor, told U.S. interrogators in 1943 that Hitler's genitals were in fact "completely normal".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4233811/hitler-micropenis-nazi-genitals/ |first=Tara |last=John |date=February 23, 2016 |title=The Immortal Myth of Hitler's Deformed Genitals|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

== Huntington's disease ==
It has been speculated that Hitler had [[Huntington's disease]]. When many of the physical symptoms shown in newsreels during his later life &ndash; his hand tremor and shuffling gait &ndash;  are coupled with his alleged mental and psychological deterioration, they may also point toward Huntington's.  This is only conjecture, since a definitive diagnosis would require DNA testing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117|title=Huntington's disease - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref>  Although Huntington's Disease was known and considered a hereditary disease during the time period, even appearing in state papers on the sterilization list, it is not known if Hitler knew of this condition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hdlf.org/node/719|title=Huntington's disease - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdlf.org/node/719|title=Hitler's 'Cure' for Huntington's Disease {{!}} Huntington's Disease Lighthouse Families|website=www.hdlf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}</ref>

== Parkinson's disease ==
It has also been speculated Hitler had [[Parkinson's disease]]. Newsreels of Hitler show he had tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk (also a symptom of tertiary syphilis, see above) which began before the war and continued to worsen until the end of his life. Morell treated Hitler with a drug agent that was commonly used in 1945, although Morell is viewed as an incompetent doctor by most historians and any diagnoses he may have made are subject to doubt.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Kalyan B. |title=Adolf Hitler and His Parkinsonism |journal=Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology |date=2015 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=387–390 |doi=10.4103/0972-2327.169536 |doi-broken-date=2020-09-30 |pmid=26713007 |pmc=4683874 }}</ref>

A more reliable physician, [[Ernst-Günther Schenck]], who worked at an emergency casualty station in the [[Reich Chancellery]] during April 1945, also claimed Hitler might have Parkinson's disease. However, Schenck only saw Hitler briefly on two occasions and, by his own admission, was extremely exhausted and dazed during these meetings (at the time, he had been in surgery for numerous days without much sleep). Also, some of Schenck's opinions were based on [[hearsay]] from [[Werner Haase|Dr. Werner Haase]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/10/09/Physician-describes-Hitlers-last-days/4583497678400/|title=Physician describes Hitler's last days|website=UPI}}</ref>

==Other complaints==
From the 1930s he suffered from stomach pains, in 1936 a non cancerous [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] was removed from his throat and he developed [[eczema]] on his legs.<ref name=Nemesis>{{cite book|date=2000|author=[[Ian Kershaw]]|isbn=0-393-32252-1|title=Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis|publisher=Penguin Press}}</ref> He suffered [[ruptured eardrum]]s as a result of the [[July 20 plot]] bomb blast in 1944 and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs,<ref name=WithHitler>{{cite book|date=2009|author=[[Heinz Linge]], Roger Moorehouse|isbn=978-1-602-39804-7|title=With Hitler to the End: The Memoir of Hitler's Valet|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|url=https://archive.org/details/withhitlertoendm00ling}}</ref> but he was otherwise uninjured. Some doctors dismiss Hitler's ailments as [[hypochondria]], pointing out the apparently drastic decline of Hitler's health as Germany began losing [[World War II]]. 

==Mental health==
{{See also|Psychopathography of Adolf Hitler}}
As debated as Hitler's physical medical issues may be, his [[mental health]] is a minefield of theories and speculation. This topic is controversial, as many believe that if a [[Psychology|psychological]] cause can be found for Hitler's behavior, there would be more reasoning behind his actions.

Waite, who wrote an extensive [[psychohistory]] of Hitler, concluded that he suffered from [[borderline personality disorder]], which manifested its symptoms in numerous ways and would imply Hitler was in full control of himself and his actions. Others have proposed Hitler may have been [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} based on claims that he was hallucinating and delusional during his last year of life. Many people believe that Hitler had a mental disorder and was not schizophrenic nor [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], but rather met the criteria for both disorders, and was therefore most likely a [[schizoaffective disorder|schizoaffective]]. If true, this might be explained by a series of [[brief reactive psychosis|brief reactive psychoses]] in a [[narcissism|narcissistic personality]] which could not withstand being confronted with reality (in this case, that he was not the "superman" or "savior of Germany" he envisioned himself to be, as his plans and apparent early achievements collapsed about him). In addition, his regular [[methamphetamine]] use<ref name="Channel4">{{YouTube | id=8DJr5q4Bf_s | title=Hitler's Hidden Drug Habit: Secret History}} directed and produced by Chris Durlacher. A Waddell Media Production for Channel 4 in association with National Geographic Channels, MMXIV. Executive Producer Jon-Barrie Waddell.</ref>{{sfn|Doyle|2005|p=8/8 in PDF}} and possible [[sleep deprivation]] in the last period of his life must be factored into any speculation as to the cause of his possible psychotic symptoms, as these two activities are known to trigger psychotic reactions in some individuals. Hitler never visited a [[psychiatrist]], and under current methodology, any such diagnosis is speculation.

==Drug use==
Prescribed 90 medications during the war years by [[Theodor Morell]], Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=782}} He regularly consumed [[methamphetamine]], [[barbiturate]]s, [[opiate]]s, and [[cocaine]],<ref>{{cite web|date=13 February 2017|last=Ohler|first=Norman|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/hitlers-doctor-said-the-dictator-almost-died-from-a-cocaine-overdose|title=Hitler's Doctor Said the Dictator Almost Died from a Cocaine Overdose |work=Vice |accessdate=15 March 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Ghaemi|2011|p={{page needed|date=November 2015}} }}{{sfn|Porter|2013}} as well as [[potassium bromide]] and [[atropa belladonna]] (the latter in the form of [[Doktor Koster's Antigaspills]]).{{sfn|Doyle|2005|p=8}}

==Criticism==
In a 1980 article, the German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] was highly dismissive of all theories that sought to attribute the rise and policies of [[Nazi Germany]] to some defect, medical or otherwise, of Hitler's. In Wehler's opinion, besides the problem that such theories about Hitler's medical condition were extremely difficult to prove, the problem was that they had the effect of personalizing the phenomena of Nazi Germany by more or less attributing everything that happened in the Third Reich to one flawed individual.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Wehler wrote:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|author=Kershaw, Ian |title=The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation|url=https://archive.org/details/nazidictatorship00kers |url-access=registration |location= London |publisher= Arnold |date=2000| page= [https://archive.org/details/nazidictatorship00kers/page/72 72]}}</ref>
{{Quote|Does our understanding of National Socialist policies really depend on whether Hitler had only one testicle?...Perhaps the Führer had three, which made things difficult for him, who knows?...Even if Hitler could be regarded irrefutably as a sado-masochist, which scientific interest does that further?...Does the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' thus become more easily understandable or the 'twisted road to Auschwitz' become the one-way street of a psychopath in power?}}

Echoing Wehler's views, the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argued that it was better to take a broader view of German history by seeking to examine what social forces led to the Third Reich and its policies, as opposed to the "personalized" explanations for [[the Holocaust]] and [[World War II]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> 

In his book ''[[Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil]]'' (1998), the American journalist [[Ron Rosenbaum]] sarcastically remarked that theories concerning Hitler's mental state and sexual activity shed more light on the theorists than on Hitler.
