The '''birthday effect''' (sometimes called the '''birthday blues''', especially when referring specifically to [[suicide]]) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their [[birthday]]. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in [[England and Wales]],<ref name="E&W">{{cite journal|title=Relationship between month of birth and month of death in the elderly|first1=M|last1=Anderson|journal=British Journal of Preventive & Social Medicine|year=1975|volume=29|issue=3|pages=151–156|pmc=478908|pmid=1191883|doi=10.1136/jech.29.3.151}}</ref> [[Switzerland]],<ref name="Swiss1992">{{cite journal|title=[Mortality and birthdays]|first1=J|last1=Bovet|first2=J|last2=Spagnoli|first3=C|last3=Sudan|journal=Sozial- und Präventivmedizin|year=1997|volume=42|issue=3|pages=151–161|pmid=9334087|language=French|doi=10.1007/bf01300566}}</ref><ref name="Swiss2008">{{cite journal|title=Death has a preference for birthdays—an analysis of death time series|first1=Vladeta|last1=Ajdacic-Gross|display-authors=etal|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|year=2012|volume=22|issue=8|pages=603–606|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.04.016|pmid=22658822}}</ref> [[Ukraine]],<ref name="Ukraine">{{cite journal|title=Variation of mortality rate during the individual annual cycle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9087987|first1=Alexander|last1=Vaiserman|first2=Pavel|last2=Grigoryev|first3=Irina|last3=Belaya|first4=Vladimir|last4=Voitenko|journal=Biogerontology|year=2003|volume=4|issue=4|pages=221–225|doi=10.1023/A:1025168932058|pmid=14501186|s2cid=22678145}}</ref> and the [[United States]],<ref name="California">{{cite journal|title=The Birthday: Lifeline or Deadline?|first1=David|last1=Phillips|first2=Camilla|last2=Van Voorhees|first3=Todd|last3=Ruth|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1992|volume=54|issue=5|pages=532–542|doi=10.1097/00006842-199209000-00001|pmid=1438656|citeseerx=10.1.1.103.5726|s2cid=12190316}}</ref><ref name="USA">{{cite journal|title=A not so happy day after all: Excess death rates on birthdays in the U.S|first1=Pablo|last1=Peña|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=2015|volume=126|pages=59–66|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.014|pmid=25528555}}</ref> as well as in smaller populations such as [[Major League Baseball]] players.<ref name="MLB">{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110|s2cid=8439436}}</ref> Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday,<ref name="California"/> while others find no [[statistical significance|significant]] gender effect.<ref name="Austria">{{cite journal|title=Longevity and month of birth: Evidence from Austria and Denmark|first1=Gabrielle|last1=Doblhammer|journal=Demographic Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=&#91;22&#93; p|doi=10.4054/DemRes.1999.1.3|pmid=12178151}}</ref><ref name="Germany">{{cite journal|title=Deaths and major biographical events: a study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009|first1=Daniel|last1=Medenwald|first2=Oliver|last2=Kuss|journal=BMJ Open|year=2014|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004423|pmid=24694623|pmc=3987729|pages=e004423}}</ref> Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased [[mortality salience]], or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually.

==Studies==

With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as [[seasonality]] in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on [[February 29]], there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.<ref name="California"/>

A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80;<ref name="Swiss1992"/> another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths.<ref name="Swiss2008"/> Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%.<ref name="USA"/> An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women.<ref name="Ukraine"/> Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players<ref name="MLB"/> and people with entries in the ''Encyclopedia of American History''.<ref name="California"/>

Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in [[Denmark]]<ref name="Denmark">{{cite journal|title=Postponed Suicide Death?

However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and [[Austria]] (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday.<ref name="Austria"/> A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect.<ref name="Germany"/> A small study by [[Leonard Zusne]] found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole.<ref name="Zusne">{{cite journal|title=Some Factors Affecting the Birthday-Deathday Phenomenon|first1=Leonard|last1=Zusne|journal=OMEGA: Journal of Death and Dying|year=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.2190/RR4D-4W0L-5QAK-X4YX|s2cid=144694845}}</ref> The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but [[Simpson's paradox|it was not seen in the population as a whole]].<ref name="E&W"/>

==Possible explanations==

===External causes===
Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. [[Binge drinking]] can [[Alcohol and health|increase an individual's risk of death]] through [[alcohol poisoning]], accidents and [[drunk driving]], as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.<ref name="Ukraine"/><ref name="Hungary"/> In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.<ref name="alcohol">{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=1|issue=1)|pages=164–182|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}</ref><ref name="alcoholappendix">{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age (Web Appendix A and B)|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|volume=1|issue=1|pages=164–182|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/articles-attachments/aej/app/app/2007-0089_app.pdf|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}</ref>

===Psychosomatic and psychological===
{{see also|Mortality salience}}
Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on [[psychosomatic]] effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life.<ref name="California"/><ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/news/birthdays-a-matter-of-life-and-death.html|first1=Sandra|last1=Blakeslee|title=Birthdays: a Matter Of Life and Death|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 September 1992|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> According to the [[terror management theory]], this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the [[public sphere]] of life (for example, [[career]]-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the [[private sphere]] (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.<ref name="California"/><ref name="MLB"/><ref name="NYT"/> Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering [[suicidal ideation]] will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.<ref name="Hungary"/>

The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as [[Christmas]],<ref name="Germany"/> and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a [[Passover]] effect among the Jewish community (which moves [[Passover#Date and duration|with the festival itself]]), and a [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] effect among the Chinese.<ref name="California"/><ref name="NYT"/>

===Physiological===
It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], the body also has a yearly "circannual" [[biological rhythm]]. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a [[zeitgeber]] that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.<ref name="Ukraine"/>

===Statistical===
It is possible when processing [[death certificate]]s to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide.<ref name="California"/> Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders.<ref name="Heaping">{{cite journal|title=Heaping in Anniversary Reaction Studies: A Cautionary Note|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=OMEGA: Journal of Death and Dying|year=2006|volume=54|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.2190/V752-6773-1KMW-3334|pmid=17844772|s2cid=24371210}}</ref> These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.<ref name="California"/>
