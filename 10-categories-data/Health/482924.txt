The '''Merck Group''', [[brand]]ed and commonly known as '''Merck''', is a German [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] science and technology company headquartered in [[Darmstadt]], with about 57,000 employees and present in 66 countries. The group includes around 250 companies; the main company is Merck [[KGaA]] in Germany. The company is divided into three business lines: Healthcare, Life Sciences and Performance Materials. Merck was founded in 1668 and is the world's oldest operating chemical and pharmaceutical company, as well as one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/0,2828,438352,00.html ''Das älteste Chemieunternehmen der Welt.''] In: ''Manager Magazin'' 21 September 2006</ref><ref>M.

Merck operates in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]] and the [[Americas]]. It has major [[research and development]] centres in Darmstadt, [[Boston]], [[Tokyo]] and [[Beijing]], as well as other Research and Development units in [[Taiwan]], [[France]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]] and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=GLOBAL R&D HUBS Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.|url=https://www.merckgroup.com/en/research/global-r-and-d-hubs.html}}</ref> Merck pioneered the commercial manufacture of [[morphine]] in the 19th century and for a time held a virtual monopoly on [[cocaine]].

Merck was privately owned until going public on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] in 1995 and is listed on the [[DAX]] index of Germany's top companies. The [[Merck family]] still controls a majority of 70.3% of the company's shares. The Merck Group includes around 250 companies in 180 countries; the current main parent company of the group, since 1995, is named ''Merck [[KGaA]]'', and is itself mainly owned by the former main parent company, ''E. Merck [[General partnership|oHG]]'', which now operates as a [[holding company]].

The American pharmaceutical company [[Merck & Co.]] was established as a subsidiary of Merck in 1891, but was [[Nationalization|nationalized]] by the United States in 1917, before being privatized again when [[George W. Merck]] repurchased the stock in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merck.com/about/our-history/home.html/|title = Our History Timeline|access-date = 2 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is known as MSD (''Merck Sharp and Dohme'') outside of North America.

== History ==
===Origins and confiscation===
[[File:ENGEL APHOTHEKE.png|thumb|The Angel Pharmacy in [[Darmstadt]] which was owned by the [[Merck family]] from 1668; the beginning of the Merck company]]
The roots of Merck reach back as far as the 17th century in [[Germany]]. In 1668, [[Friedrich Jacob Merck]], an [[apothecary]], assumed ownership of the ''Engel-Apotheke'' ("Angel Pharmacy") in [[Darmstadt, Germany]].

In 1816, Emanuel Merck, a descendant of the original founder, took over the pharmacy. Thanks to his scientific education he was successful in isolating and characterizing several different [[alkaloids]] in the [[pharmacy]]'s [[laboratory]], and by doing so also invented a number of drugs. He began the manufacture of these substances "in bulk" in 1827, touting them as a "Cabinet of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Innovations". He and his successors gradually built up a [[chemical]]-[[pharmaceutical]] [[factory]] that produced &mdash; in addition to raw materials for pharmaceutical preparations &mdash; a multitude of other chemicals and (from 1890) medicines.<ref name="thun2003">Merck KGaA (Editor): ''„Was der Mensch thun kann...“ – Ein Streifzug durch die Geschichte des pharmazeutisch-chemischen Unternehmens Merck.'' September 2003</ref>

In 1891, Georg(e) Merck established himself in the United States and set up ''Merck & Co.'' with Theodore Weicker in New York. Merck & Co. was confiscated following the [[World War I|First World War]] and set up as an independent company in the United States.<ref name="apc1919">{{cite journal |title=Report of the alien property custodian on the chemical industry |journal=[[Ind.

It is one of the top 5 pharmaceutical companies worldwide, larger than its German ancestor, which employs around 40,700 people in 67 countries (December 2011). While Merck in Darmstadt is the legal successor of the original Merck and retains the rights to the name "Merck" in all countries except the U.S. and Canada, it is sometimes known as the "German Merck" or "Merck Darmstadt" in North America. The company was formerly also referred to as "E. Merck" (Emanuel Merck).

===20th Century activities===
In the years of the Nazi rule, the company was led by Karl Emanuel Merck who became a member of the [[Nazi party]] in 1933 and subsequently received the title of [[Wehrwirtschaftsführer]]. In addition, Merck was president of the Hessian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as performing an advisory function in the Expert Advisory Council for National Health ("Sachverständigenrat für Volksgesundheit") of the [[NSDAP]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Von Adelung bis Zwangsarbeit - Stichworte zu Militär und Nationalsozialismus in Darmstadt |url=https://dfg-vk-darmstadt.de/Lexikon_Auflage_2/MerckKarl.htm |website=Deutsche Friedensgesellschaft - Vereinigte KriegsdienstgegnerInnen Gruppe Darmstadt |access-date=8 May 2020 |language=de}}</ref> During World War II, Merck was manufacturing war essential products such as narcotics, vitamins, [[biocides]] and other chemicals. According to the company's account, 265 [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced laborers]] were working in the plant in Darmstadt, most of them women from Russia and Poland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stationen unserer Geschichte ab 1917 |url=https://www.merckgroup.com/de/company/who-we-are/history/milestones/20th-century-expropriation-america.html |website=Merck Group |access-date=8 May 2020 |language=de}}</ref> Additionally, several hundred [[Forced_labour_under_German_rule_during_World_War_II#Classifications|Fremdarbeiter]] ("foreign workers") from France and Belgium were employed throughout the war years. An air raid on the 12. December 1944 destroyed nearly 70 percent of the plant and killed 55 employees.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burhop |first1=Carsten |last2=Kißener |first2=Michael |last3=Schäfer |first3=Hermann |last4=Scholtyseck |first4=Joachim |title=Merck : From a pharmacy to a global corporation. |date=2018 |publisher=C.H.

In 1973, Merck Ltd. acquired BDH Chemicals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/people/cp17426/british-drug-houses-limited|title=British Drug Houses Limited|publisher=The Science Museum Group|access-date=1 July 2017}}</ref> from the [[Glaxo Group]].

In the early 1980s Merck Group built a visitor center at its Darmstadt headquarters that featured a pyramid.

Merck was legally named ''E. Merck [[Partnership|oHG]]'' until 1995. In 1995 it was listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] and became a [[KGaA]], legally named ''Merck KGaA''.

Merck KGaA established its philanthropic foundation in 2008 called Merck Foundation and Rasha Kelej currently serves as its [[CEO]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New Merck Foundation appoints Rasha Kelej |url=http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_appointments/the_merck_foundation_appoints_rasha_kelej_1197271 |work=PMLive |date=28 June 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rasha Kelej Becomes Merck Foundation CEO |url=https://businesspost.ng/jobs/rasha-kelej-becomes-merck-foundation-ceo/ |work=Business Post Nigeria |date=26 June 2017}}</ref>

===2000 to 2009===
On March 13, 2006, Merck announced a takeover bid for [[Schering AG]], the world's largest producer of oral contraceptives. On March 23, 2006, [[Bayer]] AG made a supported offer for Schering and Merck decided to drop out of the bidding for the company.<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/finanzen/artikel/0,2828,411895,00.html ''Schering rät zur Annahme der Bayer-Offerte.''] In: ''Manager Magazin Online'' 19 April 2006</ref> Schering is not to be confused with [[Schering-Plough]] which was once part of Schering AG but was acquired by Merck & Co. in 2009. In September 2006 the company announced a takeover bid of $13.2 billion for [[Serono]] SA, Switzerland's largest biotech firm. The deal included a buy-out of the [[Ernesto Bertarelli|Bertarelli]] family's 64.5% stake in Serono to be followed by a public tender offer for the remaining shares starting in November 2006.<ref>[http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/artikel/0,2828,438324,00.html ''Serono-Übernahme – Mercks Milliardendeal.''] In: ''manager magazin'' 21 September 2006</ref><ref>Staff, First Word Pharma.

In September 2014 Merck halted the clinical development of two drug candidates in development with [[Oxygen Biotherapeutics]]. One drug candidate suffered a lack of success in patient recruitment, with its MUC1 antigen-specific cancer [[immunotherapy]] drug, [[tecemotide]] (L-BLP25), missing its Phase I/II endpoint of increasing overall survival in patients with Stage III [[non-small cell lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/merck-kgaa-oxygen-suspend-development-of-drug-candidates/81250341/|title=Merck KGaA, Oxygen Suspend Development of Drug Candidates|work=GEN|date=2014-09-12}}</ref> Later in September it was announced that the company would acquire [[Sigma-Aldrich]] for $17 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/merck-kgaa-to-acquire-sigma-aldrich-for-17b/81250377/|title = Merck KGaA to Acquire Sigma-Aldrich for $17B|last = Staff|date = 22 September 2014|work = [[Gen.

===Name===
[[File:Merck-Logo.svg|thumb|Seventh and former logo of Merck KGaA used from 2001 until 13 October 2015. This form was used internationally, in U.S. and Canada its design was similar but reading "EMD" instead of "Merck"]]
Merck in Darmstadt is the sole legal successor of the original Merck and retains the rights to the [[trademark]] "Merck" in all countries except the U.S. and Canada. In recent branding campaigns, the company has referred to itself as "the original Merck" and "the real Merck". The company was legally known as ''E. Merck [[General partnership|oHG]]'' until 1995, when ''Merck [[KGaA]]'' became the main parent company and the former a [[holding company]]. Both oHG and KGaA are generic business entity type designations and not used in everyday speech or branding.

In 2015 Merck adopted a new logo to increase the visual differences between both companies, while also visualizing “vibrant science and technology” as the new company’s brand.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WHO WE ARE - Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany|url=https://www.merckgroup.com/en/company/who-we-are.html}}</ref> It has initiated litigation in several countries against its former subsidiary [[Merck & Co.]] (MSD) over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the [[High Court of Justice]] in the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom; the judge also held that MSD's use of "Merck" as part of branding on its global websites were directed to the UK and infringed Merck's trade mark rights in the UK.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merckkgaa-name-idUSKCN0UT239 Fight over Merck name sees German firm win in British court], Reuters</ref> In response, MSD has initiated counter-litigation in the United States.<ref name="genengnews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/legal-wrangle-pits-merck-vs-merck/81252246/|title=Legal Wrangle Pits Merck vs. Merck|work=GEN|date=2016-01-15}}</ref>

After that controversies, Merck also adopted a new logo for EMD. The same look was also given to EMD Serono, MilliporeSigma, and EMD Performance Materials logos.

Generics UK (Merck's former British subsidiary, the global Generics business being sold on October 2, 2007) paid a £12M [[out-of-court settlement]] with the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] of the UK over involvement in an alleged [[Price fixing|price and supply fixing]] cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first= Simon| last= Bowers| title=Merck subsidiary pays £12m over price-fixing claims in sales to NHS | date= June 30, 2005| url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,3604,1517712,00.html | work =[[The Guardian]] | access-date = 2007-10-11 | location=London}}</ref>

The [[National Health Service|NHS]] alleges various drugs companies exploited the [[Oligopoly|oligopolistic market]] conditions, forcing the NHS to pay inflated prices. NHS fraud investigators believe there was a [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to limit the supply of 30 of its most commonly prescribed drugs, including a class of [[penicillin]] [[antibiotics]] and to a [[generic drugs|generic]] version of best-selling [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] treatment [[Zantac]].<ref>{{cite news | first= Sam| last= Lister| title=Drug chiefs on price-fixing charges | date= April 6, 2006| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article702469.ece | work =[[The Times]] | access-date = 2007-10-11 | location=London}}</ref> The NHS has so far filed claims in relation to just three drugs, seeking damages of more than £150m, while the [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) is conducting a parallel investigation into the price-fixing allegations limited to the supply of blood-thinning pill [[warfarin]] and [[penicillin]]-based [[antibiotics]]. Homes and offices of [[Senior management|executives]] at six firms, including [[Ranbaxy]], Generics UK, [[Norton Healthcare]], Goldshield and Regent-GM were raided by the SFO in May 2002.

== Healthcare ==
After Wilhelm Adam Sertürner's isolation of [[morphine]] from [[opium]] in 1805, Merck pioneered (from 1827) the commercial manufacture of morphine for an expanding global market. From 1884 onwards, Merck also played role in the production and marketing of [[cocaine]]. [[Sigmund Freud]], author of ''Über Coca'' (1884), was an enthusiastic collaborator in Merck's cocaine research, though the methodological sophistication of his [[self-experimentation]] studies has been challenged.
Attention was directed at [[vitamins]] as a new [[product (business)|product]] category, and [[Vigantol]] was introduced in 1927, followed by Cebion in 1934.

Following the defeat of Germany in [[World War II]], Merck was granted permission by the military government to produce drugs, pesticides, food preservatives, reagents, and fine chemicals for laboratory use. Soon afterward the boom is commonly known as the "[[Wirtschaftswunder]]" (economic miracle) set in. For Merck, this meant two-digit sales-growth figures for many years. Products of this time included [[corticoid]] preparations &mdash; for example [[Dexamethasone|Fortecortin]], which is still used today &mdash; the cold remedy Nasivin or the hormone preparations Gestafortin and Mantova.

Merck currently employs over 2500 people in its 4 R&D hubs via. [[Boston]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Beijing]] and [[Tokyo]].<ref name="merckkgaa,darmstadt,germany">{{cite web|url=http://www.merckgroup.com/en/innovation/innovation_key_facts/innovation_key_facts.html|title=Innovation - R&D overview - EMD Group|author=Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany|date=14 October 2015|work=merckgroup.com}}</ref> In the year 2018, Merck invested over €1,6 billion in its R&D operations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Merck's Annual Report 2019 {{!}} Research and Development|url=https://www.merckgroup.com/en/annualreport/2019/combined-management-report/fundamental-information-about-the-group/research-and-development.html}}</ref>
The focus of Merck's current pharmaceutical R&D is on [[oncology]], neurology and immunology. In oncology, its first marketed product is ''Erbitux'' ([[cetuximab]]), for which it has marketing rights worldwide, apart from North America. (Cetuximab was discovered by [[Imclone Systems]], and is marketed in North America by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]].) Other areas of Expertise from Merck Healthcare include Fertility, Endocrinology and General Medicine, the later focusing on treatments for Diabetes, Thyroid disease and Cardiovascular diseases. Some products from Merck include [[Metformin]], [[Bisoprolol]], [[Levothyroxine]] and [[Digitoxin]]. Merck's [[clinical research]] strategy consists of a partnership with [[Quintiles]] in which the latter helps the former in the clinical development of all its compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/Quintiles-is-the-arms-legs-and-brain-in-Merck-Serono-s-monogamous-relationship|title=Merck Serono discusses its strategic partnership with Quintiles at PCT|work=Outsourcing-Pharma.com}}</ref> In February 2019, Merck also announced a partnership with GSK to develop and commercialize M7824 (bintrafusp alfa*), a new Immunotherapy with potential in various difficult-to-treat cancers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hargreaves|first=Ben|date=5 February 2019|title=GSK indicates oncology intent with €3.7bn Merck deal|work=biopharma-reporter.com|url=https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2019/02/05/GSK-agrees-3.7bn-partnership-deal-with-Merck}}</ref>

== Life science ==

{{Main|Millipore Corporation}}The life science business of Merck, formerly known as Merck Millipore, was created in July 2010 following the completed acquisition of the US company Millipore. This division comprises all Millipore activities and major segments of the former Merck division Performance & Life Science Chemicals. Merck Millipore had three business units: Bioscience, Lab Solutions and Process Solutions. The Bioscience business unit is dedicated to [[solution]]s and reagents for protein research and cell biology, cell culture [[solution]]s, as well as to products and services for the development of biopharmaceutical agents. The scope of activities of Lab Solutions includes laboratory chemicals and other materials for research, science and industry, products and services for sampling, and test kits for the pharmaceutical, foods and diagnostics industries, along with products, consumables and services surrounding highly purified laboratory water for science and industry. Process Solutions focuses on products and services for the production of chemical and biopharmaceutical agents.

In 2015, Merck acquired [[Sigma-Aldrich|SigmaAldrich]] and combined it with Merck Millipore. The company was branded Merck globally and MilliporeSigma in the United States and Canada. The newly established life science business of Merck has 300,000 products and three business units: Research Solutions, Process Solutions and Applied Solutions. The company serves customers in biotech, pharma, diagnostics, food safety, academia, and environmental. Udit Batra serves as the CEO of the life science business of Merck.

The Life Science business sponsors several award programs for graduate students. One of these awards, the Alfred R. Bader Award for Student Innovation recognizes advanced chemistry graduate students, typically in the field of synthetic organic chemistry.

==Performance materials==

===Liquid crystals===

Merck is a pioneer in the field of LCD technology and the world’s largest producer of [[liquid crystal]]s, which are required for the manufacture of LC/TFT displays.  The global market share is over 60%. As a result, the company is considered to be a so-called hidden champion.
In March 2005 Merck acquired Covion Organic Semiconductors GmbH, a part of the Avecia Group. The company, originally a split-off from the Hoechst AG, and headquartered in the Höchst Industrial Park, produces organic light-emitting materials for OLEDs. Now renamed in Merck OLED Materials GmbH, the company is an essential element in the liquid crystal segment. Merck paid 50 million Euros for the acquisition, which included a research and development unit in the polymer electronics sector, and which is located in Manchester.

On April 2, 2007, Merck announced the liquidation of OLED Materials GmbH, with assets to be transferred to Merck KGaA. 100 employees were integrated into the liquid crystal division.
The Liquid Crystals sector also includes materials for photovoltaics and the lighting industry.<ref name="merckpm1">W. Huber: [http://me.merck.de/EMD/UK/uknews2.nsf/d4c60a303233fb87c1256fc500368312/e2f11de1f01060f2c1256fc5003a7eeb?OpenDocument&Click= ''Merck KGaA übernimmt OLED- und Polymerelektronik-Aktivitäten von Avecia.''] Pressemitteilung der Merck KGaA vom 8.
