'''Video game addiction''', also known as  '''gaming disorder''' or '''internet gaming disorder''', is generally defined as the problematic, compulsive use of video games that results in significant impairment to an individual's ability to function in various life domains over a prolonged period of time. This and [[Digital media use and mental health|associated concepts]] have been the subject of considerable research, debate, and discussion among experts in several disciplines and has generated controversy within the medical, scientific, and gaming communities. Such disorders can be diagnosed when an individual engages in gaming activities at the cost of fulfilling daily responsibilities or pursuing other interests without regard for the negative consequences. As defined by the [[ICD-11]], the main the main criterion for this disorder is a '''lack of self control over gaming'''.<ref name="ICD11criteria">{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/27/the-who-may-add-video-games-to-its-list-of-recognized-addictions/|title=The WHO may add video games to its list of recognized addictions|last=Krishna|first=Swapna| name-list-style = vanc |date=27 December 2017|work=[[Engadget]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228003102/https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/27/the-who-may-add-video-games-to-its-list-of-recognized-addictions/|archive-date=28 December 2017|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. Research has approached the question from a variety of viewpoints, with no universally standardized or agreed definitions, leading to difficulties in developing evidence-based recommendations.

Some players become more concerned with their interactions in the game than in their broader lives.

The APA has developed nine criteria for characterising the proposed Internet Gaming Disorder:<ref name="APA"/>

# Pre-occupation. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about games even when you are not playing, or planning when you can play next?
# Withdrawal. Do you feel restless, irritable, moody, angry, anxious or sad when attempting to cut down or stop gaming, or when you are unable to play?
# Tolerance. Do you feel the need to play for increasing amounts of time, play more exciting games, or use more powerful equipment to get the same amount of excitement you used to get?
# Reduce/stop. Do you feel that you should play less, but are unable to cut back on the amount of time you spend playing games?
# Give up other activities. Do you lose interest in or reduce participation in other recreational activities due to gaming?
# Continue despite problems. Do you continue to play games even though you are aware of negative consequences, such as not getting enough sleep, being late to school/work, spending too much money, having arguments with others, or neglecting important duties?
# Deceive/cover up. Do you lie to family, friends or others about how much you game, or try to keep your family or friends from knowing how much you game?
# Escape adverse moods. Do you game to escape from or forget about personal problems, or to relieve uncomfortable feelings such as guilt, anxiety, helplessness or depression?
# Risk/lose relationships/opportunities. Do you risk or lose significant relationships, or job, educational or career opportunities because of gaming?

One of the most commonly used instruments for the measurement of addiction, the PVP Questionnaire ([[Problem Video Game Playing Questionnaire]]), was presented as a quantitative measure, not as a diagnostic tool.<ref name="pvp">{{cite web |url=http://hera.ugr.es/doi/15022742.pdf |first1=Tejeiro |last1=Salguero |first2=Bersabé |last2=Moran | name-list-style = vanc |date=2002 |title=Measuring problem video game playing in adolescents |access-date=31 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301183609/http://hera.ugr.es/doi/15022742.pdf |archive-date=1 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>
According to Griffiths, "all addictions (whether chemical or behavioral) are essentially about constant rewards and reinforcement".<ref name="Griffiths">{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffiths M |year=2010 |title=Online video gaming: what should educational psychologists know? |journal=Educational Psychology in Practice |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=35–40 |doi=10.1080/02667360903522769|s2cid=144184336 }}</ref> He proposes that addiction has six components: salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse.<ref name=Griffiths/> But the APA's nine criteria for diagnosing Internet Gaming Disorder were made by taking point of departure in eight different diagnostic/measuring tools proposed in other studies. Thus, the APA's criteria attempt to condense the scientific work on diagnosing Internet Gaming Disorder.

[[File:Edge (video game) mockup on Sony Ericsson phone.jpg|thumb|70 px|Video game on a keypad mobile]]

=== Video game structure ===
Some theories focus on the presumed built-in reward systems of video games, such as [[compulsion loop]]s, to explain their potentially addictive nature.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=Daniel |last2=Delfabbro |first2=Paul |last3=Griffiths |first3=Mark | name-list-style = vanc |title=The Role of Structural Characteristics in Problem Video Game Playing: A Review |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |date=1 June 2010 |volume=4 |issue=1 |url=https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/4229/3272 |language=en |issn=1802-7962 |type=Review}}</ref> The anticipation of such rewards can create a neurological reaction that releases [[dopamine]] into the body, so that once the reward is obtained, the person will remember it as a pleasurable feeling.<ref name="Sussman2018" /> This has been found to be similar to the neurological reaction of other behavioral addictions such as substance abuse and gambling disorder, although not to the same magnitude and with some differences.<ref name="Sussman2018" />

Mark Griffiths has proposed another reason online video games are potentially addictive is because they "can be played all day every day." The fact there is no end to the game can feel rewarding for some, and hence players are further engaged in the game.<ref name="Griffiths" />

== Outcomes ==

=== Mental health ===
Internet gaming disorder is associated with increased anxiety, social phobia and depression, with adults and young adults being more affected than adolescents.<ref name="Mannikko2017" />

=== Physical health ===
The most frequent physical health-related outcome are alterations in physical functioning such as [[somatisation]] and sleep disturbances.<ref name="Mannikko2017" /> Preliminary evidence suggest that internet gaming disorder and the induced sedentarity may contribute to a lack of physical exercise, even though the relationship is not causal.<ref name="Mannikko2017" />

=== Debates on the classification ===
A meta-analytic review of pathological gaming studies concluded that about 3% of gamers may experience some symptoms of pathological gaming.<ref name="Ferguson 1573–1576" /> The report noted problems in the field with defining and measuring pathological gaming and concluded that pathological gaming behaviors were more likely the product of underlying mental health problems rather than the inverse.<ref name="Ferguson 1573–1576" />

Such issues may lead both society and scholars to exaggerate the prevalence and nature of problematic gaming, and over-focus on games specifically, while ignoring underlying mental health issues.

Other scholars have cautioned that comparing the symptoms of problematic gaming with problematic gambling is flawed, and that such comparisons may introduce research [[confounds and artifacts|artifacts]] and artificially inflate prevalence estimates. For instance, Richard Wood has observed that behaviors which are problematic in regards to gambling may not be as problematic when put into the context of other behaviors that are rewarding such as gaming.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Richard T.

Rather than video gaming disorder being a subtype of gambling disorder, a majority of researchers support the idea of video game addiction being a part of a more comprehensive framework of impulse control disorders with "pathological technology use" with similar characteristics, including the pathological use of video games, [[internet addiction disorder|internet]], [[computer addiction|computers]] and other [[Digital media use and mental health|interactive medias]].<ref name="Sussman2018" /><ref name="Sim2012">{{cite journal |last1=Sim |first1=Timothy |last2=Gentile |first2=Douglas A. |last3=Bricolo |first3=Francesco |last4=Serpelloni |first4=Giovanni |last5=Gulamoydeen |first5=Farah | name-list-style = vanc |title=A Conceptual Review of Research on the Pathological Use of Computers, Video Games, and the Internet |journal=International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction |date=13 January 2012 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=748–769 |doi=10.1007/s11469-011-9369-7 |type=Review |quote=Although there may be other approaches one could take in defining the morphology of pathological computer, video game, or Internet use, this approach of considering pathological use of computer, video game and Internet as a subtype of impulse control disorder has been most widely endorsed by researchers (e.g., Young 1996, 2004; Chou and Hsiao 2000; Beard and Wolf 2001; Gentile 2009; Johansson and Götestam 2004a; Cao et al. 2007).|hdl=10397/6445 |s2cid=6228232 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pluhar E, Kavanaugh JR, Levinson JA, Rich M | title = Problematic interactive media use in teens: comorbidities, assessment, and treatment | journal = Psychology Research and Behavior Management | volume = 12 | pages = 447–455 | date = 2019 | pmid = 31308769 | pmc = 6615461 | doi = 10.2147/PRBM.S208968 }}</ref> Although internet and video game addictions are generally considered different from gambling disorder and substance abuse, there is a growing body of evidence indicating they share common features, including behavioral and neural features.<ref name="Sussman2018" /> Indeed, it is suggested that while behavioral addiction may differ with drug addictions in magnitude, they share several characteristics, with Hellman et al proposing that the concept of addiction should be de-medicalized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hellman |first1=Matilda |last2=Schoenmakers |first2=Tim M. |last3=Nordstrom |first3=Benjamin R. |last4=van Holst |first4=Ruth J. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Is there such a thing as online video game addiction?

Griffiths has suggested that psycho-social dependence may revolve around the intermittent reinforcements in the game and the need to belong.<ref name="Griffiths" /> Hagedorn & Young have suggested that social dependence may arise due to video games occurring online where players interact with others and the relationships "often become more important for gamers than real-life relationships".<ref name="Hagedorn">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hagedorn W, Young T|year=2011|title=Identifying and Intervening with Students Exhibiting Signs of Gaming Addiction and other Addictive Behaviors: Implications for Professional School Counselors.|journal=Professional School Counseling|volume=14|issue=4|pages=250–260|doi=10.5330/PSC.n.2011-14.250|issn=1096-2409}}</ref>

=== Controversy and alternative viewpoints ===
Common challenges involve the reliability of the [[methodology]] and [[Construct validity|validity]] of the results in some studies. Many rely on self-surveys from university students and also lack time frames making it difficult to study the impact, if any, of addiction on a long term scale. Other concerns also address the definition of addiction and how to measure it, questioning whether or not time is a proper unit to determine how addicted someone is to [[Video game culture|gaming]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Rooij AJ, Schoenmakers TM, Vermulst AA, Van den Eijnden RJ, Van de Mheen D | title = Online video game addiction: identification of addicted adolescent gamers | journal = Addiction | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 205–12 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20840209 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03104.x }}</ref> Daria Joanna Kuss and Mark D.

In addition, they caution the deployment of the label "addiction" since it heavily denotes the use of substances or engagement in certain behaviors. Finally, the researcher promotes other researchers to assess the validity and reliability of existing measures instead of developing additional measurement instruments.<ref name=":1" />

Other challenges include the lack of context of the participant's life and the negative portrayal of gaming addicts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Addiction: Comprehensive Addictive Behaviors and Disorders, Volume 1|last=Miller|first=Peter | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|year=2013|isbn=9780123983367 |pages=819–825}}</ref> Some state that gamers sometimes use [[video games]] to either escape from an uncomfortable environment or alleviate their already existing mental issues—both possibly important aspects in determining the [[psychological]] impact of gaming.

A report, prepared by mental health experts at [[Oxford University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Stockholm University]] and the [[University of Sydney]], sponsored by [[The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment]] argues that while there may be potential addiction associated with video gaming, it is premature to consider it a disorder without further study, given the stigmatisation that surrounds video, and ask the WHO to use caution when finalising the ICD draft.
