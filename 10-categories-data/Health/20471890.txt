A subgroup, the ''fluorosurfactants'' or ''fluorinated surfactants'', have a fluorinated “tail” and a [[hydrophilic]] “head” and are thus [[surfactants]]. They are more effective at reducing the [[surface tension]] of water than comparable [[hydrocarbon]] surfactants. They include the [[perfluorosulfonic acids]] such as the [[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]] (PFOS) and the [[perfluorocarboxylic acid]]s such as the [[perfluorooctanoic acid]] (PFOA). PFOS and PFOA are [[persistent organic pollutant]]s and are detected in humans and wildlife.<ref name="Houde_200606">{{cite journal | vauthors = Houde M, Martin JW, Letcher RJ, Solomon KR, Muir DC | title = Biological monitoring of polyfluoroalkyl substances: A review | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 40 | issue = 11 | pages = 3463–73 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16786681 | doi = 10.1021/es052580b | bibcode = 2006EnST...40.3463H }} [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/es052580b/suppl_file/es052580bsi20060303_021408.pdf Supporting Information] (PDF).</ref>

Therefore, the attractive interactions resulting from the "fleeting dipoles" are reduced, in comparison to hydrocarbon surfactants. Fluorosurfactants are more stable and fit for harsh conditions than hydrocarbon surfactants because of the stability of the [[carbon–fluorine bond]]. Likewise, perfluorinated surfactants persist in the environment for that reason.<ref name="Houde_200606"/>

==Economic role==
PFASs play a key economic role for companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], and [[W. L. Gore & Associates]] because they are used in [[emulsion polymerization]] to produce [[fluoropolymer]]s. They have two main markets: a $1 billion annual market for use in stain repellents, and a $100 million annual market for use in polishes, paints, and coatings.<ref name=long>{{cite journal | vauthors = Renner R | title = The long and the short of perfluorinated replacements | journal = Environmental Science & Technology | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–3 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16433328 | doi = 10.1021/es062612a | bibcode = 2006EnST...40...12R }}</ref>

=== Proposed mechanisms of PFAS-related adverse health outcomes ===

==== Hypercholesterolemia ====
Animal studies in the 1990s and early 2000s primarily aimed to investigate the effect of two widely used long-chain PFASs, perfluorooctane acid (PFOA, C8) and perfluorooctane sulphonic acid (PFOS, C8), on peroxisome proliferation in rat livers.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hosokawa M, Satoh T | title = Differences in the induction of carboxylesterase isozymes in rat liver microsomes by perfluorinated fatty acids | journal = Xenobiotica; The Fate of Foreign Compounds in Biological Systems | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1125–33 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8259694 | doi = 10.3109/00498259309059427 }}</ref> These studies determined that PFOA and PFOS acted as [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor|peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)]] agonists, increasing lipid metabolism.<ref name=":4" /> A paradoxical response is observed in humans where elevated PFOS levels were significantly associated with elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, highlighting significantly reduced PPAR expression and alluding to PPAR independent pathways predominating over [[lipid metabolism]] in humans compared to rodents.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeWitt JC, Shnyra A, Badr MZ, Loveless SE, Hoban D, Frame SR, Cunard R, Anderson SE, Meade BJ, Peden-Adams MM, Luebke RW, Luster MI | display-authors = 6 | title = Immunotoxicity of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha | journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–94 | date = 8 January 2009 | pmid = 18802816 | doi = 10.1080/10408440802209804 }}</ref>

==== Ulcerative colitis ====
PFOA and PFOS have been shown to significantly alter immune and inflammatory responses in human and animal species. In particular, [[Immunoglobulin A|IgA]], [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] (in females only) and [[C-reactive protein]] have been shown to decrease whereas [[Anti-nuclear antibody|antinuclear antibodies]] increase as PFOA serum concentrations increase.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = DeWitt JC, Peden-Adams MM, Keller JM, Germolec DR | title = Immunotoxicity of perfluorinated compounds: recent developments | journal = Toxicologic Pathology | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 300–11 | date = 22 November 2011 | pmid = 22109712 | doi = 10.1177/0192623311428473 }}</ref> These cytokine variations allude to immune response aberrations resulting in [[Autoimmunity Reviews|autoimmunity]]. One proposed mechanism is a shift towards anti-inflammatory [[Macrophage|M2 macrophages]] and/or [[T helper cell|T-helper]] (TH2) response in intestinal [[Epithelium|epithelial tissue]] which allows [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms|sulfate-reducing bacteria]] to flourish. Elevated levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]] result which reduce [[Beta oxidation|beta-oxidation]] and thus nutrient production leading to a breakdown of the colonic epithelial barrier.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Steenland K, Zhao L, Winquist A, Parks C | title = Ulcerative colitis and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in a highly exposed population of community residents and workers in the mid-Ohio valley | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 121 | issue = 8 | pages = 900–5 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23735465 | pmc = 3734500 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.1206449 }}</ref>

==== Thyroid disease ====
[[Hypothyroidism]] is the most common thyroid abnormality associated with PFAS exposure.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JE, Choi K | title = Perfluoroalkyl substances exposure and thyroid hormones in humans: epidemiological observations and implications | journal = Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28443254 | pmc = 5401824 | doi = 10.6065/apem.2017.22.1.6 }}</ref> PFASs have been shown to decrease [[thyroid peroxidase]], resulting in decreased production and activation of [[thyroid hormones]] in vivo.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Song M, Kim YJ, Park YK, Ryu JC | title = Changes in thyroid peroxidase activity in response to various chemicals | journal = Journal of Environmental Monitoring | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 2121–6 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22699773 | doi = 10.1039/c2em30106g }}</ref> Other proposed mechanisms include alterations in thyroid hormone signaling, metabolism and excretion as well as function of nuclear hormone receptor.<ref name=":5" />

==== Cancer ====
Rat studies investigating the carcinogenicity of PFASs reported significant correlation with [[Hepatocellular adenoma|liver adenomas]], [[Leydig cell tumour|Leydig cell tumors]] of the testis and [[Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas|pancreatic acinar cell tumors]] and dietary PFOA consumption.<ref name=":6" /> Naturally, The C8 Science Panel investigated the potential relationship between PFAS exposure and these three cancer types as well as 18 other cancer types in their epidemiological studies. Contrary to the animal studies, the C8 studies did not find a probable link between elevated C8 exposure and liver adenomas or pancreatic acinar cell tumors; however, a probable link was found with regards to testis and kidney cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barry V, Winquist A, Steenland K | title = Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures and incident cancers among adults living near a chemical plant | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 121 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 1313–8 | date = 2013 | pmid = 24007715 | pmc = 3855514 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.1306615 }}</ref> Two mechanisms have been proposed linking PFOA to Leydig cell tumors. Both mechanisms start by proposing that PROA exposure results in increased [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|PPAR alpha]] activation in the liver which increases [[Aromatase|hepatic aromatase]] concentration and subsequent serum [[estrogen]] levels. The mechanisms now diverge, with one pathway suggesting elevated estradiol levels increase [[TGF alpha|Tissue Growth Factor alpha (TGF alpha)]] which prompts Leydig cell proliferation. The other pathway suggests that aromatization of [[testosterone]] to [[estradiol]] reduces serum testosterone levels resulting in increased release of [[Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor|luteinizing hormone (LH)]] from the [[pituitary gland]] which directly results in Leydig Cell tumorgenesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Klaunig JE, Hocevar BA, Kamendulis LM | title = Mode of Action analysis of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) tumorigenicity and Human Relevance | journal = Reproductive Toxicology | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–418 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22120428 | doi = 10.1016/j.reprotox.2011.10.014 }}</ref> A mechanism has not yet been proposed to explain the link between [[kidney cancer]] and C8 exposure as no in vivo animal studies have been able to model this epidemiological outcome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li K, Gao P, Xiang P, Zhang X, Cui X, Ma LQ | title = Molecular mechanisms of PFOA-induced toxicity in animals and humans: Implications for health risks | journal = Environment International | volume = 99 | pages = 43–54 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27871799 | doi = 10.1016/j.envint.2016.11.014 }}</ref>

==== Pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia ====
[[Gestational hypertension|Pregnancy-induced hypertension]] is diagnosed when maternal [[Blood pressure|systolic blood pressure (SBP)]] exceeds 140mmHg or [[Blood pressure|diastolic blood pressure (DBP)]] exceeds 90mmHg after 20 weeks [[gestation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tonks|first=D. L.|date=September 1994|title=Percolation wave propagation, and void link-up effects in ductile fracture|journal=Le Journal de Physique IV|volume=04|issue=C8|pages=C8–665-C8-670|doi=10.1051/jp4:19948101|bibcode=1994STIN...9511209T|issn=1155-4339|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1275549/}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria is the same for [[pre-eclampsia]] as pregnancy-induced hypertension; however, it also confers [[proteinuria]]. Mechanisms linking pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia to PFAS exposure have remained elusive and are largely speculative to date. One proposed mechanism highlights alterations in immune function leading to disruption of [[placentation]], specifically as it pertains to [[Natural killer cell|natural killer (NK) cell]] infiltration of the placenta to facilitate [[Trophoblast|trophoblastic integration]] with placental blood supply.<ref name=":7">{{cite journal|last=Starling|first=A.P.|date=2013|title=Perflourylalkyl substances in pregnancy and the risk of preeclampsia|journal=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|pages=1–215|doi=10.17615/qhqh-4265}}</ref> Another mechanism refers to agonism of PPARs contributing to alterations in [[cholesterol]], [[triglyceride]] and [[uric acid]] levels which may lead to vascular inflammation and elevated blood pressure.<ref name=":7" />

Other adverse health outcomes that have been attributed to elevated PFAS exposure but were not found to be probable links in the C8 studies are decreased antibody response to vaccines, [[asthma]], decreased [[mammary gland]] development, low birth weight (-0.7oz per 1&nbsp;ng/mL increase in blood PFOA or PFOS level), decreased [[Bone density|bone mineral density]] and [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental]] abnormalities.<ref name="CQ Press">{{Citation|chapter=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9780872897762|doi=10.4135/9781452240121.n18|title=Health Care Policy and Politics a to Z|year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Y, Liu G, Rood J, Liang L, Bray GA, de Jonge L, Coull B, Furtado JD, Qi L, Grandjean P, Sun Q | display-authors = 6 | title = Perfluoroalkyl substances and changes in bone mineral density: A prospective analysis in the POUNDS-LOST study | journal = Environmental Research | volume = 179 | issue = Pt A | pages = 108775 | date = December 2019 | pmid = 31593837 | pmc = 6905427 | doi = 10.1016/j.envres.2019.108775 | bibcode = 2019ER....179j8775H }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Donauer S, Chen A, Xu Y, Calafat AM, Sjodin A, Yolton K | title = Prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals and infant neurobehavior | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 166 | issue = 3 | pages = 736–42 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25524317 | pmc = 4344877 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.11.021 }}</ref>

The total annual health-related costs associated with human exposure to PFASs was found to be at least €52-€84 billion in the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries.<ref name=":0">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1295959/FULLTEXT01.pdf</ref> Aggregated annual costs covering environmental screening, monitoring where contamination is found, water treatment, soil remediation and health assessment are totalling to €821 million-€170 billion in the EEA plus Switzerland.<ref name=":0" />

==== Canada ====
Although PFAS are not manufactured in Canada, they may be present in imported goods and products. In 2008, Canada prohibited the import, sale, or use of PFOS or PFOS-containing products, with some exceptions for products used in firefighting, in the military, and in some forms of ink and photo media.<ref name="nceh">{{cite web |last1=O'Keeffe |first1=Juliette |title=Keeping Drinking Water Safe: New Guidelines for PFAS in Canada |url=https://ncceh.ca/content/blog/keeping-drinking-water-safe-new-guidelines-pfas-canada |website=National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health |publisher=National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health |access-date=22 July 2020}}</ref>

Health Canada has published drinking water guidelines for maximum concentrations of PFOS and PFOA. The guidelines were established to protect the health of Canadians, including children, over a lifetime's exposure to these substances. The maximum allowable concentration for PFOS under the guidelines is 0.0002 milligrams per litre. The maximum allowable concentration for PFOA is 0.0006 milligrams per litre.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perfluoroalkylated substances in drinking water |website=canada.ca |publisher=Government of Canada |access-date=22 July 2020 |date=April 2019 | url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/publications/healthy-living/water-talk-drinking-water-screening-values-perfluoroalkylated-substances.html}}</ref>

===== Michigan =====
Launched in 2017, the [[Michigan]] PFAS Action Response Team (MPART) is the first multi-agency action team of its kind in the nation. Agencies representing health, environment and other branches of state government have joined together to investigate sources and locations of PFAS contamination in the state, take action to protect people's drinking water, and keep the public informed.<ref name = "FAS_Response">{{cite web|url=https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/|title=PFAS Response - PFAS Response|website=www.michigan.gov|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>

Groundwater is tested at locations throughout the state by various parties to ensure safety, compliance with regulations, and to proactively detect and remedy potential problems. In 2010, the [[Michigan Department of Environmental Quality]] (MDEQ) discovered levels of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in groundwater monitoring wells at the former [[Wurtsmith Air Force Base]]. As additional information became available from other national testing, Michigan expanded its investigations into other locations where PFAS compounds were potentially used.<ref name = "FAS_Response" />

In 2018, the MDEQ's Remediation and Redevelopment Division (RRD) established cleanup criteria for groundwater used as drinking water of 70 ppt of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), individually or combined. The RRD staff are responsible for implementing these criteria as part of their ongoing efforts to clean-up sites of environmental contamination. The RRD staff are the lead investigators at most of the PFAS sites on the MPART website and also conduct interim response activities, such as coordinating bottled water or filter installations with local health departments at sites under investigation or with known PFAS concerns. Most of the groundwater sampling at PFAS sites under RRD's lead is conducted by contractors familiar with PFAS sampling techniques. The RRD also has a Geologic Services Unit, with staff who install monitoring wells and are also well versed with PFAS sampling techniques.<ref name = "FAS_Response" />

The MDEQ has been conducting environmental clean-up of regulated contaminants for decades. Due to the evolving nature of PFAS regulations as new science becomes available, the RRD is evaluating the need for regular PFAS sampling at [[Superfund]] sites and is including an evaluation of PFAS sampling needs as part of a Baseline Environmental Assessment review.<ref name = "FAS_Response" />

Earlier this year, the RRD purchased lab equipment that will allow the MDEQ Environmental Lab to conduct analyses of certain PFAS samples. (Currently, most samples are shipped to one of the few labs in the country that conduct PFAS analysis, in California, although private labs in other parts of the country, including Michigan, are starting to offer these services.) As of August 2018, RRD has hired additional staff to work on developing the methodology and conducting PFAS analyses.<ref name = "FAS_Response" />

===Class action lawsuits===
In October 2018, a [[class action suit]] was filed by an Ohio firefighter against several producers of fluorosurfactants, including the [[3M]] and [[DuPont]] corporations, on behalf of all US residents who may have adverse health effects from exposure to PFAS chemicals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nationwide class action lawsuit targets Dupont, Chemours, 3M, and other makers of PFAS chemicals |author=Sharon Lerner |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/10/06/dupont-pfas-chemicals-lawsuit/ |website=[[The Intercept]] |date=October 6, 2018 |access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref> Five New Jersey companies were declared to be financially responsible for statewide remediation of the chemicals in a directive from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in March 2019.<ref name="NewJersey_Warren_20190513"/>

===Corporate and Federal Government suppression of information===
Starting in the 1970s, 3M scientists learned that [[PFOS]] and [[PFOA]], two types of PFAS, are toxic to humans, documenting damage to the human [[immune system]]. Also in the 1970s, 3M scientists found that these substances accumulate over time in the human body. However, 3M suppressed revelation of these facts to the public or to regulators. Many years later, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] pressured the U.S. [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] to suppress a study that showed PFAS to be even more dangerous than previously thought.<ref>The Intercept, 31 Jul. 2018, [https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/ "3M Knew about The Dangers of PFOA and PFOS Decades Ago, Internal Documents Show"] </ref> <ref>[[Union of Concerned Scientists]], 16 May 2018, [https://blog.ucsusa.org/michael-halpern/bipartisan-outrage-as-epa-white-house-try-to-cover-up-chemical-health-assessment "Bipartisan Outrage as EPA, White House Try to Cover Up Chemical Health Assessment"] </ref> <ref>Politico, 14 May 2018, [https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/14/emails-white-house-interfered-with-science-study-536950 "White House, EPA Headed Off Chemical Pollution Study"] </ref>

===Water contamination by U.S. military bases===
The water in and around at least 126 U.S. military bases has been contaminated by high levels of PFAS, according to a study by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]. Of these, 90 bases reported PFAS contamination that had spread to drinking water or ground water off the base. The chemical is correlated with cancer and birth defects.<ref>Military Times, 26 Apr. 2018 [https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/04/26/dod-126-bases-report-water-contaminants-harmful-to-infant-development-tied-to-cancers/ "DoD: At Least 126 Bases Report Water Contaminants Linked to Cancer, Birth Defects"] </ref>

== Occupational exposure ==
Occupational exposure to PFAS occurs in numerous industries due to the widespread use of PFAS in products and as an element of industrial process streams.<ref name=":12" /> PFAS are used in more than 200 different ways in industries as diverse as electronics and equipment manufacturing, plastic and rubber production, food and textile production, and building and construction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Glüge J, Scheringer M, Cousins IT, DeWitt JC, Goldenman G, Herzke D, Lohmann R, Ng CA, Trier X, Wang Z | display-authors = 6 | title = An overview of the uses of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) | journal = Environmental Science.

Among these exemptions are numerous uses in manufacturing as well as firefighting foams. 

=== Professional ski wax technicians ===
Professional ski wax technicians are disproportionately exposed to PFAS from the [[Ski wax#Glide wax|glide wax]] used to coat the bottom of skis to reduce the friction between the skis and snow. During this process, the wax is heated to 130-220&nbsp;°C, which releases fumes and airborne fluorinated compounds. Exposure to aerosolized PFAS is associated with alveolic edema, polymer fume fever, severe dyspnea, decreased pulmonary function, and respiratory distress syndrome in those chronically exposed.<ref name=":8" /> In a 2010 study, blood serum levels of PFOA were significantly higher in ski wax technicians compared to levels of the general Swedish population. Serum levels of PFOA in ski wax technicians was positively correlated with years spent working, suggesting bioaccumulation of PFOA over time.<ref name=":8" />

=== Manufacturing workers ===
People who work at fluorochemical production plants and in manufacturing industries that use PFAS in the industrial process can be exposed to PFAS in the workplace. Much of what we know about PFAS exposure and health effects began with medical surveillance studies of workers exposed to PFAS at fluorochemical production facilities. These studies began in the 1940s and were conducted primarily at U.S. and European manufacturing sites. Between the 1940s and 2000s, thousands of workers exposed to PFAS participated in research studies that advanced scientific understanding of exposure pathways, [[Toxicokinetics|toxicokinetic]] properties, and adverse health effects associated with PFAS exposure.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":14">{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa G, Sartori S, Consonni D | title = Thirty years of medical

=== Firefighters ===
PFAS chemicals are commonly used in Class B [[firefighting foam]]s due to their hydrophobic and lipophobic properties as well as the stability of the chemicals when exposed to high heat.<ref name=":10">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laitinen JA, Koponen J, Koikkalainen J, Kiviranta H | title = Firefighters' exposure to perfluoroalkyl acids and 2-butoxyethanol present in firefighting foams | journal = Toxicology Letters | volume = 231 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–32 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25447453 | doi = 10.1016/j.toxlet.2014.09.007 }}</ref> Due to firefighters’ potential for exposure to PFAS chemicals through these [https://www.nrl.navy.mil/accomplishments/materials/aqueous-film-foam aqueous film forming foams (AFFF)], studies raise concerns that there are high levels of bioaccumulation of PFAS chemicals in firefighters who work and train with these substances.

Research into occupational exposure for firefighters is emergent, though frequently limited by underpowered study designs.

=== Exposure after World Trade Center terrorist attacks ===
The September 11, 2001 collapse of the World Trade Center buildings in New York City resulted in the release of chemicals from the destruction of construction and electrical material and long-term chemical fires.

== Remediation solutions ==
=== Liquids treatment ===
Several technologies are currently available for remediating PFAS in liquids. These technologies can be applied to drinking water supplies, groundwater, industrial wastewater, surface water, and other miscellaneous applications (such as landfill leachate). Influent concentrations of PFAS can vary by orders of magnitude for specific media or applications. These influent values, along with other general water quality parameters (for example, pH) can influence the performance and operating costs for the treatment technologies.<ref name = "pfas">{{cite web | title = Remediation Technologies and Methods for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) |url=https://pfas-1.itrcweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/pfas_fact_sheet_remediation_3_15_18.pdf| publisher = Interstate Technology & Regulatory Council (ITRC) |access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>

==== Theoretical and early stage solutions ====
The [[Michigan State University|MSU]]-Fraunhofer team has a viable solution to treat PFAS-contaminated wastewater that's ready for a pilot-scale investigation. The electrochemical oxidation system uses boron-doped diamond electrodes. The process breaks down the contaminants’ formidable molecular bonds, cleaning the water while systematically destroying the hazardous compounds.<ref name = "msutoday">{{cite web|url=http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2018/diamond-technology-cleans-up-pfas-contaminated-wastewater/|title=Diamond technology cleans up PFAS-contaminated wastewater  | website = MSUToday|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref>

<blockquote>"EO, or electrochemical oxidation, is a simple, clean and effective method for destruction of PFAS and other co-contaminants as a complementary procedure to other wastewater treatment processes," said Cory Rusinek, electrochemist at MSU-Fraunhofer. "If we can remove it from wastewater, we can reduce its occurrence in surface waters."<ref name = "msutoday" /></blockquote>

In September 2019 it was reported ''Acidimicrobium sp.'' strain A6 may be a potential remediator.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earther.gizmodo.com/a-new-jersey-soil-bacteria-is-first-to-break-down-toxic-1838215840 |title=A New Jersey Soil Bacteria Is First to Break Down Toxic 'Forever Chemical' |author=Ryan F.
