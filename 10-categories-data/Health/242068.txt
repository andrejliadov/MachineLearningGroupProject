Bulldogs have a longstanding association with [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], as the [[BBC]] wrote: "to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination."<ref name="Icon">{{cite news|title=English Bulldog health problems prompt cross-breeding call|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36916431|publisher=BBC|date=12 December 2016}}</ref> During World War II, Bulldogs were often likened to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and his defiance of [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name="National symbol"/> Dedicated Bulldog fanciers formed the Bulldog Club (England) in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America in 1890.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Female English Bulldog.jpg|thumb|Example of a 4-year-old Bulldog of Champion bloodlines, side view. Note the "rope" over the nose, and pronounced underbite.]]

Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular [[prognathism]]. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, [[brindle]], and [[piebald]].<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" /> 

In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are {{convert|55|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for a male and {{convert|50|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} for a female.<ref name="KC breed standard">{{cite web|title=Bulldog breed standard|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/services/public/breed/standard.aspx?id=4084|publisher=The Kennel Club|access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref> In the United States, a typical mature male weighs {{convert|50|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}, while mature females weigh about {{convert|40|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" /> The Bulldog Club of America recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be {{convert|40|-|50|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight, screwed or thin and thus is not cut or [[Docking (dog)|docked]] as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upwards.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

== Temperament ==
[[File:Clyde The Bulldog.jpg|thumb|left|Six-month-old Bulldog puppy from [[American Kennel Club|AKC]] Champion bloodlines]]
According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be "equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior".<ref name="AKC Bulldog Page">[http://www.akc.org/breeds/bulldog/ American Kennel Club – Bulldog]. Akc.org.

[[File:Philip Reinagle - Bulldog.jpg|thumb|Painting of a Bulldog from 1790 by English artist [[Philip Reinagle]].]]

The first reference to the word "Bulldog" is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: "procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp".<ref>{{cite book|author=Jesse, George R. |title=Researches into the history of the British Dog, from ancient laws, charters, and historical records: With original anecdotes, and illustrations of the nature and attributes of the dog, from the poets and prose writers of ancient, mediaeval, and modern times. With engravings designed and etched by the author|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7oo-AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA306|year=1866|publisher=Rob. Hardwicke|page=306}}</ref> 
In 1666, English scientist [[Christopher Merret]] applied: "Canis pugnax, ''a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog''", as an entry in his ''[[Christopher Merret#Bibliography|Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Merret|first1=Christopher|title=Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum, continens Vegetabilia, Animalia, et Fossilia|date=1666|page=169|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JC-IpBPhsoC&q=canis+pugnax&pg=PA169}}</ref>

The designation "bull" was applied because of the dog's use in the sport of [[bull-baiting]]. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling over them. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed, as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Curnutt |first1=Jordan |title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook |date=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=284|isbn=9781576071472 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC}}</ref> This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as "cattle") [[snake]]s, [[dog]]s, [[owl]]s, and [[donkey]]s, so that bull- and [[bear-baiting]], as well as [[cockfighting]], became prohibited. Therefore, the [[Old English Bulldog]] had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or "working" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor [[Richard Nicolls]]. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.<ref>Ellis, Edward Robb (2005). The Epic of New York City – A Narrative History. Basic Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-7867-1436-0}}</ref> Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer [[Bill George (dog dealer)|Bill George]].<ref>Oliff, D. B.

Despite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by two and a half years, Bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At five to six years of age, they start to show signs of aging.

Though today Bulldogs look tough, they cannot perform the job they were originally created for, as they cannot withstand the rigors of running after and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle.  Although not as physically capable as their ancestors, decreased levels of aggression associated with modern Bulldogs have resulted in a far calmer temperament.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

The oldest single breed specialty club is The Bulldog Club (England), which was formed in 1878. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk {{convert|20|mi|km}}. King Orry was reminiscent of the original Bulldogs, lighter boned and very athletic. Dockleaf was smaller and heavier set, more like modern Bulldogs. King Orry was declared the winner that year, finishing the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} walk while Dockleaf collapsed.<ref>The sun., 11 September 1894, [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1894-09-11/ed-1/seq-4/;words=orry+Dock+Orry+Leaf Page 4, Image 4]</ref> The Bulldog was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886.<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" />

At the turn of the 20th century, [[Championship (dog)#The conformation championship title|Ch.]] Rodney Stone became the first Bulldog to command a price of $5,000 when he was bought by controversial Irish American political figure [[Richard Croker]].{{cn|date=September 2020}}

Some individuals of this breed are prone to interdigital cysts—cysts that form between the toes. These cause the dog some discomfort, but are treatable either by vet or an experienced owner. They may also suffer from respiratory problems. Other problems can include [[cherry eye]], a protrusion of the inner eyelid (which can be corrected by a veterinarian), [[Allergy|allergies]], and [[hip]] issues in older Bulldogs.

The folds, or "rope", on a Bulldog's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation. Some Bulldogs' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment. Due to the high volume of skin folds on the Bulldog's body, they have high prevalence of skin-fold dermatitis.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2009.08.033|pmid=19836981|title=Inherited defects in pedigree dogs.

Like all dogs, Bulldogs require daily [[exercise]]. If not properly exercised it is possible for a Bulldog to become overweight, which could lead to heart and lung problems, as well as stress on the joints.<ref>Denizet-Lewis, Benoit (22 November 2011) [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/magazine/can-the-bulldog-be-saved.html Can the Bulldog be Saved?] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref>

Like all [[Cephalic_index#List_of_brachycephalic_dogs|brachycephalic]] dogs, bully breeds often suffer from [[brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome]]. The condition manifests in a variety of ways, often in the form of intolerance to heat and physical exertion. The English bulldog is among the breeds that are most severely affected by brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome.<ref name=UFAW>{{cite web |url=https://www.ufaw.org.uk/dogs/english-bulldog-brachycephalic-airway-obstruction-syndrome-baos|title=Brachycephalic Airway Obstruction Syndrome and the English Bulldog|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2011 |website=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare |publisher=The International Animal Welfare Science Society |access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref> Bulldogs have very small nasal cavities and this makes them have great difficulty keeping their bodies cool. Bulldogs are very sensitive to heat. Extra caution should be practiced in warmer climates and during summer months. Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat.<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" /> Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe. Bulldogs actually do most of their sweating through the pads on their feet and accordingly enjoy cool floors. Like all [[brachycephalic]], or "short faced", breeds, Bulldogs can easily become overheated and even die from [[hyperthermia]].<ref name="Get to Know the Bulldog" /> Bulldog owners can keep these issues under control by staying aware and protecting their Bulldog(s) from these unsafe conditions. They can be heavy breathers and tend to be loud snorers; another indicator of brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. In 2014 the [[Dutch Kennel Club]] implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1&nbsp;km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes. Its temperature and heart rate has to recover after 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convenant Bulldog, breeding rules|url=http://www.raadvanbeheer.nl/uploads/media/Convenant_Bulldog-breeding_rules.pdf|publisher=Raad van Beheer (Dutch Kennel Club)|access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref>

In January 2009, after the BBC documentary ''[[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]'', [[The Kennel Club]] introduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, in order to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders.<ref name="Time14Jan09Bulldog">{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5512620.ece | title = Healthier new Bulldog will lose its Churchillian jowl|author=Elliott, Valerie  | work = The Times | date = 14 January 2009 | access-date = 14 January 2009 | location = London}}</ref>

Based on a study done by Sari Helena Mölsä, Heli Katariina Hyytiäinen, Kaj Mikael Morelius, Maria Katariina Palmu, Tommi Sakari Pesonen, and Anu Katriina Lappalainen, they found that "The English bulldogs carried a mean of 67.3% and 62.1% of their body weight in front limbs while standing and trotting, respectively"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mölsä|first=Sari Helena|last2=Hyytiäinen|first2=Heli Katariina|last3=Morelius|first3=Kaj Mikael|last4=Palmu|first4=Maria Katariina|last5=Pesonen|first5=Tommi Sakari|last6=Lappalainen|first6=Anu Katriina|date=2020-05-12|title=Radiographic findings have an association with weight bearing and locomotion in English bulldogs|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-020-00517-3|journal=Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica|volume=62|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1186/s13028-020-00517-3|issn=1751-0147|pmc=7218547|pmid=32398017}}</ref> They also found that, "Front and hind limb lameness was seen in 20.8% (5/24) and 12.5% (3/24) of dogs, respectively" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mölsä|first=Sari Helena|last2=Hyytiäinen|first2=Heli Katariina|last3=Morelius|first3=Kaj Mikael|last4=Palmu|first4=Maria Katariina|last5=Pesonen|first5=Tommi Sakari|last6=Lappalainen|first6=Anu Katriina|date=2020-05-12|title=Radiographic findings have an association with weight bearing and locomotion in English bulldogs|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-020-00517-3|journal=Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica|volume=62|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1186/s13028-020-00517-3|issn=1751-0147|pmc=7218547|pmid=32398017}}</ref> English bulldogs show more weight distribution in the front limbs of their bodies. This study shows that English bulldogs are prone to having abnormalities with their radiographic findings and many orthopaedic diseases. These studies also found that there are many hip dysplasia being seen within a large number of the English bulldog breed. They also found that English bulldogs have low range of motion because of the way their musculoskeletal function is. 

In 2019, the [[Dutch government]] forbade breeding of Bulldogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vettimes.co.uk/news/dutch-to-crack-down-on-breeding-of-dogs-with-too-short-snouts/ |title=Dutch to crack down on breeding of dogs with too short snouts {{!}} Vet Times|work=vettimes.co.uk |access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref>
