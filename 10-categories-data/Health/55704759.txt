The '''Total Recordable Incident Rate''' is a US measure of [[occupational safety and health]], useful for comparing working conditions in workplaces and industries. It is calculated by combining the actual number of safety incidents and total work hours of all employees with a standard employee group (100 employees working 40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year).<ref>"[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/osh.pdf Employer-reported Workplace Injuries And Illnesses â€“ 2015]" October 27, 2016.
