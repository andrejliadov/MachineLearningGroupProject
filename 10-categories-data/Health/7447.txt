Laws restricting, regulating, or banning [[circumcision]], some dating back to ancient times, have been enacted in many countries and communities. In modern states, circumcision is generally presumed to be legal, but laws pertaining to assault or child custody have been applied in cases involving circumcision. There are currently no states that unequivocally ban infant male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons. In the case of non-therapeutic circumcision of children, proponents of laws in favor of the procedure often point to the rights of the parents or practitioners, namely the right of [[freedom of religion]]. Those against the procedure point to the boy's right of [[Freedom of religion#Secular law|freedom ''from'' religion]]. In several court cases, judges have pointed to the irreversible nature of the act,<ref name="bbc.co.uk">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18604664 German court rules circumcision is 'bodily harm', BBC News Europe.] Retrieved 13 July 2012</ref> the grievous harm to the boy's body,<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9358636/Jewish-groups-condemn-courts-definition-of-circumcision-as-grievous-bodily-harm.html |title=Jewish groups condemn court's definition of circumcision as grievous bodily harm |date=27 June 2012 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref> and the right to self-determination, and bodily integrity.<ref name = "Reut06">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-life-circumcision/judge-rules-9-year-old-need-not-get-circumcised-idUSN2425381320061025 |title=US judge rules 9-year-old need not get circumcised |date=19 January 2007 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=10 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200911004911/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-life-circumcision/judge-rules-9-year-old-need-not-get-circumcised-idUSN2425381320061025 |archive-date=10 September 2020 |url-status=live |quote=In a decision cheered by foes of routine circumcision for boys, a judge ruled on Tuesday that a 9-year-old need not be circumcised as his mother wanted....In granting the boy's father an injunction blocking the procedure, the judge said the boy could decide for himself whether to be circumcised when he turns 18. }}</ref>

There are ancient religious requirements for [[circumcision]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] commands [[Jew]]s to circumcise their male children on the eighth day of life, and to circumcise their male [[slavery|slaves]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:11–12|HE}}).

Laws banning circumcision are also ancient. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] prized the foreskin and disapproved of the Jewish custom of circumcision.<ref name=Hodges2001>{{cite journal |last=Hodges |first=Frederick M. |year=2001 |title=The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=75 |issue= 3|pages=375–405 |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/ |doi=10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 |pmid=11568485 |s2cid=29580193 |accessdate=22 January 2008}}</ref> [[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61 states that [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|King Antiochus IV]] of [[Syria]], the occupying power of [[Judea]] in 170 BCE, outlawed circumcision on penalty of death,<ref>[[1 Maccabees]], 1:60–61</ref> one of the grievances leading to the [[Maccabean Revolt]].<ref name = "Miller">{{cite journal

| quote       = Ritual circumcision of boys is a durable tradition. Jews of ancient times refused to abandon the practice despite enormous pressure to do so. In 167 BCE the Seleucid emperor Antiochus IV, as part of a campaign to Hellenise the Jews, condemned to death every Hebrew who allowed a son to be circumcised. The Jews responded with the Maccabean revolt, a campaign of guerrilla warfare that resulted in major victories for the rebels and, eventually, a peace treaty that restored Jewish ritual prerogatives.

According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', the [[Roman empire|Roman]] emperor [[Hadrian]] issued a decree banning circumcision in the empire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/|title=The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome}}</ref> and some modern scholars argue that this was a main cause of the Jewish [[Bar Kokhba's revolt|Bar Kokhba]] revolt of 132 CE.<ref>See, e.g., Alfredo M. Rabello, The Ban on Circumcision as a Cause of Bar Kokhba's Rebellion, 29 ISRAEL L. REV. 176 (1995) (Arguing that the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule was primarily motivated by the superimposition of foreign religious standards, rather than by some important notion of independence or sovereignty).</ref> The Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]], however, made no mention of such a law, and blamed the Jewish uprising instead on Hadrian's decision to rebuild [[Jerusalem]] as [[Aelia Capitolina]], a city dedicated to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].

[[Antoninus Pius]] permitted Jews to circumcise their own sons. However, he forbade the circumcision of non-Jews that were either foreign-slaves or non-Jewish members of the household, contrary to {{bibleverse||Genesis|17:12|HE}} He also made it illegal for a man to convert to Judaism.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2004/2004-03-29.html|title=Review of: Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud|first=Matthew|last=Kraus|date=29 March 2004|journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review}}</ref> Antoninus Pius exempted the Egyptian priesthood from the otherwise universal ban on circumcision.

=== Soviet Union ===
Before [[glasnost]], according to an article in [[The Jewish Press]], Jewish ritual circumcision was forbidden in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Barbara Oka, [http://www.russianjewry.org/about/media/jp9.php "Soviet Jews Of All Ages Seek Circumcision"], ''The Jewish Press'', 14 March 1991.</ref> However, David E. Fishman, professor of Jewish History at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], states that, whereas the ''[[Cheder|heder]]'' and ''[[yeshiva]]'', the organs of Jewish education, "were banned by virtue of the law separating church and school, and subjected to tough police and administrative actions", circumcision was not proscribed by law or suppressed by executive measures.<ref>David E. Fishman, "Judaism in the USSR, 1917–1930: The Fate of Religious Education", in: Yaacov Ro'i, ed., ''Jews and Jewish Life in Russia and the Soviet Union'' (Cummings Center Series; London: Cass, 1995), 251–262; pp. 251–252.</ref>
Jehoshua A. Gilboa writes that while circumcision was not officially or explicitly banned, pressure was exerted to make it difficult. ''[[Mohel]]s'' in particular were concerned that they could be punished for any health issue that might develop, even if it arose some time after the circumcision.<ref>"There was no official prohibition of circumcision and, on the whole, even the propaganda attacks on it were relatively restrained, apparently out of consideration for the presence of many millions of Moslems [...] in the Soviet Union. But at the same time numerous pressures were exerted to make observance of this precept [i.e., circumcision] difficult. Needless to say, Jewish members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] were in an embarrassing situation when they personally faced the question whether to circumcise their sons [...] And the uncertainty weighed heaviest on the ''mohalim'' themselves [...] Any health problem developing in the baby some time after circumcision could serve to incriminate the ''mohel''. It is easy to imagine, for example, the impact of news items on the death of children because of [...] circumcision (and the punishments imposed on ''mohalim''), even if there were no explicit legal bans on circumcision." Jehoshua A. Gilboa, ''A Language Silenced: The Suppression of Hebrew Literature and Culture in the Soviet Union'' (London: Associated University Press, 1982), pp. 34–35.</ref>

=== Albania ===
In 1967 all religion in Communist Albania was banned, along with the practice of circumcision. The practice was driven underground and many boys were secretly circumcised.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnTCPH_ZGW4C&q=young+boys+were+secretly+circumcised&pg=PA99|title=Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity|last1=Vickers|first1=Miranda|last2=Pettifer|first2=James|date=1997|publisher=Hurst|isbn=9781850652908|language=en}}</ref>

Whereas child custody regulations have been applied to cases involving circumcision, there seems to be no state which currently unequivocally bans infant male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons, albeit the legality of such circumcision is disputed in some legislations.

The present table provides a non-exhaustive overview comparing legal restrictions and requirements on non-therapeutic infant circumcision in several countries. Some countries require one or both parents to consent to the operation; some of these (Finland,<ref name="Denniston"/> United Kingdom<ref name="Exeter"/><ref name="BBC2207"/>) have experienced legal battles between parents when one of them had their son's circumcision carried out or planned without the other's consent. Some countries require the procedure to be performed by or supervised by a qualified physician (or a qualified nurse in Sweden<ref name="Denniston"/>), and with (local) [[anaesthesia]] applied to the boy or man.

=== Australia ===
The [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians|Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP)]] finds that routine infant circumcision is not warranted in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] and that, since circumcision involves physical injury, physicians ought to raise and consider with parents and considered the option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself: {{quote | After reviewing the currently available evidence, the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians|RACP]] believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand. … Since circumcision involves physical risks which are undertaken for the sake of psychosocial benefits or debatable medical benefit to the child, … The option of leaving circumcision until later, when the boy is old enough to make a decision for himself does need to be raised with parents and considered.| author = {{Flagicon|AUS}} [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Circumcision of infant males|publisher=[[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]]|year=2010|location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>}}

In 1993, a non-binding research paper of the [[Queensland Law Reform Commission]] (''Circumcision of Male Infants'') concluded that "On a strict interpretation of the assault provisions of the [[Queensland]] Criminal Code, routine circumcision of a male infant could be regarded as a criminal act," and that doctors who perform circumcision on male infants may be liable to civil claims by that child at a later date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/QLRC/|title=QLRC: Circumcision of Male Infants}}</ref> No prosecutions have occurred in Queensland, and circumcisions continue to be performed.

In 1999, a [[Perth]] man won A$360,000 in damages after a doctor admitted he botched a circumcision operation at birth which left the man with a badly deformed penis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/perth1/|title=Man Receives $360,000 Compensation for Childhood Circumcision|publisher=cirp.org}}</ref>

In 2002, Queensland police charged a father with grievous bodily harm for having his two sons, then aged nine and five, circumcised without the knowledge and against the wishes of the mother. The mother and father were in a family court dispute. The charges were dropped when the police prosecutor revealed that he did not have all family court paperwork in court and the magistrate refused to grant an adjournment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/thesundaymail08-11-02/|title=Mother's Fury as Boys Circumcised|publisher=cirp.org}}</ref>

In 2012, ''[[Le Soir]]'' reported a 21% increase in the amount of circumcisions in [[Belgium]] from 2006 and 2011. In the previous 25 years, one in three Belgian-born boys had allegedly been circumcised. A questionnaire to hospitals in [[Wallonia]] and [[Brussels]] showed that about 80 to 90% of the procedures had religious or cultural motives. The Ministry of Health stressed the importance of safe circumstances, physicians warned that 'no surgical procedure is without risk' and that circumcision was 'not a necessary procedure'.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20120810_003 |title=Rituele besnijdenis in opmars in België |work=Het Nieuwsblad |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>

In 2017, it was estimated that about 15% of Belgian men were circumcised. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] has been gradually rising: in 2002, about 17,800 boys or men underwent circumcision, which increased to almost 26,200 in 2016. The expenses of undergoing circumcision are covered by the National Institute for Disease and Disability Insurance (RIZIV/INAMI), costing about 2.7 million euros in 2016. After inquiries were submitted to the Belgian Bioethics Advisory Committee in early 2014, an ethics commission was set up to review the morality of covering the costs of medically unnecessary surgery through taxpayer money, especially considering that many taxpayers regard the practice as immoral.

According to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia:

::"To date, the legality of infant male circumcision has not been tested in the Courts. It is thus assumed to be legal if it is performed competently, in the child's best interest, and after valid consent has been obtained."

::"At all times the physician must perform the procedure with competence and at all times, the parent and physician must act in the best interests of the child. Signed parental consent for any treatment is assumed to be valid if the parent understands the nature of the procedure and its associated risks and benefits. However, proxy consent by parents is now being questioned. Many believe it should be limited to consent for diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, and that it is not relevant for non-therapeutic procedures."<ref name="cpsbc">[https://www.cpsbc.ca/files/u6/Circumcision-Infant-Male.pdf Circumcision (Infant Male)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215182208/https://www.cpsbc.ca/files/u6/Circumcision-Infant-Male.pdf |date=15 February 2012 }} In: ''Professional Standards and Guidelines''.

A study commissioned by the [[European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs]] published in February 2013 stated that "Male circumcision for non-therapeutic reasons appears to be practiced with relative regularity and frequency throughout Europe," and said it was "the only scenario, among the topics discussed in the present chapter, in which the outcome of the balancing between the right to physical integrity and religious freedom is in favour of the latter." The study recommended that "the best interests of children should be paramount, while acknowledging the relevance of this practice for Muslims and Jews. Member States should ensure that circumcision of underage children is performed according to the medical profession's art and under conditions that do not put the health of minors at risk. The introduction of regulations by the Member States in order to set the conditions and the appropriate medical training for those called to perform it is warranted."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/474399/IPOL-LIBE_ET(2013)474399_EN.pdf |title=Religious practice and observance in the EU Member States |author=Arnaiz|display-authors=et al |publisher=[[Secretariat of the European Parliament#Internal Policies|Directorate-General for Internal Policies]] |date=February 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>

The [https://www.bvkj.de German Association of Pediatricians (BVKJ)] finds no medical reason for non-therapeutic circumcision and that the [[American Academy of Pediatrics|AAP]] (2012) recommendation scientifically unsustainable, and that boys should have the same constitutional legal right to physical integrity as girls: {{quote | From a medical point of view, there is no reason to remove the intact foreskin of underage and non-consenting boys. … The tip of the foreskin is richly supplied with blood by important vascular structures.

In May 2005, [[Iceland]] amended its [[General Penal Code (Iceland)|General Penal Code]] to illegalize female genital mutilation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.althingi.is/altext/stjt/2005.083.html|title=Lög um breytingar á almennum hegningarlögum, nr. 19/1940, með síðari breytingum (bann við limlestingu á kynfærum kvenna).|website=Alþingi|language=is|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>

The bill discussed in the [[Alþing]], the Icelandic parliament, claimed the practice harmed the physical integrity of young boys, was often performed without anaesthesia and in an unhygienic manner by religious leaders instead of medical experts. These facts were deemed incompatible with the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1990). Critics argued the bill infringed on religious freedom or constituted antisemitism or anti-Muslim bigotry, making it hard for Muslims and Jews to live there. Silja Dögg Gunnarsdóttir, who proposed the ban, retorted that Iceland had already prohibited female circumcision in 2005, and "If we have laws banning circumcision for girls, then we should do so for boys."<ref name="Sherwood" /> On 29 April, the bill was sent back to Parliament for revisions.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/vilja-visa-frumvarpi-um-umskurd-til-stjornar |title=Vilja vísa frumvarpi um umskurð til stjórnar |work=[[RÚV]] |date=28 May 2018 |language=is |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref> On 25 March 2018, members of [[Jews Against Circumcision]] spoke in the Alþing expressing their support for the proposed ban, dismissing claims that it was motivated by antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, xenophobia or anti-immigration sentiment.<ref name="JACAlþing">{{Cite web |url=https://www.althingi.is/altext/erindi/148/148-1018.pdf |title=Comment on a bill amending the Criminal Code (prohibition on circumcision of boys), 148th Legislative Assembly |author=Jews Against Circumcision |publisher=Alþing |date=25 March 2018 |language=en |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref> Despite rumours to the contrary spread by the ''[[Times of Israel]]'' and others in late April, the bill was not scrapped, but is still a "work in progress".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://aleteia.org/2018/05/29/bill-to-criminalize-male-circumcision-is-still-alive-in-iceland/ |title=Bill to criminalize male circumcision is still alive in Iceland |author=Zelda Caldwell |work=[[Aleteia]] |publisher=Foundation for Evangelization through the Media |date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>

In October 2005 a Nigerian man was cleared of a charge of reckless endangerment over the death of a baby from hemorrhage and shock after he had circumcised the child. The judge directed the jury not to "bring what he called their white western values to bear when they were deciding this case" and effectively imposed a not guilty verdict on the jury.

=== Netherlands ===

The [[Royal Dutch Medical Association|Royal Dutch Medical Association (KNMG)]] finds non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors to be in conflict with children's right to autonomy and physical integrity, and that there are good reasons for its legal prohibition, as exists for female genital mutilation: {{quote |
* There is no convincing evidence that circumcision is useful or necessary in terms of prevention or hygiene. Partly in the light of the complications which can arise during or after circumcision, circumcision is not justifiable except on medical/therapeutic grounds. Insofar as there are medical benefits, such as a possibly reduced risk of HIV infection, it is reasonable to put off circumcision until the age at which such a risk is relevant and the boy himself can decide about the intervention, or can opt for any available alternatives.
* Contrary to what is often thought, circumcision entails the risk of medical and psychological complications. The most common complications are bleeding, infections, meatus stenosis (narrowing of the urethra) and panic attacks. Partial or complete penis amputations as a result of complications following circumcisions have also been reported, as have psychological problems as a result of the circumcision.
* Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is contrary to the rule that minors may only be exposed to medical treatments if illness or abnormalities are present, or if it can be convincingly demonstrated that the medical intervention is in the interest of the child, as in the case of vaccinations.
* Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity.

In May 2008 a father who had his two sons, aged 3 and 6 circumcised against the will of their mother was found not guilty of abuse as the circumcision was performed by a physician and due to the court's restraint in setting a legal precedent; instead he was given a 6-week suspended jail sentence for taking the boys away from their mother against her will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/05/father_not_guilty_in_circumcis.php|title=Father 'not guilty' in circumcision case - DutchNews.nl|date=7 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/101027/101027.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Religieuze jongens besnijdenis als mishandeling|date=2012}}</ref>

The [[Parquet (legal)|parquet]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] made an elaborate statement on the legal status of circumcision on 5 July 2011 in the course of a criminal case. First, the parquet notes that there is no law that specifically prohibits the circumcision of boys, nor that the practice falls under the more general crime of ''(zware) mishandeling'' ('(grave) assault'). 'Genital mutilation of girls in any case undoubtedly falls under ''(zware) mishandeling'' (Art. 300–303 [[Dutch Criminal Code]]). Whereas most forms of genital cutting of girls are generally marked as genital mutilation, a similar [[communis opinio]] regarding genital cutting of boys does not yet exist so far.' The Supreme Court acknowledged that society's attitudes on genital cutting of boys had been gradually shifting over the course of years, and that 'the increasing concern [in the medical world] about the harm and the risk of complications during a circumcision is indeed relevant', but that overall there were not enough reasons yet to proceed to criminalisation. Neither could intentional infliction of grave bodily harm (Art. 82 Dutch Criminal Code) be applied to the normal circumstances of a competently and hygienically performed circumcision in a clinic. And because young children are incapable of exercising the right to self-determination, parents ought to do this on their behalf. They can both request a circumcision to be performed, as well as consent to it being performed, on the grounds of their parental authority. However, it is important that both parents consent to the procedure.<ref name="Supreme Court of the Netherlands">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uitspraken.nl/uitspraak/parket-bij-de-hoge-raad/strafrecht/strafrecht-overig/ecli-nl-phr-2011-bq6690|title=Strafrecht overig |work=Uitspraken.nl |date=5 July 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2020 |language=nl}}</ref>

While legal, the [[British Medical Association]] finds it ethically unacceptable to circumcise a child or young person, either with or without competence, who refuses the procedure, irrespective of the parents' wishes, and that parental preference alone does not constitute sufficient grounds for performing NTMC on a child unable to express his own view: {{quote | The [[British Medical Association|BMA]] considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from NTMC (non-therapeutic male circumcision) is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for boys undergoing circumcision. In addition, some of the anticipated health benefits of male circumcision can be realised by other means – for example, condom use. … There are clearly risks inherent in any surgical procedure: for example, pain, bleeding, surgical mishap and complications of anaesthesia. With NTMC there are associated medical and psychological risks …  The BMA cannot envisage a situation in which it is ethically acceptable to circumcise a child or young person, either with or without competence, who refuses the procedure, irrespective of the parents' wishes. … Parental preference alone does not constitute sufficient grounds for performing NTMC on a child unable to express his own view. … Furthermore, the harm of a person not having the opportunity to choose not to be circumcised or choose not to follow the traditions of his parents must also be taken into account, together with the damage that can be done to the individual's relationship with his parents and the medical profession, if he feels harmed by an irreversible non-therapeutic procedure.| author = {{Flagicon|GB}} [[British Medical Association]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/children-and-young-people/non-therapeutic-male-circumcision-of-children-ethics-toolkit/5-health-risks-and-benefits-of-circumcision|title=BMA - Health risks and benefits of non-therapeutic male circumcision|publisher=[[British Medical Association]] |access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/children-and-young-people/non-therapeutic-male-circumcision-of-children-ethics-toolkit/6-determining-best-interests-when-it-comes-to-circumcision|title=BMA - Determining a child's best interests for non-therapeutic male circumcision|publisher=[[British Medical Association]] |access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>}}

The passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has led to some speculation that the lawfulness of the circumcision of male children is unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/edge1/|title=Circumcision After the Human Rights Act 1998|publisher=cirp.org}}</ref>

One 1999 case, ''Re "J" (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/Re_J/|title=Re J (child's religious upbringing and circumcision)|publisher=cirp.org}}</ref> said that circumcision in Britain required the consent of all those with parental responsibility (however this comment was not part of the reason for the judgement and therefore is not legally binding), or the permission of the court, acting for the best interests of the child, and issued an order prohibiting the circumcision of a male child of a non-practicing [[Muslim]] father and non-practicing Christian mother with custody. The reasoning included evidence that circumcision carried some medical risk; that the operation would be likely to weaken the relationship of the child with his mother, who strongly objected to circumcision without [[medical necessity]]; that the child may be subject to ridicule by his peers as the odd one out and that the operation might irreversibly reduce sexual pleasure, by permanently removing some sensory nerves, even though cosmetic foreskin restoration might be possible. The court did not rule out circumcision against the consent of one parent. It cited a hypothetical case of a Jewish mother and an agnostic father with a number of sons, all of whom, by agreement, had been circumcised as infants in accordance with Jewish laws; the parents then have another son who is born after they have separated; the mother wishes him to be circumcised like his brothers; the father for no good reason, refuses his agreement. In such a case, a decision in favor of circumcision was said to be likely.

In 2001 the General Medical Council had found a doctor who had botched circumcision operations guilty of abusing his professional position and that he had acted "inappropriately and irresponsibly",<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1502729.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Circumcision doctors 'abused position' | date=21 August 2001 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> and struck him off the register.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://archive.thisisthenortheast.co.uk/2003/3/3/101692.html Circumcision case GP told he can resume career<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A doctor who had referred patients to him, and who had pressured a mother into agreeing to the surgery, was also condemned.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> He was put on an 18-month period of review and retraining, and was allowed to resume unrestricted practice as a doctor in March 2003, after a committee found that he had complied with conditions it placed on him. According to the ''Northern Echo'', he "told the committee he has now changed his approach to circumcision referrals, accepting that most cases can be treated without the need for surgery".<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Fox and Thomson (2005) argue that consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision.<ref name="cirp" /> They say there is "no compelling legal authority for the common view that circumcision is lawful".

In 2005 a Muslim man had his son circumcised against the wishes of the child's mother who was the custodial parent.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4497150 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050523125330/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=4497150 | archive-date=23 May 2005 | title=Muslim Accused of Assaulting Son Through Circumcision | date=3 May 2005 | first=James | last=Tapsfield | newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] | location=Edinburgh | accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>

In 2009 it was reported that a 20-year-old man whose father had him ritually circumcised as a baby is preparing to sue the doctor who circumcised him.

[[File:Intact America logo.jpg|thumb|[[Intact America]] is one of the groups campaigning for a ban on non-medical nonconsensual circumcision of minors.]]
Circumcision of adults who grant personal informed consent for the surgical operation is legal.

In the United States, non-therapeutic circumcision of male children has long been assumed to be lawful in every jurisdiction provided that one parent grants surrogate informed consent. Adler (2013) has recently challenged the validity of this assumption.<ref>Peter W. Adler. [http://rjolpi.richmond.edu/archive/Adler_Formatted.pdf Is Circumcision Legal?] 16(3) Richmond J. L. & Pub.

'''Disputes between parents'''

Occasionally the courts are asked to make a ruling when parents cannot agree on whether or not to circumcise a child.

In January 2001 a dispute between divorcing parents in New Jersey was resolved when the mother, who sought to have the boy circumcised withdrew her request. The boy had experienced two instances of foreskin inflammation and she wanted to have him circumcised. The father, who had experienced a traumatic circumcision as a child, objected and they turned to the courts for a decision. The Medical Society of New Jersey and the Urological Society of New Jersey both opposed any court ordered medical treatment. As the parties came to an agreement, no precedent was set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cirp.org/news/star-ledger01-25-01/|title=Accord Not To Circumcise Son Still Leaves Heated Legal Debate|publisher=cirp.org}}</ref> In June 2001 a Nevada court settled a dispute over circumcision between two parents but put a strict gag order on the terms of the settlement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/cgi-bin/printable.cgi?/lvrj_home/2001/Jun-25-Mon-2001/news/16387263.html|title=Gag order issued|last=Thevemot|first=Carri Geer|date=25 June 2001|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]}}</ref> In July 2001 a dispute between parents in [[Kansas]] over circumcision was resolved when the mother's request to have the infant circumcised was withdrawn. In this case the father opposed circumcision while the mother asserted that not circumcising the child was against her religious beliefs. (The woman's pastor had stated that circumcision was "important" but was not necessary for salvation.) On 24 July 2001 the parents reached agreement that the infant would not be circumcised.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-24-01 |title=Agreement reached in circumcision case |date=25 July 2001 |newspaper=The Wichita Eagle |accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cirp.org/news/wichitaeagle07-13-01/ |title=Wichitans fight over their son's circumcision |author=Alex Branch |date=13 July 2001 |newspaper=The Wichita Eagle}}</ref>

On 14 July 2004 a mother appealed to the [[Missouri Supreme Court]] to prevent the circumcision of her son after a county court and the Court of Appeals had denied her a writ of prohibition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://examiner.net/stories/071504/new_071504018.shtml |title=The Examiner: Parents in court over son's circumcision 07/15/04 |date=26 December 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226064014/http://examiner.net/stories/071504/new_071504018.shtml |archive-date=26 December 2004 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, in early August 2004, before the Supreme Court had given its ruling, the father, who had custody of the boy, had him circumcised.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/9359979.htm|title=Despite mother's protest, father has boy circumcised|date=10 August 2004|work=Kansas City Star|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029070148/http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/9359979.htm|archive-date=29 October 2004}}</ref>

In October 2006 a judge in Chicago granted an injunction blocking the circumcision of a 9-year-old boy. In granting the injunction the judge stated that "the boy could decide for himself whether to be circumcised when he turns 18."<ref name="Reut06"/>

In November 2007, the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] heard arguments from a divorced [[Oregon]] couple over the circumcision of their son. The father wanted his son, who turned 13 on 2 March 2008, to be circumcised in accordance with the father's religious views; the child's mother opposes the procedure.  The parents dispute whether the boy is in favor of the procedure. A group opposed to circumcision filed briefs in support of the mother's position, while some Jewish groups filed a brief in support of the father.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gerstein |first=Josh |title=Ore.

'''Other disputes'''

In September 2004 the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] rejected a mother's attempt to prosecute her doctor for circumcising her child without fully informing her of the consequences of the procedure. The judge and jury found that the plaintiffs were adequately informed of possible complications, and the jury further found that it is not incumbent on the doctors to describe every "insignificant" risk.<ref name = "FargoForum2004">{{cite news

Anita Flatt of Hawley, Minn., also will have to pay more than $58,000 in costs the doctor and hospital incurred defending themselves, the court ruled. The justices rejected Flatt's argument that she received inadequate information before consenting to her son's circumcision shortly after his birth in 1997. If she had had more information, she would not have consented, she said....Jurors agreed with defense attorneys' arguments that Flatt had been told of the possible complications and that there is no need for doctors to outline every possible "insignificant" risk.
