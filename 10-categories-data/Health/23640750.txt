'''Antibiotic misuse''', sometimes called '''antibiotic abuse''' or '''antibiotic overuse''', refers to the misuse or overuse of [[antibiotic]]s, with potentially serious effects on health. It is a contributing factor to the development of [[antibiotic resistance]], including the creation of [[Antibiotic resistance|multidrug-resistant bacteria]], informally called "super bugs": relatively harmless bacteria (such as [[staphylococcus]], [[enterococcus]] and [[acinetobacter]]) can develop resistance to multiple antibiotics and cause life-threatening infections.<ref name="pmid9643260">{{cite journal|date=April 1998|title=The beginning of the end of the antibiotic era?

==History of antibiotic regulation==
Antibiotics have been around since 1928 when penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming. In the 1980s, antibiotics that were determined medically important for treatment of animals could be approved under veterinary oversight. In 1996, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) was established.<ref name="Food Insight 2016">{{cite journal | author = Food Insight | year = 2016 | title = FDA Antibiotic Regulation Through the Decades | url = http://www.foodinsight.org/fda-antibiotics-regulations-fact-sheet }}</ref> Starting in 2010, publications regarding antimicrobial drugs in food became an annual report. Starting in 2012, there was publicly solicited input on how data is to be collected and reported for matters relating to the use of antimicrobials for food-producing animals. Resulting from this, the FDA revised its sampling structure within NARMS with the goal of obtaining more representative livestock data for the key organisms under surveillance.<ref name="Food Insight 2016"/>  “NARMS partners at CDC and USDA have published over 150 peer-reviewed research articles examining the nature and magnitude of antimicrobial resistance hazards associated with antibiotic use in food-producing animals.” In 2014, the FDA began working with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  to explore additional mechanisms to obtain data that is representative of antibiotic use in food-producing animals. In 2015, the FDA issued the [[Veterinary Feed Directive]] (VFD) final rule, under which veterinarians must authorize the use of antimicrobials within feed for the animals they serve.<ref name="Food Insight 2016"/>

===Livestock===

There has been significant use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. The most abundant use of antimicrobials worldwide is in livestock; they are typically distributed in animal feed or water for purposes such as disease prevention and growth promotion.<ref>{{Citation|title=Industrial food animal production, antimicrobial resistance, and human health|year=2008|last1=Silbergeld|last2=Graham|last3=Price|first1=E.K.|first2=J.|first3=L.B.|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=29|pages=151–169|doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090904| doi-access=free|pmid=18348709}}</ref>

This action requires that farmers establish and work with veterinaries to receive a written VFD order.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Beth Ferry, Madonna Benjamin, Michigan State University Extension and Megan Sprague, MDARD | year = 2016 | title = Don't wait, be ready! New antibiotic rules for 2017  | url = http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/dont_wait_be_ready_new_antibiotic_rules_for_2017 }}</ref> The effect of this act places a requirement on an established veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR). Through this relationship, farmers will receive an increased education in the form of advice and guidance from their veterinarian. Resistant bacteria in food can cause infections in humans. Similar to humans, giving antibiotics to food animals will kill most bacteria, but resistant bacteria can survive. When food animals are slaughtered and processed, resistant germs in the animal gut can contaminate the meat or other animal products.
Resistant germs from the animal gut can also get into the environment, like water and soil, from animal manure. If animal manure or water containing resistant germs are used on fruits, vegetables, or other produce as fertilizer or irrigation, then this can spread resistant germs.<ref>CDC</ref>
