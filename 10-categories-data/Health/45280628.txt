Physiotherapists treating patients following uncomplicated coronary artery bypass surgery (also called coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or CABG) surgery continue to use interventions such as deep breathing exercises that are not supported by best available evidence. Standardised guidelines may be required to better match clinical practice with current literature.<ref>Inverarity, Laura; Grossman, K (28 November 2007). "Types of Physical Therapy". About.com.

== Diseases and conditions treated ==

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
[[Cystic fibrosis]] (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a [[genetic disorder]] that affects mostly the lungs, but also the [[pancreas]], [[liver]], [[kidneys]], and [[intestines]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Sullivan | first1 = BP | last2 = Freedman | first2 = SD | year = 2009 | title = Cystic fibrosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 373 | issue = 9678| pages = 1891–904 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60327-5 | pmid = 19403164 }}</ref> Major advances over the past few years in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) have resulted in dramatic improvements in longevity and [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] for many patients. However, [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] dysfunction remains responsible for much of the [[morbidity]] and mortality associated with the disorder. Physiotherapy has long played an important role in the respiratory management of the disease, and has had to adapt to the changes in disease pattern from infancy to adulthood. The role of the physiotherapist is not limited to airway clearance, but also includes encouragement and advice regarding exercise, [[Neutral spine|posture]] and mobility, inhalation therapy and, in the later stages of the disease process, non-invasive respiratory support. It is generally felt that the use of [[chest physiotherapy]] in CF has lacked good scientific basis, and the current call for [[evidence-based medicine]] requires physiotherapists to scrutinize their practice closely.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 1305881 | pmid=10911816 | volume=93 Suppl 38 | title=Physiotherapy in cystic fibrosis | year=2000 | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=27–36 | last1 = Prasad | first1 = SA | last2 = Tannenbaum | first2 = EL | last3 = Mikelsons | first3 = C}}</ref>

=== Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ===
[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by chronically poor airflow. It typically worsens over time. The main symptoms include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], cough, and [[Mucus hypersecretion|excessive mucus production]].<ref>Vestbo, Jørgen (2013). "Definition and Overview". Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease. pp. 1–7.</ref> As COPD gets worse, shortness of breath worsens making eating, exercising or breathing much more difficult.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/tc/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-overview|title=COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)-Topic Overview}}</ref>

=== Deep vein thrombosis  ===
[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT), or deep venous thrombosis, is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Scarvelis | first1 = D | last2 = Wells | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = Diagnosis and treatment of deep-vein thrombosis | journal = CMAJ | volume = 175 | issue = 9| pages = 1087–92 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.060366 | pmid = 17060659 | pmc=1609160}}</ref> Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as [[venous thromboembolism]].

== Techniques ==
{{See also|Airway clearance therapy}}

=== Chest physiotherapy:Postural drainage ===

=== Active cycle of breathing techniques ===
The ''active cycle of breathing techniques'' (ACBT) is a flexible regimen comprising breathing control, [[thoracic]] expansion exercises and the FET, frequently combined with gravity-assisted positioning. Increasing [[lung volumes]] during thoracic expansion allows air to get behind distal secretions via collateral ventilatory channels. During a [[forced expiratory volume|forced expiratory]] manoeuvre, compression and narrowing occurs within the airways at a point dependent on lung volume (the equal pressure point). This is shifted distally as a forced expiration is continued to low lung volume, thereby mobilizing peripheral secretions.

This technique has been reported to be an effective and efficient [[Airway clearance therapy|means of airway clearance]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pryor | first1 = JA | last2 = Webber | first2 = BA | year = 1979 | title = Evaluation of the forced expiration technique as an adjunct to postural drainage in treatment of cystic fibrosis | journal = BMJ | volume = 2 | issue = 6187| pages = 417–18 | doi=10.1136/bmj.2.6187.417| pmc = 1595668 | pmid = 486968 }}</ref><ref name="auto">Wilson GE, Baldwin AL, Walshaw MJ.

== Assessment tests ==

=== 6 minute walk test ===
[[Pulmonary rehabilitation]] is an evidence-based intervention for the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In clinical practice, the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is commonly used to assess changes in functional exercise capacity in COPD patients following pulmonary rehabilitation with the primary outcome reported being the distance walked during the test (i.e. 6MWD). The 6MWD has demonstrated [[internal validity|validity]] and [[Reliability (research methods)|reliability]] after one familiarisation test and the capacity to detect changes following pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition to assessing the outcomes of pulmonary rehabilitation, 6MWD may be used to quantify the magnitude of a patient's disability, prescribe a walking programme, identify patients likely to benefit from a rollator and to identify the presence of exercise-induced [[hypoxemia]].

== Current concepts ==
[[Randomized trial]]s have demonstrated that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) can improve [[dyspnea]], exercise tolerance, and health-related quality of life. Rehabilitation has traditionally been provided in [[Health care#Secondary care|secondary care]] to patients with moderate to severe disease. However, current concepts are recommending that it should be delivered in a primary and community care setting for patients with milder disease.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frozen Shoulder|url=https://www.local-physio.co.uk/articles/shoulder-pain/frozen-shoulder|publisher=www.local-physio.co.uk}}</ref>

There are several opportunities for spreading the word for PR in primary care. One of these is to improve access to PR for all those disabled by their disease by the increase of community schemes. One such scheme being utilised in [[Health care in Canada|Canada]] is reviewed. The essential components of PR include behavior change, patient self-management and prescriptive exercise. In the last decade new strategies have been developed to enhance the effects of exercise training. An overview of these new approaches being an adjunct to exercise training is reviewed. Although the role of exercise training is well established, we are only just beginning to appreciate the importance of behavior change and patient self-management in contributing to improved health and diminished healthcare resource utilisation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ambrosino | first1 = N | last2 = Casaburi | first2 = R | last3 = Ford | first3 = G | last4 = Goldstein | first4 = R | last5 = Morgan | first5 = MD | last6 = Rudolf | first6 = M | last7 = Singh | first7 = S | date = June 2008 | title = Developing concepts in the pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD.
