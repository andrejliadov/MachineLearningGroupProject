Efforts to change government policies on [[euthanasia]] of humans in the 20th and 21st centuries have met limited success in [[Western world|Western countries]]. Human euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. {{As of|2020|December}}, active human euthanasia is legal in the [[Netherlands]],  [[Belgium]], [[Colombia]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Minsalud deja en firme la resolución con protocolo de eutanasia |date=April 2015 |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/estilo-de-vida/salud/eutanasia-en-colombia-minsalud-expide-protocolo-para-muerte-digna-en-el-pais/15606475 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |language=es}}</ref> [[Luxembourg]], [[Western Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2016_3/FullText.html|title=Medical Assistance in Dying Bill|date=2016|website=Canada's Justice Laws Website}}</ref> [[Assisted suicide]] is legal in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and in the [[United States|U.S.]] states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Vermont]], [[Maine]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/politics/governor-mills-signs-death-with-dignity-bill/97-468e06aa-8e96-411e-93ff-d60c28355d5c|title=Governor Mills signs 'Death with Dignity' bill|website=WCSH}}</ref> [[New Jersey]],<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/tns-aid-in-dying-bill-signed-new-jersey.html|title='Aid-in-Dying' Bill Becomes Law in New Jersey|website=www.governing.com}}</ref> [[California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwfdailynews.com/news/20160419/canadian-catholic-group-speaks-out-against-proposed-assisted-suicide-bill|title=Canadian Catholic group speaks out against proposed assisted suicide bill|first=Kelsey Dallas, Deseret|last=News|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> and in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/18/dc-physician-assisted-suicide-law-goes-effect/|title=D.C. physician-assisted suicide law goes into effect|work=The Washington Times|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref>

===Argentina===

On 9 May 2012, the [[Argentine Senate]] turned into law a project that enables to reject treatments that artificially prolong the life of patients with terminal or irreversible symptoms. The consent may be given by the patient or, if not in a position to do so, their relatives or legal representatives. It was promulgated on 24 May 2012 as "Law 26,742".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/ciudadanos/que-dice-la-ley-de-muerte-digna |title=Qué dice la ley de muerte digna |date=7 July 2015 |work=[[La Voz del Interior]] |language=es}}</ref>

A survey published in 2010 reported that those who died from euthanasia (compared with other deaths) were more often younger, male, cancer patients and more often died in their homes. In almost all cases, unbearable physical suffering were reported.

In December 2003, the Belgian Senate voted in favour of extending its euthanasia law to terminally ill children.  Conditions imposed on children seeking euthanasia are that "the patient must be conscious of their decision and understand the meaning of euthanasia", "the request must have been approved by the child's parents and medical team", "their illness must be terminal" and "they must be in great pain, with no available treatment to alleviate their distress".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25364745 | work=BBC News | title=Belgian Senate votes to extend euthanasia to children | date=13 December 2013}}</ref>  A [[psychologist]] must also determine the patient's maturity to make the decision.

In September 2014, the Federal Euthanasia Commission gave convicted rapist and murderer [[Frank Van Den Bleeken]] the right to assisted suicide. Van Den Bleeken had served decades in prison for a 1989 crime and no longer wished to live. Over a dozen other inmates filed similar petitions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brussels: Murderer may kill himself|publisher=The Week (page 6)|date=26 September 2014}}</ref> In January 2015, the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Van Den Bleeken's doctors recommended against euthanasia and that alternative psychological care would be sought for him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgian rapist Van Den Bleeken refused 'right to die'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30699780|access-date=31 January 2018|agency=BBC News|date=6 January 2015}}</ref>

In late 2014, a doctor administered a lethal dose of drugs to a patient after struggling with mental illness for years, upon the patient own request.
Quote: "Belgium is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with the Netherlands, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. The idea is that those with a psychiatric illness should be afforded the same rights as those suffering from a physical one." <ref>{{cite news|title='What could help me to die?'

===Canada===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Canada}}
Voluntary active euthanasia, called "physician assisted dying", is legal in Canada for all people over the age of 18 who have a terminal illness that has progressed to the point where natural death is "reasonably foreseeable."  To prevent [[suicide tourism]], only people eligible to claim Canadian health insurance may use it.  Legalization of the practice came in 2015/2016 as a result of a series of Supreme Court rulings striking down Canada's ban on medically assisted suicide.  Below is a timeline of events:

On 6 February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]'' that Canadian adults who are mentally competent and suffering intolerably and permanently have the right to a doctor's help in dying. The court however suspended its ruling for 12 months to give the government an opportunity to write legislation and draft new laws and policies around assisted dying.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-on-doctor-assisted-suicide/article22828437/ | work=The Globe and Mail | first=Sean | last=Fine | title=Canadians have right to doctor-assisted suicide, Supreme Court rules | date=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref>''Carter v. Canada (Attorney General)'', 2015 SCC 5, online at: http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do</ref>  In January 2016 the court granted an additional 4-month extension to its ruling suspension to allow time for the newly elected Liberal government to consult with Canadians on drafting a law to comply with the ruling.  As an interim measure, it also ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia until the new law passes.<ref>{{cite web | title = Supreme court gives Parliament 4-month extension on doctor-assisted dying law

A parliamentary committee report tasked with studying the issue in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling recommended that anyone experiencing "intolerable suffering" should be able to seek a doctor's help to die.  On 14 April 2016, Canada's federal Liberal government introduced legislation to legalize assisted dying under more restrictive conditions than recommended by the committee, allowing access to only those with terminal illnesses for whom death is "reasonably foreseeable".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21697129-seeking-consensus-where-none-exists-canadas-new-doctor-assisted-dying-law-takes-shape|title=Canada's new doctor-assisted dying law takes shape|journal=The Economist|access-date=6 October 2018|date=19 April 2016}}</ref>  The [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] argues that the government's assisted dying law is unconstitutional, because it limits access to only those whose death is "reasonably foreseeable", rather than provide access to anybody suffering from a "grievous and irremediable" condition, the definition used by the Supreme Court of Canada in their court ruling that the BCCLA argues would include non-terminal conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/children-of-assisted-death-advocate-kay-carter-urge-amendments-to-liberal-bill-1.2869585|title=Children of assisted-death advocate Kay Carter urge amendments to Liberal bill|date=21 April 2016|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref>

The bill received considerable multi-partisan opposition within the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], where it was criticized as being drafted too quickly, and being too restrictive compared with the Supreme Court decision.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tasker|first1=John Paul|title='Rushed' assisted-dying legislation to face strong opposition in the Senate|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rushed-assisted-dying-legislation-senate-1.3604005|access-date=1 June 2016|work=CBC News|date=28 May 2016}}</ref>   As a result, the Senate made a series of amendments to the bill.  The House of Commons accepted all of the amendments made by the Senate except one, which removed the requirement that death be "reasonably foreseeable."

On 17 June 2016, a bill to legally allow assisted suicide within Canada became law after it passed both houses of the [[Parliament of Canada]] and received [[Royal Assent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.her.ie/news/canada-legalises-euthanasia-for-the-terminally-ill/298541|title=Canada legalises euthanasia for the terminally ill - Her.ie|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref>

===Chile===
Active euthanasia or assisted suicide are not legal in [[Chile]]. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. Since 2012, the regulation of patients' rights creates the right to informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Patients can refuse treatment when they are terminal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ley. Nº 20.584.

===Colombia===
In a 6–3 decision, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled in 1997 that "no person can be held criminally responsible for taking the life of a terminally ill patient who has given clear authorization to do so," according to the ''Washington Post''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-738421.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329164300/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-738421.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 March 2015|title=Colombia Debates Court Ruling That Legalizes Mercy Killing|date=18 August 1997|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> The court defined "terminally ill" person as those with diseases such as "cancer, AIDS, and kidney or liver failure if they are terminal and the cause of extreme suffering," the Post reported. The ruling specifically refused to authorize euthanasia for people with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Lou Gehrig's disease. On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the [[Ministry of Health and Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Health and Social Protection]] 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/vivir/los-principios-regular-eutanasia-articulo-544675|title=Los principios para regular la eutanasia|publisher=ElEspectador.com|date=19 February 2015|author=Redacción Salud|language=es}}</ref>

===France===
In July 2013, French President [[François Hollande]] stated his personal support for decriminalisation of [[voluntary euthanasia]] in France, which had been one of his presidential campaign promises ("introduction of the right to die with dignity"), despite objections from France's National Consultative Ethics Committee/ [[Comité national consultatif d'éthique]], which alleged "abuses" in adjacent jurisdictions that have decriminalised and regulated either voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide ([[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]]). More socially conservative members of the [[Catholic Church]] and other major religious groups in France had announced that after expressing an opposition to the introduction of [[same-sex marriage in France]], their next target may be the possible decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnz.co.nz/world-news/france-aims-allow-euthanasia-despite-ethics-doubts-5484055 |title=France aims to allow euthanasia despite ethics doubts | work = TVNZ News| date=2 July 2013 | access-date=2 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130702051822/http://www.tvnz.co.nz/world-news/france-aims-allow-euthanasia-despite-ethics-doubts-5484055 |archive-date=2 July 2013 }}</ref>

In  January 2016 both houses of France's parliament approved a measure that, while stopping short of euthanasia, would allow doctors to keep terminal patients sedated until death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/28/france-adopts-sedated-dying-law-as-compromise-on-euthanasia|title=France adopts sedated dying law as compromise on euthanasia|last=Press|first=Associated|date=27 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref>

===Germany===
Passive euthanasia is legal in [[Germany]] if the patient has requested it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-12-state-euthanasia-europe.html|title=The state of euthanasia in Europe|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> On 17 May 2014 the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] legalized passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of [[life support]] to patients who request euthanasia. Forms of [[euthanasia|active euthanasia]], including the lethal compound administration, are illegal. 

On 6 November 2015, the German Parliament passed a bill incriminating assisted suicide if it is done in a business-like manner. "Business-like" was meant by the legislator to include any recurrent assistance. Consequently, it typically included physicians. There did not need to be an intention to gain benefits.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/assisted-suicide-law-germany-passes-despite-concerns-over-nazi-association-2172889|title=Assisted Suicide Law In Germany Passes Despite Concerns Over Nazi Association|date=6 November 2015|work=International Business Times|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref>

On 2 March 2017, the [[Federal Administrative Court (Germany)|Federal Administrative Court]] ruled that, in extreme circumstances, it was illegal that an agency denied access to life-ending substances. The relevant legal basis must be interpreted in accordance with the fundamental right to personal self-determination.<ref>{{cite web |title=Licence for acquiring a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital to commit suicide |url=https://www.bverwg.de/en/020317U3C19.15.0 |website=Federal Administrative Court |access-date=7 March 2020 |date=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=German Federal Court rules patients should have access to life-ending drugs |url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-federal-court-rules-patients-should-have-access-to-life-ending-drugs/a-37790952 |access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref>

===Ireland===

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it is illegal for a doctor (or anyone) to ''actively'' contribute to someone's death. It is not, however, illegal to remove life support and other treatment (the "right to die") should a person (or their next of kin) request it. A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0917/1224279097037.html|title=The Irish Times (17 September 2010) – ''Majority believe assisted suicide should be legal''}}</ref> Doctors can stop giving a patient life sustaining treatments such as ventilators, feeding tube etc. after being sedated, allowing the patient to die peacefully in their sleep.This only occurs in certain circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/az/E/Euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide/Alternatives-to-euthanasia-and-assisted-suicide.html|title=Alternatives to euthanasia and assisted suicide - HSE.ie|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref>

===Israel===
The [[Israel]]i Penal Law forbids causing the death of another and specifically forbids shortening the life of another. Active euthanasia has been accepted in some cases under Israeli law.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Euthanasia: The Approach of the Courts in Israel and the Application of Jewish Law Principles|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/euth.html|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> In 2005, proposals were put forward to allow passive euthanasia to be administered using a switch mechanism similar to [[Sabbath clock]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Butcher|first=Tim|title=Israelis to be allowed euthanasia by machine|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1505018/Israelis-to-be-allowed-euthanasia-by-machine.html|access-date=6 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=8 December 2005|location=London}}</ref> In 2006, the Steinberg Commission was set up to look into whether life and death issues could be rethought in the context of Jewish law, which suggested that hospitals could set up committees to determine whether patients would be given passive euthanasia.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Shlomo|title=Ask the Rabbi: 'Passive euthanasia'|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1258624592410|access-date=6 January 2012|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|date=19 November 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Japan===
The [[Japan]]ese government has no official laws on the status of euthanasia and the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] has never ruled on the matter.  Rather, to date, Japan's euthanasia policy has been decided by two local court cases, one in [[Nagoya]] in 1962, and another after an incident at [[Tokai University]] in 1995.  The first case involved {{Nihongo|"passive euthanasia"|消極的安楽死|shōkyokuteki anrakushi}} (i.e., allowing a patient to die by turning off life support) and the latter case involved {{Nihongo|"active euthanasia"|積極的安楽死|sekkyokuteki anrakushi}} (e.g., through injection).  The judgments in these cases set forth a legal framework and a set of conditions within which both passive and active euthanasia could be legal. Nevertheless, in both of these particular cases the doctors were found guilty of violating these conditions when taking the lives of their patients.  Further, because the findings of these courts have yet to be upheld at the national level, these precedents are not necessarily binding.  Nevertheless, at present, there is a tentative legal framework for implementing euthanasia in Japan.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia
  | title = 安楽死
  | encyclopedia = 現代用語の基礎知識
  | pages = 951, 953
  | publisher = 自由国民社
  | year = 2007}}</ref>

In the case of passive euthanasia, three conditions must be met:
# the patient must be suffering from an incurable disease, and in the final stages of the disease from which he/she is unlikely to make a recovery;
# the patient must give express consent to stopping treatment, and this consent must be obtained and preserved prior to death.  If the patient is not able to give clear consent, their consent may be determined from a pre-written document such as a [[living will]] or the testimony of the family;
# the patient may be passively euthanized by stopping medical treatment, chemotherapy, dialysis, artificial respiration, blood transfusion, IV drip, etc.

For active euthanasia, four conditions must be met:
# the patient must be suffering from unbearable physical pain;
# death must be inevitable and drawing near;
# the patient must give consent.  (Unlike passive euthanasia, living wills and family consent will not suffice.)
# the physician must have (ineffectively) exhausted all other measures of pain relief.

The problems that arose from this, in addition to the problem faced by many other families in the country, has led to the creation of "bioethics SWAT teams".<ref>{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=89}}</ref> These teams will be made available to the families of terminally ill patients in order to help them, along with the doctors, come to a decision based on the personal facts of the case. Though in its early stages and relying on "subsidies from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare" there are plans to create a nonprofit organization to "allow this effort to continue."<ref>{{harvnb|McDougall|Gorman|2008|p=90}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
{{main|Euthanasia in New Zealand}}
Assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are illegal in [[New Zealand]] under Section 179 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which renders it a criminal offence to "aid and abet suicide." 

Two decriminalisation attempts – the Death With Dignity Bill 1995 and the Death With Dignity Bill 2003 – failed, the latter by only a three-vote margin within the New Zealand Parliament. In May 2012, [[Labour Party of New Zealand]] MP Maryan Street introduced a private [[member's bill]] into the ballot box, the End of Life Choices Bill, which was taken over by MP Iain Lees-Galloway when she failed to get re-elected in the 2014 General Election. The bill was dropped in December 2014 at the request of Labour Party leader [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] as the issue was deemed to be distracting from bigger issues that concerned the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11374199|title=Labour MP drops euthanasia bill|first=Isaac Davison Political reporter, NZ Herald isaac davison@nzherald co nz|last=@isaac_davison|date=14 December 2014|access-date=6 October 2018|via=www.nzherald.co.nz}}</ref>

Euthanasia is a delict under the laws of Peru, although there have been some attempts to reform them.

In October 2009, the Reviser Special Commission of the Penal Code of the Parliament expressed its support of a proposal that tried to amend article 112 of the Penal Code, but it did not succeed.

However, at the beginning of 2015, the case of the Chilean woman young Valentina Maureira, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, an incurable disease, and who asked that euthanasia be allowed in her country, attracted the interest of the press of Chile and also of foreign media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://larepublica.pe/01-03-2015/michelle-bachelet-visita-en-el-hospital-a-valentina-la-nina-que-le-pidio-eutanasia| title=Michelle Bachelet visita en el hospital a Valentina, la niña que le pidió eutanasia|date=1 March 2015| work=[[La República]]| access-date=22 June 2017}}</ref>

On 4 March of the same year, the Peruvian legislator Roberto Angulo Álvarez, membership of Dignity and Democracy parliamentary group, motivated by this case, presented a bill that proposed to allow assisted death in case of terminal or degenerative disease, with the objective of "avoid the physical and psychological pains of the patient, as well the unnecessary expenses for the family members and the State".

===Philippines===
Euthanasia is illegal in the Philippines. In 1997, the [[Philippine Senate]] considered passing a bill legalizing passive euthanasia. The bill met strong opposition from the country's Catholic Church. If legalized the Philippines would have been the first country to legalize euthanasia. Under current laws, doctors assisting a patient to die can be imprisoned and charged with malpractice.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=2126848 | pmid=9193287 | doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7095.1641i | volume=314 |issue = 7095| title=Philippines considers euthanasia bill | year=1997 | journal=BMJ | pages=1644 | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = C}}</ref>

This incident is well known in Korea as 'Boramae Hospital Incident' (보라매병원 사건). Another incident that sparked further debate was from the imprisonment of a father who plugged off a respirator for his braindead son.<ref>{{cite web|title=Euthanasia Legal for the Terminally Ill In S.Korea Now|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/euthanasia-legal-for-the-terminally-ill-in-skorea-now-71327-1.htm|website=Med India|publisher=Tanya Thomas|access-date=15 July 2010|date=15 July 2010}}</ref>

Patients who qualify for active or passive euthanasia in South Korea are reserved for the terminally ill with a nonexistent chance of recovery. Patients who have a beneficial reaction to any medications, or are not in a rapidly deteriorating state of health leading to imminent death may not be qualified. Patients must have a confirmation of a registered physician and a doctor to die under dignity, and comatose patients must have the approval of both guardians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Korea to Temporarily Allow Terminally Ill Patients to Choose Death with Dignity|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/10/23/2017102301468.html|website=조선일보|publisher=Choi Won-woo|access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref>

The bill will now go to committee and the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spanish Government Passes 1st Hurdle to Legalize Euthanasia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/02/11/world/europe/ap-eu-spain-euthanasia.html |access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> The lower house approved the bill in December 2020. <ref>{{cite news |title= Spain's lower house approves euthanasia bill |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-euthanasia/spains-lower-house-approves-euthanasia-bill-idUSLUN2HC01A |access-date=17 December 2020}}</ref>

On 17 December 2020, the [[Congress of Deputies]] passed a bill to regulate the right to euthanasia.<ref name=hermida  /> The final draft, whose intellectual authorship was attributed to [[María Luisa Carcedo]], commanded the support from 192 legislators ([[PSOE]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]], [[Bloque Nacionalista Galego|BNG]], [[Republican Left of Catalonia|ERC]], [[Together for Catalonia (2017)|Junts per Catalunya]], [[Más País]], [[Bildu]], [[Basque Nationalist Party|PNV]], [[Candidatura d'Unitat Popular|CUP]], [[Ciudadanos]]), the opposition from 138 ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]], [[Vox (political party)|Vox]], [[Unión del Pueblo Navarro|UPN]]) and 2 abstentions.<ref name=hermida>{{Cite web|url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-12-17/el-congreso-aprueba-la-primera-ley-de-eutanasia-con-una-holgada-mayoria.html|first=Xosé|last=Hermida|date=17 December 2020|title=El Congreso aprueba la primera ley de eutanasia con una holgada mayoría|website=[[El País]]|language=es}}</ref><ref name=abc>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.es/sociedad/abci-congreso-aprueba-amplia-mayoria-ley-eutanasia-202012171548_noticia.html|website=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|first=Laura|last=Daniele|date=17 December 2020|title=El Congreso aprueba por amplia mayoría la ley de eutanasia}}</ref> Given widespread parliamentary support and the incorporation of [[amendment]]s, the law is expected to be directly passed by the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] and then published in the [[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]], without needing to return to the Congress of Deputies.<ref name=abc />

===Sweden===
Passive euthanasia was deemed legal after a landmark court ruling in 2010. That means a health care professional can legally cease life support upon request from a patient if they understand the consequences stated by their health care provider, and administering a lethal substance is also illegal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sweden allows passive euthanasia|agency=AFP|publisher=The Swedish Wire|date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Switzerland}}
In Switzerland, deadly drugs may be prescribed to a Swiss person or to a foreigner, where the recipient takes an active role in the drug administration.<ref name="CB1">{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887| title=YOUthanasia| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2 August 2009| publisher=Criminal Brief| access-date=27 August 2009}}</ref> More generally, article 115 of the Swiss penal code, which came into effect in 1942 (having been written in 1918), considers assisting suicide a crime only if the motive is selfish.

===Turkey===
Euthanasia is strictly forbidden in [[Turkey]]. The aide who helped a person to suicide or other ways to kill oneself will be punished for assisting and encouraging suicide under the stipulation of article 84 of the [[Turkish Criminal Law]]. In condition of active euthanasia, article 81 of the same law sets forth that any person who carries out this act will be judged and punished for life imprisonment just like a simple murder.

===United Kingdom===

Active euthanasia is illegal in the [[United Kingdom]].

In regard to the [[principle of double effect]], in 1957 [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Judge Devlin]] in the trial of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]] ruled that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Otlowski|first=Margaret|title=Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&pg=PA177|year=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-825996-1|pages=175–177}}</ref>

===United States===

{{See also|Assisted suicide in the United States}}

Active euthanasia is illegal throughout the [[United States of America|United States]]. Patients retain the rights to refuse medical treatment and to receive appropriate management of pain at their request (passive euthanasia), even if the patients' choices hasten their deaths. Additionally, futile or disproportionately burdensome treatments, such as life-support machines, may be withdrawn under specified circumstances and, under federal law and most state laws only with the informed consent of the patient or, in the event of the incompetence of the patient, with the informed consent of the legal surrogate. The Supreme Court of the United States has not dealt with "quality of life issues" or "futility issues" and appears to only condone active or passive "euthanasia" (not legally defined)  when there is clear and convincing evidence that informed consent to the euthanasia, passive or active, has been obtained from the competent patient or the legal surrogate of the incompetent patient.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

===Uruguay===
{{Main|Euthanasia in Uruguay}}
Since 1933 the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150815062616/http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/Codigos/CodigoPenal/Cod_Pen.htm Penal Code of Uruguay], article 37, accept Compassionate Homicide, the first legal document that include euthanasia. It's important to say that this legal document didn't use this denomination. In another article, 127,  the judge could waive the doctor, if this action was made by patient pledge and the doctor had an honorable reputation.<ref>Reta A, Grezzi O. ''Código penal de la República Oriental del Uruguay''. 4th ed. Montevideo: Fundación de Cultura Universitaria; 1996.</ref> The main source of this Penal Code was [[Luis Jiménez de Asúa|Jimenéz de Asúa]], a Spanish penalist, that introduce this concept in his book "Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinología", published in Madrid/Spain, in 1928.<ref>Asúa LJ de. Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinología. Madrid: Historia Nueva; 1928.</ref> The first proposal to understand Euthanasia as homicide was made by Ruy Santos in his MD thesis, "Da resistencia dos estados mórbidos à therapeutica e da incurabilidade perante a euthanásia", at Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia/Brazil, in 1928. He made a difference between Euthanasia as homicide and Euthanasia as suicide, probably the first citation about Assisted Suicide.<ref>Santos R. Da euthanásia nos incuráveis dolorosos.

There are a number of historical studies about the thorough euthanasia-related policies of professional associations. In their analysis, {{harvp|Brody, B. A.|Rothstein, M. A.|McCullough, L. B.|Bobinski, M. A.|2001}}. found it necessary to distinguish such topics as euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, informed consent and refusal, advance directives, pregnant patients, surrogate decision-making (including neonates), DNR orders, irreversible loss of consciousness, quality of life (as a criterion for limiting end-of-life care), withholding and withdrawing intervention, and futility.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Brody, B.

A.|title=Medical Ethics: Analysis of the Issues Raised by the Codes, Opinions and Statements.|publisher=BNA Books|year=2001}}</ref> Similar distinctions presumably are found outside the U.S., as with the highly contested statements of the British Medical Association.<ref>[http://www.doctorsfed.org.uk/content/view/165/39/ On the BMA controversy.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128200523/http://www.doctorsfed.org.uk/content/view/165/39/ |date=28 November 2006 }}</ref><ref>For professional policies in the English-speaking world, see [http://www.euthanasia.com/page17.html this selection by an advocacy NGO.]</ref>

On euthanasia (narrowly defined here as directly causing death), Brody sums up the U.S. medical NGO arena:

<blockquote>The debate in the ethics literature on euthanasia is just as divided as the debate on physician-assisted suicide, perhaps more so. Slippery-slope arguments are often made, supported by claims about abuse of voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands.... Arguments against it are based on the integrity of medicine as a profession. In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative – an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide.<ref>{{harvp|Brody, B. A.|Rothstein, M. A.|McCullough, L. B.|Bobinski, M. A.|2001|p=283}}</ref></blockquote>

Other NGOs that advocate for and against various euthanasia-related policies are found throughout the world. Among proponents, perhaps the leading NGO is the UK's [[Dignity in Dying]], the successor to the (Voluntary) Euthanasia Society.<ref>[http://www.dignityindying.org.uk Dignity in Dying.] In an unsympathetic account, the International Task Force on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide has detailed the ebb and flow of euthanasia proponents. http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/rpt2005_I.htm#204 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010142142/http://www.internationaltaskforce.org/rpt2005_I.htm#204 |date=10 October 2007 }}</ref> In addition to professional and religious groups, there are NGOs opposed to euthanasia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euthanasia.com/page10.html|title=Euthanasia suicide mercy-killing right-to-die physician assisted suicide living wills research|website=www.euthanasia.com|access-date=6 October 2018}}</ref> found in various countries.
