There are many scientists of this movement with different approaches. Two of the most popular proponents of the anti-aging movement include [[Ray Kurzweil]], who says humanity can defeat aging through the advance of [[technology]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Chasing Immortality—The Technology of Eternal Life |author=Craig Hamilton |url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j30/kurzweil.asp |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606134650/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j30/kurzweil.asp |archive-date=June 6, 2012 }}</ref> and [[Aubrey De Grey]], who says that the human body is a very complicated machine and, thus, can be repaired indefinitely.<ref name=SingularitySymposiumDeGray>{{cite web|title=Who is Aubrey de Grey?|url=http://www.singularitysymposium.com/aubrey-de-grey.html|website=Singularity Symposium|quote=Maybe it is because of his background in computer science that Dr. de Grey perceives the human body as a very complicated machine. Therefore, he argues that aging is primarily an engineering problem.

Levinson]].

==Anti-aging medicine==
{{Main|Anti-aging medicine}}
Anti-aging medicine has become a budding and rapidly growing [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] as physicians who initially sought treatment for themselves have received training and [[Board certification|certification]] in its practice<ref name=Mykytyn/> by organizations such as the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) co-founded by Dr [[Robert M. Goldman]] and Ronald Klatz.

===Human growth hormone===

Central to anti-aging medicine is administration of [[human growth hormone]].<ref>Ronald Klatz, ''Grow Young with HGH: The Amazing Medically Proven Plan to Reverse Aging'' Harper Paperbacks (May 8, 1998), trade paperback, 400 pages {{ISBN|0-06-098434-1}} {{ISBN|978-0060984342}}</ref> Clinical studies have shown that low-dose growth hormone (GH) treatment for adults with GH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing [[muscle]] mass, decreasing fat mass, and increasing [[bone]] density and muscle strength. It also improves [[cardiovascular]] parameters (i.e. decrease of [[LDL cholesterol]]) and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexopoulou O, Abs R, Maiter D |title=Treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: who, why and how?

==Scientific approaches==
[[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontology]] is a scientific discipline which has the same area of interest but, as a branch of [[gerontology]], takes a more conservative approach.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jaging.2008.05.010 | volume=22 | title=Anti-aging science: The emergence, maintenance, and enhancement of a discipline | year=2008 | journal=Journal of Aging Studies | pages=295–303 | last1 = Fishman | first1 = Jennifer R.| issue=4 | pmid=23264719 | pmc=3528075 }}</ref> [[Calorie restriction|Caloric Restriction]] is a phenomenon introduced in anti-aging techniques which focuses on depletion of calories and taking the right amount of nutrients necessary for growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Everitt|first1=Arthur V.|last2=Couteur|first2=DAVID G.

=== Calorie Restriction ===
Calorie Restriction (CR) refers to a dietary restriction that focuses on less calorie intake to increase longevity and reduce the age-related diseases in humans. Calorie restriction maintains a low-calorie intake that helps to regulate the rate of aging and increases the youthfulness of an individual or animal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sohal|first1=Rajindar S.|last2=Forster|first2=Michael J.|date=2014-08-01|title=Caloric restriction and the aging process: a critique|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584914002317|journal=Free Radical Biology and Medicine|language=en|volume=73|pages=366–382|doi=10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.05.015|pmid=24941891|pmc=4111977|issn=0891-5849|doi-access=free}}</ref> Low-Calorie intake has directly been correlated to negative energy balance which promotes low Body Mass Index (BMI) and comparatively high plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for improved life expectancy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Caloric Restriction, the Traditional Okinawan Diet, and Healthy Aging: The Diet of the World's Longest-Lived People and Its Potential Impact on Morbidity and Life Span|last1=Bj|first1=Willcox|last2=Dc|first2=Willcox|date=October 2007|language=en|pmid=17986602|last3=H|first3=Todoriki|last4=A|first4=Fujiyoshi|last5=K|first5=Yano|last6=Q|first6=He|last7=Jd|first7=Curb|last8=M|first8=Suzuki|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 1114|issue = 1|pages = 434|doi = 10.1196/annals.1396.037|bibcode = 2007NYASA1114..434W}}</ref> Calorie Restriction has widely been practiced by pregnant women and people with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes.

==Mass movement==
A substantial fraction of older people, taking their cue from [[alternative medicine]], purchase and use [[herbal supplement]]s and other products which promise relief from the incidents and dangers of aging. Some products are not effective while others hold promise.<!--<ref>http://bit.ly/1N88Sv5</ref>--><ref>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d011129.pdf 'Health Products for Seniors:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106233742/http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d011129.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }} "Anti-Aging" Products Pose Danger for Physical and Economic Harm' report by the [[General Accounting Office|GAO]] September, 2001</ref>

== Reception ==
There are at least two opposite views on the prospects of anti-aging research and development. One group states that there is a great deal of over-heated rhetoric in use with respect to [[life extension]] with over-optimistic projections on the part of its advocates.

Though some scientists think curing aging is impossible, there are some criticisms of both the time frame life extensionists envision (the first, perhaps somewhat crude, treatments within the next several decades, or at least before the beginning of the 22nd century) and of whether curing aging is even desirable. Common criticisms of the idea of life extension are fears it will cause the world to be more [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]]; however, De Grey counters that by saying that since [[menopause]] would also be delayed, women could wait longer to have children and, thus, the rate of growth would actually ''decline'' as a result. Also, the slowly growing population would buy centuries of time to figure out new places to live, such as [[space colonies]].<ref>Gavrilov, Rejuvenation Res. 2010 Apr; 13(2-3): 329–334.
