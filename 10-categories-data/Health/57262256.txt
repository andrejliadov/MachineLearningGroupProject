'''Number 16''' (1974 – 2016), also known as '''#16''',<ref name=2018paper/> was a wild female [[armored trapdoor spider|trapdoor spider]] (''[[Gaius villosus]],'' family [[Idiopidae]]) that lived in North Bungulla Reserve near [[Tammin, Western Australia]]. She died in 2016, at an estimated age of 43 years, and is the longest-lived [[spider]] recorded to date.<ref name=2018paper/> Number 16 did not die of old age, but was most likely killed by a parasitic [[spider wasp|wasp]] sting.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/30/worlds-oldest-known-spider-dies-at-43-after-a-quiet-life-underground/|title=World's oldest known spider dies at 43 after a quiet life underground|first=Agence |last=France-Presse|date=30 April 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

==Long-term monitoring==
Number 16 was born in 1974, and was studied in the wild by arachnologist [[Barbara York Main]] from March 1974 until 2016.<ref name=2018paper>{{cite journal|last1=Mason|first1=Leanda Denise|last2=Wardell-Johnson|first2=Grant|last3=Main|first3=Barbara York|title=The longest-lived spider: mygalomorphs dig deep, and persevere|journal=Pacific Conservation Biology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=203|date=2018|doi=10.1071/PC18015|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2018/04/27/farewell-no-16-scientists-left-miserable-worlds-oldest-spider/|title=Farewell, No. 16: scientists left 'miserable' after world's oldest spider dies aged 43|first=Henry|last=Bodkin|date=27 April 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/number-16-worlds-oldest-known-spider-dies-aged-43-2676125|title=Number 16, World's Oldest Known Spider, Dies Aged 43|date=28 April 2018|website=ibtimes.com}}</ref> She was part of the first cohort of dispersing spiderlings to establish a burrow at the study site, and her burrow was the 16th to be marked with a peg.<ref name=2018paper/> By 1978, Main had tagged 101 burrows at the study site, within a few metres of each other.<ref name=WP/>

Number 16 spent her entire life in the same [[burrow]], which is typical for her species.<ref name=Guardian/> For over 40 years, her status was monitored by Main and her collaborators either six-monthly or annually.<ref name=2018paper/> As Number 16 became older, the researchers developed a tradition of always checking her burrow first when they visited the site.<ref name=WP/>

==Death==
On 31 October 2016, researcher Leanda Mason discovered Number 16's burrow in disrepair, and the spider missing.<ref name=WP>Avi Selk (2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/05/01/the-extraordinary-life-and-death-of-the-worlds-oldest-known-spider/ "The extraordinary life and death of the world’s oldest known spider"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 1 May 2018. Accessed 2 May 2018.</ref> The silk plug of her burrow had been pierced by a parasitic [[spider wasp]], suggesting that she had been parasitised, either before or after death.<ref name=2018paper/> During a survey six months earlier, Number 16 had been alive.<ref name=2018paper/> “She was cut down in her prime [...] It took a while to sink in, to be honest," said Mason.<ref name=WP/>  The spider's death received widespread publicity in late April 2018, with the publication of a research article in the journal ''[[Pacific Conservation Biology]]''.<ref name=2018paper/> Based on the burrow fidelity of females of her species, the researchers concluded with a "high level of certainty" that Number 16 was 43 years old at the time of her death.<ref name=2018paper/>
