Numerous studies have shown that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth have a higher rate of suicide attempts than do heterosexual youth.  The Suicide Prevention Resource Center synthesized these studies and estimated that between 5 and 10% of LGBT youth, depending on age and sex groups, have attempted suicide, a rate 1.5-3 times higher than heterosexual youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sprc.org/library/SPRC_LGBT_Youth.pdf |title=Preventing Suicide among Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Questioning Youth and Young Adults |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref>  A U.S. government study, titled ''Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide'', published in 1989, found that LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED334503&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED334503 |title=Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide |publisher=Eric.ed.gov |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref> This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to [[minority stress]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10851 |title=Definition of Bisexual suicide risk |publisher=Medterms.com |date=1999-10-27 |access-date=2011-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208215013/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10851 |archive-date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Meyer, IH |title=Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: conceptual issues and research evidence |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=5 |pages=674–97 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12956539 |pmc=2072932 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674}}</ref>  "More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year," making it "the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers."<ref name="Thetrevorproject.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher=Thetrevorproject.org |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref>

===Impact of same-sex marriage===
The establishment of the legal right of [[same-sex marriage]] in the United States is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth). In Denmark and Sweden, same-sex married couples have a higher suicide rate than opposite-sex married couples, though the discrepancy is trending toward disappearing.

==== United States ====
A study of nationwide data from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed an association between states that established same-sex marriage and reduced rates of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12, with a rate reduction in all schoolchildren (LGB and non-LGB youth) in grades 9–12 declining by 7% and a rate reduction among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth) in grades 9–12 of 14%, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from 1 state in 2004 to all 50 states in 2015) allowed the researchers to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that "laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future".<ref>{{cite web|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258|website=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|Journal of the American Medical Association: Pediatrics]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Marriage Legalization Linked to Reduction in Suicide Attempts Among High School Students|url=https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2017/same-sex-marriage-legalization-linked-to-reduction-in-suicide-attempts-among-high-school-students.html|website=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|date=February 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Study: Teen suicide attempts fell as same-sex marriage was legalized|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/20/teen-suicide-down-as-same-sex-marriage-legalized-study/98179684/|website=[[USA Today]]|date=February 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage laws linked to fewer youth suicide attempts, new study says|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/same-sex-marriage-fewer-youth-suicide|website=[[PBS]]|date=February 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage laws tied to fewer teen suicide attempts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pediatrics-suicide-lgbt/same-sex-marriage-laws-tied-to-fewer-teen-suicide-attempts-idUSKBN1612SP|website=[[Reuters]]|date=February 23, 2017}}</ref> Other research shows that while this nationwide study has shown an association between states that established same-sex marriage and reduced rates of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12, it does not show causation.<ref>{{cite web|title= Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage and Drop in Adolescent Suicide Rates: Association but Not Causation|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2643166|website=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|Journal of the American Medical Association: Pediatrics]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Legalization of Same-Sex Marriage and Drop in Adolescent Suicide Rates: Association but Not Causation—Reply|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2643167|website=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|Journal of the American Medical Association: Pediatrics]]}}</ref>

==== Denmark and Sweden ====
In [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]], adults in same-sex marriages are still more likely to commit suicide than those in opposite-sex marriages; however, the suicide rate for all married people (for both same-sex and opposite-sex marriages) has been decreasing and equalizing. Those who entered same-sex marriages in the past (between 1989–2002) were 2.8 times more likely to commit suicide than those who entered opposite-sex marriages, while those who entered same-sex marriages more recently (between 2003–2016) were only 1.5 times more likely than opposite-sex married people to kill themselves. Those who entered opposite-sex marriages in the more recent time bracket had a suicide rate 28% lower than for those who entered marriages in the earlier time bracket.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Erlangsen|first1=Annette|last2=Drefahl|first2=Sven|last3=Haas|first3=Ann|last4=Bjorkenstam|first4=Charlotte|last5=Nordentoft|first5=Merete|last6=Andersson|first6=Gunnar|title=Suicide among persons who entered same-sex and opposite-sex marriage in Denmark and Sweden, 1989–2016: a binational, register-based cohort study|url=https://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2019/11/01/jech-2019-213009|journal=J Epidemiol Community Health|volume=74|issue=1|pages=78–83|language=en|doi=10.1136/jech-2019-213009|issn=0143-005X|pmid=31722984|pmc=6929702|year=2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.suda.su.se/about-us/press-media-news/excess-suicide-rate-among-same-sex-married-is-decreasing-in-the-nordic-countries-1.462698|title=Excess suicide rate among same-sex married is decreasing in the Nordic countries - SUDA|last=Leila Zoubir|website=www.suda.su.se|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.queerty.com/legalizing-sex-marriage-leads-big-drop-gay-suicide-rate-20191114|title=Legalizing same-sex marriage leads to big drop in gay suicide rate|last=Hudson|first=David|date=2019-11-14|website=Queerty|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>

==Developmental psychology perspectives==
The [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that biological vulnerabilities predispose individuals to different conditions such as [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and mental health conditions like [[major depression]], a risk factor for [[suicide]].  Varying amounts of environmental stress increase the probability that these individuals will develop that condition. [[Minority stress]] theory suggests that minority status leads to increased discrimination from the social environment which leads to greater stress and health problems.  In the presence of poor emotion regulation skills this can lead to poor mental health.  Also, the [[differential susceptibility hypothesis]] suggests that for some individuals their physical and mental development is highly dependent on their environment in a "for-better-and-for-worse" fashion.  That is, individuals who are highly susceptible will have better than average health in highly supportive environments and significantly worse than average health in hostile, violent environments.  The model can help explain the unique health problems affecting LGBT populations including increased suicide attempts.  For adolescents, the most relevant environments are the family, neighborhood, and school. Adolescent bullying - which is highly prevalent among sexual minority youths - is a chronic stressor that can increase risk for suicide via the [[diathesis-stress model]]. In a study of American lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents, Mark Hatzenbuehler examined the effect of the county-level social environment.<ref>{{citation |year=2011 |journal=Pediatrics |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=896–903 |title= The Social Environment and Suicide Attempts inLesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-3020|pmid=21502225 |pmc=3081186 |last1=Hatzenbuehler |first1=M. L. }}</ref>  This was indexed by the proportion of same-sex couples and Democrats living in the counties.  Also included were the proportions of schools with gay-straight alliances as well as anti-bullying and antidiscrimination policies that include [[sexual orientation]].  He found that a more conservative social environment elevated risk in suicidal behavior among all youth and that this effect was stronger for LGB youth.  Furthermore, he found that the social environment partially mediated the relation between LGB status and suicidal behaviour. Hatzenbuehler found that even after such social as well as individual factors were controlled for, however, that "LGB status remained a significant predictor of suicide attempts."

==Institutionalized and internalized homophobia==
Institutionalized and internalized [[homophobia]] may also lead LGBT youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.<ref>Gibson, P.

Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to [[bullying]] which can take many forms. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other [[verbal abuse]]. [[Cyber bullying]] involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other [[social media]] networks. Sexual bullying is inappropriate touching, lewd gestures or jokes.<ref>{{cite web|first=Janice L. |last=Habuda |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |title=Students learn about bullying |publisher=Buffalonews.com |date=2010-10-29 |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref>

Bullying may be considered a "[[rite of passage]]",<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volumes 1-4 |first=David |last=Levinson |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofcr0004unse/page/137 137] |isbn=9780761922582 |year=2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofcr0004unse/page/137 }}</ref> but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. "Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals", and "almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)") according to [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'s ''Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools''.<ref name="Thetrevorproject.org"/>

===The Trevor Project===
[[The Trevor Project]] is an American [[nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] founded in 1998 focused on [[suicide prevention]] efforts among [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]] and [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] ([[LGBTQ]]) youth. Through a [[toll-free telephone number]], it operates The Trevor Lifeline, a confidential service that offers trained counselors. The stated goals of the project are to provide crisis intervention and suicide prevention services for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25, as well as to offer guidance and resources to parents and educators.<ref name="About Trevor">[http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/organization About Trevor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020135304/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/organization |date=October 20, 2010 }}</ref>

===The Friend-Ship Project===
The charity [[Youmanity]] introduced an annual suicide prevention campaign called [https://www.youmanity.today/en/awards/2020-photography-award-friend-ship-2.html Friend-Ship] to help fight social isolation - a contributing factor to people taking their own life. Friend-Ship invites people to connect with family and friends, take a screenshot that embodies this treasured connection, to submit screenshots to the charity. Images are then showcased online to celebrate the value of friendship and reclaim the importance of human connection.

==Policy responses==
A number of policy options have been repeatedly proposed to address this issue. Some advocate intervention at the stage in which youth are already suicidal (such as crisis hotlines), while others advocate programs directed at increasing LGBT youth access to factors found to be "protective" against suicide (such as social support networks or mentors).

One proposed option is to provide LGBT-sensitivity and anti-bullying training to current middle and high school counselors and teachers. Citing a study by Jordan et al., school psychologist Anastasia Hansen notes that hearing teachers make homophobic remarks or fail to intervene when students make such remarks are both positively correlated with negative feelings about an LGBT identity<ref name="eric.ed.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ776677&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ776677 |title=Hansen, Anastasia. "School-Based Support for GLBT Students: A Review of Three Levels of Research." ''Psychology in the Schools.'' 44.8(2007). 839-848 |publisher=Eric.ed.gov:80 |access-date=2011-08-21}}</ref>  Conversely, a number of researchers have found the presence of LGBT-supportive school staff to be related to "positive outcomes for LGBT youth".<ref name="eric.ed.gov" /> Citing a 2006 Psychology in the Schools report, The Trevor Project notes that "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) youth who believe they have just one school staff member with whom they can talk about problems are only 1/3 as likely as those without that support to... report making multiple suicide attempts in the past year."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/sites/default/files/educatorresourceguide.pdf |title=EDUCATOR RESOURCE GUIDE  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807234654/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/sites/default/files/educatorresourceguide.pdf |archive-date=August 7, 2012|publisher=The Trevor Project}}</ref>

Another frequently proposed policy option involves providing grant incentives for schools to create and/or support Gay-Straight Alliances, student groups dedicated to providing a social support network for LGBT students. Kosciw and Diaz, researchers for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, found in a nationwide survey that "students in schools with a GSA were less likely to feel unsafe, less likely to miss school, and more likely to feel that they belonged at their school than students in schools with no such clubs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/binary-data/GLSEN_ATTACHMENTS/file/585-1.pdf |title=2005 NSCS Final v6.pdf |access-date=2011-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618161552/http://www.glsen.org/binary-data/GLSEN_ATTACHMENTS/file/585-1.pdf|archive-date=2006-06-18}}</ref>  Studies have shown that social isolation and [[marginalization]] at school are psychologically damaging to LGBT students, and that GSAs and other similar peer-support group can be effective providers of this "[[psychosocial recovery|psychosocial support]]".<ref name="eric.ed.gov"/>

===Early interventions for LGBT youth===
====Be proactive and understanding====
Educators can be proactive in helping adolescents with gender identity and the questions/issues that sometimes come with them. Nornalising education about sexualities and genders can help prevent adolescents from resorting to suicide, drug abuse, homelessness, and many more psychological problems.  Van Wormer & McKinney (2003)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van Wormer | first1 = K | last2 = McKinney | first2 = R | year = 2003 | title = What schools can do to help gay/lesbian/bisexual youth: A harm reduction approach | journal = Adolescence | volume = 38 | issue = 151| pages = 409–420 }}</ref> relate that understanding LGBT students is the first step to suicide prevention.  They use a harm reduction approach, which meets students where they are to reduce any continued harm linked with their behaviors.  They relate that creating a supportive and culturally diverse environment is crucial to social acceptance in an educational setting.

====LGBT role models/resources====
It is beneficial to hire LGBT teachers to serve as role models and support LGBT students. Many of the resources in the U.S. are crisis-driven- not prevention-driven. In order to prevent suicide for LGBT adolescents, it needs to be the other way around. Furthermore, studies show that counselors and teachers need to be trained in self-awareness, sexuality and [[sexual diversity]] with themselves and with students. Researchers also suggest inviting gay/lesbian and bisexual panels from colleges or universities to conduct classroom discussions.  Education and resources is key to helping LGBT students and families. According to researcher [[Rob Cover]], role models and resources benefit LGBT youth only if they avoid replicating stereotypes and provide diverse visual and narrative representations to allow broad identification.<ref>Cover, Rob. (2012). Queer Youth Suicide, Culture and Identity: Unliveable Lives? Ashgate, {{ISBN|9781409444473}}</ref>

Having a PFLAG (Parents Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) and GSA Club are possible resources to promote discussions and leadership roles to LGBT students.  These resources extend outside of school and in the community.  (Greytak, E. A., Kosciw, J. G., & Boesen, M. J. 2013) report that when schools have a GSA or Gay Straight Alliance club or a club promoting social awareness and camaraderie of sorts, supportive educators, inclusive curricula, and comprehensive policies that LGBT students were victimized less and had more positive school experiences. Students will feel positive and want to be in school.

====Teach tolerance and examine a school's climate====
Examine a school's climate and teach tolerance – Teaching Tolerance is a movement, magazine and website which gives many tools and ideas to help people be tolerant of one another.  It demonstrates that the classroom is a reflection of the world around us.  Educators can use Teach Tolerance's website and book to download resources and look up creative ways to learn more about LGBT students and teaching tolerance to their students in the classroom.  It helps schools get started with anti-bullying training and professional development and resource suggestions.  It even relates common roadblocks and tips to starting a GSA club.

Research shows that a collaborative effort must be made in order to prevent LGBT students from being bullied and/or committing suicide.  Teachers, administrators, students, families, and communities need to come together to help LGBT students be confident.  Each school has its own individuality, its own sense of "self", whether it be the teachers, administrators, students, or the surrounding community.  In order to tackle the issue of bullying for LGBT students it needs to start with understanding the student population and demographic where the school lies. Educating students, faculty, staff, and school boards on LGBT issues and eliminating homophobia and trans phobia in schools, training staff on diversity acceptance and bullying prevention, and implementing Gay-Straight Alliances is key to suicide prevention for LGBT students (Bacon, Laura Ann 2011).<ref>Bacon, Laura Ann, "A Study of Effective Strategies, Programs, and Policies for School Leaders in Protecting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth from Peer Victimization" (2011). Electronic Theses & Dissertations. Paper 380.</ref>  Adolescents grow and are shaped by many factors including internal and external features (Swearer, Espelage, Vaillancourt, & Hymel, 2010).

The school climate must foster respect. Thus, setting the tone for administration, teachers, professionals who enter the building, parents and most importantly the students.  People, in general, need to understand their own misconceptions and stereotypes of what being LGBT is. Unless students and adults are educated on the LGBT community, than stereotypes and negative attitudes will continue to exist (Knotts, G., & Gregorio, D. 2011).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Knotts | first1 = G. | last2 = Gregorio | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Confronting homophobia at school: High school students and the gay men's chorus of Los Angeles | journal = Journal of LGBT Youth | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 66–83 | doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.519193| s2cid = 144391118 }}</ref>  The GMCLA (Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles) use music and singing as a vehicle for changing the attitudes and hearts of people in schools nationwide.  Their goal is to bring music to standards-driven curriculum to youth with the purpose of teaching content in innovative and meaningful ways.  They instill in students and staff techniques to foster positive meaning of the social and personal issues dealt with in school and society.

Gay, L. (2009) has generated a guide to helping school safety/climate and fostering positive interpersonal relationships through "The Safe Space Kit".<ref>Gay, L. (2009). The Safe Space Kit: Guide to Being an Ally to LGBT Students. Gay, Lesbian And Straight Education Network (GLSEN)</ref>  This tool helps teachers create a safe space for LGBT students.  One of the most effective ways for an educator to create a safe space is to be a supportive ally to LGBT students.  This kit has numerous tools for teachers and schools to utilize, including: a hard copy of "The Safe Space Kit" includes the "Guide to Being an Ally", stickers and two Safe Space posters.  Even utilizing something just to promote awareness, such as using "The Safe Space Kit" could be a good first step for schools to promote responsiveness to LGBT students.  Providing some supports rather than none at all can benefit LGBT youth tremendously now and in the future (Greytak, et al. 2013).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greytak | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Kosciw | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Boesen | first3 = M. J. | year = 2013 | title = Putting the "T" in "Resource": The Benefits of LGBT-Related School Resources for Transgender Youth | journal = Journal of LGBT Youth | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 45–63 | doi=10.1080/19361653.2012.718522| s2cid = 144399587 }}</ref>

====OBPP (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program)====
OBPP is an anti-bullying program designed by psychologist [[Dan Olweus]] utilized in schools in Europe, Canada and the U.S. Reductions in bullying were due to parent training, playground supervision, home-school communication, classroom rules, and training videos.  Furthermore, Swearer, et al. (2010) discuss a "dosage effect" in which the more positive and consistent elements included in a program, the more the likelihood that bullying would decrease.  Success in one school does not guarantee success in another because each school has its own social climate.  The OBPP is effective but still needs to be analyzed further, since there are many things to consider when implementing this technique within a large school.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Steps To Respect====
Steps To Respect is an anti-bullying campaign which can be beneficial in schools as well – it is a comprehensive guide for teachers, administrators, and students utilizing in class lessons and training helping schools foster positive social-emotional skills and conflict resolution.  If schools are able to change peer conduct and norms, increase student communication skills, and maintain adult prevention and intervention efforts, the positive effects of their work will strengthen over time (Frey, Edstrom & Hirschstein 2005)<ref>Steps to Respect (Frey, Edstrom and Hirschstein 2005; Frey et al. 2005; Hirschtein et al. 20070; category 6</ref> and continue to grow as each class progresses through the school system.

====Make curriculum changes====
According to Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., & Manke, E. (2006),<ref name="Russel 2006">Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., & Manke, E. (2006). LGBT Student Safety: Steps Schools Can Take.(California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 3) San Francisco, CA: California Safe Schools Coalition</ref> it is imperative for educators to make subject and age appropriate lessons with LGBT issues incorporated into the curriculum on a consistent basis utilizing current events, history, literature, or social sciences. Teachers should be trained each year on new practices to employ in their classrooms and in school in general.  They should be taught how to handle situations they may face with LGBT students, so that if a problem should arise, they will be confident in their own understandings of the LGBT community and know how to handle any question or situation professionally and empathetically.  Russell, et al. (2006) report that state policy and government officials need to be mindful of the ever-changing culture we live in by enforcing and including material appropriate in schools to educate educators on LGBT people in the world.<ref name="Russel 2006"/>

Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012)<ref>Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012). Lessons That Matter: LGBTQ Inclusivity and School Safety. (GayStraight Alliance Network and California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 14). San Francisco, CA: Gay-Straight Alliance Network.</ref> relate numerous lessons, which each subject area teacher can teach to enforce LGBT inclusivity and school safety.  They report that lessons, which promote LGBT inclusivity, can have the greatest impact on school safety. Physical education, health, history, and social studies teachers can educate all students to have more social awareness and create a positive school climate.  They continue to note that inviting parents, teachers, administrators and other key stakeholders to identify and/or participate in the development of age-appropriate LGBT-inclusive lessons that teachers can use in their classrooms is most beneficial.

Educators must continue to try new trends, constantly assessing the environment of their school.  The best policies and interventions are those, which show positive growth across grade levels.  Research should continue to see which programs suit the needs of different schools over a period of time.  Since each school varies in many ways, it may be hard to report positive trends.  One technique that works in one school may or may not work for another. Therefore, taking pieces of one technique and making it into something that molds best to each school and environment is key.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
