==Christianity==
Throughout the history of Christianity, attitudes towards disability have varied greatly.
===The Bible===
In parts of the Bible physical disability is portrayed as a punishment for sinners. In the New Testament, [[Jesus]] is often shown performing [[miracles of Jesus|miraculous healing those with disabilities]], although some believe Jesus still referred to sin as the cause of physical disability.<ref name="OtienoDSQ">{{cite journal |last1=Otieno |first1=Pauline A. |title=Biblical and Theological Perspectives on Disability: Implications on the Rights of Persons with Disability in Kenya |journal=Disability Studies Quarterly |date=5 November 2009 |volume=29 |issue=4 |language=en |issn=2159-8371 |doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i4.988|doi-access=free }}</ref> The Bible makes no reference to [[intellectual disability]]<ref name="YongDisability">{{cite book |last1=Yong |first1=Amos |title=Theology and Down Syndrome: Reimagining Disability in Late Modernity |date=2007 |publisher=Baylor University Press |location=Waco |pages=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1WFwF53G3cC&q=The+Bible%2C+Disability%2C+and+the+Church%3A+A+New+Vision+of+the+People+of+God |accessdate=8 December 2018|isbn=9781602580060 }}</ref>
Contrast this perspective to Christ healing the man born blind (John 9:1-12), where Jesus challenged the view that disability was punishment for sin.
“His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" Jesus replied: Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.”

===Early Christianity===
In the [[Middle Ages]], there were two prevailing approaches to those with disabilities. Some priests and scholars took the view that disability was a punishment from God for committing sins, as is often described in the Bible. Others believed that those with disabilities were more pious than non-disabled people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Metzler |first1=Irina |title=Disability in Medieval Europe: Thinking about physical impairment during the high Middle Ages, c.1100-1400 |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-415-36503-1 |pages=46–47}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Martin Luther]] held the view that disability was caused by sin, and is recorded to have recommended to the Prince of Dessau that a young boy with disabilities be drowned. When this suggestion was rebuked, Luther told the prince that Christians should pray for the [[Devil]] to be removed from the boy every day.<ref name="McKennaDisabilityandReligion">{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Adrian |title=In Dependent Bodies: Exploring a Christian Understanding of Disability |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3USCywb4mcgJ:https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/AMcKennaBodies.pdf+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com |publisher=Royal College of Psychiatry |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>

===Contemporary Christianity===
Disability is still linked with sin in some denominations of the church and in some cultures where Christianity is the predominant religion.<ref name="McKennaDisabilityandReligion"/> In [[Ghana]], people with mental illnesses and neurological disorders are routinely sent to [[prayer camps]] that are linked with [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, to try to overcome their disorder. Prayer camps have been condemned by [[Human Rights Watch]] because of the way that people in prayer camps are often treated. Human Rights Watch reports that people living in prayer camps are subject to being chained to objects for prolonged periods, being deprived of food and poor sanitation.<ref name="HRWDisabilityAndRelgion">{{cite web |title="Like a Death Sentence" {{!}} Abuses against Persons with Mental Disabilities in Ghana |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/10/02/death-sentence/abuses-against-persons-mental-disabilities-ghana |website=Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=5 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="BarringaDisabilityAndReligion">{{cite news |last1=Barriga |first1=Shantha Rau |title=The (in)human dimension of Ghana's prayer camps |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/openglobalrights/shantha-rau-barriga/inhuman-dimension-of-ghana%E2%80%99s-prayer-camps |accessdate=5 January 2019 |work=openDemocracy |publisher=OpenDemocracy |date=9 October 2014 |language=en}}</ref> Christians with disabilities also report feeling unwelcome when attending church.

==Buddhism==
===Buddhist religious texts===

==Christianity==
Throughout the history of Christianity, attitudes towards disability have varied greatly.
===The Bible===
In parts of the Bible physical disability is portrayed as a punishment for sinners. In the New Testament, [[Jesus]] is often shown performing [[miracles of Jesus|miraculous healing those with disabilities]], although some believe Jesus still referred to sin as the cause of physical disability.<ref name="OtienoDSQ">{{cite journal |last1=Otieno |first1=Pauline A. |title=Biblical and Theological Perspectives on Disability: Implications on the Rights of Persons with Disability in Kenya |journal=Disability Studies Quarterly |date=5 November 2009 |volume=29 |issue=4 |language=en |issn=2159-8371 |doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i4.988|doi-access=free }}</ref> The Bible makes no reference to [[intellectual disability]]<ref name="YongDisability">{{cite book |last1=Yong |first1=Amos |title=Theology and Down Syndrome: Reimagining Disability in Late Modernity |date=2007 |publisher=Baylor University Press |location=Waco |pages=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T1WFwF53G3cC&q=The+Bible%2C+Disability%2C+and+the+Church%3A+A+New+Vision+of+the+People+of+God |accessdate=8 December 2018|isbn=9781602580060 }}</ref>
Contrast this perspective to Christ healing the man born blind (John 9:1-12), where Jesus challenged the view that disability was punishment for sin.
“His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?" Jesus replied: Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.”

===Early Christianity===
In the [[Middle Ages]], there were two prevailing approaches to those with disabilities. Some priests and scholars took the view that disability was a punishment from God for committing sins, as is often described in the Bible. Others believed that those with disabilities were more pious than non-disabled people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Metzler |first1=Irina |title=Disability in Medieval Europe: Thinking about physical impairment during the high Middle Ages, c.1100-1400 |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-415-36503-1 |pages=46–47}}</ref> Furthermore, [[Martin Luther]] held the view that disability was caused by sin, and is recorded to have recommended to the Prince of Dessau that a young boy with disabilities be drowned. When this suggestion was rebuked, Luther told the prince that Christians should pray for the [[Devil]] to be removed from the boy every day.<ref name="McKennaDisabilityandReligion">{{cite web |last1=McKenna |first1=Adrian |title=In Dependent Bodies: Exploring a Christian Understanding of Disability |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3USCywb4mcgJ:https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/AMcKennaBodies.pdf+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com |publisher=Royal College of Psychiatry |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>

===Contemporary Christianity===
Disability is still linked with sin in some denominations of the church and in some cultures where Christianity is the predominant religion.<ref name="McKennaDisabilityandReligion"/> In [[Ghana]], people with mental illnesses and neurological disorders are routinely sent to [[prayer camps]] that are linked with [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches, to try to overcome their disorder. Prayer camps have been condemned by [[Human Rights Watch]] because of the way that people in prayer camps are often treated. Human Rights Watch reports that people living in prayer camps are subject to being chained to objects for prolonged periods, being deprived of food and poor sanitation.<ref name="HRWDisabilityAndRelgion">{{cite web |title="Like a Death Sentence" {{!}} Abuses against Persons with Mental Disabilities in Ghana |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/10/02/death-sentence/abuses-against-persons-mental-disabilities-ghana |website=Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=5 January 2019 |language=en |date=2 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="BarringaDisabilityAndReligion">{{cite news |last1=Barriga |first1=Shantha Rau |title=The (in)human dimension of Ghana's prayer camps |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/openglobalrights/shantha-rau-barriga/inhuman-dimension-of-ghana%E2%80%99s-prayer-camps |accessdate=5 January 2019 |work=openDemocracy |publisher=OpenDemocracy |date=9 October 2014 |language=en}}</ref> Christians with disabilities also report feeling unwelcome when attending church.
