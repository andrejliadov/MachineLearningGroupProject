'''High-altitude flatus expulsion''' ('''HAFE''') is a [[gastrointestinal]] syndrome which involves the spontaneous passage of increased quantities of [[rectal gases]] at high altitudes.<ref name="pmid18748805">{{cite journal |author=[[Paul Auerbach|Auerbach Paul]], Miller YE |title=High Altitude Flatus Expulsion (HAFE) |journal=West.

The phenomenon is based on the differential in atmospheric pressure, directly correlated with the observer's frequency of and level of experience in high-altitude metabolism. As the external pressure decreases, the difference in pressure between the gas within the body and the atmosphere outside is higher, and the urge to expel gas to relieve the pressure is greater. Consistent with [[Boyle's law]], controlling for dietary variance, the amount of gas produced is constant in mass, but the volume increases as the external pressure decreases.

The feeling of fullness or need to expel brought on by this differential in atmospheric pressure has been verified by studies involving military pilots subjected to pressure changes simulating flight.<ref name="pmid5765206">{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenwald AJ, Allen TH, Bancroft RW |title=Abdominal gas volume at altitude and at ground level |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=177–81 |date=February 1969 |pmid=5765206 |doi= 10.1152/jappl.1969.26.2.177|url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=5765206 |access-date=2009-03-05}}</ref>
