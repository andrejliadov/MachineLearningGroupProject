'''Hyperreligiosity''' is a psychiatric disturbance in which a person experiences intense religious beliefs or episodes that interfere with normal functioning.  Hyperreligiosity generally includes [[delusions|abnormal beliefs]] and a focus on religious content or even atheistic content,<ref name="HeilmanMD2011" /> which interferes with work and social functioning.  Hyperreligiosity may occur in a variety of disorders including [[epilepsy]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tucker|first1=D. M.|last2=Novelly|first2=R. A.|last3=Walker|first3=P.

Also can refer to the result of strong sectarian indoctrination, which may influence cognition and/or cause thought distortions, often marked with irrational or egregious reasoning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Signs and symptoms==

Hyperreligiosity is characterized by an increased tendency to report supernatural or mystical experiences, spiritual delusions, rigid legalistic thoughts,{{cn|date=June 2019}} and extravagant expression of piety.<ref name="volume">{{cite journal|last1=Wuerfel|first1=J.|last2=Krishnamoorthy|first2=E.

This "typical personality" of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer & Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky & Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}</ref>
