==United States==
In the [[United States]], disability benefits for most Americans are covered and paid for by the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Administration]] (a government agency). There are two main programs administered by the SSA; Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. There is also a specific program for children with disabilities.

[[Social Security Disability Insurance]] provides benefits to individuals who have worked and paid Social Security taxes. Insurance eligibility is dependent upon Quarters of Coverage (QCs), commonly called "work credits". These are allotted based on the earnings for each [[Calendar year#Quarters|quarter]] the individual has worked.<ref>{{cite web |title=Quarter of Coverage |url=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/QC.html |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Work credits ensure  coverage until they "expire" on the individual's Date Last Insured (DLI).

[[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) provides benefits to low-income individuals who are disabled and unable to work, regardless of whether they have worked in the past. Individuals must meet income and resource requirements.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Eligibility |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |language=en}}</ref> SSI also provides benefits to children under 18 years old, who are disabled and whose parents or guardians have limited income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI for Children |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-child-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The monthly SSI payment is calculated based upon the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR), and the individual's income.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI)-- SSI Income |url=https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-income-ussi.htm |website=Social Security Administration |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Most SSI recipients are immediately eligible for [[Medicaid]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Disability & Medicaid coverage |url=https://www.healthcare.gov/people-with-disabilities/ssi-and-medicaid/ |website=HealthCare.gov |language=en}}</ref> and [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program]] (SNAP),<ref>{{cite web |title=SNAP Special Rules for the Elderly or Disabled |url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/snap-special-rules-elderly-or-disabled |website=Food and Nutrition Service |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> though program requirements vary by state.

== Canada ==

In Canada, there are a variety of public [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/disability.html Disability Benefit Programs]. The largest programs are the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, and provincial [[workers' compensation]] and [[social assistance]] programs. Some individuals, in addition, have private disability insurance coverage, purchased either individually, or through an employer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref> Different programs use different rules to decide whether or not someone is eligible for benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/living-disability/disability-benefits.html|title=Disability benefits - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Financial Consumer Agency of|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>

=== Canada Pension Plan (CPP) / Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) Disability Benefits ===

To access [[Canada Pension Plan]] or the Quebec Pension Plan disability benefits, an individual needs to have a disability that is "severe and prolonged", and which prevents them from working on a regular basis. As of 2018, CPP disability benefits are a minimum of $485.20 a month. Individuals who have contributed more to CPP or QPP during their working career receive higher benefits. The average monthly CPP disability benefit was $971.23 in 2018 and the maximum monthly amount was $1,335.83.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/benefit-amount.html|title=Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit – How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>

People receiving CPP disability benefits may earn up to $5,500 a year without losing their benefits.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp/cpp-disability-benefit/while-receiving.html |accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref> Benefits stop when an individual has the ability to work regularly, or is no longer disabled. When an individual reaches the age of 65, CPP Disability Benefits are replaced by a [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/publicpensions/cpp.html Retirement Pension].

=== Employment Insurance Sickness Benefit (EI Insurance) ===
[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html Employment Insurance] is a benefit plan that offers temporary financial assistance to those individuals who cannot work due to sickness, injury, or quarantine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

To be eligible to receive EI sickness benefits:

* The individual's earnings have been reduced by at least 60% 
* He/She is employed in insurable employment
* A minimum of 600 hours has been accumulated in the qualifying period <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

People are only eligible for these benefits if they are unable to work due to their sickness, injury, or quarantine, but would be able to work otherwise. To receive EI sickness benefit a medical certificate signed by the doctor is required.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

To qualify for EI you must have a required amount of insurable employment hours, which are used to calculate your benefit period, these insurable employment hours must be accumulated throughout the qualifying period.

The qualifying period:

* 52 week period before the EI claim date 
* Start date of previous EI benefit period to the start of the new date <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/eligibility.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - Eligibility - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

It is important to note that each individual's case is different and requirements may vary from case to case. But a general way of calculating EI benefits is 55% of the average insurable weekly earnings. The maximum amount you can be eligible for as of January 1, 2018 is $51,700. Typically EI sickness benefits can only be paid for up to 15 weeks, but can vary depending on how long the individual is unable to work.

Weekly EI sick benefits are calculated based on income before it has been deducted during the individuals “best weeks”. Best weeks are the weeks in which the individual earned the most amount, including any tips and commissions, the best weeks are chosen out of the qualifying period.

In Canada areas with high rates of unemployment will use the best 14 weeks, and in areas with low unemployment rates will use the best 35 weeks.

The weekly amount is calculated:

* Calculating total earnings amount from the accumulated best weeks 
* Based on the region the individual is in the number of best weeks to use will be decided 
* Divide the total earnings by the number of best weeks 
* The result is multiplied by 55% to get the weekly benefit <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

If you are considered a low income family you may be eligible to receive the EI Family Supplement. An individual can be considered to be a part of this category if the yearly family net income is $67, 921 or less, has children, and if the individual or their spouse receives Canada child tax benefit. If both the individual and their spouse claims EI sickness benefits only one of them can be eligible for the family supplement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness/benefit-amount.html|title=EI Sickness Benefit - How much could you receive - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>
