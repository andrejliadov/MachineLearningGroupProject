'''Behavior-altering parasites''' are [[parasite]]s with two or more hosts, capable of causing changes in the behavior of one of their [[Host (biology)|hosts]] to enhance their [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]], sometimes directly affecting the hosts' decision-making and behavior control mechanisms.

===Types===
Parasite manipulations can be either ''direct'' or ''indirect''. Indirect manipulation is the most frequent method used by behavior-altering parasites,<ref name="Adamo2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Adamo | first1 = S | year = 2002 | title = Modulating the Modulators: Parasites, Neuromodulators and Host Behavioral Change | journal = Brain, Behavior and Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 370–377 | doi = 10.1159/000067790 | pmid = 12563169 | s2cid = 8702062 }}</ref> while the direct approach is far less common. Direct manipulation is when the parasite itself affects the host and induces a behavioral response, for example by creating neuroactive compounds that stimulate a response in the host's central nervous system (CNS), a method mostly practiced by parasites that reside within the CNS.<ref name="tolv">{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = F. | last2 = Adamo | first2 = S. | last3 = Moore | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Parasitic manipulation: where are we and where should we go? | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 185–199 | doi = 10.1016/j.beproc.2004.06.010 | pmid = 15792688 | s2cid = 599951 }}</ref> Affecting the host's neural system is complicated and manipulation includes initiating immune cascades in the host.<ref name="tretton">{{cite journal | last1 = Tomonaga | first1 = K | year = 2004 | title = Virus-induced neurobehavioral disorders: mechanisms and implications | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 71–77 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2003.12.001 | pmc = 7128097 | pmid = 15102360 }}</ref> However, determination of the causative factor is difficult, especially whether the behavioral change is the result of direct manipulation from the parasite, or an indirect response of the host's [[immune system]].<ref name="tolv" /> A direct approach to behavioral manipulation is often very costly for the parasite,<ref name="tolv" /> which results in a trade-off between the benefits of the manipulation (e.g., fitness increase) and the energy it costs. The more common approach for parasites is to indirectly induce behavioral responses by interacting with the host's immune system<ref name="Adamo2002"/> to create the necessary neuroactive compounds to induce a desired behavioral response.<ref name="tolv" /> Parasites can also indirectly affect the behavior of their hosts by disturbing their [[metabolism]], [[developmental biology|development]] or immunity.<ref name="tolv" /> [[Parasitic castration|Parasitic castrators]] drastically modify their hosts' metabolism and reproduction, sometimes by secreting castrating hormones, changing their behavior and physiology to benefit the parasite.<ref name=poulin>{{cite book |last=Poulin |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |title=Evolutionary Ecology of Parasites - From individuals to communities |year=1997 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-412-79370-7 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaDVuLXoUNIC}}</ref>

===By viruses===

[[Rabies]] causes the host to be aggressive and prone to biting others. This along with increased salivation, which carries the virus, increases the chances of it spreading to new hosts. At the same time [[Aquaphobia|hydrophobia]] (fear of water)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies |title=Rabies |date=2019-09-27 |website=World Health Organization |language=en |access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> prevents the host from drinking, which would wash virus-laden saliva down into the stomach making it unavailable for infection by biting.

Viruses from the family ''[[Baculoviridae]]'' induce in their hosts changes to both feeding behavior and environment selection. They infect moth and butterfly caterpillars, who some time following infection begin to eat incessantly, providing nutrients for the virus's [[Viral replication|replication]]. When the virions (virus "units") are ready to leave the host, the caterpillar climbs higher and higher, until its cells are made to secrete enzymes that "dissolve the animal into goo", raining down clumps of tissue and viral material for ingestion by future hosts.<ref name="Mindsuckers">{{Cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |title=Mindsuckers - Meet Nature's Nightmare |work=National Geographic |date =November 2014 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/11/mindsuckers/zimmer-text}}</ref>

===By protozoa===

The protozoan ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' infects animals from the family [[Felidae]] (its ''[[definitive host]]''), and its [[Apicomplexan life cycle#Infectious stages|oocysts]] are shed with the host's feces. When a rodent consumes the fecal matter it gets infected with the parasite (becoming its ''[[intermediate host]]'').

Making the host careless increases the risk of it being eaten by a non-host predator, interrupting the parasite's life-cycle. Some parasites manipulate their intermediate host to reduce this risk. For example, the parasitic trematode ''[[Microphallus]]'' sp., uses the snail ''[[New Zealand mud snail|Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' as an intermediate host. The parasite manipulates the snail's foraging behavior to increase the chance of it being preyed upon by the parasite's definitive hosts ([[waterfowl]]). The infected snail forages on the upper side of rocks during the period of the day when waterfowl feed most intensely. During the rest of the day, the snail forages at the bottom of rocks to reduce the risk of being eaten by fish (non-hosts for the parasitic trematode).<ref name="sjutton">{{cite journal | last1 = Levri | first1 = E | year = 1998 | title = The Influence of Non-Host Predators on Parasite-Induced Behavioral Changes in a Freshwater Snail | journal = Oikos | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 531–537 | doi = 10.2307/3546773 | jstor = 3546773 }}</ref>

The lancet liver fluke (''[[Dicrocoelium dendriticum]]'') is a parasitic trematode with a complex life cycle. In its adult state it occurs in the liver of its definitive host ([[ruminant]]s), where it reproduces. The parasite eggs are passed with the [[feces]] of the host, which then are eaten by a terrestrial snail (first intermediate host). The fluke matures into a juvenile stage in the snail, which in an attempt to protect itself excretes the parasites in "slime-balls". The "slime-balls" are then consumed by ants (second intermediate hosts). The fluke manipulates the ant to move up to the top of grass, where they have a higher chance of being eaten by grazing ruminants.<ref name="Otranto2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Otranto | first1 = D. | last2 = Traversa | first2 = D. | year = 2002 | title = A review of dicrocoeliosis of ruminants including recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment | journal = Veterinary Parasitology | volume = 107 | issue = 4| pages = 317–335 | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4017(02)00121-8 | pmid = 12163243 }}</ref>

The parasitic nematode ''[[Myrmeconema neotropicum]]'' infects the intermediate ant host ''[[Cephalotes atratus]]''. The nematode then induces a morphological change in the ant, which turns the [[Gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]] color from black to red, making it resemble fruit. This color transition makes the ant susceptible to predation by [[frugivore|frugivorous]] birds, which act as the parasite's definitive hosts. The parasitic eggs are deposited in the bird's feces and are eaten by ants, which complete the cycle.<ref name="Yanoviak2008">{{cite journal | last1 = Yanoviak | first1 = S. | last2 = Kaspari | first2 = M. | last3 = Dudley | first3 = R. | last4 = Poinar | first4 = G. | year = 2008 | title = Parasite-Induced Fruit Mimicry in a Tropical Canopy Ant | journal = Am Nat | volume = 171 | issue = 4| pages = 536–544 | doi = 10.1086/528968 | pmid = 18279076 }}</ref>

Crickets infected by [[Nematomorpha|horsehair worms]] exhibit [[Phototaxis|light-seeking]] behavior and increased walking speed, leading them to open spaces and ponds (the surface of which reflects moonlight); the crickets will eventually find and enter a body of water, where the worm will wiggle out of the cricket's abdomen and swim away. While crickets often drown in the process, those who survive exhibit a partial recovery and return to normal activities in as little as 20 hours.<ref name="Fleur et al.">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1093/beheco/arq215 |pmid=22476265 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=392–400 |last1=Ponton |first1=Fleur |last2=Otálora-Luna |first2=Fernando |last3=Lefèvre |first3=Thierry |last4=Guerin |first4=Patrick M. |last5=Lebarbenchon |first5=Camille |last6=Duneau |first6=David |last7=Biron |first7=David G. |last8=Thomas |first8=Frédéric |title=Water-seeking behavior in worm-infected crickets and reversibility of parasitic manipulation |journal=Behavioral Ecology |date=2011-03-01 |pmc=3071748 }}</ref>

The trematode ''[[Leucochloridium paradoxum]]'' matures inside snails of the genus ''[[Succinea]]''.

''[[Schistocephalus solidus]]'' is a parasitic tapeworm with three different hosts, two intermediate and one definitive. In its adult stage the tapeworm resides in the intestine of [[piscivore|piscivorous]] birds, where they reproduce and release eggs through the bird's feces. Free-swimming larvae hatch from the eggs, which are in turn ingested by [[copepod]]s (the first intermediate host).

Several species of fly in the family [[Phoridae]] parasitise [[fire ant]]s. The fly injects an egg into the ant's thorax; upon hatching, the larva migrates into the ant's head, where it feeds on the ant's [[haemolymph]], muscle and nerve tissue. During this period some larvae direct the ant up to 50 meters away from the nest and towards a moist, leafy place where they can hatch safely.<ref name="zombie ants">{{Cite web |title="Zombie" Ants Controlled, Decapitated by Flies |work=National Geographic News |access-date=2017-10-10 |date=2009-05-14 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/05/photogalleries/zombie-ants/}}</ref><ref name="wild flyers">{{Cite episode|publisher=PBS|number=3|title=Crowded Skies|access-date=2017-10-10|date=2016-06-30|url=http://www.pbs.org/video/2365791097/|series=SuperNature - Wild Flyers}}</ref> Eventually the larva completely devours the ant's brain, which often falls off (hence the species nickname: "decapitating fly").<ref>{{Cite web |last=Malhotra |first=Richa |title=Phorid fly is the headhunter of the animal kingdom |work=BBC - Earth |access-date=2017-10-10 |date=2015-01-09 |url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150109-headhunters-of-the-animal-kingdom}}</ref> The larva then pupates in the empty head capsule, emerging as an adult fly after two weeks.<ref name="FWST">{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20090512/sc_mcclatchy/3231765 |title=Parasitic flies turn fire ants into zombies |last=Hanna |first=Bill |date=May 12, 2009 |publisher=Fort Worth Star-Telegram |access-date=2009-05-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522005217/http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20090512/sc_mcclatchy/3231765 |archive-date=May 22, 2009 }}</ref>

Members of the order ''[[Rhizocephala]]'' such as [[Sacculina carcini|S. carcini]] alter male hosts' hormonal balance, to encourage nurturing behavior similar to that seen in females.

==Evolutionary perspective==

===Addition of intermediate hosts===

For complex life cycles to emerge in parasites, the addition of intermediate host species must be beneficial, e.g., result in a higher [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].<ref name="sju">{{cite journal | last1 = Trail | first1 = D | year = 1980 | title = Behavioral Interactions between Parasites and Hosts: Host Suicide and the Evolution of Complex Life Cycles | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 116 | issue = 1| pages = 77–91 | doi = 10.1086/283612 | hdl = 1808/17548 | hdl-access = free }}</ref><ref name="atta">{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = S. | last2 = Renaud | first2 = F. | last3 = Guégan | first3 = J. | last4 = Thomas | first4 = F. | year = 2001 | title = Evolution of trophic transmission in parasites: the need to reach a mating place? | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 815–820 | doi = 10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00318.x }}</ref> It is probable that most parasites with complex life cycles evolved from simple life cycles.<ref name="nio">{{cite journal | last1 = Choisy | first1 = M. | last2 = Brown | first2 = S. | last3 = Lafferty | first3 = K. | last4 = Thomas | first4 = F. | year = 2003 | title = Evolution of Trophic Transmission in Parasites: Why Add Intermediate Hosts?. | url = https://hal.umontpellier.fr/hal-02502579/file/Thomas_04.pdf| journal = Am Nat | volume = 162 | issue = 2| pages = 172–181 | doi = 10.1086/375681 | pmid = 12858262 }}</ref> The transfer from simple to complex life cycles has been analyzed theoretically, and it has been shown that trophically transmitted parasites can be favored by the addition of an intermediate prey host if the population density of the intermediate host is higher than that of the definitive host.<ref name="nio" /> Additional factors that catalyze this transfer are high predation rates, and a low natural mortality rate of the intermediate host.<ref name="nio" />

Parasites with a single host species are faced with the problem of not being able to survive in higher trophic levels and therefore dying with its prey host. The development of complex life cycles is most likely an adaptation of the parasite to survive in the predator.<ref name="Lafferty1999" /> The development of parasite increased trophic transmission is a further adaptation in relation to a complex life cycle, where the parasite increases its transmission to a definitive host by manipulating its intermediate host.<ref name="sju" />

===Evolution of induced behaviors===

The ''adaptive manipulation'' hypothesis posits that specific behavioral alterations induced in a host can be used by parasites to increase their [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Under this hypothesis, induced behaviors are the result of natural selection acting upon the parasite's [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]] (in this case its ''host's behavior''). Many behaviors induced by [[obligate parasite]]s to complete their lifecycles are examples of adaptive manipulation because of their clear relationship to parasite fitness. For example, evidence has shown that infection by the parasitic worm ''[[Pomphorhynchus laevis]]'' leads to altered drifting behavior in its [[intermediate host]], the [[amphipod]] ''[[Gammarus pulex]]''; this altered behavior increases its host's predation risk by fish which are ''P. laevis''{{'}}s definitive hosts. The induced behavioral change in the host thus leads to the parasite's increased success in completing its life cycle.<ref name="Lagrue">{{Cite journal | volume=88 |issue=11 |pages=2839–2847 |last1=Lagrue |first1=Clément |last2=Kaldonski |first2=Nicolas |last3=Perrot-Minnot |first3=Marie J. |last4=Motreuil |first4=Sébastien |last5=Bollache |first5=Loïc |title=Modification of hosts' behavior by a parasite: field evidence for adaptive manipulation |journal=Ecology |date=Nov 2007 |pmid=18051653 |doi=10.1890/06-2105.1}}</ref> In general, whether a specific behavioral change serves an adaptive purpose for the parasite, the host, or both, depends on the entire "host-parasite system":<ref name="Klein 2003">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(03)00163-X | pmid=12954438 | volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=441–449 |last=Klein |first=Sabra L. |author-link1=Sabra Klein|title=Parasite manipulation of the proximate mechanisms that mediate social behavior in vertebrates |journal=Physiology & Behavior |date=August 2003| s2cid=28547443 }}</ref> The life cycle of the pathogen, its virulence and the host's immune response.<ref name="Klein 2003" />

Conversely, evolved behaviors of the host may be a result of adaptations to parasitism.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Del Giudice |first1=Marco |s2cid=199523717 |title=Invisible Designers: Brain Evolution Through the Lens of Parasite Manipulation |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |date=September 2019 |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=249–282 |doi=10.1086/705038 }}</ref>

== Mechanisms ==
The way in which parasites induce behavioral changes in hosts has been compared to the way a neurobiologist would effect a similar change in a lab.<ref name= "Hughes">{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=edited by David P. Hughes, Jacques Brodeur, Frédéric |last2=Brodeur |first2=J. |last3=Thomas |first3=F. |title=Host manipulation by parasites |date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-964224-3}}</ref> A scientist may stimulate a certain [[Neural pathway|pathway]] in order to produce a specific behavior, such as increased appetite or lowered anxiety; parasites also produce specific behavioral changes in their hosts, but rather than stimulate specific neurological pathways, they appear to target broader areas of the [[central nervous system]]. While the [[Tinbergen's four questions#Proximate explanations|proximate mechanisms]] underlying this broad targeting have not been fully characterized, two mechanisms used by parasites to alter behavior in [[vertebrate]] hosts have been identified: infection of the central nervous system and altered [[neurochemical]] communication.<ref name="Klein 2003" />

=== Infection of the central nervous system ===

Some parasites alter host behavior by infecting [[neuron]]s in the host's central nervous system. The host's central nervous system responds to the parasite [[Immune system|as it would to any other infection]]. The hallmarks of such response include local inflammation and the release of chemicals such as [[cytokine]]s. The immune response itself is responsible for induced behavioral changes in many cases of parasitic infection. Parasites that are known to induce behavioral changes through central nervous system inflammation in their hosts include ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' in rats, ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in mice and ''[[Plasmodium mexicanum]]'' in the Mexican lizard.<ref name="Klein 2003" />

[[File:Toxoplasma gondii (2).jpg|thumb|''Toxoplasma gondii'' induces behavioural changes in rats by infecting central nervous system neurons.]]

While some parasites exploit their hosts' typical immune responses, others seem to alter the immune response itself. For example, the typical immune response in rodents is characterized by heightened anxiety.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume=818 |issue=2 |pages=291–303 |last1=Lacosta |first1=S. |last2=Merali |first2=Z. |last3=Anisman |first3=H. |title=Behavioral and neurochemical consequences of lipopolysaccharide in mice: anxiogenic-like effects |journal=Brain Research |date=1999-02-13 |pmid=10082815 |doi=10.1016/s0006-8993(98)01288-8|s2cid=5915083 }}</ref> Infection with ''Toxoplasma gondii'' inhibits this response, increasing the risk of predation by ''T. gondii''{{'}}s subsequent hosts. Research suggests that the inhibited anxiety-response could be the result of immunological damage to the [[limbic system]].<ref name= "Hughes" />

=== Altered neurochemical communication===

-->
Parasites that induce behavioral changes in their hosts often exploit the regulation of social behavior in the brain.<ref name="Klein 2003" /> Social behavior is regulated by [[neurotransmitters]], such as [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], in the emotional centers of the brain – primarily the [[amygdala]] and the [[hypothalamus]], and although parasites may be capable of stimulating specific neurochemical pathways to induce behavioral changes, evidence suggests that they alter neurochemical communication through broad rather than specific targeting.<ref name="Hughes" /> For example, ''Toxoplasma gondii'' attaches to the hypothalamus rather than target a specific cellular pathway; this broad targeting leads to a widespread increase in host dopamine levels, which may in turn account for the loss of aversion to cat odor.<ref name="Webster">{{Cite journal | volume=109 |pages=583–589 |last=Webster |first=J. P. |title=The effect of Toxoplasma gondii and other parasites on activity levels in wild and hybrid Rattus norvegicus |journal=Parasitology |date=Dec 1994 |pmid=7831094 |issue=5 |doi=10.1017/s0031182000076460}}</ref> In some cases, ''T. gondii'' is believed to cause increases in dopamine levels by secreting another compound, [[L-DOPA|L-Dopa]], which may trigger a rise in dopamine levels, though concrete evidence for this mechanism has not yet been demonstrated.<ref name="Webster" /> This rise in dopamine levels induces a loss of aversion to cat odor in the rats, increasing the risk of predation by cats, ''T. gondii''{{'}}s definitive host.<ref name="Webster" /> The mechanistic details underlying the increase in dopamine levels and the way it affects the rat's behavioral change remain elusive.<ref name="Hughes" />

The [[emerald cockroach wasp]] alters behavior through the injection of venom directly into the host's brain, causing [[hypokinesia]].<ref name="Haspel et al." /><ref name="Klein 2003" /> This is achieved by a reduction in dopamine and octopamine activity, which affects the transmission of interneurons involved in the escape response;<ref name="Banks & Adams" /> so while the host's brain circuitry responsible for movement control is still functional – and indeed it will slog along when pulled by the wasp – the nervous system is in a depressed state. Put differently: the wasp's toxin affects not the host's ''ability'' to move, but its ''motivation'' to do so.

The original function of such secretions may have been to suppress the immune system of the host, as described above. The trematode ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]'' secretes [[opioid]] [[peptides]] into the host's bloodstream, influencing both its immune response and neural function.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=M. |first1=Kavaliers |title=Parasites and behavior: an ethopharmacological analysis and biomedical implications |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=1999 |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1037–1045 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(99)00035-4|pmid=10580316 |s2cid=29936892 }}</ref> Other sources suggest a possible origin in [[molecular mimicry]].<ref name="Biron">{{cite journal |author=Biron, D.
