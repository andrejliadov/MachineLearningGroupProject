The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to death:

'''[[Death]]''' &ndash; termination of all biological functions that sustain a living organism.

== What is death? ==

Death can be described as all of the following:

* End of [[life]] &ndash; life is the characteristic distinguishing physical entities having signaling and self-sustaining processes from those that do not,<ref name=Koshland>{{Cite journal |title=The Seven Pillars of Life |journal=Science |date=March 22, 2002 |first=Daniel E. |last=Koshland, Jr. |volume=295 |issue=5563 |pages=2215–2216 |doi= 10.1126/science.1068489 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |accessdate=2009-05-25 |pmid=11910092|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=AHDLife>The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' of the English Language, 4th edition, published by Houghton Mifflin Company, via [http://www.answers.com/topic/life Answers.com]:
* "The property or quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter, manifested in functions such as [[metabolism]], growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli or adaptation to the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] originating from within the organism."
* "The characteristic state or condition of a living organism."</ref> either because such functions have ceased ([[death]]), or because they lack such functions and are classified as [[wikt:inanimate|inanimate]].<ref>[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=inanimate Definition of ''inanimate''.] WordNet Search by Princeton University.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life |title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2009-06-21 |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}</ref><ref name=Chambers>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary | publisher=Chambers Publishers Ltd |edition=online |year=1999 |title=organism |url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=organism&title=21st |accessdate=2012-05-26}}</ref>
* (Death is) the opposite of:
** [[Life]] &ndash; ''(see above)''
** [[Biogenesis]] &ndash; production of new living organisms or organelles. The law of biogenesis, attributed to Louis Pasteur, is the observation that living things come only from other living things, by reproduction (e.g. a spider lays eggs, which develop into spiders).
*** [[Fertilisation]] (Conception) &ndash; the beginning of an organism's life, initiated by the fusion of gametes resulting in the development of a new individual organism. In animals, the process involves the fusion of an ovum with a sperm, which eventually leads to the development of an embryo. 
*** [[Birth]] &ndash; act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. Commonly considered the beginning of one's life. "First you are born, then you live life, then you die."
**** [[De-extinction]] &ndash; process of creating an organism, which is a member of or resembles an extinct species, or a breeding population of such organisms. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although selective breeding has also been proposed. Similar techniques have been applied to endangered species. Though we have not yet brought an extinct species back to life
** [[Self-preservation|Survival]] &ndash; Survival is simply the need to live, the only real purpose of an organism is to generate offspring
*** [[Indefinite lifespan]] &ndash; term used in the life extension movement and transhumanism to refer to the hypothetical longevity of humans (and other life-forms) under conditions in which aging is effectively and completely prevented and treated. Their lifespans would be "indefinite" (that is, they would not be "immortal") because protection from the effects of aging on health does not guarantee survival. Such individuals would still be susceptible to accidental or intentional death by disease, starvation, getting hit by a truck, murdered, and so on, but not death from aging, some animals can live forever such as the Turritopsis doohmii jellyfish, or the bowhead whale.

== Types of death ==
* Individual death &ndash; termination of all biological functions within a living organism
* [[Extinction]] &ndash; death of an entire species, or more specifically, death of the last member of a species
** [[Extinction event]] &ndash; widespread and rapid decrease in the amount of life on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp reduction in the diversity and abundance of macroscopic life. Also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis.
** [[Human extinction]] &ndash; hypothesized end of the human species. Various scenarios have been discussed in science, popular culture, and religion ''(see [[end time]])''
** [[Local extinction]] (extirpation) &ndash; condition of a species (another taxon) that ceases to exist in the chosen geographic area of study, though it still exists elsewhere. Local extinctions are contrasted with global extinctions. Local extinction can be reversed by reintroduction of the species to the area from other locations; wolf reintroduction is an example of this.

== Causes of death ==

=== Causes of death, by type ===
* [[Accident]]s &ndash; unplanned events or circumstances, often with lack of intention or necessity. They generally have negative outcomes which might have been avoided or prevented had circumstances leading up to each accident had been recognized, and acted upon, prior to occurrence. An example of a type of accident that can cause death is a [[traffic collision]].
** [[List of accident types]]
* [[Senescence|Biological aging]] &ndash; 
* [[Disease]] &ndash; 
** [[Terminal illness]]
* [[Injury]]
** [[Wound]]
*** [[Mortal wound]]
* Killing &ndash; causing the death of a living organism, usually for the purpose of survival, including the defense of self and or others.
** [[Predation]] &ndash; 
** [[Homicide]] &ndash;
*** [[Murder]] &ndash; killing of a human done in malice
*** [[Human sacrifice]]
** [[Sacrifice]]
*** [[Human sacrifice]]
*** [[Animal sacrifice]]
** [[Suicide]] &ndash; act of intentionally causing one's own death. Suicide is often carried out as a result of despair, the cause of which is frequently attributed to a mental disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, alcoholism, or drug abuse. Stress factors such as financial difficulties or troubles with interpersonal relationships often play a role. Efforts to prevent suicide include limiting access to firearms, treating mental illness and drug misuse, and improving economic circumstances.
*** [[Assisted suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Copycat suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Familicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Forced suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Honor suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Internet suicide pact]] &ndash; 
*** [[Mass suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Murder–suicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Suicide pact]] &ndash; 
*** [[Parasuicide]] &ndash; 
*** [[Suicide attack]] &ndash; 
*** [[Suicide by cop]] &ndash;
** [[Capital punishment]] &ndash; legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The judicial decree that someone is punished in this manner is a death sentence, while the actual enforcement is an execution. Also called the "death penalty".
*** [[List of methods of capital punishment]] 
** [[Genocide]] &ndash; systematic destruction of all or a significant part of a racial, ethnic, religious or national group. Well-known examples of genocide include the Holocaust, the Armenian genocide, and more recently the Rwandan genocide.
** [[War]] &ndash; organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterized by extreme violence, social disruption and an attempt at economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as warfare.
* [[Laughing oneself to death]] (extremely rare) &ndash;
* [[Natural disaster]]s &ndash;
** [[Avalanche]]s &ndash;
** [[Earthquake]]s &ndash;

Also known as ''thanatophobia'' (fear of death).
** [[Mortality salience]] &ndash;
* Effects on the deceased (and on the [[cadaver]]) &ndash; "deceased" is short for "deceased person", which is a person who has died and who is therefore dead.  A cadaver is the body of a dead person.
** [[Unconsciousness|End of consciousness]] &ndash; a dead body is no longer awake, but there is the question of where consciousness went to, if anywhere...
*** Is there [[consciousness after death]]? &ndash; there is a debate between proponents of the following possibilities:
**** [[Eternal oblivion]]
**** [[Afterlife]]
** Cessation of [[breathing]]
** [[Cardiac arrest]] &ndash; the heart has stopped beating (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
** [[Pallor mortis]] &ndash; paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
** [[Livor mortis]] &ndash; settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
** [[Algor mortis]] &ndash; reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
** [[Rigor mortis]] &ndash; limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
