== Construction ==
King [['Adud al-Dawla]] provided the funding for the hospital from the properties that he owned.<ref name="Farkhondehzadeh et al 2017" /> Before the construction of the building and its quarters, well-known physician, [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]], was chosen to decide the ideal location for Al-'Adudi. In order to make the appropriate choice, it is said that different areas of the city were tested by hanging meat and choosing the place that resulted in the minimal amount of decay of the meat.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /><ref name="Miller 2006" /> The completion of the construction of Al-'Adudi was in 981 A.D. on the western banks of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]].<ref name="Syed 1981">{{Cite journal|last=Syed|first=Ibrahim B|s2cid=55246528|date=1981-01-01|title=Islamic Medicine: 1000 Years Ahead of Its Times|journal=Journal of the Islamic Medical Association of North America|volume=13|issue=1|doi=10.5915/13-1-11925|issn=2160-9829}}</ref><ref name="Hamarneh 1962" />

The Al-'Adudi Hospital was reconstructed twice after its initial development. The first time the Al-'Adudi was destroyed occurred in 1068 due to a flood of the [[Tigris|Tigris River]].<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /> After it was rebuilt, it is said the hospital improved in its facilities and the care provided to patients.<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /> However, visitors who passed through the hospital shared that Al-'Adudi did not actually treat patients with the same quality care.<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /> Some shared that the physicians only visited patients a couple times a week. The Al-'Adudi Hospital was destroyed for the second time during the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Siege of Baghdad]] in 1258.<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /> The hospital was not rebuilt for a third time.

==Medical institution==
Al-'Adudi served as more than a place in which infections were cured. The hospital was both a medical institution and an institution for learning medicine.<ref name="Miller 2006" /> As it was a [[Bimaristan]], it served individuals of all backgrounds regardless of sex and other identities.<ref name="Miller 2006" /> Males and females were treated at the hospital by expert physicians of different areas of medicine that created set plans for patients.<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /><ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /> In Al-'Adudi, there were twenty-four physicians hired as well as nurses that cared for patients that shared the same sex.<ref name="Syed 1981" /> After the second construction of Al-'Adudi, the number of physicians increased to twenty-eight.<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" /> Among the physicians, were specialists such as [[surgeons]], [[ophthalmologists]], [[orthopedics]], [[oculists]] and future physicians.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /><ref name="Dajani 1989" /> Some of the physicians cared for patients and also taught students of medicine.<ref name="Syed 1981" /> A traveler named, [[Ibn Jubayr]], is said to have described the hospital to be made of many quarters that had large rooms for different purposes.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /> Al-'Adudi was said to resemble characteristics of palaces.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /> It also held some of the most recent pharmaceutical developments.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /> Although the Al-'Adudi Hospital had its main location of function and work for physicians, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]], who was a leader and well-known physician, asked that prisons also schedule organized regular medical checkups for the prisoners.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Syed 1981" /> He gave the physician, [[Sinan ibn Thabit|Sinan bin Thabit]], the job to assign medical officers frequent visits to the prisons.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=FIMA Yearbook 2009|publisher=Jordan Society for Islamic Medical Sciences|year=2010|isbn=978-969-8695-01-9|pages=99–126}}</ref><ref name="Syed 1981" />

== Learning institution ==
The way of learning for medical students today is similar when compared to the approach for learning medicine in early Islamic hospitals. Al-'Adudi was among the first hospitals that emphasized the importance for medical students to have direct contact with patients.<ref name="Dajani 1989">{{Cite journal|last=Dajani|first=Akram M.|title=Medical Education in Islamic Civilization|journal=Journal of the Islamic Medical Association of North America|language=en-US|volume=21|issue=4|pages=166–172|doi=10.5915/21-4-13514|year=1989|doi-access=free}}</ref> Al-'Adudi began as one of the hospitals that would work as a place in which students could learn and practice their specialty.<ref name="Syed 1981" /> The education of medicine became significant during the period of hospitals like Al-'Adudi for the goal of having students move beyond the classroom.<ref name="Syed 1981" /> Al-'Adudi was modeled after hospitals like those in [[Jundi-Shapur]].<ref name="Miller 2006" /> Medical students in Al-'Adudi were able to participate in rounds, attend lectures, and have discussions with other medical professionals.<ref name="Miller 2006" /> As there were physicians of different areas of expertise, students were, for example, able to view the skills of surgeons who practiced in optometry and orthopedics among other areas of medicine.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /> One way in which the medical knowledge of students was assessed would be by directly asking students questions relating to the medical conditions of the patients in their presence.<ref name="Syed 1981" /> Among the physicians that taught and assessed students was [[Ibn al-Tilmidh|Hibat Allah Ibn al-Tilmidh]].<ref name="Hamarneh 1962" />

== Physicians ==
There were numerous experts of medicine throughout the existence of Al-'Adudi that helped the hospital from the beginning of its founding until the end. Among those were [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]], who helped King [['Adud al-Dawla]] choose the location of the hospital.<ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" /><ref name="Miller 2006" /> Before the death of King 'Adud al-Dawla, Ibn Mandevaih worked under his reign for a salary.<ref name="Farkhondehzadeh et al 2017" /> During Ibn Mandevaih's time at 'Al-Adudi, he was able to prove his medical knowledge, which allowed him to work further outside of the hospital.<ref name="Farkhondehzadeh et al 2017" /> A physician who received his medical education at Al-'Adudi was [[Ibn Jazla]]h.<ref name="Lev 2014">{{Cite journal|last=Lev|first=Efraim|date=April 2014|title=An Early Fragment of Ibn Jazlah's Tabulated Manual " Taqwīm al-Abdān " from the Cairo Genizah (T-S Ar.41.137)|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=189–223|doi=10.1017/S1356186313000503|issn=0035-869X}}</ref> He studied under Ibn Hibat Allah and continued his medical career by contributing to the field with works such as ''Taqwim al-Abdan fi Tadbir al-Insan'' (The Almanac of Bodily Parts for the Treatment of People).<ref name="Lev 2014" /> [[Ibn al-Tilmidh]] also contributed to Al-'Adudi during the early part of the 12th century in which he served as the chief of the hospital.<ref name="Dajani 1989" /> Among the medical specialists that worked at Al-'Adudi were also [[Al-Dakhwar]] ([[optometrist]]), [[Ibn Tufail]] (surgeon), and [[Ibn Butlan]], who received an education from the institution.<ref name="Dajani 1989" /><ref name="Nowsheravi 1983" />
