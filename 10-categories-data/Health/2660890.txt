'''Medical geography''' is a sub-discipline of [[geography]] and a sister field of [[health geography]],<ref name="Oxford 20162">[[doi:10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-0034|Oxford Bibliographies entry of Medical Geography]].</ref> focused on understanding spatial patterns of [[health]] and [[disease]] as related to the natural and social environment.<ref name="Meade, Florin, and Gesler 1988">Meade MS, Florin JW, Gesler WM.

==History==
Relationships between [[Location (geography)|place]] and [[health]] have long been recognized throughout human history, predating modern [[Health system|health delivery systems]] and providing insights into the transmission of [[Pathogen|infectious agents]], well before the [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]] paradigm shift in the late 1800s. Throughout history there have been many examples of place and location playing major roles in shaping perceptions of health and [[risk]]. The associations between [[Geographical indication|geographical characteristics]] and health outcomes, which essentially form the foundation of modern medical geography, were recognized more than 2,000 years ago by [[Hippocrates]] in his treatise [[Hippocratic Corpus|’’On Airs, Waters, and Places’’]] (ca. 400 BC).
The [[industrial revolution]] in the 1700s brought with it a plethora of novel [[public health]] issues stemming from rapid [[Urbanization|urban development]] and poor [[sanitation]], conditions which fueled the development of [[Disease diffusion mapping|disease mapping]], or medical cartography. A precursor to medical geography, medical cartography arose from the need to communicate spatial discrepancies in risk for diseases of unknown cause, particularly urban outbreaks of [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref name="Welhausen 2015">Welhausen CA. Power and Authority in Disease Maps: Visualizing Medical Cartography Through Yellow Fever Mapping. J Bus Tech Commun. 2015;29: 257–283. doi:10.1177/1050651915573942</ref> One of the most prominent figures in both [[epidemiology]] and medical geography is [[John Snow]], the physician who correctly identified the source of exposure during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow’s famous 1854 map of the cholera outbreak graphically demonstrates that cases were clustered around the Broad Street pump, the source of contaminated water that fueled the epidemic. This map led Snow to identify the contaminated pump and conclude that cholera was a [[Waterborne diseases|waterborne]] illness, a remarkable feat given that [[bacteria]] were unknown to science at the time. While Snow’s contributions to medical geography and epidemiology are irrefutable, the role of the map in this particular investigation is somewhat overstated.<ref name="McLeod 2000">McLeod KS. Our Sense of Snow: The Myth of John Snow in Medical Geography. Soc Sci Med. 2000;50: 923–935.</ref> [[Dot distribution map|Dot maps]] of cases produced during the industrial period were powerful tools in communicating the findings of traditional epidemiological measures of association, but their role as analytic tools were restricted due to technological limitations.<ref name="Nelson and Williams 2014">Nelson KE, Williams CM, editors.

Modern medical geography arose in the United States in the 1950s with the pioneering work of Jacques May,<ref name="Monmonier 1976">Mark S. Monmonier (1976) Jacques M. May, The Professional Geographer, 28:1, 93, DOI: 10.1111/j.0033-0124.1976.00093.x [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0033-0124.1976.00093.x?journalCode=rtpg20]</ref> who worked as a surgeon in Thailand and Vietnam and noticed differences between the health experiences of his patients in these locations and in Europe.<ref name="Meade and Emch 2010">Meade, M. S. and M. Emch. 2010. Medical Geography.  Guilford Press, New York.</ref> Although the notion that the [[Biophysical environment|environment]] could influence [[health|human health]] has been understood since Hippocrates, medical geography as envisioned by May built on this idea, describing medical geography as working to understand the nature of the relationships between pathogen transmission and geographical factors.<ref name="May 1950">May, J. M. 1950. Medical geography: Its methods and objectives. Geographical Review 40 (1): 9-41.</ref>   May soon began mapping global distributions of disease and exploring the cultural and environmental factors that influenced these distributions.<ref name="Monmonier 1976" /><ref name="Meade and Emch 2010"/>

==Areas of study==
The first area of study within medical geography has been described as geographical epidemiology or disease geography and is focused on the spatial patterns and processes of health and disease outcomes.<ref name="Mayer 1982" /> This area of inquiry can be differentiated from the closely related discipline of epidemiology in that it uses concepts and methods from geography, allowing an ecologic perspective on health that considers how interactions between humans and the environment result in observed health outcomes.<ref name="Glass 2000">Glass, G. E. 2000. Update: spatial aspects of epidemiology: the interface with medical geography.  Epidemiologic Reviews 22 (1): 136-139.</ref> The second area of study focused on the planning and provision of health services, often with a focus on the spatial organization of health systems and exploration of how this arrangement affects accessibility of care.<ref name="Meade and Emch 2010"/>

==Methods==
[[Geographic Information System]]s (GIS) are used extensively in medical geography to visualize and analyze [[Georeferencing|georeferenced]] health-related data. These spatial data can be [[vector graphics|vector]] (point, line, or polygon) or [[raster graphics|raster]] (continuous grid) format and are often presented in quantitative thematic maps. Disease outcomes and sociodemographic characteristics collected through [[surveillance]] systems and population [[census]]es are frequently used as data sources in medical geography studies. In disease ecology studies, interpolated [[climate]] data, gridded [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land surveys]], and [[remote sensing]] imagery are examples of data used to quantify the environmental characteristics of disease systems.
Spatial statistics or analysis are applied to test hypotheses regarding patterns or relationships within these data, such as the property of [[Spatial dependence|spatial dependency]] (spatially closer entities are more similar or related than spatially distant entities) or [[spatial heterogeneity]] (locations are unique relative to other locations).<ref name="Sui 2007">Sui, D.Z., 2007. Geographic information systems and medical geography: Toward a new synergy. Geography Compass, 1(3), pp.556-582.</ref> Some examples of the spatial analyses used in medical geography include point pattern analysis, tests for spatial autocorrelation, geographically weighted regression (GWR), [[ecological niche]] modeling, spatial scan statistics, and network analysis.
