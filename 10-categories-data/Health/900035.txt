'''Dipsomania''' is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as [[alcoholism]]. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a [[Disease theory of alcoholism|disease theory of chronic drunkenness]]. The [[word]] comes from Greek ''dipso'' ({{lang-el|"δίψα"}}= thirst) and ''mania''.

It is mentioned in the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] [[ICD-10|ICD-10 classification]] as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26.

The term was coined by the German physician [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Brühl-Cramer,<ref>[[Hasso Spode]]: Die Macht der Trunkenheit. Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte des Alkohols, Opladen 1993, pp. 125ff.</ref> he translated Brühl-Cramer's term "''trunksucht''" as "dipsomania".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910233721/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119222474/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-10|title=The History of Alcoholism: Brühl-Cramer's Concepts and Observations|first=Friedrich-Wilhelm|last=Kielhorn|journal=Addiction |via=Wiley Online Library|volume=91|issue=1|pages=121–128|date=January 1996|pmid = 8822020}}</ref>

Due to the influence of Brühl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/54233 NLA record]</ref> Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as "the most medical" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.<ref>Tracy, Sarah W. (2005).

Although ''dipsomania'' was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.<ref name="psych encyc">[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/dipsomania Dipsomania entry] at Psychoanalysis Encyclopedia</ref> In his 1893 book ''Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania'', Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available.<ref name="psych encyc" /> Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober.<ref name="psych encyc" />

Similarly, in 1892 the influential English physician and mental health expert [[Daniel Hack Tuke]] defined dipsomania as a syndrome involving "an irresistible obsession and impulse to drink, coming on in attacks, during which the patients are in a condition of impotence of will and manifest great anguish."{{sfn|Tuke|1892|p=389}} Tuke clarifies that dipsomania can be distinguished from was at the time considered alcoholism by six key factors. First, "an alcoholic patient becomes insane because he drinks; a dipsomaniac is insane before he commences to drink."<ref>{{harvnb|Tuke|1892|p=394}}</ref> Second,"alcoholism is an intoxication which has as its cause alcohol; dipsomania has its cause in a defective mental condition, and alcohol is but a secondary factor, which may be replaced by any other poison, leaving to the syndrome all its psychological characters."{{sfn|Tuke|1892|p=395}} Third, "dipsomania proceeds in paroxysmal attacks, and the appetite for strong drink is absent during the intervals between the attacks. Alcoholism has no definite course." {{sfn|Tuke|1892|p=395}} Fourth, "a dipsomaniac satisfies a pathological and imperious want; he does not like alcohol, and takes it against his will," whereas "an alcoholic individual has no actual want; he only obeys a vice, a proclivity, and an alteration of his moral sense."{{sfn|Tuke|1892|p=395}} Fifth, a dipsomaniac is conscious and ashamed of his condition, whereas an alcoholic is sometimes unaware of, but more often indifferent to it. Finally, he concluded that "dipsomania is a syndrome, always identical with itself, whilst alcoholism is an intoxication varying much in its clinical symptoms."{{sfn|Tuke|1892|p=395}}

Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism.<ref>{{cite book | last = Tracy | first = Sarah | title = Alcoholism in America |pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&q=dipsomania&pg=PA31 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 }}</ref>
