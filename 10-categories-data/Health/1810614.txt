Health equity, sometimes also referred to as health disparity, is defined as differences in the quality of [[health]] and [[healthcare]] across different populations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of a Few Key Public Health Terms |url=http://www.cdphe.state.co.us/ohd/glossary.html|publisher=Office of Health Disparities, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Health equity is different from health equality, as it refers to the absence of disparities in controllable or remediable aspects of health.

== Socioeconomic status ==
[[Socioeconomic status]] is both a strong predictor of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations. Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the [[Capability approach#Capabilities|capabilities]] of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both [[Financial capital|financial]] and [[social capital]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ben-Shlomo Yoav, White Ian R., Marmot Michael | year = 1996 | title = Does the Variation in the Socioeconomic Characteristics of an Area Affect Mortality? | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7037| pages = 1013–1014 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7037.1013| pmid = 8616348 | pmc = 2350820 }}</ref> It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health.

In China, for instance, the collapse of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] left many of the rural poor uninsured and unable to access the resources necessary to maintain good health.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sun X., Jackson S., Carmichael G., Sleigh A.C. | year = 2009 | title = Catastrophic medical payment and financial protection in rural China: evidence from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in Shandong Province | journal = Health Economics | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 103–119 | doi = 10.1002/hec.1346 | pmid = 18283715 }}</ref> Increases in the cost of medical treatment made healthcare increasingly unaffordable for these populations.

Similarly, in Tanzania, it was demonstrated that wealthier families were far more likely to bring their children to a healthcare provider: a significant step towards stronger healthcare.<ref name=":2" /> Some scholars have noted that unequal income distribution itself can be a cause of poorer health for a society as a result of "underinvestment in social goods, such as public education and health care; disruption of social cohesion and the erosion of social capital".<ref name=":0" />

The role of socioeconomic status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, [[social capital]] plays a significant role in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives.<ref>{{cite journal | author = House J.

In addition, these children have higher mortality rates than those in richer families due to malnutrition. Because of their low socioeconomic status, receiving health care can be challenging. Children in poor families are less likely to receive health care in general, and if they do have access to care, it is likely that the quality of that care is not highly sufficient.<ref name=":8" />

=== Education ===
Education is an important factor in healthcare utilization, though it is closely intertwined with economic status. An individual may not go to a medical professional or seek care if they don't know the ills of their failure to do so, or the value of proper treatment.<ref name=":5" /> In Tajikistan, since the nation gained its independence, the likelihood of giving birth at home has increased rapidly among women with lower educational status. Education also has a significant impact on the quality of prenatal and maternal healthcare.

== Spatial disparities in health ==
{{see also|Healthcare reform in China}}

For some populations, access to healthcare and health resources is physically limited, resulting in health inequities. For instance, an individual might be physically incapable of traveling the distances required to reach healthcare services, or long distances can make seeking regular care unappealing despite the potential benefits.<ref name=":5">Banerjee, A., Banerjee, A.

China experienced a serious decrease in spatial health equity following the Chinese economic revolution in the 1980s as a result of the degradation of the [[Healthcare reform in China|Cooperative Medical System]] (CMS). The CMS provided an infrastructure for the delivery of healthcare to rural locations, as well as a framework to provide funding based upon communal contributions and government subsidies. In its absence, there was a significant decrease in the quantity of healthcare professionals (35.9%), as well as functioning clinics (from 71% to 55% of villages over 14 years) in rural areas, resulting in inequitable healthcare for rural populations.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Liu Y. |author2=Hsiao W.

Similarly, populations in rural Tajikistan experience spatial health inequities. A study by Jane Falkingham noted that physical access to healthcare was one of the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, many women in rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.<ref name=":4" />

==Ethnic and racial disparities==
{{see also|Race and health}}

Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that [[Race and health in the United States|these racially centered disparities continue to exist]] and are a significant social health issue.<ref name="Weinick">{{cite journal |author1=Weinick R.

There are also considerable racial disparities in access to insurance coverage, with ethnic minorities generally having less insurance coverage than non-ethnic minorities. For example, Hispanic Americans tend to have less insurance coverage than white Americans and as a result receive less regular medical care. The level of insurance coverage is directly correlated with access to healthcare including preventive and [[ambulatory]] care.<ref name="Weinick" /> A 2010 study on racial and ethnic disparities in health done by the [[Institute of Medicine]] has shown that the aforementioned disparities cannot solely be accounted for in terms of certain demographic characteristics like: insurance status, household income, education, age, geographic location and quality of living conditions.

Ethnic health inequities also appear in nations across the African continent. A survey of the child mortality of major ethnic groups across 11 African nations (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) was published in 2000 by the WHO.

In a survey of five European countries (Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Italy, and France), a 1995 survey noted that only Sweden provided access to translators for 100% of those who needed it, while the other countries lacked this service potentially compromising healthcare to non-native populations. Given that non-natives composed a considerable section of these nations (6%, 17%, 3%, 1%, and 6% respectively), this could have significant detrimental effects on the health equity of the nation. In France, an older study noted significant differences in access to healthcare between native French populations, and non-French/migrant populations based upon health expenditure; however this was not fully independent of poorer economic and working conditions experienced by these populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bollini P. |author2=Siem H. | year = 1995 | title = No real progress towards equity: Health of migrants and ethnic minorities on the eve of the year 2000 | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 819–828 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(94)00386-8 |pmid=8571153 }}</ref>

A 1996 study of race-based health inequity in Australia revealed that [[Indigenous health in Australia|Aborigines experienced higher rates of mortality]] than non-Aborigine populations. Aborigine populations experienced 10 times greater mortality in the 30–40 age range; 2.5 times greater infant mortality rate, and 3 times greater age standardized mortality rate. Rates of diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are also significantly greater in this population (16 and 15 times greater respectively), which is indicative of the poor healthcare of this ethnic group. At this point in time, the parities in life expectancy at birth between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples were highest in Australia, when compared to the US, Canada and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mooney G | year = 1996 | title = And now for vertical equity?

Recognizing the need for LGBT healthcare research, the Director of the [[National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities]] (NIMHD) at the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] designated sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) as a health disparity population for NIH research in October 2016.<ref name=":14">Meads, C.; Pennant, M.; McManus, J.; Bayliss, S.

Both sex and gender inform each other, and it is important to note that differences between the two genders influence disease manifestation and associated healthcare approaches.<ref name=":02" /> Understanding how the interaction of sex and gender contributes to disparity in the context of health allows providers to ensure quality outcomes for patients. This interaction is complicated by the difficulty of distinguishing between sex and gender given their intertwined nature; sex modifies gender, and gender can modify sex, thereby impacting health.<ref name=":02" /> &nbsp;Sex and gender can both be considered sources of health disparity; both contribute to men and women’s susceptibility to various health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and autoimmune disorders.<ref name=":02" />

=== Health disparities in the male population ===
As sex and gender are inextricably linked in day-to-day life, their union is apparent in medicine. Gender and sex are both components of health disparity in the male population.

=== Cultural factors ===
Health disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that involve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status. For example, in [[China]], health disparities have distinguished medical treatment for men and women due to the cultural phenomenon of preference for male children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mu|first1=Ren|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiaobo|date=2011-01-01|title=Why does the Great Chinese Famine affect the male and female survivors differently?

Individuals living in rural areas, especially poor rural areas, have access to fewer health care resources. Although 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, only 9 percent of physicians practice in rural settings. Individuals in rural areas typically must travel longer distances for care, experience long waiting times at clinics, or are unable to obtain the necessary health care they need in a timely manner. Rural areas characterized by a largely Hispanic population average 5.3 physicians per 10,000 residents compared with 8.7 physicians per 10,000 residents in nonrural areas. Financial barriers to access, including lack of health insurance, are also common among the urban poor.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/field-based-outreach-workers-facilitate-access-health-care-and-social-services-underserved |title=Field-Based Outreach Workers Facilitate Access to Health Care and Social Services for Underserved Individuals in Rural Areas |date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref>

==Disparities in access to health care==

Reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following:

* Lack of [[universal health care]] or [[health insurance]] coverage. Without health insurance, patients are more likely to postpone medical care, go without needed medical care, go without prescription medicines, and be denied access to care.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tikkanen|first1=Roosa Sofia|last2=Woolhandler|first2=Steffie|last3=Himmelstein|first3=David U.|last4=Kressin|first4=Nancy R.|last5=Hanchate|first5=Amresh|last6=Lin|first6=Meng-Yun|last7=McCormick|first7=Danny|last8=Lasser|first8=Karen E.|title=Hospital Payer and Racial/Ethnic Mix at Private Academic Medical Centers in Boston and New York City|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=47|issue=3|date=2 February 2017|pages=460–476|doi=10.1177/0020731416689549|pmid=28152644|pmc=6090544}}</ref> Minority groups in the United States lack insurance coverage at higher rates than whites.<ref>Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured (KCMU), "The Uninsured and Their Access to Health Care" (December 2003).</ref> This problem does not exist in countries with fully funded public health systems, such as the examplar of the [[National Health Service|NHS]].
* Lack of a regular source of care. Without access to a regular source of care, patients have greater difficulty obtaining care, fewer doctor visits, and more difficulty obtaining prescription drugs. Compared to whites, minority groups in the United States are less likely to have a doctor they go to on a regular basis and are more likely to use [[emergency rooms]] and [[clinics]] as their regular source of care.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Fryer G. E. |author2=Dovey S. M. |author3=Green L. A. | year = 2000 | title = The Importance of Having a Usual Source of Health Care | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 477 |pmid=18853527 }}</ref> In the United Kingdom, which is much more racially harmonious, this issue arises for a different reason; since 2004, NHS [[General practitioners|GPs]] have not been responsible for care out of normal GP surgery opening hours, leading to significantly higher attendances in [[Emergency department|A+E]]
* Lack of financial resources. Although the lack of financial resources is a barrier to health care access for many Americans, the impact on access appears to be greater for minority populations.<ref>Commonwealth Fund (CMWF), [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/News/News-Releases/1999/May/Analysis-Of-Minority-Health-Reveals-Persistent--Widespread-Disparities.aspx "Analysis of Minority Health Reveals Persistent, Widespread Disparities,"] press release (May 14, 1999).</ref>
* [[Legal]] barriers. Access to medical care by low-income immigrant minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs.  For example, in the United States federal law bars states from providing [[Medicaid]] coverage to [[immigrants]] who have been in the country fewer than five years.<ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10">Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 10.</ref> Another example could be when a non-English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person's language. This is mostly seen in Hispanic people who do not speak English. 
* Structural barriers. These barriers include poor transportation, an inability to schedule appointments quickly or during convenient hours, and excessive time spent in the waiting room, all of which affect a person's ability and willingness to obtain needed care.<ref>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), "National Healthcare Disparities Report," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (July 2003).</ref>
* The health care financing system. The [[Institute of Medicine]] in the United States says fragmentation of the U.S. health care delivery and financing system is a barrier to accessing care. Racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be enrolled in health insurance plans which place limits on covered services and offer a limited number of health care providers.<ref name="Goldberg, J. 2004 page 10"/>
* Scarcity of providers. In inner cities, rural areas, and communities with high concentrations of minority populations, access to medical care can be limited due to the scarcity of primary care practitioners, specialists, and diagnostic facilities.<ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002">[http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2002/Mar/Diverse-Communities--Common-Concerns--Assessing-Health-Care-Quality-for-Minority-Americans.aspx K. Collins, D. Hughes, M. Doty, B. Ives, J. Edwards, and K. Tenney, "Diverse Communities, Common Concerns: Assessing Health Care Quality for Minority Americans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425163800/http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Fund-Reports/2002/Mar/Diverse-Communities--Common-Concerns--Assessing-Health-Care-Quality-for-Minority-Americans.aspx |date=2014-04-25 }}," Commonwealth Fund (March 2002).</ref> In the UK, [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]] (a [[quango]]) has a legal obligation to ensure that sufficient provision exists in all parts of the nation.
* Linguistic barriers. Language differences restrict access to medical care for minorities in the United States who are not [[English language|English]]-proficient.<ref>National Health Law Program and the Access Project (NHeLP), Language Services Action Kit: Interpreter Services in Health Care Settings for People With Limited English Proficiency (February 2004).</ref>
* Health [[literacy]]. This is where patients have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, patients with a poor understanding of good health may not know when it is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy are not limited to minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors.<ref name="K. Collins, D. Hughes 2002"/> A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Determinants of access to and use of maternal health care services in the Eastern Cape, South Africa- a quantitative and qualitative investigation|last = Mluleki Tsawe|first = Appunni Sathiya Susuman|date = 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-723|pmid = 25315012|pmc = 4203863|volume=7|pages=723}}</ref>
* Lack of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the health care workforce. A major reason for disparities in access to care are the [[cultural]] differences between predominantly white health care providers and minority patients. Only 4% of physicians in the United States are African American, and Hispanics represent just 5%, even though these percentages are much less than their groups' proportion of the United States population.<ref>Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J. "Understanding Health Disparities." Health Policy Institute of Ohio (November 2004), page 13.</ref>
*Age. Age can also be a factor in health disparities for a number of reasons. As many older Americans exist on fixed incomes which may make paying for health care expenses difficult. Additionally, they may face other barriers such as impaired mobility or lack of transportation which make accessing health care services challenging for them physically. Also, they may not have the opportunity to access health information via the internet as less than 15% of Americans over the age of 65 have access to the internet.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brodie M, Flournoy RE, Altman DE | year = 2000 | title = Health information, the Internet, and the digital divide | journal = Health Affairs | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.6.255| pmid = 11192412 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> This could put older individuals at a disadvantage in terms of accessing valuable information about their health and how to protect it. On the other hand, older individuals in the US (65 or above) are provided with medical care via [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

===Dental healthcare===
In many countries, dental healthcare is less accessible than other kinds of healthcare. In Western countries, dental healthcare providers are present, and private or public healthcare systems typically facilitate access. However, access remains limited for marginalized groups such as the homeless, racial minorities, and those who are homebound or disabled. In Central and Eastern Europe, the privatization of dental healthcare has resulted in a shortage of affordable options for lower-income people. In Eastern Europe, school-age children formerly had access through school programs, but these have been discontinued. Therefore, many children no longer have access to care. Access to services and the breadth of services provided is greatly reduced in developing regions. Such services may be limited to emergency care and pain relief, neglecting preventative or restorative services. Regions like Africa, Asia, and Latin America do not have enough dental health professionals to meet the needs of the populace. In Africa, for example, there is only one dentist for every 150,000 people, compared to industrialized countries which average one dentist per 2,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094318| doi-access=free|title=Disparities in Access to Oral Health Care|year=2020|last1=Northridge|first1=Mary E.|last2=Kumar|first2=Anjali|last3=Kaur|first3=Raghbir|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=41|pages=513–535|pmid=31900100|pmc=7125002}}</ref>

==Disparities in quality of health care==

Health disparities in the quality of care exist and are based on language and ethnicity/race which includes:

=== Problems with patient-provider communication ===
Communication is critical for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care.   The patient provider relationship is dependent on the ability of both individuals to effectively communicate.  Language and culture both play a significant role in communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians.  Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask.<ref name="Health Care Quality Survey">{{cite web|title=Health Care Quality Survey|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Surveys/2001/2001-Health-Care-Quality-Survey.aspx|publisher=The Commonwealth Fund 2001}}</ref> In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time.<ref name="Health Care Quality Survey" /> Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Betancourt|first=J. R.|title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=Institute of Medicine}}</ref> Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers.  Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater.  Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one.  The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ku|first=L.|author2=Flores, G.|title=Pay Now or Pay Later: Providing Interpreter Services in Health Care|journal=Health Affairs|date=Mar–Apr 2005|volume=24|issue=2|pages=435–444|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.435|pmid=15757928|doi-access=free}}</ref> Language barriers have not only hindered appointment scheduling, prescription filling, and clear communications, but have also been associated with health declines, which can be attributed to reduced compliance and delays in seeking care, which could affect particularly  [[refugee health in the United States]].

This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient.  However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|title=Physician Language Ability and Cultural Competence|journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine|date=Feb 2004|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–174|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30266.x|pmid=15009796|pmc=1492135|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Flores|title=Errors in Medical Interpretation and their Potential Clinical Consequences in Pediatric Encounters|journal=Pediatrics|date=Jan 2003|volume=111|issue=1|pages=6–14|doi=10.1542/peds.111.1.6|pmid=12509547|display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.9277}}</ref> Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamers|author2=McNulty|title=Professional Interpreters and Bilingual Physicians in a Pediatric Emergency Department|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|date=Nov 2002|volume=156|issue=11|pages=1108–1113|doi=10.1001/archpedi.156.11.1108|pmid=12413338|doi-access=free}}</ref>    Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers.   It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting.

So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=A.|author2=Eisenberg, L. |title=Culture, Illness and Care: Clinical Lessons for Anthropologic and Cross Culture Research|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=1978|volume=88|issue=2|pages=251–258|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-88-2-251|pmid=626456|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with.<ref>Goldberg, J., Hayes, W., and Huntley, J.

Gochman]</ref>

=== Provider discrimination ===
Provider [[discrimination]] occurs when health care providers either unconsciously or consciously treat certain racial and ethnic patients differently from other patients. This may be due to stereotypes that providers may have towards ethnic/racial groups. Doctors are more likely to ascribe negative racial stereotypes to their minority patients.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Ryn|first=M.|author2=Burke, J.|title=The effect of Patient Race and Socio-economic Status on Physicians' Perceptions on Patients|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=2000|volume=50|issue=6|pages=813–828|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00338-x|pmid=10695979}}</ref> This may occur regardless of consideration for education, income, and personality characteristics. Two types of stereotypes may be involved, [[Implicit stereotype|automatic stereotypes]] or goal modified stereotypes.  Automated stereotyping is when stereotypes are automatically activated and influence judgments/behaviors outside of consciousness.<ref name="Burgess 2006 119–134">{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=D.

Critics question this research and say further studies are needed to determine how doctors and patients make their treatment decisions. Others argue that certain diseases cluster by ethnicity and that clinical decision making does not always reflect these differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Smedley B. |author2=Stith A. |author3=Nelson A. | year = 2002 | title = Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care | journal = Institute of Medicine }}</ref>

=== Lack of preventive care ===
According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans are less likely to receive preventive services in health care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Habib JL | year = 2010 | title = Progress lags in infection prevention and health disparities | url = http://www.patientcareonline.com/drug-benefit-trends/progress-lags-infection-prevention-and-health-disparities | journal = Drug Benefit Trends | volume = 22 | issue = 4| page = 112 }}</ref> For example, minorities are not regularly screened for [[colon cancer]] and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms.<ref name=pmid9276652>{{cite journal |pmid=9276652 |pmc=1497155 |year=1997 |last1=Woloshin |first1=S |title=Is language a barrier to the use of preventive services? |journal=Journal of General Internal Medicine |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=472–7 |last2=Schwartz |first2=L.

==Plans for achieving health equity==
There are a multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities outlined in scholarly texts, some examples include:

* Advocacy. Advocacy for health equity has been identified as a key means of promoting favourable policy change.<ref>Commission on Social Determinants of Health. Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final Report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008. Available at: http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9789241563703_eng.pdf.</ref> EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake of knowledge, that there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Farrer L. |author2=Marinetti C. |author3=Cavaco Y. K. |author4=Costongs C. | year = 2015 | title = Advocacy for Health Equity: A Synthesis Review | journal = Milbank Quarterly | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 392–437 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.12112 |pmid=26044634 |pmc=4462882 }}</ref> As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/health-advocacy-toolkit/ | title=Health Gradient &#124; EuroHealthNet}}</ref>
* Provider based incentives to improve healthcare for ethnic populations. One source of health inequity stems from unequal treatment of non-white patients in comparison with white patients. Creating provider based incentives to create greater parity between treatment of white and non-white patients is one proposed solution to eliminate provider bias.<ref>http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf</ref> These incentives typically are monetary because of its effectiveness in influencing physician behavior. 
* Using Evidence Based Medicine (EBM). Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) shows promise in reducing healthcare provider bias in turn promoting health equity.<ref>Betancourt, J. R., & Maina, A. (2007). Barriers to Eliminating Disparities in Clinical Practice. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (83-98). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> In theory EBM can reduce disparities however other research suggests that it might exacerbate them instead. Some cited shortcomings include EBM’s injection of clinical inflexibility in decision making and its origins as a purely cost driven measure.<ref>Maxey, R. W., & Williams, R. A. (2007). Second Class Medicine: Implications of Evidence-Based Medicine for Improving Minority Access to the Correct Pharmaceutical Therapy. In R. A. Williams (Ed.), Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America (99-120). Totwa, NJ: Humana Press.</ref> 
* Increasing awareness. The most cited measure to improving health equity relates to increasing public awareness. A lack of public awareness is a key reason why there has not been significant gains in reducing health disparities in ethnic and minority populations. Increased public awareness would lead to increased congressional awareness, greater availability of disparity data, and further research into the issue of health disparities.
* The Gradient Evaluation Framework. The evidence base defining which policies and interventions are most effective in reducing health inequalities is extremely weak. It is important therefore that policies and interventions which seek to influence health inequity be more adequately evaluated. Gradient Evaluation Framework (GEF) is an action-oriented policy tool that can be applied to assess whether policies will contribute to greater health equity amongst children and their families.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://health-gradient.eu/gef-the-gradient-evaluation-framework/ | title=Health Gradient &#124; EuroHealthNet}}</ref>
* The AIM framework. In a pilot study, researchers examined the role of AIM—ability, incentives, and management feedback—in reducing care disparity in pressure-ulcer detection between African American and Caucasian residents. The results showed that while the program was implemented, the provision of (1) training to enhance ability, (2) monetary incentives to enhance motivation, and (3) management feedback to enhance accountability led to successful reduction in pressure ulcers. Specifically, the detection gap between the two groups decreased. The researchers suggested additional replications with longer duration to assess the effectiveness of the AIM framework.
* Monitoring actions on the social determinants of health. In 2017, citing the need for accountability for the pledges made by countries in the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund called for the monitoring of intersectoral interventions on the social determinants of health that improve health equity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2471/BLT.16.184622 |pmid=29147060 |pmc=5677605 |url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/11/16-184622/en/ |title=The need to monitor actions on the social determinants of health |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=95 |issue=11 |pages=784–787 |year=2017 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Valentine |first2=Nicole |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan |last4=Hosseinpoor |first4=Ahmad Reza |last5=Neira |first5=Maria }}</ref>
*Changing the distribution of health services. Health services play a major role in health equity. Health inequities stem from lack of access to care due to poor economic status and an interaction among other [[social determinants of health]]. The majority of high quality health services are distributed among the wealthy people in society, leaving those who are poor with limited options. In order to change this fact and move towards achieving health equity, it is essential that health care increases in areas or neighborhoods consisting of low socioeconomic families and individuals.<ref name=":8" />
*Prioritize treatment among the poor. Because of the challenges that arise from accessing health care with low economic status, many illnesses and injuries go untreated or are not given sufficient treatment. Promoting treatment as a priority among the poor will give them the resources they need in order to achieve good health, because health is a basic human right.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8" />

==Health inequalities==
Health inequality is the term used in a number of countries to refer to those instances whereby the health of two demographic groups (not necessarily ethnic or racial groups) differs despite comparative access to health care services. Such examples include higher rates of [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] for those in lower occupational classes than those in higher occupational classes, and the increased likelihood of those from ethnic minorities being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. In [[Canada]], the issue was brought to public attention by the [[LaLonde report]].

In [[UK]], the [[Black Report]] was produced in 1980 to highlight inequalities. On 11 February 2010, Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an epidemiologist at University College London, published the ''Fair Society, Healthy Lives'' report on the relationship between health and poverty. Marmot described his findings as illustrating a "social gradient in health": the life expectancy for the poorest is seven years shorter than for the most wealthy, and the poor are more likely to have a disability. In its report on this study, ''The Economist'' argued that the material causes of this contextual health inequality include unhealthful lifestyles - smoking remains more common, and obesity is increasing fastest, amongst the poor in Britain.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15501633|title=In sickness and in health|journal=The Economist|date=11 February 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>

In June 2018, the [[European Commission]] launched the [[Joint Action Health Equity in Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/chafea/news/news599.html|title=IA new Joint Action to tackle health inequalities in Europe|date= 21–22 June 2018|publisher=The European Commission|accessdate=17 September 2018}}</ref> Forty-nine participants from 25 [[European Union]] Member States will work together to address health inequalities and the underlying [[social determinants of health]] across Europe. Under the coordination of the [[Istituto Superiore di Sanità|Italian Institute of Public Health]], the Joint Action aims to achieve greater equity in health in Europe across all social groups while reducing the inter-country heterogeneity in tackling health inequalities.

==Poor health and economic inequality==
[[Economic inequality#Health|Poor health outcomes appear to be an effect of economic inequality]] across a population. Nations and regions with greater economic inequality show poorer outcomes in life expectancy,<ref>Figure 1.1. Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press</ref> mental health,<ref>Figure 5.1. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010).

The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press</ref> educational performance, teenage birthrates, and ill health due to violence. On an international level, there is a positive correlation between developed countries with high economic equality and longevity. This is unrelated to average income per capita in wealthy nations.<ref>Figure 1.3. Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press.</ref> Economic gain only impacts life expectancy to a great degree in countries in which the mean per capita annual income is less than approximately $25,000.
The United States shows exceptionally low health outcomes for a developed country, despite having the highest national healthcare expenditure in the world. The US ranks 31st in life expectancy. Americans have a lower life expectancy than their European counterparts, even when factors such as race, income, diet, smoking, and education are controlled for.<ref>In Woolf, S. H., In Aron, L. Y., National Academies (U.S.)., & Institute of Medicine (U.S.). (2013). U.S. health in international perspective: Shorter lives, poorer health.</ref>

Relative inequality negatively affects health on an international, national, and institutional levels. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States. The patterns seen internationally hold true between more and less economically equal states in the United States, that is, more equal states show more desirable health outcomes. Importantly, inequality can have a negative health impact on members of lower echelons of institutions. The [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall I and II]] studies looked at the rates of cardiovascular disease and other health risks in British civil servants and found that, even when lifestyle factors were controlled for, members of lower status in the institution showed increased mortality and morbidity on a sliding downward scale from their higher status counterparts.
The negative aspects of inequality are spread across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels.<ref>Figure 13.2. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press</ref> This is also true of the difference between mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.<ref>Figure 13.3. Adapted from Wilkinson, R. G., & Pickett, K. (2010). The spirit level: Why greater equality makes societies stronger. New York: Bloomsbury Press</ref>
