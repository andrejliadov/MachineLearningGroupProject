== Immediate benefits ==

=== Brain activity ===

The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive effects on brain function on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level. According to a study done by the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia, even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing and memory functions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tomporowski |first1=Phillip D. |title=Effects of acute bouts of exercise on cognition |journal=Acta Psychologica |date=March 2003 |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=297–324 |doi=10.1016/s0001-6918(02)00134-8 |pmid=12595152 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595152 |issn=0001-6918}}</ref>

Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells.<ref>{{cite web |title=Physical Exercise for Brain Health |url=https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/everyday-brain-fitness/physical-exercise |website=Brain HQ |accessdate=18 May 2020}}</ref>

Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of important cortical areas of the brain. Research from UCLA demonstrated that exercise increased growth factors in the brain—making it easier for the brain to grow new neuronal connections.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Molteni |first1=R |last2=Zheng |first2=JQ |last3=Ying |first3=Z |last4=Gómez-Pinilla |first4=F |last5=Twiss |first5=JL |title=Voluntary exercise increases axonal regeneration from sensory neurons. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=1 June 2004 |volume=101 |issue=22 |pages=8473-8 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0401443101 |pmid=15159540|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or [[cognition]] for children 6 to 13 years of age and reduced short-term feelings of [[anxiety]] for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your [[thinking]], [[learning]], and [[judgment]] skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety and help you sleep better.<ref>{{cite web |title=Physical Activity Guidelines |url=https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf#page=39 |website=health.gov |accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Weight management ===

Both [[Dieting|diet]] and physical activity play a critical role in maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess body weight, or maintaining successful weight loss.<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits of Physical Activity |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm |website=CDC |accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref> Physical activity helps control weight by using excess [[calories]] that would otherwise be stored as [[fat]]. Most foods we eat contain calories, and everything we do uses calories, including [[sleeping]], [[breathing]], and [[digesting]] food. Balancing the calories we eat with the calories we use through physical activity will help us reach and maintain a healthy weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Physical Activity and Weight Control |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/weight-loss/physical-activity-and-weight-control/ |website=MentalHelp.net - An American Addiction Centers Resource |accessdate=18 May 2020}}</ref>

== Long-term benefits ==

The most common health risks include [[cardiovascular]] diseases, [[diabetes]] type 2 and some [[cancers]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Benefits of Physical Activity |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm |website=CDC |accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>

[[Obesity]] is a complex disease that affects whole body [[metabolism]] and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical exercise results in numerous health benefits and is an important tool to combat [[obesity]] and its co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Exercise prevents both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an important therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some benefits of exercise include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and the release of myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function. In this review we will discuss the mechanisms through which exercise promotes cardiovascular health.
Regular physical exercise has several beneficial effects on overall health. While decreasing body mass and adiposity are not the primary outcomes of exercise, exercise can mediate several diseases that accompany obesity including T2D and CVD.
Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity is associated with decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of heart failure, and improved overall survival.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular Biomarkers: New Insights, Recent Data, and Applications |publisher=Che L., Li D.

There are several risk factors leading to the development and progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle. A sedentary lifestyle can be characterized by both obesity and consistently low levels of physical activity. Thus, lifestyle interventions that aim to increase physical activity and decrease obesity are attractive therapeutic methods to combat most non-congenital types of CVD.<ref>{{cite document |title=Exercise Training Improves Cardiovascular Health |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

=== Cardiovascular Risk Factors ===

Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous health benefits to reduce the progression and development of obesity, T2D, and CVD. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions including moderate exercise and a healthy diet improve cardiovascular health in at-risk populations. Individuals with metabolic syndrome who participated in a 4 month program of either a diet (caloric restriction) or exercise intervention had reduced adiposity, decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lipid profiles compared to the control group. Both the diet and exercise intervention improve these cardiovascular outcomes to a similar extent.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}</ref>

Several previous studies have investigated the effects of diet and exercise, independently or in combination, on metabolic and cardiovascular health and have determined that diet, exercise, or a combination of diet and exercise induces weight loss, decreases visceral adiposity, lowers plasma triglycerides, plasma glucose, HDL levels, and blood pressure, and improves VO2max. Importantly, several of these beneficial effects of exercise are evident independent of weight loss. Studies have shown that exercise can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health independent of changes in body weight, including improved glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, blood pressure, and HDL levels. These data indicate exercise, independent of changes in body mass, results in significant improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic health. Although a detailed analysis of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have shown that cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet and exercise programs compared to either intervention alone.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}</ref>

Exercise has a similar effect on cardiovascular improvements in lean and overweight normoglycemic subjects. In a 1 year study of non-obese individuals, a 16–20% increase in energy expenditure (of any form of exercise) with no diet intervention resulted in a 22.3% decrease in body fat mass and reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and C-reactive protein concentrations, all risk factors associated with CVD. In overweight individuals, 7–9 months of low-intensity exercise (walking ~19 km per week at 40–55% VO2peak) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness compared to sedentary individuals. Together these data indicate that exercise interventions decrease the risk or severity of CVD in subjects who are lean, obese, or have type 2 diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}</ref>

=== Cardiac rehabilitation ===

Exercise is also an important [[therapeutic]] treatment for patients who have [[cardiovascular]] diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with [[atherosclerosis]] post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute [[myocardial]] infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms.<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

One defining characteristic of [[heart failure]] is [[exercise intolerance]], which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients, and this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of [[hospitalization]] and decreased rates of long-term [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). Other studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation at a moderate intensity in heart failure patients improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increases both exercise endurance capacity and VO2max (12–31% increase).<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

More recent studies have examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with heart failure. A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

== Other benefits ==
=== Bones and muscles===

Routine physical activity is important for building strong [[bones]] and [[muscles]] in children, but it is equally important as we get older.  Your bones and muscles work together to support every movement you make on a daily basis. When you are physically active you strengthen your muscles. Your bones adapt by building more cells and as a result both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improves balance and coordination. In addition active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved [[flexibility]]. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. Even if you have [[arthritis]], exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to every move you make without the hassle of an actual brace that you have to put on and take off.<ref>{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STRENGTHENS YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES |url=https://raleighboneandjoint.com/news/physical-activity-bones-muscles/ |website=theboneandjoint.com |accessdate=20 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Daily activity ===

The ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires strong muscles, balance and endurance. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscle strength, balance and endurance, all risk factors for falling. Balance plays an important role in everyday activities such as walking, getting up out of a chair or leaning over to pick up a grandchild. Balance problems can reduce your independence by interfering with activities of daily living. The good news is that participating in regular physical activity can significantly improve balance and reduce your risk for falling.<ref>{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FALL PREVENTION |url=https://fallpreventiontaskforce.org/fall-prevention-topics/physical-activity-fall-prevention/ |website=Fall prevention task force |accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Mental health ===

Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Exercise is also a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in our brain that energize our spirits and make us feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing us to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Mental benefits of exercize |url=https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm |website=HelpGuide.org |accessdate=27 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Sleep ===

Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercise may also reduce insomnia by decreasing arousal, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Insomnia is commonly linked with elevated arousal, anxiety, and depression, and exercise has strong effects on reducing these symptoms in the general population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exercize and Insomnia - Natural remedy |url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-does-exercise-help-those-chronic-insomnia |website=sleepfoundation.org |accessdate=27 May 2020}}</ref>

These issues count among the most common among most of population. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facts & Statistics about anxiety and depression |url=https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics |website=Anxiety and depression association of America |accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>

In a 1 year study of non-obese individuals, a 16–20% increase in energy expenditure (of any form of exercise) with no diet intervention resulted in a 22.3% decrease in body fat mass and reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and C-reactive protein concentrations, all risk factors associated with CVD. In overweight individuals, 7–9 months of low-intensity exercise (walking ~19 km per week at 40–55% VO2peak) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness compared to sedentary individuals. Together these data indicate that exercise interventions decrease the risk or severity of CVD in subjects who are lean, obese, or have type 2 diabetes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K.

=== Cardiac rehabilitation ===

Exercise is also an important [[therapeutic]] treatment for patients who have [[cardiovascular]] diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with [[atherosclerosis]] post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute [[myocardial]] infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms.<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

One defining characteristic of [[heart failure]] is [[exercise intolerance]], which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients, and this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of [[hospitalization]] and decreased rates of long-term [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). Other studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation at a moderate intensity in heart failure patients improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increases both exercise endurance capacity and VO2max (12–31% increase).<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

More recent studies have examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with heart failure. A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.<ref>{{cite document |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 }}</ref>

== Other benefits ==
=== Bones and muscles===

Routine physical activity is important for building strong [[bones]] and [[muscles]] in children, but it is equally important as we get older.  Your bones and muscles work together to support every movement you make on a daily basis. When you are physically active you strengthen your muscles. Your bones adapt by building more cells and as a result both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improves balance and coordination. In addition active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved [[flexibility]]. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. Even if you have [[arthritis]], exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to every move you make without the hassle of an actual brace that you have to put on and take off.<ref>{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STRENGTHENS YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES |url=https://raleighboneandjoint.com/news/physical-activity-bones-muscles/ |website=theboneandjoint.com |accessdate=20 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Daily activity ===

The ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires strong muscles, balance and endurance. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscle strength, balance and endurance, all risk factors for falling. Balance plays an important role in everyday activities such as walking, getting up out of a chair or leaning over to pick up a grandchild. Balance problems can reduce your independence by interfering with activities of daily living. The good news is that participating in regular physical activity can significantly improve balance and reduce your risk for falling.<ref>{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FALL PREVENTION |url=https://fallpreventiontaskforce.org/fall-prevention-topics/physical-activity-fall-prevention/ |website=Fall prevention task force |accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Mental health ===

Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Exercise is also a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in our brain that energize our spirits and make us feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing us to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Mental benefits of exercize |url=https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm |website=HelpGuide.org |accessdate=27 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Sleep ===

Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercise may also reduce insomnia by decreasing arousal, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Insomnia is commonly linked with elevated arousal, anxiety, and depression, and exercise has strong effects on reducing these symptoms in the general population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exercize and Insomnia - Natural remedy |url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-does-exercise-help-those-chronic-insomnia |website=sleepfoundation.org |accessdate=27 May 2020}}</ref>

These issues count among the most common among most of population. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facts & Statistics about anxiety and depression |url=https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics |website=Anxiety and depression association of America |accessdate=15 May 2020}}</ref>
