The '''Falsified Medicines Directive''' is a legal framework introduced by the [[European Commission]], to improve the protection of [[public health]] within the [[European Union]]. The directive applies since 2 January 2013.  The European Commission Delegated Regulation, (EU) 2016/161, supplements Directive 2001/83/EC with rules regarding safety features for the packaging of medicinal products for human use. The regulation was adopted in October 2015. Measures to counteract to fake medicines include stricter record-keeping of wholesale distributors, tougher inspections of pharmaceutical producers, an EU-wide quality mark to identify online pharmacies and obligatory safety features on packages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/special_topics/general/general_content_000186.jsp|title=European Medicines Agency - Public health threats - Falsified medicines|website=www.ema.europa.eu|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>
