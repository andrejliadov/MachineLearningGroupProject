[[Food]] may be accidentally or deliberately contaminated by [[microbiology|microbiological]], chemical or physical hazards. In contrast to microbiologically caused foodborne illness, the link between exposure and effect of chemical hazards in foods is usually complicated by cumulative low doses and the delay between exposure and the onset of symptoms. Chemical hazards include environmental contaminants, food ingredients (such as iodine), heavy metals, [[mycotoxins]], natural toxins, improper storage, processing contaminants, and veterinary medicines. Incidents have occurred because of poor harvesting or storage of grain, use of banned veterinary products, industrial discharges, [[human error]] and deliberate adulteration and fraud.<ref name=Thomson2012>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1757-837X.2012.00129.x |title=Incidents and impacts of unwanted chemicals in food and feeds |year=2012 |last1=Thomson |first1=Barbara |last2=Poms |first2=Roland |last3=Rose |first3=Martin |journal=Quality Assurance and Safety of Crops & Foods |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=77–92}}</ref>

== Definition of an incident ==
An "incident" of chemical food contamination may be defined as an episodic occurrence of adverse health effects in humans (or animals that might be consumed by humans) following high exposure to particular chemicals, or instances where episodically high concentrations of chemical hazards were detected in the food chain and traced back to a particular event.<ref name=Thomson2012/>

== Socio-economic impacts ==
Information on the impacts of these incidents is fragmentary and unsystematic, ranging from thousands of dollars to meet the cost of monitoring analysis, to many millions of dollars due to court prosecutions, bankruptcy, product disposal, compensation for revenue loss, damage to brand or reputation, or loss of life.<ref name=Thomson2012/>

==List of notable incidents==

===Ancient times===
*Roman Empire – There is speculation that the Romans, in particular the elite, suffered chronic to severe lead poisoning due to the ubiquity of lead in e.g. lined pots in which acidic foodstuffs were boiled, over and above any mere exposure to lead in water pipes. They also used [[Lead(II) acetate|sugar of lead]] to sweeten their wines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://io9.com/5877587/the-first-artificial-sweetener-poisoned-lots-of-romans|title=The first artificial sweetener poisoned lots of Romans|first=Keith |last=Veronese|date=Jan 20, 2012|work=io9.com}}</ref>

===1900 to 1949===
*1900 - [[1900 English beer poisoning]] - Beer contaminated with [[arsenic]]. Traced to sugar manufactured with sulphuric acid that was naturally contaminated with arsenic from Spanish [[pyrites]].

*1920 – In South Africa, 80 people suffered poisoning from eating bread contaminated with naturally occurring [[pyrrolizidine alkaloid]]s.<ref name=Kakar2010/>
*1900s–49 – [[Agene process]]; Severe and widespread [[neurological disorder]]s due to bread flour bleached with [[Nitrogen trichloride|agene]], a process no longer in use. The denatured protein in the treated flour is toxic and causes a condition of hysteria in dogs eating biscuits made from the flour.{{cn|date=June 2019}}
*1930s – A striking example of OPIDN [[Organophosphate poisoning]] occurred during the 1930s Prohibition Era when thousands of men in the American South and Midwest developed arm and leg weakness and pain after drinking a "medicinal" alcohol substitute called "[[Jamaica ginger|Ginger Jake]]", which contained an adulterated Jamaican ginger extract containing [[tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate]] (TOCP), which resulted in partially reversible neurologic damage. The damage resulted in the limping "Jake Leg" or "Jake Walk" which were terms frequently used in the blues music of the period. Europe experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated [[abortifacient]]s. Morocco experienced outbreaks of TOCP poisoning from contaminated cooking oil.
*1942 – Prisoners at the [[Vapniarka concentration camp]], in present day Ukraine, were fed a diet containing significant quantities of ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]'', a species of [[pea]] that was normally used to feed [[livestock]]. A team of doctors among the inmates, led by Dr. Arthur Kessler of [[Chernivtsi|Cernăuţi]], reached the conclusion that the disease presented all the symptoms of [[lathyrism]],<ref>[http://www.clima.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/919796/Kessler.pdf "Dr. Arthur Kessler (1903-2000)"], in ''Lathyrus Lathyrism Newsletter'', Vol. 3, pp. 3–4; [[Dennis Deletant]], ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940-1944''.

Within a few weeks, the first symptoms of the disease appeared, affecting the [[bone marrow]] of prisoners and causing paralysis. By January 1943, hundreds of prisoners were suffering from lathyrism.

===1950 to 2000===
*1951 - [[1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass poisoning]] in France, probably caused by [[Ergot]].

*1955 – [[Morinaga Milk arsenic poisoning incident]]: Arsenic in milk powder in Japan. An industrial grade of [[Monosodium phosphate]] additive which inadvertently contained 5–8% [[arsenic]], was added to milk fed to infants.

*1957 – Millions of chickens died after eating [[dioxin]]-contaminated feed, and 300,000 more were destroyed to prevent consumption.

Italy ships more wine to the United States than any other wine-producing nation, but most of its wine exports go to France and Germany, in that order, much of it in bulk for use in cutting domestic wines with higher-alcohol Italian varieties. It is far worse in scale than the scandal that virtually eliminated Austrian wines from the market last year. Some Austrian wine makers were found to have added ethylene glycol, a toxic, sweetening element, to their wines, and the discovery wiped out export sales. Ethylene glycol is also used in antifreeze.
