'''Joyce Echaquan''' was a 37-year-old [[Atikamekw]] woman who died on September 28, 2020 in the Centre hospitalier de Lanaudière in [[Saint-Charles-Borromée]], [[Quebec]]. Before her death, she recorded a [[Facebook Live]] video that showed her screaming in distress and healthcare workers abusing her.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Feith|first=Jesse|date=2020-09-30|title=Indigenous woman records slurs by hospital staff before her death|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/indigenous-woman-who-died-at-joliette-hospital-had-recorded-staffs-racist-comments|access-date=2020-09-30|website=[[Montreal Gazette]]}}</ref><ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54350027|title=Joyce Echaquan: Outcry in Canada over treatment of dying indigenous woman|date=30 September 2020|access-date=30 September 2020|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]}} </ref><ref name="leadersdiscuss">{{Cite news|title=Federal ministers, Indigenous leaders plan to discuss systemic racism in health system {{!}} CBC News|language=en-US|work=CBC|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/marc-miller-joyce-echaquan-1.5755912|access-date=2020-10-08}}</ref>

== Incident ==
Echaquan, a mother of seven from [[Manawan]], was admitted to the hospital on September 26, 2020 for stomach pains.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Shingler|first=Benjamin|date=2020-09-20|title=Investigations launched after Atikamekw woman records Quebec hospital staff uttering slurs before her death|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-atikamekw-joliette-1.5743449|access-date=2020-10-04|website=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> She had prior heart complications that required a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]. Echaquan was given [[morphine]] on September 28, despite her concerns that she would have an adverse reaction to it.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kirkup|first=Kirsty|last2=Thanh Ha|first2=Tu|date=2020-09-29|title=Indigenous woman records slurs, taunts of Quebec hospital staff before her death|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-indigenous-woman-records-slurs-taunts-of-quebec-hospital-staff-before/|access-date=2020-10-04|website=[[Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> She had also been restrained to her hospital bed.

Due to Echaquan not trusting the hospital staff and not being fluent in French, she would often record Facebook Live videos during her hospital visits and have her cousin interpret for her.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kestler-D’Amours|first=Jillian|date=2020-10-06|title=Indigenous Peoples Fear Racism in Hospitals.

Echaquan livestreamed for seven minutes on September 28. During the livestream, at least two hospital employees are heard insulting her in French. While Echaquan was moaning in pain, an employee asked her if she is "done acting stupid." Another employee told Echaquan that she "made some bad choices" and asked what her children would be thinking if they saw her,<ref name=":1" /> where she quietly responded with: "That's why I came here."<ref name=":0" /> Echaquan was also told that she is only "good for sex," the employees were the ones "paying for this,"<ref name=":1" /> and that she was "stupid as hell."<ref name=":2" /> Echaquan died shortly after posting the video online on Sept. 28. According to her family, she was allergic to morphine.

A prior incident where Echaquan was mistreated by the hospital staff occurred in late August 2020. 33-year-old Jennifer Mac Donald, a patient attendant at a local [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] centre who was at the hospital to support her father, overheard Echaquan screaming in a nearby cubicle and expressing concerns about her treatment. Mac Donald described Echaquan's medical attendants as "indifferent" and "verbally aggressive." They were ignoring Echaquan's pleas and one attendant eventually asked out loud: "Will she ever shut up?" At one point, Mac Donald approached Echaquan to see if she could help, but was told by staff to "mind her own business." Mac Donald did not know the woman being mistreated in August was Echaquan until she saw the Facebook livestream and recognized her.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Feith|first=Jesse|date=2020-10-01|title=Hospital staff ignored Echaquan's pleas for help in August, woman says|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/hospital-staff-ignored-echaquans-pleas-for-help-in-august-woman-says|access-date=2020-10-01|website=Montreal Gazette}}</ref>
