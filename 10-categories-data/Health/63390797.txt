==== Response and impact ====
According to a [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] report by Frank Newport "the most dramatic result (in religion) has been the exceedingly quick shift of religious services from in-person to online worship." While for almost a hundred years, churches have used various communication methods to reach their audiences, such as radio, television and online media, Gallup says that the halting of in-person worship "is one of the most significant sudden disruptions in the practice of religion in U.S. history."<ref name="gallup1">{{cite web|url=https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/307619/religion-covid-virus.aspx |title=Religion and the COVID-19 Virus in the U.S |publisher=News.gallup.com |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref> A [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research]] report from March 2020 reported a change in their religious habits due to the pandemic. More than half of respondents said that they have "prayed for an end to the spread of coronavirus," "attended services in person less often," and "watched religious services online or on TV instead of in person."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/03/30/most-americans-say-coronavirus-outbreak-has-impacted-their-lives |title=Most Americans Say Coronavirus Outbreak Has Impacted Their Lives &#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewsocialtrends.org |date=2020-03-30 |accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine reported that drive-in church services have achieved a great level of attendance in the COVID-19 outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5811387/drive-in-church-coronavirus/|title='Come As You Are in the Family Car.'

In a survey conducted in late May–early June 2020 by the American Enterprise Institute, 60% of Americans said they feared that they or someone in their household might get COVID-19. Responses differed demographically, however; 69% of Black Protestants and 42% of white evangelicals worried about infection. When it came to weighing the public health risks of returning to normal economic activity, a majority of Black Protestants (84%) and Hispanic Catholics (70%) said they would prioritize public health, while a majority of white evangelicals (65%) and white mainline Protestants and white Catholics (52%) prioritized the economy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kuruvilla|first=Carol|date=2020-06-27|title=Study: White Evangelicals Aren't As Worried About COVID-19 As Other Faith Groups|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-evangelicals-coronavirus-less-worried_n_5ef375b0c5b601e5995762fd|access-date=2020-06-28|website=HuffPost|language=en}}</ref>

{{quotation|The point of lament, woven thus into the fabric of the biblical tradition, is not just that it's an outlet for our frustration, sorrow, loneliness and sheer inability to understand what is happening or why. The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person—the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about—he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit "groaning" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. —[[N.T. Wright]], Anglican bishop and University of Oxford professor<ref name="Wright2020"/>}}

=====Shincheonji Church of Jesus=====
{{update|section|date=August 2020}}
A South Korean Christian [[new religious movement]] known as ''Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony'' (in short, [[Shincheonji]]). On February 19, 2020. At that date, news spread that one of its members in Daegu, South Korea, had been infected with COVID-19. She had been wrongly released from the hospital after having been diagnosed with a common cold, and allowed to participate in her religion’s gatherings. Patient 31 was later blamed for not submitting to the test before. Some Korean media reported that she refused the test twice. She told a different story. On February 7, she was admitted to Saeronan Korean Medicine Hospital for a minor car accident and shortly thereafter started showing symptoms of cold. The X-ray results showed she had pneumonia, but according to Patient 31 the hospital did not mention COVID-19 as a possibility to her, nor suggested a test. With permission for the hospital to go out, she attended a church service. Only the following week, after her symptoms worsened, a test for COVID-19 was recommended on February 17, and she accepted to be tested, was found positive, and quarantined. That, when quarantined, she started screaming and assaulted the nurse in charge in the hospital, was reported by some media but denied by both Patient 31 and the nurse. After Patient 31 tested positive, Shincheonji church members were massively tested for COVID-19, which resulted in many confirmed cases. This gave the Korean media the opportunity to start a campaign against Shincheonji as a “secretive cult” that endangered public health.

Despite the fact that “Gyeonggi Governor Lee Jae-myung stormed into the residence of the church’s leader in the middle of the night to snatch a full list of its followers in the province,” and “even boasted of his ‘heroic feat’ on social media,” no discrepancies were found there either (Lee H. 2020). It is another indication of the climate prevailing in South Korea that the Justice Minister and the Mayor of Seoul, who had both jumped on the anti-Shincheonji bandwagon prior to the elections, rather than accepting that by comparing the lists supplied Shincheonji and the COVID-19 Epidemic: Sorting Fact from Fiction $ The Journal of CESNUR | 4/3 (2020) 70—86 83 by Shincheonji and those seized by the authorities no significant discrepancies had emerged, attacked and threatened South Korea’s chief prosecutor Yoon Seok-youl (already at odds with them for having investigated corruption in their party) for being “soft” on Shincheonji (Kim 2020). At the time of this writing, the campaign against Shincheonji continues, although it is increasingly criticized by media both outside (Rashid 2020) and inside (Lee H. 2020) South Korea. In a document published in March 2020, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan body whose members are appointed by the President of the United States and the congressional leaders of both political parties, noted that Shincheonji was
suffering. We wholeheartedly subscribe to the appeal of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, which is concerned by reports that Shincheonji church members are being blamed for the spread of the #coronavirus. We urge the South Korean government to condemn scapegoating and to respect religious freedom as it responds to the outbreak (U.S.
Commission on International Religious Freedom 2020a). The virus cannot be an excuse to violate the human rights and religious liberty of hundreds of thousands of believers.

Venerable [[Phra Paisal Visalo]], a respected monk in [[Theravadin]] tradition, offers a Buddhist perspective on this turbulent situation, “We have to find a careful balance between carelessness and craziness. We should be aware that the coronavirus is not the only dangerous virus that is spreading in our society. Fear is also harming our minds and affecting our humility, causing us to become selfish and to look down on those who are infected. Therefore, recognizing that we need to act to prevent COVID-19 from infecting our body, we should also ensure that we prevent our fear of COVID-19 from infecting our mind. Let’s support each other on both levels. This situation has great potential to help each of us to reduce our selfish behaviors and attitudes and increase our generosity in support of each other. We need to stay connected and encourage people to express their goodness from within, which ultimately helps others.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/senior-thai-monk-offers-a-buddhist-perspective-on-dealing-with-covid-19|title=Unity and Interdependence: Joining Together Through Our Crisis|website=buddhistdoor.net|accessdate=31 July 2020}}</ref>

The national office of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations is strongly recommending that congregations plan for ongoing virtual gathering and operations through May 2021.

The church in fact provided sound advice to prevent infection and maintain health during the COVID-19 crisis, while also cancelling all church gatherings. A bulletin published by the Church of Scientology on the pandemic quoted L. Ron Hubbard who believed in the motto that “an ounce of prevention is worth a ton of cure.” The church stated in the bulletin, “How about a ton of prevention so as not to require an ounce of cure?”<ref>https://cesnur.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tjoc_4_4_1_soryte.pdf</ref>

The [[First Liberty Institute]], a non-profit legal firm based in the United States, has issued guidance for religious institutions related to the suspension of their work during the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref name="Parke2020"/>

California reported over 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) and more than 4,000 deaths. To protect public health, the state ordered that nonessential retail and worship services halt for more than two months. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued an order limiting congregations to the lower of 100 attendees or 25% of capacity. South Bay United Pentecostal Church sued to remove the limits, stating that its services typically attract 200 to 300 congregants. Noting that “Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports and theatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time,” the United States Supreme Court upheld the state's right to impose limits on congregations as well as secular activities in the protection of public health. The Court held that
<blockquote>
"Although California's guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment...

In April 2020, the United States Justice Department stated that the "government may not impose social restrictions on religious activity that do not also apply to similar nonreligious activity" in response to the citation of Temple Baptist Church members in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]], [[Mississippi]] for holding parking lot worship services. The congregants listened to the church sermon over car radios while remaining in their cars. The Greenville churchgoers were fined $500 per person.
