'''Dignity of risk''' is the idea that [[self-determination]] and the right to take reasonable risks are essential for [[dignity]] and [[self esteem]] and so should not be impeded by excessively-cautious [[caregiver]]s, concerned about their [[duty of care]].

The concept is applicable to adults who are under care such as [[elderly care|elderly]] people,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-22/risky-activities-could-improve-quality-of-life-for-elderly/6939166 |author=Norman Hermant |title=Dignity of Risk: Elderly should be allowed to do 'risky' activities to improve lifestyle, professor says - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2015-11-22 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}</ref> people living with [[disabled |disability]],<ref name=Coda>{{cite web |url=http://codasouth.org/807-2/ |title=Duty of Care and Dignity of Risk - Coda South - Choice.

== History ==
The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article ''The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded'' by Robert Perske:
<blockquote>Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not – this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety!<ref name=Perske>{{cite journal|last1=Perske|first1=R|title=The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded.|journal=Mental Retardation|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–7|pmid=5059995}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1980, the concept was relied upon by [[Julian Wolpert]], Professor of Geography, Public Affairs, and Urban Planning at [[Princeton University]], to support his argument in a paper, "The Dignity of Risk",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wolpert |first1=Julian |authorlink1=Julian Wolpert |title=The Dignity of Risk |journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers |date=1980 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=391–401 |doi=10.2307/622018 |jstor=622018 }}</ref> which has since been described as "seminal".<ref name="vb and vb">{{cite journal |last1=von Benzon |first1=Nadia |last2=van Blerk |first2=Lorraine |title=Research relationships and responsibilities: 'Doing' research with 'vulnerable' participants: introduction to the special edition |journal=Social & Cultural Geography |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=895–905 |doi=10.1080/14649365.2017.1346199 |url=http://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/18221200/author_final_version_S_and_C_si_editorial.pdf }}</ref> Wolpert's argument was that a paternalistic approach to people living with disability, prioritizing safeguarding over the rights of individuals to independent decision-making, is a limitation on personal freedom.<ref name="vb and vb"/>

==Conflict with duty of care==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Allowing people under care to take risks is often perceived to be in conflict with the caregivers' [[duty of care]]. Finding a balance between these competing considerations can be difficult when formulating policies and guidelines for caregiving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interchangewa.org.au/opinion/duty-care-dignity-risk/ |title=Duty of care and the dignity of risk &#124; Interchange |publisher=Interchangewa.org.au |date=2016-05-04 |author=Wendel Bamford |accessdate=2017-04-19}}</ref><ref name=Coda/><ref name=Perske/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2016/05/11/balancing-act-dignity-risk-vs-duty-care/ |author=Jackie Keast |title=A balancing act: dignity of risk vs. duty of care |publisher=Australian Ageing Agenda |date=2016-05-11 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Joseph E|last2=Davis|first2=Marie-Claire|title=Impediments to applying the 'dignity of risk' principle in residential aged care services|journal=Australasian Journal on Ageing|date=September 2013|volume=32|issue=3|pages=188–193|doi=10.1111/ajag.12014|pmid=24028460|s2cid=206981816}}</ref>

==Problems of overprotection==
[[File:Wheelchair rugby game 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wheelchair rugby]] is a [[contact sport|full contact sport]] played by wheelchair users. In spite of the protective features of the wheelchairs, the risk of injury is significant.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bauerfeind|first1=Joanna|last2=Koper|first2=Magdalena|last3=Wieczorek|first3=Jacek|last4=Urbański|first4=Piotr|last5=Tasiemski|first5=Tomasz|title=Sports Injuries in Wheelchair Rugby – A Pilot Study|journal=Journal of Human Kinetics|date=1 January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|pages=123–132|doi=10.1515/hukin-2015-0098|pmid=26834880|pmc=4721614}}</ref>]]
Overprotection of people with disabilities causes low [[self-esteem]] and underachievement because of lowered expectations that come with overprotection. Internalisation of low expectations causes the person with a disability to believe that they are less capable than others in similar situations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=KY|title=Overprotection and lowered expectations of persons with disabilities: the unforeseen consequences.|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|date=2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=181–8|pmid=16971765}}</ref>

In elderly people, overprotection can result in learned dependency and a decreased ability for [[self-care]]:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kennie|first1=David C.|title=Preventive care for elderly people|url=https://archive.org/details/preventivecarefo0000kenn|url-access=registration|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Angleterre|isbn=9780521436298|page=[https://archive.org/details/preventivecarefo0000kenn/page/24 24]}}</ref>

"It is possible to deliver physical care that has positive outcomes and returns a person to full function, yet, if during that care they have not been involved, allowed to make choices and respectfully assisted with activities of daily living, it may be possible to cause psychological damage through undermining that person's dignity."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Mitchell|first2=Theresa|title=growing old with dignity: a concept analysis|journal=Nursing Older People|date=June 2002|volume=14|issue=4|pages=19–21|doi=10.7748/nop2002.06.14.4.19.c2212|pmid=12094515}}</ref>

== Independent living ==
The right to fail and the dignity of risk is one of the basic tenets of the philosophy of the [[independent living|independent living movement]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deegan|first1=Patricia E.|title=The Independent Living Movement and people with psychiatric disabilities: Taking back control over our own lives.|journal=Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal|date=1992|volume=15|issue=3|pages=3–19|doi=10.1037/h0095769}}</ref>

== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ==
The first of eight "guiding principles" of the United Nations' [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] states: "Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices, and independence of persons."<ref>{{cite web|title=Guiding Principles of the Convention |publisher=United Nations - Division for Social Policy and Development |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/guiding-principles-of-the-convention.html|website=www.un.org}}</ref>
