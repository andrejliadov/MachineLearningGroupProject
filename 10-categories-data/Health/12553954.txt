The term '''military medicine''' has a number of potential connotations. It may mean:

*A medical specialty, specifically a branch of [[occupational medicine]] attending to the medical risks and needs (both preventive and interventional) of soldiers, sailors and other service members. This disparate arena has historically involved the prevention and treatment of [[infectious disease]]s (especially [[tropical disease]]s), and, in the 20th Century, the ergonomics and health effects of operating military-specific machines and equipment such as submarines, tanks, helicopters and airplanes. [[Diving medicine|Undersea]] and [[aviation medicine]] can be understood as subspecialties of military medicine, or in any case originated as such. Few countries certify or recognize "military medicine" as a formal speciality or subspeciality in its own right.
* The planning and practice of the surgical management of mass battlefield casualties and the logistical and administrative considerations of establishing and operating [[combat support hospitals]]. This involves military medical hierarchies, especially the organization of structured medical command and administrative systems that interact with and support deployed [[combat unit]]s. (See [[Battlefield medicine]].)
* The administration and practice of health care for military service members and their dependents in non-deployed (peacetime) settings. This may (as in the [[United States]]) consist of a medical system paralleling all the medical specialties and sub-specialties that exist in the civilian sector. (See also [[Veterans Health Administration]] which serves U.S. veterans.)
* Medical [[research and development]] specifically bearing upon problems of military medical interest. Historically, this encompasses all of the medical advances emerging from medical research efforts directed at addressing the problems encountered by deployed military forces (e.g., vaccines or drugs for soldiers, [[medical evacuation]] systems, drinking water [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], etc.) many of which ultimately prove important beyond the purely military considerations that inspired them.

==Legal status==
Military medical personnel engage in [[humanitarianism (international humanitarian law)|humanitarian]] work and are "[[protected persons]]" under [[international humanitarian law]] in accordance with the [[First Geneva Convention|First]] and [[Second Geneva Convention]]s and their Additional Protocols, which established legally binding rules guaranteeing neutrality and protection for wounded soldiers, field or ship's medical personnel, and specific humanitarian institutions in an [[armed conflict]]. International humanitarian law makes no distinction between medical personnel who are members of the [[armed forces]] (and who hold military ranks) and those who are civilian volunteers. All medical personnel are considered [[non-combatant]]s under international humanitarian law because of their humanitarian duties, and they may not be attacked and not be taken as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]; hospitals and other medical facilities and transports identified as such, whether they are military or civilian, may not be attacked either. The [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|red cross, the red crescent and the red crystal]] are the [[protective sign]]s recognised under international humanitarian law, and are used by military medical personnel and facilities for this purpose. Attacking military medical personnel, patients in their care, or medical facilities or transports legitimately marked as such is a [[war crime]]. Likewise, misusing these protective signs to mask military operations is the war crime of [[perfidy]]. Military medical personnel may be armed, usually with [[service pistol]]s, for the purpose of [[self defense]] or the defense of patients.

==Historical significance==
The significance of military medicine for combat strength goes far beyond treatment of battlefield injuries; in every major war fought until the late 19th century disease claimed more soldier casualties than did enemy action. During the [[American Civil War]] (1860–65), for example, about twice as many soldiers died of disease as were killed or mortally wounded in combat.<ref>{{cite book|last=McPherson|first=James M.|year=1988|title=Battlecry of Freedom|publisher=Ballantine Books, New York|isbn=0-345-35942-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/battlecryoffreed00jame}}, p. 485</ref> The [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) is considered to have been the first conflict in which combat injury exceeded disease, at least in the German coalition army which lost 3.47% of its average headcount to combat and only 1.82% to disease.<ref>''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon]]''; 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 8, p. 939.</ref> In new world countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, military physicians and surgeons contributed significantly to the development of civilian health care.<ref>Vivian Charles McAlister.
