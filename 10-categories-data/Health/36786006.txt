'''Life Study'''  is a cross-disciplinary research study that will look at the health and wellbeing of thousands of children across the UK. It will collect a large amount of information on the health, growth and life factors of a new [[generation]] of children born in the [[UK]].<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2930109.ece "Womb-to-tomb study for 1 in 10 babies" The Times, March 2,2011]</ref>  
This study will create a large storehouse of social, [[medical]] and environmental information and linked routine health data for use by UK [[academics]] and policy communities. The information in this storehouse resource will help answer questions regarding early life development of health and disease, and physical, [[psychological]] and social [[well-being]].

It is funded by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), [[ESRC|Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) and [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) academics from the Institute of Child Health's Paediatric Epidemiology Unit at [[University College London]] (UCL) are leading the study,<ref>MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health

==Aims and objectives==

The study aims to understand how biological and environmental factors interact with a baby's early life experiences and the outcomes this has later in life. The study will cover five main research themes:

* Inequalities, [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including ethnic) and social changes in this new generation of UK children
* Early life factors of school readiness and later educational performance
* Development beginnings of health and illness in [[childhood]]
* Social, [[emotional]] and [[mental development]]: the interaction between the child and parent
* Neighbourhoods and the surrounding environment: effects on child and family

==Comparison with past UK cohort studies==
This will be the fifth UK birth cohort study (beginning in 1946) which have followed the lives of children from birth to adult life. As was the case with these earlier studies, Life Study will provide a wide range of new information into the health, growth and life factors of this new generation of UK children.

==Life study update==
The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) discontinued Research Councilsâ€™ funding for Life Study in early 2016 due to the challenges encountered in recruiting participants.
