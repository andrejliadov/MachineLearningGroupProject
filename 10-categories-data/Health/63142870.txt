The British-registered {{ship||Diamond Princess|ship|2}} was the first cruise ship to have a major outbreak on board, with the ship [[quarantine]]d at [[Port of Yokohama|Yokohama]] from 4 February 2020 for approximately one month.  Over 700 people [[COVID-19 pandemic on Diamond Princess|became infected]], and 14 people died.

Governments and ports responded by [[#Docking restrictions|preventing]] many cruise ships from docking and [[#Government travel advisories|advising]] people to avoid travelling on cruise ships.  Similarly, [[#Cruise line suspensions|many cruise lines suspended]] their operations to mitigate the spread of the pandemic.

{{As of|2020|05|02}}, over 40 cruise ships have had [[#Summary of confirmed cases on board|confirmed positive cases]] of coronavirus on board.

The cruise ship ''[[World Dream]]'' (registered in the Bahamas, operated by [[Dream Cruises]]) was on a journey from [[Nansha District|Nansha]] Port, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, to Nha Trang and Da Nang in Vietnam during 19–24 January 2020 with 6,903 persons on board including 108 from Hubei, in which 28 were from Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1644114654_m61ff32de02000wbav.html|title=世界梦号邮轮已有11人确诊 途中最后一夜狂欢视频曝光|publisher=新京报|date=8 February 2020|access-date=19 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319084334/https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1644114654_m61ff32de02000wbav.html|archive-date=19 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 24 January 2020, the ship returned to Nansha Port. Port customs performed a temperature check for all disembarking passengers and crew, with 31 people sampled and tested for the virus, including those who had fever during the cruise and those who were in close contact with confirmed cases before they boarded for the cruise. All the test results were negative though some of them were later confirmed to be infected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2020/02/07/686085.html|title=危险无人察觉："世界梦号"豪华邮轮疫情始末|publisher=新京报|date=7 February 2020|author=李云蝶|access-date=19 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331183455/http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2020/02/07/686085.html|archive-date=31 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 24 January 2020 and 2 February 2020, the ship made three additional cruises out of Guangzhou or Hong Kong, including two "cruises to nowhere" and one to the Philippines, although passengers from the journey were not disembarked at Manila due to local resident protests over fear on the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E7%AA%81%E7%99%BC/430817/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A2%E8%99%9F%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1%E6%97%85%E7%A8%8B%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%9C%AA%E6%98%8E-%E9%80%B1%E6%9C%AB%E9%81%8A%E8%87%B3%E5%B0%91%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%83%E4%BA%BA%E7%99%BB%E6%B8%AF%E5%B2%B8|title=【武漢肺炎】世界夢號三次旅程資料未明週末遊至少三千人登港岸|publisher=HK01|date=6 February 2020|access-date=19 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319084337/https://www.hk01.com/%E7%AA%81%E7%99%BC/430817/%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E-%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%A4%A2%E8%99%9F%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1%E6%97%85%E7%A8%8B%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%E6%9C%AA%E6%98%8E-%E9%80%B1%E6%9C%AB%E9%81%8A%E8%87%B3%E5%B0%91%E4%B8%89%E5%8D%83%E4%BA%BA%E7%99%BB%E6%B8%AF%E5%B2%B8|archive-date=19 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 March the ship disembarked more than 350 passengers, from the United States and Canada only, at [[Marseille]], France.

At [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]], the passengers were met by people with [[hazmat suit]]s to check their body temperatures, perform visual assessment and ask if any had COVID-19 symptoms. Those without symptoms were to go to customs and then take their baggage.

On 11 March 2020, [[Viking Cruises]] suspended operations for its 79-vessel fleet until the end of April, cancelling all ocean and river cruises, after it was revealed that a passenger on a cruise in Cambodia had been exposed to the virus while in transit via plane, placing at least 28 other passengers in quarantine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|title=My Trip – Updates on Current Sailings|website=vikingrivercruises.com.au|access-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312181910/https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |title=Viking Cruises suspended operations worldwide due to the coronavirus, as infections ravage the cruise industry |first=Bill |last=Bostock |website=Business Insider |date=12 March 2020 |access-date=12 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312174617/https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |archive-date=12 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Crew strandings and repatriations==

After disembarking passengers, many cruise ships remained docked or at sea near ports with crew members still aboard, in some cases unpaid though with free room and board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/05/03/849732492/many-crews-remain-aboard-cruise-ships-after-passengers-evacuated|title=Many Crews Remain Aboard Cruise Ships After Passengers Evacuated|website=NPR.org}}</ref> Crew members are generally citizens of many different countries, aside from those where the ship is registered, based, or temporarily stopped. Especially with pandemic-related travel restrictions and concerns about onboard outbreaks, crew members could not simply disembark and fly home. After some negotiations, most cruise companies made special arrangements to allow crew members to take charter flights to their home countries. In some cases, the ships themselves were used to transport crew members to home countries directly.<ref name="herald_unhappy">{{cite web | last1=Charles | first1=Jacqueline | last2=Dolven | first2=Taylor | title=Cruise lines finally repatriating workers stranded by COVID-19.

== Hazard controls ==
{{Further|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}
According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], proper [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard controls]] for cruise ships and other commercial vessels include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.  Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/maritime/recommendations-for-ships.html|title=Interim Guidance for Ships on Managing Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019|date=2020-02-18|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2020-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301220052/https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/maritime/recommendations-for-ships.html|archive-date=1 March 2020|url-status=live}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

==Financial fallout==
{{See also|Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|Financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic}}
Cruise line stock fell sharply on 27 March 2020 when the US$2 trillion relief package passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] excluded companies that are not "organized" under United States law. [[Carnival Corporation & plc]] is registered in Panama, England and Wales; [[Royal Caribbean International]] is chartered in Liberia, and [[Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings]] is domiciled in Bermuda. Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]], (D-RI), tweeted: "The giant cruise companies incorporate overseas to dodge US taxes, flag vessels overseas to avoid US taxes and laws, and pollute without offset. Why should we bail them out?" Senator [[Josh Hawley]] (R-MO) tweeted that cruise lines should register and pay taxes in the United States if they expect a financial bailout. U.S-based employees and American-owned passenger ships will still be eligible for financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web |website=Associated Press |title=Cruise stocks sink after missing out on economic-relief bill |first1=David |last1=Koening |first2=Kevin |last2=Freking |name-list-style=amp |date=27 March 2020 |url=https://apnews.com/819d004059e6b165d9509f2d346a7d41 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329192618/https://apnews.com/819d004059e6b165d9509f2d346a7d41 |archive-date=29 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Carnival Cruise Line]] stock fell 75% between 1 January and 31 March 2020 and dividend payments to shareholders were suspended.

The cruise ship ''[[World Dream]]'' (registered in the Bahamas, operated by [[Dream Cruises]]) was on a journey from [[Nansha District|Nansha]] Port, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China, to Nha Trang and Da Nang in Vietnam during 19–24 January 2020 with 6,903 persons on board including 108 from Hubei, in which 28 were from Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1644114654_m61ff32de02000wbav.html|title=世界梦号邮轮已有11人确诊 途中最后一夜狂欢视频曝光|publisher=新京报|date=8 February 2020|access-date=19 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319084334/https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1644114654_m61ff32de02000wbav.html|archive-date=19 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 24 January 2020, the ship returned to Nansha Port. Port customs performed a temperature check for all disembarking passengers and crew, with 31 people sampled and tested for the virus, including those who had fever during the cruise and those who were in close contact with confirmed cases before they boarded for the cruise. All the test results were negative though some of them were later confirmed to be infected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2020/02/07/686085.html|title=危险无人察觉："世界梦号"豪华邮轮疫情始末|publisher=新京报|date=7 February 2020|author=李云蝶|access-date=19 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331183455/http://www.bjnews.com.cn/feature/2020/02/07/686085.html|archive-date=31 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 March the ship disembarked more than 350 passengers, from the United States and Canada only, at [[Marseille]], France.

At [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]], the passengers were met by people with [[hazmat suit]]s to check their body temperatures, perform visual assessment and ask if any had COVID-19 symptoms. Those without symptoms were to go to customs and then take their baggage.

On 11 March 2020, [[Viking Cruises]] suspended operations for its 79-vessel fleet until the end of April, cancelling all ocean and river cruises, after it was revealed that a passenger on a cruise in Cambodia had been exposed to the virus while in transit via plane, placing at least 28 other passengers in quarantine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|title=My Trip – Updates on Current Sailings|website=vikingrivercruises.com.au|access-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312181910/https://www.vikingrivercruises.com.au/my-trip/current-sailings/index.html|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |title=Viking Cruises suspended operations worldwide due to the coronavirus, as infections ravage the cruise industry |first=Bill |last=Bostock |website=Business Insider |date=12 March 2020 |access-date=12 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312174617/https://www.businessinsider.com/viking-cruises-coronavirus-suspends-operations-industry-struggles-2020-3 |archive-date=12 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Crew strandings and repatriations==

After disembarking passengers, many cruise ships remained docked or at sea near ports with crew members still aboard, in some cases unpaid though with free room and board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/05/03/849732492/many-crews-remain-aboard-cruise-ships-after-passengers-evacuated|title=Many Crews Remain Aboard Cruise Ships After Passengers Evacuated|website=NPR.org}}</ref> Crew members are generally citizens of many different countries, aside from those where the ship is registered, based, or temporarily stopped. Especially with pandemic-related travel restrictions and concerns about onboard outbreaks, crew members could not simply disembark and fly home. After some negotiations, most cruise companies made special arrangements to allow crew members to take charter flights to their home countries. In some cases, the ships themselves were used to transport crew members to home countries directly.<ref name="herald_unhappy">{{cite web | last1=Charles | first1=Jacqueline | last2=Dolven | first2=Taylor | title=Cruise lines finally repatriating workers stranded by COVID-19.

== Hazard controls ==
{{Further|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}
According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], proper [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard controls]] for cruise ships and other commercial vessels include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.  Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/maritime/recommendations-for-ships.html|title=Interim Guidance for Ships on Managing Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019|date=2020-02-18|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2020-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301220052/https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/maritime/recommendations-for-ships.html|archive-date=1 March 2020|url-status=live}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

==Financial fallout==
{{See also|Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|Financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic}}
Cruise line stock fell sharply on 27 March 2020 when the US$2 trillion relief package passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] excluded companies that are not "organized" under United States law. [[Carnival Corporation & plc]] is registered in Panama, England and Wales; [[Royal Caribbean International]] is chartered in Liberia, and [[Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings]] is domiciled in Bermuda. Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]], (D-RI), tweeted: "The giant cruise companies incorporate overseas to dodge US taxes, flag vessels overseas to avoid US taxes and laws, and pollute without offset. Why should we bail them out?" Senator [[Josh Hawley]] (R-MO) tweeted that cruise lines should register and pay taxes in the United States if they expect a financial bailout. U.S-based employees and American-owned passenger ships will still be eligible for financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web |website=Associated Press |title=Cruise stocks sink after missing out on economic-relief bill |first1=David |last1=Koening |first2=Kevin |last2=Freking |name-list-style=amp |date=27 March 2020 |url=https://apnews.com/819d004059e6b165d9509f2d346a7d41 |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329192618/https://apnews.com/819d004059e6b165d9509f2d346a7d41 |archive-date=29 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Carnival Cruise Line]] stock fell 75% between 1 January and 31 March 2020 and dividend payments to shareholders were suspended.

A report from [[Cruise Lines International Association]] from 2019 states the [[Arithmetic mean|average]] age of cruise passengers is 46.9 years, while the largest age bracket is 60–69 years (19%) followed by 50–59 years (18%).<ref>Darcy Alexander: ''[https://www.cruise1st.co.uk/blog/cruise-holidays/how-old-is-the-average-cruise-passenger/ How Old is the Average Cruise Passenger?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403212942/https://www.cruise1st.co.uk/blog/cruise-holidays/how-old-is-the-average-cruise-passenger/ |date=3 April 2020 }}'', Cruise 1st, 23 August 2019</ref> Research from 2001 studying the epidemiology of passenger mortalities on two cruise ships, indicated a median age of 65 years of cruise participants.
