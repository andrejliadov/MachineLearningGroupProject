'''Non-specific effects of vaccines''' (also called "'''heterologous effects'''" or "'''off-target effects'''") are effects which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. Non-specific effects can be strongly beneficial by increasing protection against non-targeted infections.<ref name=(2)>{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013 |volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475| name-list-style=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}</ref> This has been shown with two [[live attenuated vaccines]], [[BCG vaccine]] and [[measles vaccine]], through multiple [[randomized controlled trials]].<ref name=(2)>{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013 |volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475| name-list-style=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}</ref> Theoretically, non-specific effects of vaccines may be detrimental, increasing overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases.

Ongoing research suggests that non-specific effects of vaccines may depend on the [[vaccine]], the vaccination schedule, and the sex of the infant.<ref name=Benn13>{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=13 May 2013 |volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130| name-list-style=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}</ref> For example, one hypothesis suggests that all [[live attenuated vaccines]] reduce mortality more than explained by prevention of target infections, while all [[inactivated vaccine|inactivated vaccines]] may increase overall mortality despite providing protection against the target disease. These effects may be long-lasting, at least up to the time point where a new type of vaccine is given. The non-specific effects can be very pronounced, with significant effects on overall mortality and [[morbidity]]. In a situation with [[herd immunity]] to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.<ref name="Benn13" />

The non-specific effects should not be confused with the [[side effects]] of vaccines (such as local reactions at the site of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases [[anaphylaxis]]). Rather, non-specific effects represent a form of general immunomodulation, with important consequences for the [[immune system|immune system's]] ability to handle subsequent challenges.

It is estimated that millions of child deaths in [[developing country|low income countries]] could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs.<ref name=(2)>{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013 |volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475| name-list-style=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bandim Health Project.JPG|thumb|The [[Bandim Health Project]] Office built in 2008.]]
The hypothesis that vaccines have non-specific effects was formulated in the early 1990s by [[Peter Aaby]] at the [[Bandim Health Project]] in West Africa.<ref name=(3)>{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Andersen |first2=M |last3=Sodemann |first3=M |last4=Jakobsen |first4=M |last5=Gomes |first5=J |last6=Fernandes |first6=M |title=Reduced childhood mortality after standard measles vaccination at 4-8 months compared with 9-11 months of age. |journal=BMJ |date=20 November 1993 |volume=307 |issue=6915 |pages=1308–11 |pmid=8257884 |doi=10.1136/bmj.307.6915.1308 |pmc=1679462}}</ref>

The first indication of the importance of the non-specific effects of vaccines came in a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the late 1980s. It was tested whether a high-titer (high-dose) measles vaccine (HTMV) given at 4–6 months of age was as effective against measles infection as the standard measles vaccine (MV) given at 9 months of age. Early administration of the HTMV prevented measles infection just as effectively as did the standard MV given at 9 months of age.

However, early administration of the HTMV was associated with twofold ''higher'' overall mortality among females (there was no difference in mortality for males).<ref name=(6)>{{cite journal |last1=Holt |first1=EA |last2=Moulton |first2=LH |last3=Siberry |first3=GK |last4=Halsey |first4=NA |title=Differential mortality by measles vaccine titer and sex. |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |date=November 1993 |volume=168 |issue=5 |pages=1087–96 |pmid=8228340 |doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1087}}</ref><ref name=(5)>{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Samb |first2=B |last3=Simondon |first3=F |last4=Knudsen |first4=K |last5=Seck |first5=AM |last6=Bennett |first6=J |title=Sex-specific differences in mortality after high-titre measles immunization in rural Senegal. |journal=Bull World Health Organ |date=1994 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=761–70 |pmid=7955026 |pmc=2486568}}</ref><ref name=(4)>{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Knudsen |first2=K |last3=Whittle |first3=H |last4=Lisse |first4=IM |last5=Thaarup |first5=J |last6=Poulsen |first6=A |title=Long-term survival after Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccination in Guinea-Bissau: increased female mortality rate |journal=Journal of Pediatrics |date=June 1993 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=904–8 |pmid=8501567 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(09)90015-4}}</ref> In other words, the girls given HTMV died more often despite having the same protection against measles as the infants given standard MV.

This first observation that vaccines could protect against the target disease but at the same time affect mortality after infection with other pathogens, in a sex-differential manner, led to several further studies showing that other vaccines might also have such nonspecific effects.

==Live attenuated versus inactivated vaccines==
Numerous [[observational study|observational studies]] and [[randomized trial|randomised trials]] (RCTs) have found that the impact on mortality of live and inactivated vaccines differ markedly. All live vaccines studied so far (BCG, measles vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and smallpox vaccine) have been shown to reduce mortality more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infection(s). In contrast, inactivated vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, inactivated polio vaccine) may have deleterious effects in spite of providing target disease protection.<ref name=(14)/>

===BCG vaccine===
The live attenuated BCG vaccine developed against tuberculosis has been shown to have strong beneficial effects on the ability to combat non-tuberculosis infections.<ref name=Benn13/><ref name=Aaby14Oct>{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Kollmann|first2=TR|last3=Benn|first3=CS|title=Nonspecific effects of neonatal and infant vaccination: public-health, immunological and conceptual challenges.|journal=Nature Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=15|issue=10|pages=895–9|pmid=25232810|doi=10.1038/ni.2961|s2cid=2856426}}</ref>

===Measles vaccine===

Standard titer measles vaccine is recommended at 9 months of age in low-income countries where measles infection is endemic and often fatal. Many observational studies have shown that measles-vaccinated children have substantially lower mortality than can be explained by the prevention of measles-related deaths.<ref name=(13)>{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Rodrigues|first4=A|last5=Benn|first5=CS|last6=Whittle|first6=H|title=The optimal age of measles immunisation in low-income countries: a secondary analysis of the assumptions underlying the current policy|journal=BMJ Open|date=2012|volume=2|issue=4|pmid=22815465|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000761|pages=e000761|pmc=3401826}}</ref> Many of these observational studies were [[natural experiments]], such as studies comparing the mortality before and after the introduction of measles vaccine and other studies where logistical factors rather than maternal choice determined whether a child was vaccinated or not.

These findings were later supported in randomized trials from 2003 to 2009 in Guinea-Bissau. An intervention group of children given standard titer measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 month of age had a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the children in the control group, which were only vaccinated against measles at 9 month of age.<ref name=(14)>{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Bale|first4=C|last5=Andersen|first5=A|last6=Rodrigues|first6=A|title=Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: randomised controlled trial.|journal=BMJ|date=2010|volume=341|issue=6495|pmid=21118875|pages=c6495|doi=10.1136/bmj.c6495|pmc=2994348}}</ref>

In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on four randomized trials and 18 observational studies, it was concluded that "There was consistent evidence of a beneficial effect of measles vaccine, although all observational studies were assessed as being at risk of bias and the [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org GRADE rating] was of low confidence. There was an apparent difference between the effect in girls and boys, with girls benefitting more from measles vaccination", and furthermore "estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk" and "if these effects are real then they are not fully explained by deaths that were established as due to measles".<ref name=(11)/> Based on the evidence, the [https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/sage/en WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization] concluded that "the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research".<ref name=(12)/>[https://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8921/en/]

In a recent WHO-commissioned review of DTP based on ten observational studies, it was concluded that, "the findings were inconsistent, with a majority of the studies indicating a detrimental effect of DTP, and two studies indicating a beneficial effect. All of the studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the GRADE criteria."

Furthermore, "three observational studies provided a suggestion that simultaneous administration of BCG and DTP may be preferable to the recommended schedule of BCG before DTP; and there was suggestion that mortality risk may be higher when DTP is  given with, or after, measles vaccine compared with when it is given before measles vaccine (from five, and three, observational studies, respectively). These results are consistent with hypotheses that DTP vaccine may have detrimental effects on mortality, although a majority of the evidence was generated by a group centred in Guinea-Bissau who have often written in defence of such a hypothesis."<ref name=(11)/>

===Smallpox vaccine===
When smallpox vaccine was introduced in the early 19th century, there were anecdotal descriptions of non-specific beneficial effects.

==Immunological mechanisms==
The findings from the epidemiological studies on the non-specific effects of vaccines pose a challenge to the current understanding of vaccines, and how they affect the immune system, and also question whether boys and girls have identical immune systems and should receive the same treatment.

The mechanisms for these effects are unclear. It is not known how vaccination induces rapid beneficial or harmful changes in the general susceptibility to infectious diseases, but the following mechanisms are likely to be involved.

===Heterologous T-cell immunity===
It is well known from animal studies that infections, apart from inducing pathogen-specific [[T-cells]], also induce cross-reactive T-cells through epitope sharing, so-called heterologous immunity.<ref name=(37)>{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Che|first2=JW|last3=Brehm|first3=MA|last4=Selin|first4=LK|title=Heterologous immunity between viruses|journal=Immunological Reviews|date=May 2010|volume=235|issue=1|pages=244–66|pmid=20536568|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x|pmc=2917921}}</ref><ref name=(36)>{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Selin|first2=LK|title=No one is naive: the significance of heterologous T-cell immunity.|journal=Nat Rev Immunol|date=June 2002|volume=2|issue=6|pages=417–26|pmid=12093008|doi=10.1038/nri820|s2cid=37492938}}</ref> Heterologous T-cell immunity can lead to improved clearance of a subsequent cross-reactive challenge, but it may also lead to increased morbidity.<ref name=(38)>{{cite journal|last1=Selin|first1=LK|last2=Wlodarczyk|first2=MF|last3=Kraft|first3=AR|last4=Nie|first4=S|last5=Kenney|first5=LL|last6=Puzone|first6=R|title=Heterologous immunity: immunopathology, autoimmunity and protection during viral infections.|journal=Autoimmunity|date=June 2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=328–47|pmid=21250837|doi=10.3109/08916934.2011.523277|pmc=3633594}}</ref> This mechanism may explain why DTP could have negative effects.

It would, however, not explain effects occurring shortly after vaccination, as for instance the rapidly occurring beneficial effects of BCG vaccine,<ref name=(10)/> as the heterologous effect would only be expected to be present after some weeks, as the adaptive immune response need time to develop. Also, it is difficult to explain why the effect would vanish once a child receives a new vaccine.

===Trained innate immunity===
The concept that not only plants and insects, but also humans have innate immune memory may provide new clues to why vaccines have non-specific effects. Studies into BCG have recently revealed that BCG induces epigenetic changes in the monocytes in adults, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon challenges with unrelated [[mitogens]] and [[pathogens]] (trained innate immunity).<ref name=(39)>{{cite journal|last1=Kleinnijenhuis|first1=J|last2=Quintin|first2=J|last3=Preijers|first3=F|last4=Joosten|first4=LAB|last5=Ifrim|first5=DC|last6=Saeed|first6=S|title=Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17537–42|pmid=22988082|doi=10.1073/pnas.1202870109|pmc=3491454}}</ref>

In [[SCID mice]] that have no adaptive immune system, BCG reduced mortality from an otherwise lethal [[candida infection]]. The effects of BCG presented when tested after 2 weeks, but would be expected to occur rapidly after vaccination, and hence might be able to explain the very rapid protection against neonatal [[septicaemia]] seen after BCG vaccine.<ref name=(40)>{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Benn|first2=CS|title=Saving lives by training innate immunity with bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17317–8|pmid=23071307|doi=10.1073/pnas.1215761109|pmc=3491466}}</ref>

Trained [[innate immunity]] may also explain the generally increased resistance against broad disease categories, such as [[fevers]] and lower [[respiratory tract infections]]; such effects would be difficult to explain merely by shared [[epitope]]s, unless such epitopes were almost universally common on pathogens.

Lastly, it is plausible that the effects are reversible by a different vaccine. Hence, trained innate immunity may provide a biological mechanism for the observed non-specific effects of vaccines.<ref name=(39)/>

==Controversy==
In 2000 Aaby and colleagues presented data from Guinea-Bissau which suggested that DTP vaccination could, under some circumstances (e.g. absence of [[pertussis]]) be associated with increases in overall mortality, at least until children received measles vaccine. In response, WHO sponsored the analysis of a variety of data sets in other populations to test the hypothesis. None of these studies replicated the observation of increased mortality associated with DTP vaccination.<ref name=(21)/><ref name=(20)/><ref name=(19)/><ref name=(18)/><ref name=(17)/><ref name=(16)/> WHO subsequently concluded, that the evidence was sufficient to reject the hypothesis for an increased nonspecific mortality following DTP vaccination.<ref name=(41)>{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 20–21 June|journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record|date=22 November 2002|volume=77|issue=47|pages=389–404|url=https://www.who.int/docstore/wer/pdf/2002/wer7747.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>

However, Aaby and colleagues subsequently pointed out that the studies which failed to show any mortality increase associated with DTP vaccination used methods of analysis that can introduce a bias against finding such an effect.<ref name=(24)/>

In these studies, data on childhood vaccinations were typically collected in periodic surveys, and the information on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated at the time of the second visit. The person-time at risk in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children – thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.<ref name=(24)/>

This bias has been described before, but in different contexts, as the distinction between 'landmark' and 'retrospective updating' analysis of [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] data.<ref name=(43)/> The retrospective updating method can lead to a considerable bias in vaccine studies, biasing observed mortality rate ratios towards zero (a large effect), whereas the landmark method leads to a non-specific misclassification and biases the mortality rate ratio towards unity(no effect).

An additional problem with the literature on the nonspecific effects of vaccines has been the variety and unexpected nature of the hypotheses which have appeared (in particular relating to sex-specific effects), which has meant that it has not always been clear whether some apparent 'effects' were the result of [[post hoc analysis|post hoc analyses]] or whether they were reflections of [[A priori probability|a priori]] hypotheses.

This was discussed at length at a review of the work of Aaby and his colleagues in Copenhagen in 2005.<ref name=(22)/> The review was convened by the Danish National Research Foundation and the [[Novo Nordisk Foundation]] who have sponsored much of the work of Aaby and his colleagues. An outcome of the review was the explicit formulation of a series of testable hypotheses, agreed by the Aaby group.<ref name=(22)/> It was hoped that independent investigators would design and conduct studies powered to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

Also, the two foundations sponsored a workshop on the analysis of vaccine effects, which was held in London in 2008.<ref name=(22)/> The workshop resulted in three papers.<ref name=(43)>{{cite journal|last1=Farrington|first1=CP|last2=Firth|first2=MJ|last3=Moulton|first3=LH|last4=Ravn|first4=H|last5=Andersen|first5=PK|last6=Evans|first6=S|title=Epidemiological studies of the non-specific effects of vaccines: II - methodological issues in the design and analysis of cohort studies.|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=977–85|pmid=19531116|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02302.x|s2cid=13903114}}</ref><ref name=(44)>{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|last2=Nohynek|first2=H|last3=Scott|first3=JA|last4=Hesseling|first4=A|last5=Flanagan|first5=KL|title=Randomized Trials to Study the Nonspecific Effects of Vaccines in Children in Low-Income Countries|journal=Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal|date=2010|volume=29|issue=5|pages=457–61|pmid=20431383|doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3181c91361|s2cid=13918714}}</ref><ref name=(42)>{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=PEM|last2=Williams|first2=TN|last3=Aaby|first3=P|last4=Källander|first4=K|last5=Moulton|first5=LH|last6=Flanagan|first6=KL|title=Epidemiological studies of the 'non-specific effects' of vaccines: I - data collection in observational studies|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=969–76|pmid=19531117|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02301.x|s2cid=205390916}}</ref> The proceedings were forwarded to WHO which subsequently concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".<ref name=(45)>{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|date=18 July 2008|volume=83|issue=32|pages=285–92|url=https://www.who.int/wer/2008/wer8332/en/|pmid=18689006}}</ref>

==Implications for world health==
{{POV|date=August 2017}}
Dr. Frank Shann from Australia recently assessed the consequences of changing the current [[EPI vaccine|EPI]] schedule to an alternative schedule taking non-specific effects into account, and concluded: "If all neonates in high-mortality regions were given BCG at birth, and the revised immunization schedule ... were adopted, with extra doses of measles vaccine at 14 weeks and 19 months (at a cost of only US $0.60/dose delivered), ~1 million (30%) of the 3.2 million neonatal deaths each year might be prevented in developing countries, and 1.5 million (30%) of the 4.8 million deaths between 1 month and 5 years of age might be prevented". Furthermore: "This very large reduction in mortality in children <5 years of age would be achieved at a low cost using only vaccines that are already in the routine EPI schedule".<ref name=(2)/>

==''The Arc of the Swallow''==
In 2008, Danish crime novel author [[Sissel-Jo Gazan]] (author of the Danish crime novel ''Dinosaur Feather'') became interested in the work of the [[Bandim Health Project]] and based her science crime novel ''The Arc of the Swallow'' (''Svalens Graf'') on the research into non-specific effects of vaccines.

The novel was published in Danish in 2013; it was on the best-seller list for months and won the Readers' Prize 2014 in Denmark. It was published in English in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on November 6, 2014 and in the US on April 7, 2015.
