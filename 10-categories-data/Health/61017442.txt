'''''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{Nihongo||あつまれ どうぶつの森|'''''Atsumare Dōbutsu no Mori'''''|{{lit}} ''Animal Forest: Gather''|lead=yes}}}} is a [[life simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It is the fifth main entry in the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' series and was released on March 20, 2020.

In ''New Horizons'', the player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a package from [[Tom Nook]], a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who has appeared in every entry in the ''Animal Crossing'' series. Taking place in [[Real time (media)|real-time]], the player can explore the island in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] fashion, gathering and crafting items, catching insects and fish, and developing the island into a community of [[anthropomorphic]] animals.

''New Horizons'' was a major commercial hit, breaking the console game record for most digital units sold in a single month with five million copies, and has currently sold over {{nowrap|26 million}} copies. Currently standing as the [[List of best-selling video games|28th best-selling video game in history]], it became the best-selling game in the ''Animal Crossing'' series, the best-selling Nintendo Switch exclusive, the second [[best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch]] (after ''[[Mario Kart 8 Deluxe]]''), and the second-highest selling game of all time in Japan (after the [[Pokémon Red and Blue|original three ''Pokémon'' games]]); its success has been partially attributed to its release during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], with players spending more time at home. It received acclaim from critics, with many praising its gameplay and customization options and calling it the best game in the series; it won the award for Game of the Year at the [[List of Game of the Year awards#Japan Game Awards (formerly CESA Awards)|Japan Game Awards]], and received three nominations at [[The Game Awards 2020]], including for [[The Game Award for Game of the Year|Game of the Year]], ultimately winning Best Family Game.

==Gameplay==
As in previous installments in the ''Animal Crossing'' series, ''Animal Crossing: New Horizons'' is a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] [[life simulation game]] played in [[Real time (media)|real-time]]. The player assumes the role of a customizable character who moves to a deserted island after purchasing a deserted island package from [[Tom Nook]], a [[Japanese raccoon dog|tanuki]] character who is a staple of the series.<ref name="TECHRADAR"/> The game proceeds in an open-ended fashion as the player explores the island, and develops it into a community of [[anthropomorphic]] animals.<ref name="ISABELLE"/> 

Players can collect different items to use as decorations within the game. Like in the 2017 spin-off game ''[[Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp]]'' for mobile devices, the game introduces a crafting system that allows the player to convert materials into tools and furniture, which can be used to decorate the game's interior and exterior spaces.<ref name="KOTAKU1" /><ref name="IGN1" />

The game allows the player to customize the appearance of their character at will, and does not lock specific hairstyles or facial features to specific genders.<ref name="APPEARANCE" /> Players are additionally able to select their character's skin color, a feature introduced in the 2015 spin-off game ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]''.<ref name="KOTAKU1" /> Nook Miles, an in-game currency earned by completing various tasks, can be used to purchase premium items.<ref name="NEWSWEEK" /> Players are able to invite animals to live on their island, and have the option to choose or influence where the animal constructs their home.<ref name="14DETAILS" /> The game's weather adjusts to the seasons of the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] or [[Southern Hemisphere]], depending on the player's real-world location, a first for the ''Animal Crossing'' series.<ref name="NEWSWEEK" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/everything-we-know-animal-crossing-new-horizons/|title=Here are all the juicy details on Animal Crossing: New Horizons|last=Gurwin|first=Gabe|date=September 5, 2019|website=Digital Trends|access-date=September 9, 2019}}</ref>

Once the player has made sufficient progress in ''New Horizons'', [[Isabelle (Animal Crossing)|Isabelle]] appears in the game.<ref name="ISABELLE"/> Additionally, [[Mr. Resetti]] no longer lectures the player about saving due to the game's [[autosave]] function and the removal of the ability to [[Reset (computing)|reset]]. Instead, it is implied that he is the operator for the Rescue Service.<ref name="RESETTI"/> [[K.K.
