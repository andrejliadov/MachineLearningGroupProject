'''Atari VCS''' (codename '''Ataribox''') is a [[home video game console]] and [[Microconsole]] produced by [[Atari SA]]. The system was first revealed in June 2017 and pre-orders began on May 30, 2018.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atari.com/news/atari-announces-atari-vcs-pre-sale-begins-may-30th-indiegogo-exclusive-wood-front-collectors|title=Atari® Announces Atari VCS™ Pre-Sale Begins May 30th on INDIEGOGO with Exclusive Wood-Front Collector's Edition, Onyx Model and Accessories|date=April 30, 2018|website=Atari|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501055941/https://www.atari.com/news/atari-announces-atari-vcs-pre-sale-begins-may-30th-indiegogo-exclusive-wood-front-collectors|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=dead|access-date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> After several delays, the console was expected to ship in March 2020, but was delayed again due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://us.blastingnews.com/gaming/2020/02/atari-vcs-console-delayed-yet-again-due-to-coronavirus-outbreak-003063581.html| title = Atari VCS console delayed, report blames Coronavirus outbreak  | access-date=March 14, 2020}}</ref>

While its physical design is intended to pay homage to the [[Atari 2600]], the new Atari VCS is expected to play modern games and streaming entertainment via a [[Linux]]-based operating system that will allow users to download and install other compatible games onto it. The system shares a name with [[Atari, Inc.]]'s 1977 Video Computer System, usually shortened to VCS, which was renamed to the Atari 2600 in late 1982.

==History==
[[Atari Corporation]] left the hardware business around 1996, after it released the [[Atari Jaguar CD]] video game console, and was liquidated in 1998, with [[Hasbro Interactive]] purchasing the [[intellectual property]] of the brand.<ref name="ataritohasbro">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-goes-to-hasbro/1100-2462915/ |title=Atari Goes to Hasbro |last=Johnston |first=Chris |date=April 8, 2000 |website=GameSpot}}</ref> In 2001, [[Infogrames Entertainment SA]] purchased Hasbro Interactive. <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/business/company-news-hasbro-completes-sale-of-interactive-business.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FHasbro+Inc |title=Company News; Hasbro Completes Sale Of Interactive Business&nbsp;— New York Times |work=New York Times |date=30 January 2001 |access-date=27 July 2018 |archive-date=30 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630190216/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/30/business/company-news-hasbro-completes-sale-of-interactive-business.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FCompanies%2FHasbro+Inc |url-status=live }}</ref> Infogrames would later rename itself [[Atari SA]], while the Hasbro Interactive subsidiary was renamed Atari Interactive.<ref name="atarisa">{{cite press_release |url=https://www.atari.com/sites/default/files/Anthony_Jacobson_and_Pierre_Hintze_Hire_Release_FINAL_100709_GB.pdf |title=Anthony Jacobson and Pierre Hintze Hire Release FINAL |publisher=Atari |date=7 October 2009 |access-date=15 May 2018 |archive-date=25 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053601/http://atari.com/sites/default/files/Anthony_Jacobson_and_Pierre_Hintze_Hire_Release_FINAL_100709_GB.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Atari Interactive provided licensing for the various [[Atari Flashback]] [[dedicated consoles]] produced since 2004.

The concept of the Atari VCS came from Feargal Mac Conuladh, who joined Atari and became general manager to oversee the Ataribox release. Conuladh said that he was inspired to create the unit after seeing players connect laptops to televisions to use a larger screen to play games that were not available for consoles, and then use social media platforms outside of the games via the same laptop to communicate with friends.<ref name="vb fries conuladh"/> He also saw that Atari's game catalog had a good amount of brand recognition.<ref name="vb conuladh">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/25/ataribox-runs-linux-on-amd-chip-and-will-cost-at-least-249/ | title = Ataribox runs Linux on AMD chip and will cost at least $250 | first = Dean | last = Takahashi | date = September 25, 2017 | access-date = September 26, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170926060200/https://venturebeat.com/2017/09/25/ataribox-runs-linux-on-amd-chip-and-will-cost-at-least-249/ | archive-date = September 26, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> His design goal was to feed nostalgia for the old Atari consoles and allow players to enjoy indie games without a personal computer.<ref name="vb conuladh"/> Processor maker [[AMD]] provided custom componentry for it.<ref name="vb conuladh"/> While Atari made most of the decisions on the unit's hardware, they have also kept open to suggestions from Atari fans on the unit's aesthetics and other visual features.<ref name="vb conuladh"/>

The console in its current rendition would function as a sort of hybrid between a [[home video game console]] and a [[Computer video game|gaming PC]], two branches of electronics Atari has operated in previously. Conuladh took lessons learned from the commercial failure of the [[Ouya]], a similar crowd-funded microconsole. One was to use the [[Linux]] operating system directly, rather than through the limited version offered through [[Android (operating system)|Android]], as to be able to provide more capabilities and a more open system to developers and users.<ref name="vb fries conuladh"/> Conuladh did not want to restrict what users could install on the device; while the unit's operating system will have a storefront feature, he wanted users to be able to add software by any means possible. He also decided to use a higher-performance laptop/desktop APU than the smartphone/tablet APU used in the Ouya.<ref name="vb fries conuladh"/> Conuladh also wanted to steer away from problems encountered by [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[Steam Machine (hardware platform)|Steam Machines]], which provided a minimum set of specifications for hardware that Valve expected other vendors to build towards, but ultimately never took off. Instead, the Ataribox hardware configuration will remain fixed and controlled by Atari.<ref name="vb fries conuladh"/> Additionally, Atari will contract for the manufacture of all the consoles themselves, rather than relying on third parties to manufacture their own systems based on the Ataribox specifications.

In December 2017, just prior to opening for pre-orders for the Ataribox, Atari recognized there were still several issues they needed to address with the hardware, and decided to postpone the pre-orders. At that point, Michael Arzt, the head for Atari Connected Devices, took over production while Conuladh left Atari, though the two had been coordinating on its development previously. According to Atari CEO Fred Chesnais, this period gave them time to review what they wanted the Ataribox to do, and revise the unit's specifications and hardware without sacrificing the core elements of being a Linux-based system that would be able to run classic Atari games along with newer titles.<ref name="vb chesnais">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/26/atari-pressed-the-reset-button-on-its-atari-vcs-game-console/ | title = Atari pressed the reset button on its Atari VCS game console | first = Dean | last = Takahashi | date = March 26, 2018 | access-date = March 26, 2018 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180326220913/https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/26/atari-pressed-the-reset-button-on-its-atari-vcs-game-console/ | archive-date = March 26, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

===Announcements===
Atari first teased Project Ataribox in June 2017 during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]], releasing images of the box but did not call out any technical specifications. As this followed [[Nintendo]]'s November 2016 release of the [[NES Classic Edition]], a dedicated console that supported a number of pre-loaded [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games, journalists believed that the new Atari system was developed in kind, to provide a way to play classic Atari games on a dedicated platform.<ref name="gamasutra july2017">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/301859/The_Ataribox_sounds_like_a_NES_Classic_with_a_modern_twist.php | title = The AtariBox sounds like an NES Classic with a modern twist | first = Chris | last = Kerr | date = July 17, 2017 | access-date = September 26, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170927000224/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/301859/The_Ataribox_sounds_like_a_NES_Classic_with_a_modern_twist.php | archive-date = September 27, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Further information released in September 2017 provided more technical specifications, details on the software approach including the plans to use [[Linux]] and provide an open platform for other compatible software to be installed, and a planned release in the second quarter of 2019. The price is expected to fall between [[USD|$]]249 and $299, based on configuration options. The announcement also stated some of the funding for the unit will come from a planned [[Indiegogo]] crowdfunding campaign to be launched before the end of 2017.<ref name="gamasutra sept2017">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/306507/Back_to_the_future_Ataribox_price_and_some_tech_specs_revealed.php | title = Back to the future: AtariBox price and (some) tech specs revealed | first = Chris | last = Kerr | date = September 26, 2017 | access-date = September 26, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170926235728/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/306507/Back_to_the_future_Ataribox_price_and_some_tech_specs_revealed.php | archive-date = September 26, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Conuladh said they chose Indiegogo to help with international sales and hardware support, including a close relationship with [[Arrow Electronics]], an electronics components company, that has supported past Indiegogo projects.<ref name="vb conuladh"/><ref name="vb fries conuladh">{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/18/former-xbox-leader-ed-fries-quizzes-feargal-mac-on-ataris-new-console/ | title = Former Xbox leader Ed Fries quizzes Feargal Mac on Atari’s new console | first = Dean | last = Takahashi | date = October 18, 2017 | access-date = October 18, 2017 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019004916/https://venturebeat.com/2017/10/18/former-xbox-leader-ed-fries-quizzes-feargal-mac-on-ataris-new-console/ | archive-date = October 19, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

On June 27, 2018, Rob Wyatt, system architect for the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and designer of [[PlayStation 3]]'s graphic systems, was announced as part of the VCS team. Wyatt and his company Tin Giant had been working with Atari for months to define hardware and operating system requirements. About joining the project, Wyatt said, "Who wouldn't want to be part of bringing Atari back?

In March 2019, Atari announced that they would be delaying the launch of the VCS to the end of 2019 and announced that the system has upgraded to an unannounced embedded 14&nbsp;nm AMD Ryzen processor with [[Radeon Vega Frontier Edition|Radeon Vega]]-based graphics and two Zen CPU cores. The new AMD processor supports native [[4K resolution|4K video playback]] with modern [[HDCP]], has built-in [[Ethernet]] and a [[Framebuffer|secure framebuffer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/18/amd-atari-vcs-delay/|title=Atari VCS gets a spec boost and another delay|website=Engadget|last=Fingas|first=Jon|language=en|access-date=March 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/atari-vcs-upgrade-launch-1203166492/|title=Atari VCS Is Getting An Upgrade, Launch Pushed to End of 2019|last=Gera|first=Emily|last2=Gera|first2=Emily|date=March 19, 2019|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=March 27, 2019}}</ref>

In July 2019, Atari announced that they would be providing more information about the product's mass production and game content to be available for the system in summer 2019. By the end of summer 2019, no functional version of the AtariVCS meeting the product description has been shown publicly, and additional details of gaming content have not been forthcoming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@atarivcs/atari-vcs-teases-the-future-at-the-e3-expo-in-los-angeles-c08e970a90d9|title=Atari VCS Medium.com Blog|date=July 19, 2019|website=Medium.com/@AtariVCS}}</ref>

On October 4, 2019, Wyatt stated that he resigned from the project in a statement to ''The Register''. Wyatt cited non-payment by Atari as a key reason for his departure. In wake of this news, several of those that had backed the Indiegogo campaign took to the project's Reddit forum to ask about the state of the project, but Atari subsequently took down these posts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/10/08/atari_architect_quits/|title=Game over: Atari VCS architect quits project, claims he hasn’t been paid for six months|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=October 8, 2019|website=theregister.co.uk|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> In April 2020, Wyatt filed a lawsuit against Atari to recover payment for his design work.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/02/xbox-co-creator-rob-wyatt-sues-atari-for-failing-to-pay-him-for-design-of-vcs-console/ | title = Xbox co-creator Rob Wyatt sues Atari for failing to pay him for design of VCS console |first= Dean | last =Takahashi | date = April 2, 2020 | access-date = April 3, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref>

Atari VCS's COO Michael Arzt stated in December 2019 that they were in the final stages of pre-production of the unit, with plans to ship the console to those that pre-ordered by March 2020 before the units were then sent to retail. Arzt explained that the lack of communications over the previous year was due to limitations with their partnership contracts, but promised that they would try to provide more regular updates moving forward.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/troubled-atari-vcs-project-is-deep-into-the-final-stages-of-pre-production--573958.phtml | title = Troubled Atari VCS project is 'deep into the final stages of pre-production' | first=  Chris | last = Moyse | date = December 2, 2019 | access-date = December 2, 2019 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref>

The console was delayed in March again, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

Conuladh says that they anticipate the hardware is comparable to a mid-range personal computer for 2017, powerful enough to run most games but not for more recent [[AAA (video gaming)|AAA]] titles.<ref name="vb conuladh"/> This was before the platform was redesigned around AMD's new Ryzen R1000 chip, the R1606G announced in 2019.<ref>https://medium.com/@atarivcs/more-power-is-coming-to-the-atari-vcs-20c02f3aefc2</ref> Since then, the VCS has been demonstrated at the 2020 CES playing ''Fortnite'' and ''Borderlands 2''.<ref>https://medium.com/@atarivcs/ces-2020-recap-from-the-atari-vcs-meeting-suite-1ab66df4b6a</ref>

The hardware will include one "Classic Joystick" controller, based on the single-button design of the [[Atari CX40 joystick]], adding only additional inset buttons for accessing the console's menus,<ref name="vb vcs"/><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/12/01/atari-ataribox-controller-old-school-atari-2600/ | title = Atari Reveals Its AtariBox Controller, And It’s Decidedly Old-School | first = Robert | last = Workman | date = November 30, 2017 | access-date = December 11, 2017 | work = Comicbook.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171212084125/http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/12/01/atari-ataribox-controller-old-school-atari-2600/ | archive-date = December 12, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> as well as [[LED]] lighting. A "Modern Controller" features a layout typical of modern console platforms.<ref name="vb vcs"/>

Two editions of Atari VCS have been announced, including one inspired by the [[Atari 2600]] and the other in red and black colors having a front panel made of glass.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/07/17/ataribox-will-come-in-two-suitably-retro-editions/|title=Ataribox will come in two suitably retro editions|date=July 17, 2018|publisher=Engadget}}</ref> The third option which was added in June 2018 is the Tribute Edition, which is exactly the same as the collector's edition except without the limited edition numbering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/atari-vcs-campaign-almost-at-3m-gets-new-tribute-edition-preorder-option/|title=Atari VCS campaign almost at $3m, gets new 'Tribute Edition' preorder option|last=Grunin|first=Lori|website=CNET|language=en|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref>

===Accessories===
Atari has stated that while they will provide bundles with the Classic Joystick and Modern Controller, there will also be options to purchase the device without them. This comes as Atari intends to allow users to use their own pre-existing accessories including remotes, mouse and keyboards, microphones, external speakers and other controllers.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/atari-vcs-game-stream-connect-like-never-before-computers-pc#/updates/all | title = A Classic Reimagined | date = May 30, 2018 | access-date = May 31, 2018 | work = Indiegogo.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180530175023/https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/atari-vcs-game-stream-connect-like-never-before-computers-pc#/updates/all | archive-date = May 30, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The Atari VCS will be compatible with most PC peripherals via both [[Bluetooth]] and [[USB 3.0]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/atari-vcs-specs-release-date-games-price-news/|title=The Atari VCS: Everything you need to know|last=Parrish|first=Kevin|date= June 22, 2018|website=[[Digital Trends]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803011529/https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/atari-vcs-specs-release-date-games-price-news/|archive-date= August 3, 2018|access-date= December 5, 2018}}</ref>

==Software==
The Atari VCS will be driven by a [[Linux]] operating system. The software is specifically designed to be open to allow users to install other Linux-compatible applications on the Atari VCS alongside pre-installed games,<ref name="gamasutra sept2017"/> using Atari Vault(now called Atari VCS Vault). Other applications that can be installed include streaming applications, music players, and web browsers.<ref name="vb conuladh"/>

Whereas the Atari 2600 was a cartridge-driven game system, the VCS does not use cartridges or optical discs for games, but instead allows players to download games from external websites or install through storage media such as SD cards.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The Atari VCS will have a custom storefront that Atari developed with an undisclosed "leading industry partner", where users can download additional video games and applications.<ref name=":1" /> All users will have access to basic online features such as the store and online multiplayer, however, access to cloud storage and live streaming video games will be available exclusively on a subscription service.<ref name=":1" />

Atari has stated that the unit will ship with "tons of classic Atari retro games pre-loaded, and current titles from a range of studios".<ref name="gamasutra sept2017"/> Conuladh stated that there will be "hundreds" of Atari games, plus a number of other retro games from other catalogs.<ref name="vb fries conuladh"/> The console will ship with Antstream Arcade, a game streaming service that supports titles from the [[Amiga]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and arcade games.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2019/09/29/atari-antstream-arcade-to-bring-thousands-of-retro-games-to-atari-vcs-console/ | title = Atari: Antstream Arcade to bring thousands of retro games to Atari VCS console | first = Dean | last=  Takahashi | date = September 29, 2019 | access-date = September 30, 2019 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref>
