==Alcohol intoxication symptoms==

Alcohol intoxication is the negative health effects due to the recent drinking of [[ethanol]] (alcohol).<ref name=Jun2014/> When severe it may become a [[medical emergency]]. Some effects of alcohol intoxication, such as euphoria and lowered [[social inhibition]], are central to alcohol's desirability.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The drunken monkey : why we drink and abuse alcohol|last=Dudley, Robert, 1961–|isbn=978-0-520-95817-3|location=Berkeley|oclc=869457130|date = May 2014}}</ref>

===Effect by alcohol level===
{{Effect_by_alcohol_level}}

==Pathophysiology==
Alcohol is [[metabolized]] by a normal [[liver]] at the rate of about 8 grams of pure [[ethanol]] per hour. 8 grams or {{convert|10|ml|usfloz|abbr=on}} is one British [[Unit of alcohol|standard unit]]. An "abnormal" liver with conditions such as [[hepatitis]], [[cirrhosis]], [[gall bladder]] disease, and [[cancer]] is likely to result in a slower rate of metabolism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/853.aspx|title=How long does alcohol stay in your blood? |publisher=NHS Choices|date=2018-06-26 }}</ref>

[[Ethanol]] is metabolised to [[acetaldehyde]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH), which is found in many tissues, including the gastric mucosa. Acetaldehyde is metabolised to acetate by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is found predominantly in liver mitochondria. Acetate is used by the muscle cells to produce [[acetyl-CoA]] using the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase, and the acetyl-CoA is then used in the [[citric acid cycle]].<ref>Smith, C., Marks, Allan D., Lieberman, Michael, 2005, ''Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry: A Clinical Approach'', 2nd ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, USA, p. 458</ref>

As drinking increases, people become sleepy, or fall into a [[stupor]]. After a very high level of consumption, the respiratory system becomes depressed and the person will stop breathing. Comatose patients may aspirate their vomit (resulting in vomitus in the lungs, which may cause "drowning" and later [[pneumonia]] if survived). CNS depression and impaired motor co-ordination along with poor judgment increases the likelihood of accidental injury occurring. It is estimated that about one-third of alcohol-related deaths are due to accidents and another 14% are from intentional injury.<ref>The World Health Organisation (2007) Alcohol and Injury in Emergency Departments</ref>

In addition to respiratory failure and accidents caused by effects on the central nervous system, alcohol causes significant metabolic derangements. [[Hypoglycaemia]] occurs due to ethanol's inhibition of [[gluconeogenesis]], especially in children, and may cause [[lactic acidosis]], [[ketoacidosis]], and [[acute kidney injury]]. Metabolic acidosis is compounded by respiratory failure. Patients may also present with hypothermia.

=== Mechanism ===
{{See also|Alcohol (drug)#Pharmacology}}

In the past, alcohol was believed to be a non-specific pharmacological agent affecting many [[neurotransmitter]] systems in the brain.<ref name=Vengeliene>{{cite journal |last1=Vengeliene |title=Neuropharmacology of alcohol addiction|journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] |year=2008 |volume=154 |pages=299–315|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.30 |pmid=18311194 |pmc=2442440 |first1=V |last2=Bilbao|first2=A |last3=Molander|first3=A|last4=Spanagel|first4=R|issue=2}}</ref> However, molecular pharmacology studies have shown that alcohol has only a few primary targets.

Many of the effects of activating [[GABA receptors|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors]] have the same effects as that of ethanol consumption.

==Diagnosis==
{{see also|Blood alcohol content}}

Definitive [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] relies on a blood test for alcohol, usually performed as part of a [[toxicology]] screen. [[Law enforcement officer]]s in the [[United States]] and other countries often use [[breathalyzer]] units and [[field sobriety test]]s as more convenient and rapid alternatives to blood tests.<ref>{{cite web |title=Random breath testing – Data by country |url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.54620 |website=apps.who.int |access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref> There are also various models of breathalyzer units that are available for consumer use. Because these may have varying reliability and may produce different results than the tests used for law-enforcement purposes, the results from such devices should be conservatively interpreted.

Many informal intoxication tests exist, which, in general, are unreliable and not recommended as deterrents to excessive intoxication or as indicators of the safety of activities such as motor vehicle driving, heavy equipment operation, machine tool use, etc.

For determining whether someone is intoxicated by alcohol by some means other than a blood-alcohol test, it is necessary to rule out other conditions such as [[hypoglycemia]], [[stroke]], usage of other intoxicants, mental health issues, and so on. It is best if their behavior has been observed while the subject is sober to establish a baseline. Several well-known criteria can be used to establish a probable diagnosis. For a physician in the acute-treatment setting, acute alcohol intoxication can mimic other acute neurological disorders, or is frequently combined with other [[recreational drug]]s that complicate diagnosis and treatment.

== Management ==
Acute alcohol poisoning is a [[medical emergency]] due to the risk of death from [[respiratory depression]] or [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration of vomit]] if [[vomiting]] occurs while the person is unresponsive. Emergency treatment strives to stabilize and maintain an open airway and sufficient breathing, while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize. This can be done by removal of any vomit or, if the person is unconscious or has impaired gag reflex, intubation of the trachea.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Devi G. |author2=Castro V.

Other measures may include
* Treat [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], with intravenous sugar solutions as ethanol induced low blood sugar unresponsive to glucagon.
* Administer the vitamin [[thiamine]] to prevent [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]], which can cause a [[seizure]] (more usually a treatment for chronic alcoholism, but in the acute context usually co-administered to ensure maximal benefit).
* [[Hemodialysis]] if the blood concentration is very high at >130 &nbsp;mmol/l (>600&nbsp;mg/dL)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adinoff |first1=B. |last2=Bone |first2=G.

* Provide oxygen therapy as needed via nasal cannula or non-rebreather mask.
* While the medication [[metadoxine]] may speed the breakdown of alcohol, use in alcohol intoxication requires further study as of 2017.<ref name=Jun2014/><ref name=Goh2017/> It is approved in a number of countries in Europe, as well as India and Brazil.<ref name=Goh2017>{{cite journal|last1=Goh|first1=ET|last2=Morgan|first2=MY|title=Review article: pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence – the why, the what and the wherefore.|journal=Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics|date=April 2017|volume=45|issue=7|pages=865–882|doi=10.1111/apt.13965|pmid=28220511|s2cid=5431337|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1542523/3/Morgan_MYM%20accepted%20for%20deposit%20Pharmacotherapy%20for%20Alcohol%20Dependence%20Jan%202017%20for%20APT.pdf}}</ref>

A normal liver detoxifies the blood of alcohol over a period of time that depends on the initial level and the patient's overall physical condition. An abnormal liver will take longer but still succeeds, provided the alcohol does not cause [[liver failure]].<ref>{{cite journal | year = 2003 | title = Management of alcoholic hepatitis | journal = Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin | volume = 41 | issue = 2| pages = 49–52 | doi = 10.1136/dtb.2003.41749 | pmc = 3099359 | pmid=21960817 | author=Morgan TR}}</ref>

Alcohol intoxication is a [[risk factor]] in some cases of [[catastrophic injury]], in particular for unsupervised [[recreation]]al activity. A study in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]] based on [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data from 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 states that 79.2% of the 2,154 catastrophic injuries recorded for the study were preventable, of which 346 (17%) involved alcohol consumption.<ref name="Tator">{{cite book|title=Catastrophic Injuries in Sports and Recreation: Causes and Prevention: A Canadian Study|editor-last=Tator|editor-first=Charles H.|edition=2|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2008|isbn=9780802089670}}</ref> The activities most commonly associated with alcohol-related catastrophic injury were [[snowmobiling]] (124), [[fishing]] (41), [[Underwater diving|diving]] (40), [[boating]] (31) and [[canoeing]] (7), swimming (31), riding an [[all-terrain vehicle]] (24), and [[cycling]] (23).<ref name="Tator" /> These events are often associated with unsupervised young males, often inexperienced in the activity, and many result in [[drowning]].<ref name="Tator" /> Alcohol use is also associated with unsafe sex.

=== Legal issues ===

In some countries, it is also an offense to serve alcohol to an already-intoxicated person,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/press/2007/february/booze-license-suspended-after-selling-alcohol-to-drunk-customers.en|title=Camden Council: Booze license suspended after selling alcohol to drunk customers|work=camden.gov.uk|access-date=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111052754/http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/press/2007/february/booze-license-suspended-after-selling-alcohol-to-drunk-customers.en|archive-date=2009-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> and, often, alcohol can be sold only by persons qualified to serve responsibly through [[alcohol server training]].

The [[Blood alcohol content#Limits by country (BAC: Blood Alcohol Content)|blood alcohol content]] (BAC) for legal operation of a vehicle is typically measured as a percentage of a unit volume of blood. This percentage ranges from 0.00% in Romania and the United Arab Emirates; to 0.05% in Australia, South Africa, Germany, Scotland and New Zealand (0.00% for underage individuals); to 0.08% in [[England and Wales]], the United States (0.00% for underaged individuals) and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icap.org/PolicyIssues/DrinkingandDriving/BACTable/tabid/199/Default.aspx |title=Drinking and Driving |work=icap.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702135901/http://www.icap.org/PolicyIssues/DrinkingandDriving/BACTable/tabid/199/Default.aspx |archive-date=2008-07-02 }}</ref>

In the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, [[public intoxication]] is a crime (also known as "being drunk and disorderly" or "being drunk and incapable").<ref>{{cite news|date=1872-08-10 |title=Licensing Act 1872 |periodical=Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament |volume=1872 |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1052305 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805165526/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1052305 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-05 |access-date=2010-05-08 }}</ref>

In some countries, there are special facilities, sometimes known as "[[drunk tanks]]", for the temporary detention of persons found to be drunk.

=== Religious views ===
[[File:Guo Xu album dated 1503 (3).jpg|thumb|''Drunken Immortal'' by Guo Xu, 1503]]
Some religious groups permit the consumption of alcohol. Some permit consumption but prohibit intoxication, while others prohibit alcohol consumption altogether. Many Christian denominations such as Catholic, Orthodox, and Lutheran use wine as a part of the Eucharist and permit the drinking of alcohol but consider it sinful to become intoxicated.

In the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Proverbs]] contains several chapters dealing with the bad effects of drunkenness and warning to stay away from intoxicating beverages. The book of Leviticus tells of Nadab and Abihu, [[Aaron]] the Priest's eldest sons, who were killed for serving in the temple after drinking wine, presumably while intoxicated. The book continues to discuss [[monasticism]] where drinking wine is prohibited. The story of [[Samson]] in the [[Book of Judges]] tells of a monk from the [[tribe of Dan]] who is prohibited from cutting his hair and drinking wine.<ref name="biblical">Biblical examples referencing intoxication: {{cite web|url=http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Pro&chapter=23&verse=21 |title=Proverbs 23:21 |publisher=Net.bible.org |access-date=2009-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620185830/http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Pro&chapter=23&verse=21 |archive-date=2009-06-20 }}, {{cite web|url=http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Isa&chapter=28&verse=1 |title=Isaiah 28:1 |publisher=Net.bible.org |access-date=2009-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620191315/http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Isa&chapter=28&verse=1 |archive-date=2009-06-20 }}, {{cite web|url=http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Hab&chapter=2&verse=15 |title=Habakkuk 2:15 |publisher=Net.bible.org |access-date=2009-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620190442/http://net.bible.org/verse.php?book=Hab&chapter=2&verse=15 |archive-date=2009-06-20 }}</ref> Romans 13:13–14,<ref>{{cite web|title=Romans 13:13–14|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013:13-14&version=NIV}}</ref> 1 Corinthians 6:9–11, Galatians 5:19–21,<ref>{{cite web|title=Galatians 5:19–21|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A19-21&version=NIV}}</ref> and Ephesians 5:18<ref>{{cite web|title=Ephesians 5:18|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ephesians+5%3A18&version=NIV}}</ref> are among a number of other Bible passages that speak against drunkenness.

In Buddhism, in general, the consumption of intoxicants is discouraged for both monastics and lay followers. Many followers of Buddhism observe a code of conduct known as the [[five precepts]], of which the fifth precept is an undertaking to refrain from the consumption of intoxicating substances<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gwynne |first1=Paul |title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction |date=2017 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-1-118-97227-4 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o08nDwAAQBAJ |chapter=The Buddhist Pancasila}}</ref> (except for medical reasons).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gombrich |first1=Richard F. |author-link1=Richard Gombrich |title=Buddhist Precept and Practice: Traditional Buddhism in the Rural Highlands of Ceylon |date=1995 |publisher=[[Kegan Paul, Trench and Company]] |isbn=978-0-7103-0444-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3Z-dHpBsBsC |page=298}}</ref> In the [[Bodhisattva vows|''bodhisattva'' vows]] of the ''[[Brahma Net Sutra|Brahma Net Sūtra]]'', observed by [[Mahāyāna]] Buddhist communities, distribution of intoxicants is likewise discouraged, as well as consumption.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last1=Sterckx |editor-first1=R. |encyclopedia=Of Tripod and Palate: Food, Politics, and Religion in Traditional China |first=James A. |last=Benn |title=Buddhism, Alcohol, and Tea in Medieval China |date=2005 |publisher=[[Springer Nature]] |isbn=978-1-4039-7927-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWPHAAAAQBAJ |page=226}}</ref>

In the branch of [[Hinduism]] known as [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], one of the four regulative principles forbids the taking of intoxicants, including alcohol.

In [[Judaism]], in accordance with the biblical stance against drinking,<ref name="biblical" /> wine drinking was not permitted for priests and monks<ref>The Talmudic decree set a schedule according to which the priests would take turns staying sober. The practice of becoming a 'biblical' monk, is discussed in a full tractate of the [[Mishna]] and Talmud. The Talmud tells of a family 'the sons of Reichab' who never drank wine, although it is not clear if this is considered good or bad.</ref> The biblical command to sanctify the [[Sabbath]] day and other holidays has been interpreted as having three ceremonial meals which include drinking of wine, the [[Kiddush]].<ref>The Kiddush is recited today only in the opening meal on Friday night and the main meal during the day. See [https://musaf-shabbat.com/2016/08/21/%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9-%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99-%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%92/ On the mystery of the missing Kiddush during the third Sabbath meal] Ruth Foichtwanger Segel, Shabbat Magazine, August 21, 2016 (Hebrew, [[Makor Rishon]] website)</ref><ref>The [[Pharisees]], avoiding the [[Zadokites]]' temple-based rituals, had installed many ceremonies which in a way change or contradict the literal meaning of the biblical protocol. These include the ceremony of lighting candles which stay lit during the Sabbath day, eating hot food from a fire lit previously, starting the Sabbath rituals on the night before, and the drinking of wine with the [[Sabbath]] meal. See [http://www.verednoam.com/articles/NoamQimronSabbathLaws.pdf Qimron Sabbath Laws] Vered Noam, Department of Hebrew Culture Studies, [[Tel Aviv University]] ([http://www.brill.com/dead-sea-discoveries Dead Sea Discoveries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131190805/http://www.brill.com/dead-sea-discoveries |date=2017-01-31 }}, Brill Institute)</ref> The Jewish marriage ceremony ends with the bride and groom drinking a shared cup of wine after reciting seven blessings, and according to western "[[Ashkenazi]]" traditions, after a fast day. But it has been customary and in many cases even mandated to drink moderately so as to stay sober, and only after the prayers are over.<ref>Menachem Posner: [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/581082/jewish/What-is-Judaisms-take-on-alcohol-consumption.htm What is Judaism's take on alcohol consumption?] on Chabad.org</ref>

During the [[Seder night]] on [[Passover]] (Pesach) there is an obligation to drink 4 ceremonial cups of wine, while reciting the [[Haggadah]]. It has been assumed as the source for the wine drinking ritual at the communion in some Christian groups.<ref>[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/jesus-historical-jesus/was-jesus-last-supper-a-seder/ Was Jesus' last supper a Seder?] Jonathan Klawans, January 7, 2014 (Biblical Archaeology organization's website)</ref> During Purim there is an obligation to become intoxicated, although, as with many other decrees, in many communities this has been avoided, by allowing sleep during the day to replace it.<ref>The [[Babylonian Talmud]] says in Megillah 7b that "[[Rava (amora)|Rava]] said: A person is obligated to become intoxicated on [[Purim]] until he is unaware of the difference between 'Cursed be [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]]' and 'Blessed be [[Mordechai]].'" This is taken to mean that on the Jewish festival of Purim one is commanded to drink alcohol to the point of intoxication. See [[Yanki Tauber]]: [http://www.chabad.org/global/popup/default_cdo/aid/2814/jewish/The-Purim-Drunk.htm Are Jews actually supposed to get drunk on Purim?] Chabad.org (referring to the Talmudic tractate Megillah (7b)).</ref>

In the 1920s due to the new beverages law, a rabbi from the [[Reform Judaism]] movement proposed using grape-juice for the ritual instead of wine. Although refuted at first, the practice became widely accepted by orthodox Jews as well.<ref>[http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/using_grape_juice_for_kiddush/ Using grape juice for Kiddush] (Torahlab website)</ref>

At the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]]—the Ibrahimi Mosque as it is called by the Muslims, the Jewish wine drinking rituals during weddings, the Sabbath day and holidays, are a cause for tension with the Muslims who unwillingly share the site under [[Israel]]i authority.<ref>[https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-11-10/hebron-jews-and-palestinians-share-holy-site-begrudgingly Hebron: Jews and Palestinians share holy site begrudgingly], Daniel Estrin, November 10, 2015 ([[Public Radio International]] website)</ref>

In elephant warfare, practiced by the Greeks during the [[Maccabean revolt]] and by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Punic wars]], it has been recorded that the elephants would be given wine before the attack, and only then would they charge forward after being agitated by their driver.<ref>[http://historythings.com/hannibals-superweapon-the-war-elephant/ Hannibal's superweapon: The war elephant] (HistoryThings.com website)</ref>

It is a regular practice to give small amounts of beer to race horses in [[Ireland]]. Ruminant farm animals have natural fermentation occurring in their stomach, and adding alcoholic beverages in small amounts to their drink will generally do them no harm, and will not cause them to become drunk.
