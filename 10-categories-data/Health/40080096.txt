Being '''bedridden''' is a form of immobility that can present as the inability to move or even sit upright.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedridden|title=Definition of BEDRIDDEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref> It differs from bed-rest, a form of non-invasive treatment that is usually part of recovery or the limitation of activities. Some of the more serious consequences of being bedridden is the high risk of developing [[Thrombosis prevention|thrombosis]] and [[Muscle atrophy|muscle wasting]] (atrophy). Its meaning is derived from a middle English term (bedrid) from a 1300s past tense form of riding a bed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bedridden|title=The definition of bedridden|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
One recommendation for preventing the complications of being bedridden is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that contains enough calories and protein needed for optimum health. If someone is confined to a bed, changing position at least every two hours can help prevent complications in addition to change sheeting and bedclothes immediately if they are soiled, and using items that can help reduce pressure, such as pillows or foam padding.<ref name=":0" />

== Studies ==
One [[India]]n study of care given to bedridden individuals at home found that family members made up 82% of [[caregivers]]. A high rate of [[Complication (medicine)|medical complications]] was reported, including [[pressure ulcers]] and [[urinary tract infection]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile of home-based caregivers of bedridden patients in North India|url=http://ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2011;volume=36;issue=2;spage=114;epage=119;aulast=Bains|author=Puneet Bains|author2=Amarjeet Singh Minhas|publisher=[[Indian Journal of Community Medicine]]|date=22 August 2011}}</ref>
