'''Game addiction problems''' can induce [[repetitive strain injury|repetitive strain injuries]], [[skin disorder]]s or other health issues. Other problems include video game-provoked [[seizures]] in patients with [[epilepsy]].<ref name= pmid17211654>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shoja MM, Tubbs RS, Malekian A, Jafari Rouhi AH, Barzgar M, Oakes WJ |title=Video game epilepsy in the twentieth century: a review |journal=Childs Nerv Syst |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=265–7 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17211654 |doi=10.1007/s00381-006-0285-2 |s2cid=12036884 }}</ref> In rare and extreme cases, deaths have resulted from excessive video game playing (see [[Video game addiction#Deaths|Deaths due to video game addiction]]).
==General findings==
Video games since their inception have been the subject of concern due to the depictions of violence they may contain, which have heightened as the technology behind video games improve the amount of visual detail and realism of games. Video games are often seen as a possible cause to violent actions, notably in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, but academic studies have yet to identify any direct evidence between depictions of violence in video games and violent behavior.<ref>[[Video game controversies#Violence]]</ref>{{circular reference|date=August 2020}}

There may or may not be an accompanying [[video game addiction]]. Video games are also been linked in some studies to [[aggressive behaviour]] and violence or fearful behaviour by its players in the short term although other studies have not supported this link.<ref name= pmid16533123>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huesmann LR, Taylor LD |title= The role of media violence in violent behavior |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |pages=393–415 |year=2006 |pmid=16533123 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144640 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name= pmid19230901>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson CJ, Kilburn J |title=The public health risks of media violence: a meta-analytic review |journal=J.

Studies have mainly reported health problems in children, mainly boys.

A further study involving musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents affirmed the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and computer usage. The study claims that daily computer use of 2 hours or more increases the risk for pain at most anatomic sites.<ref name="pmid22439805">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hakala PT, Saarni LA, Punamäki RL, Wallenius MA, Nygård CH, Rimpelä AH |title=Musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents--pain intensity and inconvenience to everyday life: a cross-sectional study |journal= BMC Musculoskelet Disord |volume=13 |issue=41 |date=March 2012|pmid=22439805 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2474-13-41|pages=41 |pmc=3348031}}</ref>

Consistently long sessions of video game play also leads to an increased likelihood of lower back pain, according to a study conducted in a population of school children. Children who played video games for more than 2 hours a day were more inclined to have lower back pain, however the same could not be said for those who watched television instead.<ref name="pmid10664300">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gunzburg R, Balagué F, Nordin M, Szpalski M, Duyck D, Bull D, Mélot C |title=Low back pain in a population of school children. |journal= Eur Spine J |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages= 439–43 |year=1999 |pmid=10664300 |doi= 10.1007/s005860050202|pmc=3611220}}</ref>

== Vision problems ==

Video game playing may be associated with vision problems.<ref name="pmid12441565"/> Extensive viewing of the screen can cause eye strain, as the cornea, pupil, and iris are not intended for mass viewing sessions of electronic devices. Using video games for too long may also cause headaches, dizziness, and chances of vomiting from focusing on a screen. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

However, certain studies have shown that video games can be used to improve various eye conditions. An investigation into the effect of action gaming on spatial distribution of attention was conducted and revealed that gamers exhibited an enhancement with attention resources compared to non-gamers, not only in the periphery but also in central vision.<ref name="pmid17154785">{{cite journal |vauthors=Green CS, Bravelier D |title=Effect of action video games on the spatial distribution of visuospatial attention |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=1465–78 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17154785 |doi= 10.1037/0096-1523.32.6.1465|pmc=2896828}}</ref> Further studies in 2011, concluded that a combination of video game therapy alongside occlusion therapy, would greatly improve the recovery of visual acuity in those experiencing [[amblyopia]].<ref name="pmid21912514">{{cite journal |vauthors=Li RW, Ngo C, Nguyen J, Levi DM |title=Video-game play induces plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. |journal=PLOS Biol |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages= e1001135|date=August 2011 |pmid=21912514 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001135 |pmc=3166159}}</ref>

==Epileptic seizures==
Concerns that video games can trigger [[epileptic seizure]]s began in the early 1980s, with the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure occurring in 1981.<ref name= NGen10>{{cite journal|title= Do Video Games Screw You Up?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|page=38}}</ref> In early 1993 ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game; similar though less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, and within a year all video game console manufacturers required that epilepsy warnings be included in the instruction manuals for all games published for their consoles.<ref name= NGen10 />

Studies published in 1994 in ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'' and ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to [[epilepsy]], and that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the TV set and wearing sunglasses while playing.<ref name= NGen10 />

== Obesity ==
{{See also| Video game addiction}}
Video game play is frequently associated with obesity. Many studies have been conducted on the link between television & video games and increased BMI ([[Body Mass Index]]).
