==Definition==

'''Global health is the health of populations in the global context; it has been defined as "the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving health and achieving equity in health for all people worldwide"
Global health employs several perspectives that focus on the determinants and distribution of health in international contexts.'''

Both individuals and organizations working in the domain of global health often face many questions regarding [[ethics|ethical]] and [[human rights]]. Critical examination of the various causes and justifications of health inequities is necessary for the success of proposed solutions. Such issues are discussed at the bi-annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20190404102034/https://www.globalsummit-berlin2016.de/ Global Summits of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils].

==History==

{{see also|Timeline of global health}}
[[File:Life expectancy by world region, from 1770 to 2018.svg|thumb|Life expectancy by world region, from 1770 to 2018]]

The 19th century held major discoveries in [[medicine]] and [[public health]].<ref>[http://www.globalhealthhub.org/timeline Global Health Timeline]</ref> The [[Broad Street cholera outbreak]] of 1854 was central to the development of modern [[epidemiology]]. The [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] responsible for [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] were identified in 1880 and 1882, respectively. The 20th century saw the development of preventive and curative treatments for many diseases, including the [[BCG vaccine]] (for tuberculosis) and [[penicillin]] in the 1920s. The eradication of [[smallpox]], with the last naturally occurring case recorded in 1977, raised hope that other diseases could be eradicated as well.

Important steps were taken towards global cooperation in health with the formation of the [[United Nations]] (UN) and the [[World Bank Group]] in 1945, after [[World War II]]. In 1948, the member states of the newly formed United Nations gathered to create the [[World Health Organization]]. A cholera epidemic that took 20,000 lives in Egypt in 1947 and 1948 helped spur the international community to action.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of WHO|author=World Health Organization|url=https://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150944/http://www.who.int/library/historical/access/who/index.en.shtml|archive-date=2006-12-07}}</ref> The WHO published its [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines|Model List of Essential Medicines]], and the 1978 [[Alma Ata declaration]] underlined the importance of [[primary health care]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Primary Health Care: Report of the International Conference on Primary Health Care|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1978|url=http://www.unicef.org/about/history/files/Alma_Ata_conference_1978_report.pdf}}</ref>

At a United Nations Summit in 2000, member nations declared eight [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=Sanjiv |title=Millennium development goals (MDGS) to sustainable development goals (SDGS): Addressing unfinished agenda and strengthening sustainable development and partnership |journal=Indian Journal of Community Medicine |date=January–March 2016 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |doi=10.4103/0970-0218.170955 |pmid=26917865 |pmc=4746946}}</ref> which reflected the major challenges facing human development globally, to be achieved by 2015.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly, 55/2|date=18 September 2000|publisher=United Nations|url=https://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf}}</ref> The declaration was matched by unprecedented global investment by donor and recipient countries.

In 2015 a book titled "[[To Save Humanity]]" was published, with nearly 100 essays regarding today's most pressing global health issues.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hoffman S.J. | year = 2011 | title = Ending Medical Complicity in State-Sponsored Torture | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9802| pages = 1535–1537 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7 | pmid = 21944647 | s2cid = 45829194 }}</ref> The essays were authored by global figures in politics, science, and advocacy ranging from [[Bill Clinton]] to [[Peter Piot]], and addressed a wide range of issues including [[Vaccination|vaccinations]], [[antimicrobial resistance]], [[Universal health care|health coverage]], [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco use]], research methodology, [[climate change]], equity, access to medicine, and media coverage of health research.

In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery was released describing the large burden of surgical disease impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Meara|first=J|display-authors=etal|date=August 8, 2015|title=Global Surgery 2030: evidence and solutions for achieving health, welfare, and economic development.|url=https://b6cf2cfd-eb09-4859-92a9-a8f002c3bcef.filesusr.com/ugd/346076_ee70c0ea4fe54f3ca2b02dcc73c19afe.pdf|journal=The Lancet Commissions|volume=386|issue=9993|pages=569–624|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60160-X|pmid=25924834|s2cid=2048403}}</ref> The shortfall in access to surgical care worldwide is estimated to affect approximately 5 billion people who do not have timely access to life-saving surgical care.<ref name=":2" />

The Commission outlines the need to improve infrastructure to make the  procedures – [[laparotomy]], [[caesarean section]], [[open fracture]] care – more widely available in LMICs in order to prevent a $12.3 trillion loss in economic productivity by 2030 as  result of surgically-related [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name=":2" />

==Measures==

Measures of global health include [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY), [[Quality-adjusted life year|quality-adjusted life years]] (QALYs), and [[mortality rate]].<ref name="etches2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Etches V, Frank J, Di Ruggiero E, Manuel D|title=Measuring population health: a review of indicators |journal=Annu Rev Public Health |volume=27 |pages=29–55 |year=2006 |pmid=16533108 |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102141 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

</div>]]
{{Main|Disability-adjusted life year}}
The DALY is a summary measure that combines the impact of [[illness]], [[disability]], and mortality by measuring the time lived with disability and the time lost due to premature mortality. One DALY can be thought of as one lost year of "healthy" life. The DALY for a disease is the sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality and the years lost due to disability for incident cases of the health condition.

===Quality-adjusted life years===
{{Main|Quality-adjusted life year}}
QALYs combine expected survival with expected [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]] into a single number: if an additional year of healthy life is worth a value of one (year), then a year of less healthy life is worth less than one (year). QALY calculations are based on measurements of the value that individuals place on expected years of survival. Measurements can be made in several ways: by techniques that replicate gambles about preferences for alternative states of health, with surveys or analyses that infer willingness to pay for alternative states of health, or through instruments that are based on trading off some or all likely survival time that a medical intervention might provide in order to gain less survival time of higher quality.<ref name="etches2006" />

===Infant and child mortality===
{{Main|Infant mortality|Child mortality}}
Infant mortality and child mortality for children under age 5 are more specific than DALYs or QALYs in representing the health in the poorest sections of a population, and are thus especially useful when focusing on [[health equity]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mulholland E, Smith L, Carneiro I, Becher H, Lehmann D|title=Equity and child-survival strategies |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=399–407 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18545743 |pmc=2647438 |url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0042-96862008000500018&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en |doi=10.2471/BLT.07.044545}}</ref>

===Morbidity===
{{Main|Morbidity}}
Morbidity measures include [[incidence rate]], [[prevalence]], and [[cumulative incidence]], with incidence rate referring to the risk of developing a new health condition within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during a time period, morbidity is better expressed as a proportion or a rate.

==Health conditions==
The diseases and health conditions targeted by global health initiatives are sometimes grouped under "[[diseases of poverty]]" versus "[[diseases of affluence]]", although the impact of globalization is increasingly blurring the lines between the two.

===Respiratory infections===
Infections of the respiratory tract and middle ear are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.<ref name="Lopez AD 2006">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lopez AD, Mathers CD, Ezzati M, Jamison DT, Murray CJ|title=Global and regional burden of disease and risk factors, 2001: systematic analysis of population health data |journal=Lancet |volume=367 |issue=9524 |pages=1747–57 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16731270 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68770-9 |s2cid=22609505 }}</ref> Some respiratory infections of global significance include [[tuberculosis]], [[measles]], [[influenza]], [[Coronavirus|coronaviruses]] and [[pneumonia]]s caused by ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', ''[[Morbillivirus]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]] and [[Pneumococci]]'' respectively. The spread of respiratory infections is exacerbated by crowded conditions, and poverty is associated with more than a 20-fold increase in the relative burden of [[lung infections]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mizgerd JP |year=2006 |title=Lung Infection—A Public Health Priority |journal=PLOS Med |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= e76|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030076 |pmid= 16401173|pmc= 1326257}}</ref>

===HIV/AIDS===
{{Main|HIV|AIDS|}}
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has highlighted the global nature of human health and welfare and globalization has given rise to a trend toward finding common solutions to global health challenges. Numerous international funds have been set up in recent times to address global health challenges such as HIV. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=HIV/AIDS: global trends, global funds and delivery bottlenecks|journal=Globalization and Health|volume=1|pages=13|doi=10.1186/1744-8603-1-13|pmid=16060961|pmc=1199613|year = 2005|last1 = Coovadia|first1 = Hoosen M.|last2=Hadingham|first2=Jacqui}}</ref>Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 36.9 million [31.1–43.9 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2017. An estimated 0.8% [0.6–0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. The WHO African region remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.1%) living with HIV and accounting for nearly two-thirds of the people living with HIV worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/|title=HIV/AIDS|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-01}}</ref> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted through unprotected sex, unclean needles, [[Blood transfusion|blood transfusions]], and from mother to child during birth or [[lactation]].

=== Surgical Disease ===
[[Surgery]] remains grossly neglected in global health, famously described by [[Halfdan T. Mahler]] as the 'neglected stepchild of global health'. This particularly affects low-resource settings with weak surgical health systems. 'Global surgery' is the term now adopted to describe the rapidly developing field seeking to address this, and has been defined as 'the [[multidisciplinary]] enterprise of providing improved and equitable surgical care to the world's population, with its core belief as the issues of need, access and quality'.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bath M, Bashford T, Fitzgerald JE |title=What is 'global surgery'?

On March 26–28, 2018, the GHSA held a high-level meeting in Tbilisi, Georgia, on biosurveillance of infectious disease threats, "which include such modern-day examples as HIV/AIDS, [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)]], [[H1N1 influenza]], [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|multi-drug resistant tuberculosis]] — any emerging or reemerging disease that threatens human health and global economic stability."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/countermeasures/27450-u-s-critical-juncture-global-health-security-agenda/|title=U.S. at critical juncture with Global Health Security Agenda|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-21|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}</ref> This event brought together GHSA partner countries, contributing countries of Real-Time Surveillance Action Package, and international partner organizations supporting the strengthening of capacities to detect infectious disease threats within the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package and other cross-cutting packages. Georgia is  the lead country for the Real-Time Surveillance Action Package.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghsagenda.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/GHSA-Surveillance-Georgia-Meeting.pdf|title=Accelerating progress in the Real-Time Biosurveillance Action Package of GHSA}}</ref>

GHSA works through four main mechanisms of member action, action packages, task forces and international cooperation. In 2015, the Steering Group of the GHSA agreed upon the implementation of their commitments through 11 Action Packages. Action Packages are a commitment by member countries and their partners to work collaboratively towards development and implementation of International Health Regulations (IHR).<ref name="Mcphee">McPhee, E., Gronvall, G. K. & Sell, T. K. 2019. Analysis of sectoral participation in the development of Joint External Evaluations. BMC public health, 19, 631–631.</ref> Action packages are based on GHSA's aim to strengthen national and international capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Each action package consists of five-year targets, measures of progress, desired impacts, country commitments, and list of baseline assessments.<ref>CDC. 2016. [https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/security/actionpackages/default.htm Global Health Security Agenda: Action Packages] Accessed 18 Nov 2019.</ref> The Joint External Evaluation process, derived as part of the IHR Monitoring and Evaluation Framework is an assessment of a country's capacity for responding to public health threats.<ref name="Mcphee" /> So far, G7 partners and EU have made a collective commitment to assist 76 countries whereas the US committed to helping 32 countries to achieve GHSA targets for IHR implementation. In September 2014, a pilot tool was developed to measure progress of the Action Packages and applied in countries (Georgia, Peru, Uganda, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine) that volunteered to participate in an external assessment.<ref>Wolicki, S.
