[[Sleep deprivation]] - the condition of not having enough [[sleep]] - is a common issue for students in higher education. This issue has several underlying and negative consequences, but there are a few helpful improvements that students can make to reduce its frequency and severity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/faqs/what-are-the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation-on-the-human-body/|title=What are the effects of sleep deprivation on the human body?|last=Inc|first=Sanmita|date=2015-11-20|website=Cornell Center for Materials Research|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> On average, [[university]] students get 6 to 6.9 hours of sleep every night.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uhs.uga.edu/sleep|title=University Health Center {{!}} Managing Stress {{!}} SleepUniversity Health Center {{!}} University of GeorgiaUniversity Health Center|website=www.uhs.uga.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> Based on the Treatment for Sleep Disorders, the recommended amount of sleep needed for college students is around 8 hours. According to [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] Department for the Diagnosis, 68% of college students aren't getting the sleep they need.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~dement/sleepless.html|title=Sleepless at Stanford|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The main causes of sleep deprivation include poor [[sleep hygiene]], [[biology]], use of technology, and use of drugs.<ref name=":0">https://aasm.org/resources/factsheets/sleepdeprivation.pdf</ref> The effects can damage the student’s [[Grading in education|GPA]], as well as negatively affect the student's focus and memory.<ref name=":0" /> Furthermore, the effects on the individual’s [[mental health]] can be harmful too. Students may face [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and difficulty maintaining their relationships.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lund|first=Hannah G.|last2=Reider|first2=Brian D.|last3=Whiting|first3=Annie B.|last4=Prichard|first4=J.

== Causes ==

=== Sleep Hygiene ===
Inadequate sleep hygiene is one reason why college students experience sleep deprivation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hershner|first=Shelley D|last2=Chervin|first2=Ronald D|date=2014-06-23|title=Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students|journal=Nature and Science of Sleep|volume=6|pages=73–84|doi=10.2147/NSS.S62907|issn=1179-1608|pmc=4075951|pmid=25018659}}</ref> [[Sleep hygiene]] is defined as habits or practices that allow for healthy amounts of sleep on a daily basis.<ref name=":1" /> Good sleep hygiene habits include keeping a consistent sleep schedule, having a quiet sleep environment, avoiding the consumption of [[caffeine]] after lunch, and minimizing [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] consumption before bed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sleepeducation.org/essentials-in-sleep/healthy-sleep-habits|title=Healthy Sleep Habits and Good Sleep Hygiene|website=sleepeducation.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>

=== Technology ===
Using technology before falling asleep can affect a student’s sleep pattern.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-blue-light-affects-kids-sleep|title=The Sneaky Ways That Blue Light Can Interfere With Your Kids' Sleep|website=www.sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The blue light that is emitted from the screens of cell phones, computers, and other devices stops the production of [[melatonin]].<ref name=":2" /> [[Melatonin]] is a hormone that controls the sleep-wake cycle of the [[circadian rhythm]].<ref name=":2" /> This reduction of the amount of melatonin produced makes it harder to fall and stay asleep.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleep.org/articles/ways-technology-affects-sleep/|title=How Technology Impacts Sleep Quality|website=Sleep.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The National Sleep Foundation conducted a poll in 2011 and reported that approximately 90% of Americans used technology in the hour before bed.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/press-release/annual-sleep-america-poll-exploring-connections-communications-technology-use-and|title=Annual Sleep in America Poll Exploring Connections with Communications Technology Use and Sleep {{!}} National Sleep Foundation|website=www.sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> The poll noted that young adults and teenagers were more likely to use cell phones, computers, and video game consoles than other adults.<ref name=":3" /> Furthermore, 22% of participants reported going to sleep with cell phone ringers on in their bedroom and 10% reported awakenings in at least a few nights per week due to their cell phones' ringers.<ref name=":3" /> Among those with the cell phone ringers on, being awakened by their cell phone was correlated to difficulty sustaining sleep.<ref name=":3" />

According to Elizabeth B. Dowdell and Brianne Q. Clayton, sleep-deprived college students performed significantly worse than peers who had adequate sleep on cognitive skills.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Dowdell|first=Elizabeth B.|last2=Clayton|first2=Brianne Q.|date=2019-10-03|title=Interrupted sleep: College students sleeping with technology|journal=Journal of American College Health|volume=67|issue=7|pages=640–646|doi=10.1080/07448481.2018.1499655|issn=0744-8481|pmid=30365360}}</ref> Furthermore, the sleep-deprived students were not aware of the extent to which sleep deprivation negatively affects their ability to complete cognitive tasks.<ref name=":4" /> Research has shown that individuals with excessive technology use in the bedroom have later bedtimes and tend to sleep later in the morning.<ref name=":4" /> The reliance on technology in the bedroom, which should be associated only with sleep, creates difficulty separating waking and sleeping activities.<ref name=":4" /> When measuring the amount of sleep during the week compared to the weekend, students with four or more technological devices in their bedroom had significantly less sleep compared to those with three or fewer devices.<ref name=":4" /> Since many students do not utilize a do not disturb mode or silence their phones at night, each notification and alert from their phones disrupts their sleep in terms of quality and duration.<ref name=":4" />

=== Biology ===
Several recent studies have shown that adolescents undergo a change in their circadian cycle which shifts sleep times later into the night.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Carskadon|first=Mary A.|date=2011-06-01|title=Sleep in Adolescents: The Perfect Storm|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|series=Pediatric Sleep Medicine Update|volume=58|issue=3|pages=637–647|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2011.03.003|pmid=21600346|pmc=3130594|issn=0031-3955}}</ref> This change seems to occur during puberty, extending well into adulthood.<ref name=":5" /> The delay in sleep cycles clashes with the structured early morning schedules of students due to early classes or work; thus, the total amount of sleep time is greatly reduced.<ref name=":5" /> There has been a push in many educational systems for a later start time to help increase the available time for sleep in adolescents due to these biological changes.<ref name=":5" />

=== College Scheduling and Activities ===
Many college students have variable day-to-day class schedules that change one's daily schedule. Additionally, many college campuses offer late night social activities that can begin as late as 10pm. These activities are crucial for college students because they allow socialization and bonding with one another, which may boost one's mood. Similarly, many fraternity and sorority organizations on college campuses hold events and fundraisers that often occur late and throughout the night which are mandatory obligations for some. Having to work an event in the middle of the night can cause someone's sleep schedule to be disrupted for the entire day and possibly the next day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hershner|first=Shelley D|last2=Chervin|first2=Ronald D|date=2014-06-23|title=Causes and consequences of sleepiness among college students|journal=Nature and Science of Sleep|volume=6|pages=73–84|doi=10.2147/NSS.S62907|issn=1179-1608|pmc=4075951|pmid=25018659}}</ref>

=== Drugs ===

==== Caffeine ====
A study from the [[University of Kentucky]] depicted that more than 78% of college freshmen consume above the recommended amount of caffeine each day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIlvain|first=Gary|date=2008-01-01|title=CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AND BELIEFS OF COLLEGE FRESHMEN|url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/gradschool_diss/638|journal=University of Kentucky Doctoral Dissertations}}</ref> In a study from the Henry Ford Hospital's Sleep and Research Center and Wayne State College of Medicine, they discovered that caffeine consumed within six hours of bedtime can significantly disrupt sleep.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=Christopher|last2=Roehrs|first2=Timothy|last3=Shambroom|first3=John|last4=Roth|first4=Thomas|date=2013-11-15|title=Caffeine Effects on Sleep Taken 0, 3, or 6 Hours before Going to Bed|journal=Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine |volume=9|issue=11|pages=1195–1200|doi=10.5664/jcsm.3170|issn=1550-9389|pmc=3805807|pmid=24235903}}</ref> Participants in this study who consumed caffeine right before bedtime, three hours before bedtime, and six hours before bedtime all experienced a shorter night's sleep, lower sleep quality, and spent more time awake at night.<ref name=":6" />

==== Adderall ====
[[Adderall]] is a drug that affects the central nervous system and is prescribed to individuals with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and/or [[narcolepsy]].<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/blog/more-you-adderall-less-you-sleep|title=The More You Adderall, the Less You Sleep {{!}} Student Health and Counseling Services|website=shcs.ucdavis.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> This drug is commonly misused by college students as a "study drug," although research suggests that stimulants are more efficient at correcting shortfalls than enhancing performance.<ref name=":7" />  Adderall is a highly abused substance among students in higher education because it prevents the [[reuptake]] of dopamine, allowing college students to stay up all day or night and remain alert.<ref name=":7" /> The effects of recreational use are exhaustion and an accumulation of “sleep debt.”<ref name=":7" /> Furthermore, frequent use of [[adderall]] during the day and night can lead to [[sleep deprivation]] and [[insomnia]].<ref name=":7" />

==== Alcohol ====
College students who consume moderate to severe amounts of [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] are increasingly likely to face lower quality of sleep.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://students.dartmouth.edu/academic-skills/learning-resources/alcohol-sleep-and-learning|title=Alcohol, Sleep, and Learning {{!}} Academic Skills Center|website=students.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> A study published in Behavioral Sleep Medicine showed that significant [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] use can lead to “lower sleep duration, greater sleep schedule irregularity, bedtime delay, weekend oversleeping, and sleep-related impairment.”<ref name=":20">{{Cite journal|last=Fucito|first=Lisa M.|last2=DeMartini|first2=Kelly S.|last3=Hanrahan|first3=Tess|last4=Whittemore|first4=Robin|last5=Yaggi|first5=Henry Klar|last6=Redeker|first6=Nancy S.|date=2015-09-03|title=Perceptions of Heavy Drinking College Students about a Sleep and Alcohol Health Intervention|journal=Behavioral Sleep Medicine|volume=13|issue=5|pages=395–411|doi=10.1080/15402002.2014.919919|issn=1540-2002|pmc=4265000|pmid=24924956}}</ref> Furthermore, increasing [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] consumption may lead to the student falling asleep faster, but the student will face sleep disturbance.<ref name=":8" /> Alcohol use decreases REM sleep, so student who consumes [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] may sleep for the normal 7–8 hours, but the sleep quality will be lower than an individual who was sober.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":20" />

== Effects  ==

=== Physical ===

==== Drowsiness ====
Sleep deprivation causes [[drowsiness]], which can affect students in higher education. Drowsiness can affect students in their classes and poses a risk for those who commute by car to their college campuses. Many students commute by car to their classes from their homes; at the [[Ohio State University]], close to 30% of students commute.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ohio-state-6883/student-life</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelantern.com/2019/02/commuting-brings-different-experience-to-ohio-state-students/|title=Commuting brings different experience to Ohio State students|date=2019-02-07|website=The Lantern|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Individuals with less than 6 hours of sleep are the most likely to fall asleep at the wheel and with the average university students getting that amount of sleep, the dangers are a real factor for students.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Minyard|first=Karen|last2=Parker|first2=Chris|last3=Butts|first3=John|date=2016-06-15|title=Improving rural access to care: Recommendations for Georgia's health care safety net|journal=Journal of the Georgia Public Health Association|volume=5|issue=4|pages=387–396|doi=10.21633/jgpha.5.412|issn=2471-9773|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":21" /> Once a student makes it to class, sleep deprivation will affect their ability to stay awake throughout the class.<ref name=":9" /> Over 50% of students have fallen asleep in class.<ref name=":21">{{Cite web|url=https://thetab.com/us/2017/02/25/new-survey-reveals-50-college-students-admit-falling-asleep-class-61538|title=New survey reveals over 50% of college students admit to falling asleep in class|date=2017-02-25|website=The Tab US|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>

==== Attention and Memory ====
Even if a student is staying awake in class, their ability to pay attention in class is severely diminished.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://brandongaille.com/21-sleep-deprivation-statistics-in-college-students/|title=23 Sleep Deprivation Statistics in College Students|last=Brandon Gaille|date=2017-05-20|website=BrandonGaille.com|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> 23.2% of students who don’t get enough sleep every night report that they have trouble being able to concentrate on things.<ref name=":10" /> Not being able to focus in class will cause the student to struggle on learning the material, which can lead to increased sleep deprivation from spending more time on homework.<ref name=":10" /> Lack of sleep also affects the forming of memories.<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/matters/benefits-of-sleep/learning-memory|title=Sleep, Learning, and Memory {{!}} Healthy Sleep|website=healthysleep.med.harvard.edu|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Studies show [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] sleep is involved in creating memories related to complex information and “students not getting enough sleep will have trouble committing their classes material to memory and learn slower”.<ref name=":11" /> Forgetfulness is another symptom of sleep deprivation which can be immensely harmful, especially during an exam when memory is crucial.<ref name=":11" /> Without adequate sleep, the neurons “can no longer function to coordinate information properly, and students lose the ability to access previously learned information."<ref name=":11" /> A study of graduate pharmacy students showed 81.7% of students failed to get 7 hours of sleep on the night before an examination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zeek|first=Megan L.|last2=Savoie|first2=Matthew J.|last3=Song|first3=Matthew|last4=Kennemur|first4=Leanna M.|last5=Qian|first5=Jingjing|last6=Jungnickel|first6=Paul W.|last7=Westrick|first7=Salisa C.|date=2015-06-25|title=Sleep Duration and Academic Performance Among Student Pharmacists|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume=79|issue=5|pages=63|doi=10.5688/ajpe79563|issn=0002-9459|pmc=4571043|pmid=26396272}}</ref>

==== Eating ====
Less sleep can lead to weight gain and [[obesity]] due to decreases in the body's energy expenditure and ability to stop eating once full.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hogenkamp|first=Pleunie S.|last2=Nilsson|first2=Emil|last3=Nilsson|first3=Victor C.|last4=Chapman|first4=Colin D.|last5=Vogel|first5=Heike|last6=Lundberg|first6=Lina S.|last7=Zarei|first7=Sanaz|last8=Cedernaes|first8=Jonathan|last9=Rångtell|first9=Frida H.|last10=Broman|first10=Jan-Erik|last11=Dickson|first11=Suzanne L.|date=September 2013|title=Acute sleep deprivation increases portion size and affects food choice in young men|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=38|issue=9|pages=1668–1674|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2013.01.012|pmid=23428257|doi-access=free}}</ref> Combining this with the already insufficient diets of college students due to time and monetary constraints can combine to result in weight gain in college students. Weight gain in first year college students is a well known phenomenon called the [[Freshman Fifteen]] in the US or the Fresher Five in Australia or New Zealand.

=== Emotional ===

==== Mental Health ====
Insufficient sleep affects students mood by increasing irritability and negatively affecting their emotions.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|url=https://thesleepdoctor.com/2018/05/01/how-sleep-deprivation-hurts-your-emotional-health/|title=How Sleep Deprivation Hurts Your Emotional Health|last=Breus|first=Dr Michael|date=2018-05-01|website=Your Guide to Better Sleep|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Research shows that sleep deprivation increases [[amygdala]] activity which is linked to negative emotions like anger and rage.<ref name=":12" /> [[Anxiety]] is another symptom of sleep loss experienced by students. Lack of sleep amplifies anxiety in people who already experience increased levels of worry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/06/27/sleep-loss-increases-anxiety-especially-among-worriers/56531.html|title=Sleep Loss Increases Anxiety — Especially Among Worriers|last=read|first=Rick Nauert PhD Associate News Editor Last updated: 8 Aug 2018 ~ 2 min|date=2013-06-27|website=psychcentral.com|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> A survey of college students in 2018 showed 63% of students felt “overwhelming anxiety.” [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] has also been linked to sleeplessness. In a study of 1,000 young adults those with sleep issues were four times more likely to develop depression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/sleep-and-mental-health|title=Sleep and mental health|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|website=Harvard Health|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> These symptoms are two-directional. Anxiety and depression have been shown to cause sleeplessness, meaning these symptoms can be compound.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peltz|first=Jack S.|last2=Rogge|first2=Ronald D.|last3=Pugach|first3=Cameron P.|last4=Strang|first4=Kathryn|date=2017-06-01|title=Bidirectional Associations Between Sleep and Anxiety Symptoms in Emerging Adults in a Residential College Setting|journal=Emerging Adulthood|volume=5|issue=3|pages=204–215|doi=10.1177/2167696816674551|issn=2167-6968}}</ref>

==== Relationships ====
The effects of sleeplessness also affect relationships among college students. An Ohio State University study showed that couples that obtained less than 7 hours of sleep interacted in a more hostile way.<ref name=":13">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/effects-lack-sleep-relationships/|title=The Effects Of Lack Of Sleep On Relationships|date=2018-01-02|website=The Sleep Matters Club|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> They also are less successful at resolving conflicts when they do come up.<ref name=":13" /> This is an effect from the irritability and impaired decision-making exhibited by students with sleep deprivation.<ref name=":13" /> Sleep deprivation also has been shown to reduce feelings of gratitude, which is an integral part of a healthy relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201404/why-your-relationship-depends-good-nights-sleep|title=Why Your Relationship Depends on a Good Night's Sleep|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>

'''Mood'''

Sleep deprivation has been found to effect mood as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=J. J.|last2=Huffcutt|first2=A. I.|date=May 1996|title=Effects of sleep deprivation on performance: a meta-analysis|journal=Sleep|volume=19|issue=4|pages=318–326|doi=10.1093/sleep/19.4.318|issn=0161-8105|pmid=8776790|doi-access=free}}</ref> This effect is most pronounced in those that are consistently partially sleep deprived, which is the case for many college students. A meta-analysis of several studies regarding sleep deprivation suggests that the effects of partial sleep deprivation are underestimated.

=== Academic ===

==== GPA ====
Inadequate sleep has been shown to affect student’s GPA by up to a .02 drop for every night of the week a student sleeps poorly.<ref name=":14">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-college-sleep-idUSKCN1LR28U|title=Sleep may impact college grades more than drinking or drugs|date=2018-09-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The effects of poor sleep are similar to that of binge drinking or abusive relationships on students' GPA along with their likeliness to drop one or more classes.<ref name=":14" /> The previously mentioned symptoms of inadequate sleep contribute to the drop in GPA. Consequences span from lack of focus affecting students classwork to decreased motivation leading to less hours of studying.

==== Social Withdrawal ====
Sleep deprivation may lead to social withdrawal due to increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://artandhealing.org/campus-loneliness-fact-sheet/|title=Campus Loneliness Fact Sheet|date=2018-03-23|website=The UnLonely Project|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Social interaction is an important part of the lives of students in higher education to remain emotionally stable.<ref name=":15" />  Over 64% of students in a 2017 study surveying 48,000 college students stated that they had felt lonely in the past year.<ref name=":15" /> The lack of social interaction has also been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression, which can negatively affect students.<ref name=":15" /> Social withdrawal also negatively affects college students’ social lives because when they feel drowsy they are less likely to seek out new experiences, which is an integral part of a student’s time in higher education.<ref name=":15" />

== Possible Improvements ==

=== Establishing Circadian Rhythm and Reducing Blue Light ===
Circadian rhythm is our bodies’ system that internally monitors and regulates sleep and waking hours in a 24 hour period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleep.org/articles/circadian-rhythm-body-clock/|title=What is Circadian Rhythm / Body Clock?|website=Sleep.org|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Sleeping a consistent number of hours will reduce feelings of drowsiness throughout the day, especially due to the large amount of sleep necessary for students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock|title=Body Clock & Sleep - National Sleep Foundation|website=www.sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Going to sleep at a consistent time can also be just as important as sleeping the same number of hours each night.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170612094045.htm|title=Irregular sleeping patterns linked to poorer academic performance in college students: Timing of sleep found to be as important as number of hours slept|website=ScienceDaily|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Students with consistent sleeping schedules had better grades on average than students with irregular sleep schedules according to a study conducted by Brigham and Women’s Hospital.<ref name=":16" /> Schedule changes may impact circadian rhythm, and will take time for your body to adjust to.<ref name=":16" />

Most modern technology with screens emit blue light, which has the ability to impact and shift circadian rhythms by tricking the body’s response to normal changes in light.<ref name=":17">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/q-a-why-is-blue-light-before-bedtime-bad-for-sleep/</ref>  As stated previously, exposure to blue light has the ability to suppress melatonin, a hormone that helps prepare our body for sleep.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side|title=Blue light has a dark side|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|website=Harvard Health|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Exposure in the early evening causes a delay to release that melatonin and therefore impacts our bodies' circadian rhythm by shifting it back.<ref name=":17" />

=== Naps ===
Napping can be an emergency measure used to help improve performance in the short term as well as supplement missing hours of sleep. Naps can have several purposes, most commonly to either to prevent sleepiness or recover from sleepiness when working on a task.<ref name=":18" /> Naps should be 60 to 90 minutes for the greatest benefits but any longer may result in affecting a person’s circadian rhythm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/repaying-your-sleep-debt|title=Repaying your sleep debt|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|website=Harvard Health|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref name=":19" /> After napping, a person can wake with “sleep inertia” where a person feels groggy or disoriented after waking.<ref name=":18" />

Naps have positive short term effects, especially in improving performance and attention.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/napping|title=Napping Benefits & Tips - National Sleep Foundation|website=www.sleepfoundation.org|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> A study conducted at the [[University of California, Riverside]] showed that participants performed similarly on an exam after a 90 minute nap compared to a full eight hours of sleep.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/07-08/naps|title=The science of naps|work=https://www.apa.org|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Similarly, NASA conducted a study involving its pilots, where even a minimal 30 to 40 minute nap improved pilot’s “performance by 34% and their alertness by 54%”.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/america-its-time-for-your-nap|title=America, It's Time for Your Nap|last=Davis|first=Jeanie Lerche|website=WebMD|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> In another study done by Lau, Alger and Fishbein showed that students who took nap after studying were more likely to retain and recall what was learned. Both longer and short naps aided in memory retention of material. (''Lau, H., Alger, S. E., & Fishbein, W. ( 2011 ). Relational memory: A daytime nap facilitates the abstraction of general concepts. Plos ONE, 6 ( 11 ), 1 - 6. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0027139).'' 

=== Improving Bedroom Environment ===
