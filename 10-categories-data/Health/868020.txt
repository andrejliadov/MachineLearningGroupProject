An '''agathodaemon''' ({{lang-grc|ἀγαθοδαίμων}}, {{transl|grc|agathodaímōn}}) or '''agathos daemon''' ({{lang|grc|ἀγαθός δαίμων}}, {{transl|grc|agathós daímōn}}, {{lit.|noble spirit}}) was a [[spiritual being|spirit]] (''[[daemon (mythology)|daemon]]'') of [[ancient Greek religion]]. They were personal companion spirits,<ref>Hor. Ep. ll, 2, 187.</ref><ref>Tibull. IV, 8</ref> comparable to the Roman ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]]'', who ensured good [[luck]], [[health]], and [[wisdom]].

==During the classical period==
Though little noted in [[Greek mythology]] ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] conjectured that the name was merely an epithet of [[Zeus]]),<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', viii. 36. § 3</ref> he was prominent in Greek folk religion;<ref>[[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Greek Folk Religion''. (Columbia University Press), 1981:33, 70, 73.</ref> it was customary to [[Libation|drink or pour out a few drops]] of unmixed [[wine]] to honor him in every [[symposium]] or formal [[banquet]]. In [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', when War has trapped Peace (Εἰρήνη ''[[Eirene (Greek goddess)|Eirene]]'') in a deep pit, Hermes comes to give aid: "Now, oh Greeks! is the moment when, freed of quarrels and fighting, we should rescue sweet ''Eirene'' and draw her out of this pit... This is the moment to drain a cup in honor of the ''Agathos Daimon''."  A temple dedicated to them was situated on the road from [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] to [[Mainalo|Maenalus]] in [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]].<ref name="DGRBM">{{Citation

An ''Agathos Daimon'' was the spouse or companion of ''[[Tyche]] Agathe'' ({{lang|grc|Τύχη Ἀγαθή}}, "Good Fortune"; {{lang-la|Agatha}}). "Tyche we know at [[Livadeia|Lebadeia]] as the wife of the Agathos Daimon, the Good or Rich Spirit".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=371}}{{sfn|Harrison|1922|pp=355–ff, 543}}  Their [[Numen|numinous presence]] could be represented in art as a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or more concretely as a young man bearing a [[cornucopia]] and a bowl in one hand, and a [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] and an ear of grain in the other.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=371}}  The agathodaemon was later adapted into a general [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]] of ''[[fortuna]]'', particularly of the continued abundance of a family's good [[food]] and [[drink]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==During late antiquity==
In the [[syncretism|syncretic atmosphere]] of [[Late Antiquity]], agathodaemons could be bound up with Egyptian bringers of security and good fortune: a gem carved with magic emblems bears the images of [[Serapis]] with crocodile, sun-lion and [[Osiris]] mummy surrounded by the lion-headed snake Chnum–Agathodaemon–[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], with [[Harpocrates]] on the reverse.<ref>Illustrated in W. Fauth, ''Helios Megistos: zur synkretistischen Theologie der Spätantike'' (Leiden: Brill) 1995:85.</ref>
