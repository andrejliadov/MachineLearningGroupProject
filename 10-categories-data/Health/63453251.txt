Global climate change has resulted a wide range of impacts on the spread of infectious diseases is a prominent instance due to ‘climate-sensitive’ characterization.{{Clarify|reason=|date=June 2020}} Like other [[Effects of global warming on human health|climate change impacts on human health]], climate change both exacerbates existing inequalities and challenges in managing infectious disease while increasing the likelihood of certain kinds of new infectious disease challenges.

Documented infectious disease impacts of climate change, include increased [[malaria]] and [[dengue]], which are expected to worsen as the global climate changes directly result in extreme weather conditions and higher temperatures. Not only will it propagate their spread, but climate change will probably bring forth new infectious diseases,<ref name="Johns Hopkins Jan 2020">{{Cite press release|date=2020-01-22|title=Johns Hopkins Researchers: Climate Change Threatens to Unlock New Microbes and Increase Heat-Related Illness and Death|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/johns-hopkins-researchers-climate-change-threatens-to-unlock-new-microbes-and-increase-heat-related-illness-and-death|access-date=2020-06-28|website=Newsroom|language=en|publisher=Johns Hopkins Medicine}}</ref> and change the epidemiology of many existing diseases.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Despite humanity's recent success at managing  diseases such as [[SARS]], [[coronavirus]], and [[Ebola]] – historical data is by no means a guarantee of the future success of confrontation given that each new disease brings its own set of [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment|challenges as seen in with the ongoing pandemic regarding COVID-19]]. There is no direct evidence that COVID-19 is worsened or is caused by climate change.

== Impact on human health ==
The [[World Health Organization]] and [[United Nations Environment Programme]] established the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) in 1988 because there was little knowledge about health issues caused by global climate change.<ref name="WHO Climate Change and Human Health 2003" /> [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has presented three assessment reports. [[IPCC First Assessment Report]], [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] and [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] wrote about climate change, potential health risks caused by climate change and early evidence of actual health impacts.<ref name="WHO Climate Change and Human Health 2003" /> IPPC and other policy-related assessments at the regional and national levels stimulated scientific studies to understand the climate-health relationships.<ref name="WHO Climate Change and Human Health 2003">{{Cite book|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/42749/9241590815.pdf|title=Climate change and human health - risks and responses.

A noticeable effect of the global climate change is the increase of temperature.

== Dengue ==
There are many viruses that coincide with climate change. [[Dengue virus|Dengue]] being one of many is a virus that can be transmitted by ''[[Aedes aegypti|Aedes Aegypti]]'' mosquitoes and was first isolated in 1943 by scientists Ren Kimura and Susumu. Dengue is deadly and has affected people all over the world, especially for those who live in warmer climates. The symptoms in mild cases are vomiting, rash, high fever (40&nbsp;°C/104&nbsp;°F), joint pain, eye pain, and in severe cases (fever 38&nbsp;°C/100&nbsp;°F) death.<ref name=":24">{{Cite web|title=Dengue and severe dengue|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus. There are higher peaks of mosquitoes during raining season. From the end of the industrial revolution to our present day, the levels of carbon dioxide have risen from 280 parts per million to 412 parts per million within the last 150 years.<ref name=":34">{{Cite web|title=The Causes of Climate Change|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/causes|website=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> The [[World Health Organization|Worlds Health Organization]] (WHO) has reported an increase from a thousand to one million for the number of confirmed cases and countries between 1955 and 2007.<ref name=":24" /> Coincidentally, due to the climate change, a greenhouse barrier has formed in the earth’s atmosphere, composed of gases such as nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide.<ref name=":34" /> The greenhouse gases trap sun rays that should be reflected back out into the universe, thereby causing the Earth's temperature to elevate.<ref name=":34" /> The increasing temperatures mostly affect countries that are closer to water since water can absorb a lot of energy from the sun and can release it in the form of vaporization. As the evaporated water condenses, the amount of condensation increases and the likelihood of precipitation increases as well. As a result, climate change causes higher raining seasons, temperature, and humidity. These conditions are favorable for ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquito population since these conditions form habitats that are accessible for laying eggs and spreading the transmission of dengue virus to people.

There are many ways, where nations have come together in order to combat Dengue. For example, many scientists from Cuba and the United States have done advanced collaboration to expedite the progress of the mosquito-borne virus, dengue.<ref name="clinmedjournals.org|language=en">{{cite web|title=ClinMed International Library |url=https://clinmedjournals.org|website=www.clinmedjournals.org|language=en}}</ref> Despite cultural differences, these two nations have set aside political conflicts in order to exchange vital information and ideas between scientists and the public. They launch the Havana symposium, which allowed Cuba and the U.S to discuss ways of controlling the virus and the transmission of dengue to the people. Together, they have done research on the properties of insecticides and mosquito repellents that are derived from plants and the effect of these properties on living cells.<ref>{{cite web|title=AAAS Home|url=https://aaas.org|website=American Association for the Advancement of Science|language=en}}</ref> This information has been vital for finding ways to prevent Dengue transmission. One example is Dengvaxia, which is a vaccine available for Dengue prevention. However, it is only recommended for people who were already exposed to the Dengue virus infection. Still, there are other forms of preventing the spread of Dengue. Another form of prevention is using insect repellents, avoiding moisture build-up indoors and outdoors, and wearing protective clothing can prevent the spread of Dengue. A step-by-step tutorial for prevention and protection against the spread of Dengue is available online.

There are other organizations that are preventing climate change and the spread of new viruses. For example, The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPPC) provides scientific evaluations based on climate change impact, adaption and alleviation options, and future risks. The information from IPPC is the most reliable source when it comes to climate change. IPPC reports are used as a foundation for policymaking. The [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) are other organizations that work toward mitigating climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=ippc – international project people consulting|url=https://IPPC.ch|website=ippc.ch}}</ref> UNEP works on seven different areas of climate change and is the leading international environmental authority. In addition, the seven areas that UNEP mainly focuses on are climate change, managing ecosystems, natural disasters and conflicts, environmental policies, chemicals, and wastes, monitor the financial output of environmental conditions, and the study of many environmental conditions.<ref name="clinmedjournals.org|language=en"/> This organization is known for mitigating environmental conditions and trends at a global, regional, and national level. Also, they have created programs that help to fight against climate change such as REDD+ program ([[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]]), Climate and Clean Air Coalition ([[Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants]]), and Climate Technology Centre and Network. WMO specifically monitors weather, climate, and water. WMO dedicates their time to bring international awareness and cooperation, pertaining to the earth’s atmosphere. This organization focuses on reducing the risk of disasters and provides vital information about meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and oceanographic activities. In 2014, a global foundational fund known as the [[Green Climate Fund]] was created.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Climate Fund|url=https://greenclimate.fund|last1=|first1=|website=Green Climate Fund|language=en}}</ref> This fund focuses on underdeveloped countries, islands, and many African states, which have been affected the most due to climate change. Another fund is the [[Climate Investment Funds]], which supports economies that are trying to minimize the use of carbon in order to prevent climate change. There are also support groups that are fighting for environmental causes. [[350.org]] is a support group that fights against fossil fuel industries and the mining in various parts of Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parotid Secretion and Its Pharmacologically Induced Variants (Author's Transl)|url=https://350.org|last1=R|first1=Chilla|last2=R|first2=Arold|date=|website=HNO|language=en}}</ref> Another organization is the [[C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group]], which is trying to develop solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.<ref>{{cite web|title=C40|url=https://C40.org|website=www.c40.org}}</ref>

== Ebola ==
The war of microorganisms against mankind is one that's been ongoing for centuries. Microorganisms have been around long before the existence of humans. At one point or another, we have all had the [[Influenza|flu]] or a cold; this is caused by viruses. [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] is one of the deadliest viruses, starting out as a small outbreak and eventually turning into a major global issue. The average case fatality rate of the Ebola virus is approximately 40% and to date, there have been more than 28,600 cases with 11,310 deaths.<ref name=":04">{{Cite web|title=Ebola (Ebola Virus Disease) {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/index.html|date=2020-02-05|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> Recent studies are holding [[climate change]] liable for the uptick in Ebola. Many researchers are linking deforestation to the disease, observing that change in the landscape increases wildlife contact with humans.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|title=Climate crisis raises risk of more Ebola outbreaks|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/health/climate-crisis-ebola-risks/index.html|first=Jen |last=Christensen|website=CNN|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> Ebola virus is typically found in animals of the wild and can be transmitted from these animals to humans when exposed to infected bodily fluids.<ref name=":04" /> The virus can also be transmitted from another human when in direct contact with the virus hosts blood, vomit, or feces. Seasonal droughts alongside strong winds, thunderstorms, heat waves, floods, landslides, and a change in rainfall patterns also impact the wildlife migration. These conditions pull them away from their natural environment and closer to human proximity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ebola and Climate Change: How Are They Connected?|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/ebola-and-climate-change-how-are-they-connected-1881942860.html|date=2014-08-14|website=EcoWatch|language=en|access-date=2020-05-06}}</ref> One example of an Ebola outbreak caused by climate change or a shift in nature was seen during the drought of Central Africa. This ultimately amplified food insecurity leading West African communities to eat animals such as bats who were infected with the virus.<ref name=":14" />

Outbreaks such as Ebola are transnational threats. Viral diseases like Ebola, have no remorse for any border or country. It's a battle that no country can face alone. [[Science diplomacy|Global health diplomacy]] helps bring together the regulation of public health, law, foreign affairs, economics, and puts the limelight on negotiations that can help build and manage policies for global environmental health. In 2014, Cuba sent 461 doctors to West Africa to help combat the outbreak of Ebola.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Politics of Ebola and the critical role of global health diplomacy for the CARICOM|last1=Chattu|first1=Vijay Kumar|journal=Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care|date=2017|volume=6|issue=3|pages=463–467|doi=10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_75_17|pmid=29416990|pmc=5787937}}</ref> Cuba was one of the first countries that have supplied as many trained health professionals to the Ebola outbreak than any other nation.

For instance, the humanitarian aid organization [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] also known as Doctors Without Borders became the prominent organization that was responding to the crisis by having many health centers in the area. Another non-governmental organization is the Samaritan's Purse who provided direct patient care and medical aid in Liberia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battling an Ebola Outbreak|url=https://www.samaritans-purse.org.uk/article/battling-an-Ebola-outbreak/|website=Samaritan's Purse UK}}</ref>

== Emergence of new infectious diseases ==
In recent decades, experts began to sound the alarm that climate change could be associated with changes to the [[epidemiology]] of infectious diseases. This viewpoint focuses on a threat where there is a strong possibility that new, previously unknown infectious diseases will emerge from warmer climates as microbes adapt to higher global temperatures that can defeat our ''endothermy'' thermal barrier. Human defenses against microbial diseases rely on advanced immunity, which includes innate and adaptive arms and endothermy. This creates a thermal restriction zone for many microbes. Given that microbes can adapt to higher temperatures, there is a concern that global climate change will select for microbes with higher temperature tolerance that can defeat our immune defenses and cause new infectious diseases to emerge.

There is a specific concern about the emergence of new diseases from the fungal kingdom. Mammals are extraordinary among animals in their ''endothermy'' and ''homeothermy'', which allows us to maintain elevated body temperature through life; but it can be defeated if the fungi were to adapt to higher temperatures and survive in the body.<ref>[https://www.jci.org/articles/view/135003#B6 JCI - Climate change brings the specter of new infectious diseases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Research has shown that fungi that are pathogenic for insects can be experimentally adapted to replicate at mammalian temperatures through cycles of progressive warming. This demonstrates that fungi are able to adapt rapidly to higher temperatures. The emergence of ''[[Candida auris|Candida Auris]]'' on three continents is proposed to be as a result of global warming and has raised the danger that increased warmth by itself will trigger adaptations on certain microbes to make them pathogenic for humans.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27988485 Simultaneous Emergence of Multidrug-Resistant Candida Auris on 3 Continents Confirmed by Whole-Genome Sequencing and Epidemiological Analyses - PubMed<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

If these threats materialize, medicine will need to conform to new infectious diseases for which it has no previous knowledge or experience. As seen with the recent pandemic of the novel [[Coronavirus|coronavirus (COVID-19)]]; control measures, therapeutics, and effective responses take time, where countless lives are lost in the meantime. However, if proper measures are taken today, it could increase the preparedness for confronting new infectious diseases.

Though climate change will almost certainly bring forth new infectious diseases and change the epidemiology of many existing diseases, it is important to note that humanity has successfully confronted new deadly diseases in recent years, such as SARS, coronavirus, and Ebola. Prior success is no guarantee for future success given that each new disease brings its own set of challenges as seen in with the ongoing pandemic, COVID-19. There is no proof that COVID-19 worsens or is caused by climate change, however, we’ve seen how a new infectious disease can change the way we live as humans in such a short span of time and also the number of deaths that resulted from the pandemic. The best solution against future threats is continued investment in surveillance, antimicrobial therapeutics, epidemiology, and research into mechanisms of these microbes.

The rising of new diseases and worsening of diseases due to climate change have been a wake up call for the science community. The collection of data on how climate changes over the years and how these changes are affecting health were stimulated by Science Diplomacy organizations because this information helped scientists to raise awareness about the situation nationally and internationally so action can be taken. This is shown by the actions that were taken during the malaria and dengue outbreak. However, Science Diplomacy organizations need more support from the world so a better solution can be reached to solve the climate change issue because new infectious diseases will emerge. These new infectious diseases could be the end of humanity if they are not addressed properly and on time.
