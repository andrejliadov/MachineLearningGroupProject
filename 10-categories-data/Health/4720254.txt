== Definition ==
The concept of "men's health" is variously defined. A 2016 international literature review found seven different meanings, and proposed a definition based on the WHO general definition of health, that avoided male-specific disease and male stereotypes.<ref name=Männergesundheit>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bardehle D, Dinges M, White A |title=Was ist Männergesundheit?

== Life expectancy ==

Despite overall increases in [[life expectancy]] globally, men's life expectancy is less than women's, regardless of race and geographic regions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Life Expectancy by Country 2019 |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/life-expectancy-by-country/ |website=World Population Review |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=":15">{{cite web |title=Mars vs. Venus: The gender gap in health |url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/mars-vs-venus-the-gender-gap-in-health |website=Harvard Medical School |publisher=Harvard Health Publishing |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> The global gap between the life expectancy of men and women has remained at approximately 4.4 years since 2016, according to the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Global Health Observatory data on Life Expectancy |url=https://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends_text/en/ |website=World Health Organization}}</ref> However, the gap does vary based on country, with low income countries having a smaller gap in life expectancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Thornton |first1=Jacqui |title=WHO report shows that women outlive men worldwide |journal=BMJ |volume=365 |date=5 April 2019 |pages=l1631 |doi=10.1136/bmj.l1631 |pmid=30952650 |s2cid=96448990 |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1631}}</ref> Biological, behavioural, and social factors contribute to a lower overall life expectancy in men; however, the individual importance of each factor is not known.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ortiz-Ospina |first1=Esteban |last2=Beltekian |first2=Diana |title=Why do women live longer than men? |url=https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men |website=Our World in Data |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> Overall attitudes towards health differ by gender.

Biological influences on lower male life expectancies include genetics and hormones. For males, the 23rd pair of chromosomes are an X and a [[Y chromosome]], rather than the two X chromosomes in females.<ref name=":15" /> The Y chromosome is smaller in size and contains fewer genes. This distinction may contribute to the discrepancy between men and women's life expectancy, as the additional X chromosome in females may counterbalance potential disease producing genes from the other X chromosome. Since males don't have the second X chromosome, they lack this potential protection.<ref name=":15" /> Hormonally, [[testosterone]] is a major male sex hormone important for a number of functions in males, and to a lesser extent, females.<ref>{{cite web |title=Testosterone — What It Does And Doesn't Do |url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/drugs-and-medications/testosterone--what-it-does-and-doesnt-do |website=Harvard Medical School |publisher=Harvard Health Publishing |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> Low testosterone in males is a risk factor of cardiovascular related diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Paul D |last2=Channer |first2=Kevin S |title=Testosterone and cardiovascular disease in men |journal=Asian Journal of Andrology |date=23 April 2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=428–435 |doi=10.1038/aja.2012.21|pmid=22522504 |pmc=3720171 }}</ref> Conversely, high testosterone levels can contribute to prostate diseases.<ref name=":15" /> These hormonal factors play a direct role in the life expectancy of men compared to women.

In terms of behavioural factors, men have higher levels of consumption of alcohol, substances, and tobacco compared to women, resulting in increased rates of diseases such as [[lung cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[cirrhosis of the liver]].<ref name=":15" /><ref>{{cite web |title=World Health Report 2014 |url=https://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf |website=World Health Organization |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref> These diseases influence the overall life expectancy of men. For example, according to the World Health Organization, 3.14 million men died from causes linked to excessive alcohol use in 2010 compared to 1.72 million women.

Social determinants of men's health involve factors such as greater levels of occupational exposure to physical and chemical hazards than women.<ref name=":16" /> Historically, men had higher work related stress, which negatively impacted their life expectancy by increasing the risk of [[hypertension]], [[heart attack]], and [[stroke]].<ref name=":15" /> However, it is important to note that as women's role in the workplace continues to be established, these risks are no longer specific to just men.<ref name=":15" />

=== Stress ===
Although most stress symptoms are similar in men and women, stress can be experienced differently by men.<ref name=":17">{{Cite news|url=https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2010/gender-stress|title=Gender and Stress|publisher=American Psychological Association|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> According to the [[American Psychological Association]], men are not as likely to report emotional and physical symptoms of stress compared to women.<ref name=":17" /> Men are more likely to withdraw socially when stressed and are more likely to report doing nothing to manage their stress.<ref name=":17" /> In terms of causes of stress, men are more likely to cite that work is a source of stress than women (who are more likely to report that money and the economy are a source of stress).<ref name=":17" />

The first UK week took place in 2002, and the event went international ([[International Men's Health Week]]) the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamh.org/mens-health-week/|title=Men's Health Week|date=2014-05-26|website=GLOBAL ACTION ON MEN’S HEALTH|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> In 2005, the world's first professor of men's health, Alan White, was appointed at [[Leeds Metropolitan University]] in north-east England.

In Australia, the Men's Health Information and Resource Centre advocates a [[salutogenic]] approach to male health which focuses on the causal factors behind health.  The centre is led by John Macdonald and was established in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/mhirc/mens_health_information_and_resource_centre|title=Men's Health Information and Resource Centre|last=Macken|first=University of Western Sydney-Michael|website=westernsydney.edu.au|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>  The Centre leads and executes [[Men's Health Week]] in Australia with core funding from the NSW Ministry of Health.

The Global Action on Men's Health (GAMH) was established in 2013 and was registered as a UK-based charity in May 2018. It is a collaborative initiative to bring together men's health organizations from across the globe into a new global network. GAMH is working at international and national levels to encourage international agencies (such as the [[World Health Organization]]) and individual governments to develop research, policies and strategies on men's health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gamh.org/about-us/|title=About Us|website=GLOBAL ACTION ON MEN’S HEALTH|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>
