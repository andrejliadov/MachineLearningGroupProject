'''Dry January''' is a public health campaign urging people to abstain from alcohol for the month of January, particularly practised in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]].

The campaign, as a formal entity, appears to be relatively recent, being described as having "sprung up in recent years" even in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1327579/government-unveils-first-dry-january-marketing-campaign|title=Government unveils first 'Dry January' marketing campaign|publisher=Marketingmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref> However, the Finnish government had launched a campaign called "Sober January" in 1942 as part of its war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://viestijat.fi/raitis-tammikuu-1942-oli-tehokas-propagandahyokkays/|title=”Raitis tammikuu” (1942) oli tehokas propagandahyökkäys|publisher=viestijat.fi|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref> The term "Dry January" was registered as a trademark by the charity [[Alcohol Concern]] in mid-2014;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/ctm/dry+january/012826863/?lang=lv|title=Trademark information for DRY JANUARY from CTM - by Markify|publisher=Trademark.markify.com|accessdate=2 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102201333/http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/ctm/dry+january/012826863/?lang=lv|archive-date=2 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> the first ever Dry January campaign by Alcohol Concern occurred in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhealthylifestylemag.com/#!dry-january/c1abx|title=ALL ABOUT DRY JANUARY 2014|publisher=Mhealthylifestylemag.com|accessdate=2 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102210945/http://www.mhealthylifestylemag.com/#!dry-january/c1abx|archive-date=2 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the leadup to the January 2015 campaign, for the first time Alcohol Concern partnered with [[Public Health England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/festive-drinkers-urged-to-try-dry-january-102171|title=Festive Drinkers Urged To Try 'Dry January'|work=LBC|accessdate=2 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102212331/http://www.lbc.co.uk/festive-drinkers-urged-to-try-dry-january-102171|archivedate=2 January 2015}}</ref>
