The '''Asthma Life Impact Scale''' (ALIS) measure is a disease specific [[patient reported outcome]] questionnaire which assesses the impact that [[asthma]] has on a patient’s [[quality of life]].<ref name="meads mckenna">{{cite journal|last=Meads|first=David M.|author2=McKenna, Stephen P.|author3=Doward, Lynda C.|author4=Pokrzywinski, Robin|author5=Revicki, Dennis|author6=Hunter, Cameron|author7= Glendenning, G.

The [[questionnaire]] has 22 items,<ref name="meads mckenna" /> which goes beyond earlier focus on the symptoms, functioning and environmental triggers of asthma and includes emotional issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shen |first=Joannie |author2=Johnston, Michael |author3=Hays, Ron D. |title=Asthma Outcome Measures |journal=[[Expert Review of Pharmacoeconomics & Outcomes Research]] |year=2011 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=447–453 |url=http://www.erairways.com/Resources/Asthma%20Outcome%20Measures%20(printer-friendly).pdf |accessdate=14 October 2013 |doi=10.1586/erp.11.48 |pmid=21831026 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017035239/http://www.erairways.com/Resources/Asthma%20Outcome%20Measures%20%28printer-friendly%29.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 }}</ref>

== Development ==

The ALIS was developed simultaneously in the UK and the US via interviews and focus groups.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=S.R.|author2=McKenna, S.|author3= Twiss, J.|author4= Tammaru, M.|author5= Oprandi, N.C.|title=PRS53 Further Developments of the Asthma Life Impact Scale (ALIS)|journal=Value in Health|date=November 2011|volume=14|issue=7|page=A497|doi=10.1016/j.jval.2011.08.1440|url=http://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(11)03002-6/|accessdate=14 October 2013|doi-access=free}}</ref> It was developed and published in 2010 by Galen Research and funded by [[Novartis AG]].<ref name="meads mckenna" /> It was the first asthma specific quality of life measure that was developed using [[Item Response Theory]].<ref name="twiss">{{cite journal|last=Twiss|first=J.|author2=McKenna, S.P.|author3= Crawford, S.R.|author4= Tammaru, M.|author5= Oprandi, N.C.|title=Adapting the Asthma Life Impact Scale (ALIS) for use in Southern European (Italian) and Eastern European (Russian) cultures|year=2011|volume=14|issue=6|pages=729–738|doi=10.3111/13696998.2011.615356|journal=Journal of Medical Economics|pmid=21899487}}</ref>
Items that were featured on the ALIS include: “asthma restricts my social activities”; “asthma affect my close relationships”, “my illness controls me” and “my asthma affects my interest in sex”.<ref>{{cite news|last=Piper |first=Lucy |title=Asthma Life Impact Scale is 'reliable and valid' |url=http://www.medwirenews.com/48/87550/Respiratory/Asthma_Life_Impact_Scale_is_%E2%80%98reliable_and_valid%E2%80%99.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131015073839/http://www.medwirenews.com/48/87550/Respiratory/Asthma_Life_Impact_Scale_is_%E2%80%98reliable_and_valid%E2%80%99.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=14 October 2013 |newspaper=Medwire News |date=2010-05-11 }}</ref>
