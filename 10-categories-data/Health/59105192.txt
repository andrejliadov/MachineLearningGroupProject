The glucose paradox demonstrates the importance of the chemical compound [[Lactic acid|lactate]] in the biochemical process of [[carbohydrate metabolism]]. The paradox is that the large amount of glycogen (10%) found in the liver cannot be explained by the liver's small absorption of glucose. After the body's digestion of [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] and the entering the [[circulatory system]] in the form of glucose, some will be absorbed directly into the [[muscle tissue]] and will be converted into lactic acid throughout the [[Anaerobic energy|anaerobic energy system]], rather than going directly to the liver and being converted into glycogen. The lactate is then taken and converted by the liver, forming the material for [[Liver glycogen phosphorylase|liver glycogen]]. The majority of the body's liver glycogen is produced indirectly, rather than directly from glucose in the [[blood]]. Under normal [[Physiological condition|physiological conditions]], glucose is a poor [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] compound and use by the liver is limited.<ref name="Katz 1984" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Joesph|last2=Kuwajima|first2=Masamichi|last3=Foster|first3=David W.|last4=McGarry|first4=J.
