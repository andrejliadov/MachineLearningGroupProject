{{Race}}

'''Race and health''' refers to how being identified with a specific race influences health. Race is a complex concept that changes across chronological eras and that depends on both self-identification and social recognition.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liebler CA, Porter SR, Fernandez LE, Noon JM, Ennis SR | title = America's Churning Races: Race and Ethnicity Response Changes Between Census 2000 and the 2010 Census | journal = Demography | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 259–284 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28105578 | pmc = 5514561 | doi = 10.1007/s13524-016-0544-0 }}</ref> In the study of race and health, scientists organize people in racial categories depending on different factors such as: phenotype, ancestry, social identity, genetic makeup and lived experience. “Race” and ethnicity often remain undifferentiated in health research.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Attina TM, Malits J, Naidu M, Trasande L | title = Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Disease Burden and Costs Related to Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in the US: an Exploratory Analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 108 | pages = 34–43 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30529005 | pmc = 6455970 | doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2018.11.024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker RJ, Strom Williams J, Egede LE | title = Influence of Race, Ethnicity and Social Determinants of Health on Diabetes Outcomes | journal = The American Journal of the Medical Sciences | volume = 351 | issue = 4 | pages = 366–73 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27079342 | pmc = 4834895 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjms.2016.01.008 }}</ref>

== Racial health disparities ==
Health disparities refer to gaps in the quality of health and [[health care]] across racial and ethnic groups.<ref>[[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), [[Healthy People 2010]]: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives, conference ed. in two vols (Washington, D.C., January 2000).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The US [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] defines health disparities as "population-specific differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health care".<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Janet |last1=Goldberg |first2=William |last2=Hayes |first3=Jill |last3=Huntley | name-list-style = vanc |date=November 2004 |title=Understanding Health Disparities |publisher=Health Policy Institute of Ohio |url=http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |page=3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010615/http://www.healthpolicyohio.org/pdf/healthdisparities.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Health is measured through variables such as life expectancy and incidence of diseases.<ref name="Collins-2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins FS | title = What we do and don't know about 'race', 'ethnicity', genetics and health at the dawn of the genome era | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 11 Suppl | pages = S13–5 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15507997 | doi = 10.1038/ng1436 }}</ref>

For racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, health disparities take on many forms, including higher rates of chronic disease, premature death, and [[Black maternal mortality in the United States|maternal mortality]] compared to the rates among whites. It is important to note that this pattern is not universal. Some minority groups—most notably, Hispanic immigrants—have better health outcomes than whites (Lara et al., 2005). This “immigrant paradox” appears to diminish with time spent in the United States, however (Lara et al., 2005). For other indicators, disparities have shrunk, not because of improvements among minorities but because of declines in the health of majority groups.

In the U.S., minority populations suffer disproportionately from chronic diseases. More than 133 million American (45% of the population)have one or more chronic diseases. Racial/ethnic minorities are 1.5 to 2.0 times more likely than whites to have most of the major chronic diseases. Hispanics and African Americans had the greatest prevalence of diabetes, while non-Hispanic blacks had higher odds of having heart disease with cancer or chronic lung disease than non-Hispanic whites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=James|last2=Penha|first2=Janell|last3=Mbowe|first3=Omar|last4=Taira|first4=Deborah A.|date=2017-10-19|title=Prevalence of Single and Multiple Leading Causes of Death by Race/Ethnicity Among US Adults Aged 60 to 79 Years|url=http://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/16_0241.htm|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|volume=14|pages=160241|doi=10.5888/pcd14.160241|issn=1545-1151|pmc=5652239|pmid=29049018}}</ref> 

Between 1960 and 2005 the percentage of children with a chronic disease in the United Stated quadrupled with minority having higher likelihood for these disease. The most common major chronic biases of youth in the United States are Asthma, diabetes mullets, obesity, hypertension, dental disease, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mental illness, cancers and others. 

Although individuals from different environmental, continental, socioeconomic, and racial groups etc. have different levels of health, yet not all of these differences are always categorized or defined as health disparities. Some researchers separate definitions of [[health inequality]] from health disparity by preventability. Health inequalities are often categorized as being unavoidable i.e. due to age, while preventable unfair health outcomes are categorized as health inequities. These are seen as preventable because they are usually associated with income, education, race, ethnicity, gender, and more.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arcaya MC, Arcaya AL, Subramanian SV | title = Inequalities in health: definitions, concepts, and theories | journal = Global Health Action | volume = 8 | pages = 27106 | date = 2015-06-24 | pmid = 26112142 | pmc = 4481045 | doi = 10.3402/gha.v8.27106 }}</ref>

== Defining race ==
{{main|Race (human categorization)}}

Definitions of race are ambiguous due to the various paradigms used to discuss race. These definitions are a direct result of biological and social views. Definitions have changed throughout history to yield a modern understanding of race that is complex and fluid. Moreover, there is no one definition that stands, as there are many competing and interlocking ways to look at race.<ref name="library.brown.edu">{{cite web|url=http://library.brown.edu/reserves/pdffiles/34469_Whitmarsh_Vernaculars.pdf|title=Brown University Authentication for Web-Based Services}}</ref> Due to its ambiguity, terms such as  race, genetic population, ethnicity, geographic population, and ancestry are used interchangeably in everyday discourse involving race. Some researchers critique this interchangeability noting that the conceptual differences between race and ethnicity are not widely agreed upon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5241582|title=Race, Ethnicity, and Racism in Medical Anthropology, 1977–2002 {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-12-14}}</ref>

Biological definitions of race encompass essentialist and anti-essentialist views. The scientific community does not universally accept a single definition of race. Essentialism is a mode of thought that uses scientific data to argue that racial groups are genetically distinct populations. Essentialists describe "races as groups of people who share certain innate, inherited biological traits, a.k.a. use of biological evidence to demonstrate racial differences".<ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org">{{cite web|url=http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Morning/|title=On Distinction}}</ref> As its counterpart, anti-essentialism uses biological evidence to demonstrate that "race groupings do not reflect patterns of human biological variation, countering essentialist claims to the contrary".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Nature of Race: How Scientists Think and Teach About Human Difference |chapter=Chapter 4: Teaching Race |author=Ann Morning |p=114 |year=2011 |publisher= University of California Press |jstor= 10.1525/j.ctt1pnrht |isbn=978-0-520-27031-2 }}</ref> Despite Essentialism and anti-Essentialism views, modern scientific evidence suggests there are more genetic differences within individuals belonging to the same racial groups, than between individuals belonging to different racial groups.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lewontin R | year = 1972 | title = The apportionment of human diversity | url = http://www.philbio.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Lewontin-The-Apportionment-of-Human-Diversity.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Evol Biology | volume = 6 | pages = 381–398 }}</ref>

In the last 20 years there has been major criticisms on the once widely held view that race is biological. In response to these criticisms, researchers and social scientists have begun examining notions of race as constructed.<ref name = "Gravlee_2008" /> Racial groups are "constructed" from differing historical, political, and economic contexts, rather than corresponding to inherited, biological variations. Proponents of the constructionist view claim that biological definitions have been used to justify racism in the past and still have the potential to be used to encourage racist thinking in the future.<ref name="raceandgenomics.ssrc.org"/> Since race is changing and often so loosely characterized on arbitrary phenotypes, and because it has no genetic basis, the only working definition we can assign it is a social construct. This is not to say race is imaginary or non-existent, it is very real and plays a role in our society; however to say that the concept of race has any scientific merit or has a scientific foundation can lead to many issues in scientific research, and it may also lead to inherent racial bias.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai J, Ucik L, Baldwin N, Hasslinger C, George P | title = Race Matters? Examining and Rethinking Race Portrayal in Preclinical Medical Education | journal = Academic Medicine | volume = 91 | issue = 7 | pages = 916–20 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27166865 | doi = 10.1097/acm.0000000000001232 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Social views also better explain the ambiguity of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both themselves and others within society.<ref>[[Social interpretations of race]]</ref> Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rds.epi-ucsf.org/ticr/syllabus/courses/23/2012/03/29/Lecture/readings/The%20Importance%20of%20Race%20&%20Ethnicity%20in%20Biomedical%20Research%20and%20Clinical%20Practice..pdf|title=Training in Clinical Research Home}}</ref> The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.

==Race and disease==
Diseases affect racial groups differently, especially when they are co-related with class disparities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race : are we so different?|last=H.|first=Goodman, Alan|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=Moses, Yolanda T., Jones, Joseph L.|isbn=978-1118233177|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|oclc=822025003}}</ref> As socioeconomic factors influence the access to care,<ref>Citation error.

Some researchers advocate for the use of self-reported race as a way to trace socioeconomic disparities and its effects in health.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DR, Lavizzo-Mourey R, Warren RC | title = The concept of race and health status in America | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 109 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–41 | date = 1994-01-01 | pmid = 8303011 | pmc = 1402239 }}</ref> For instance, a study conducted by the [[National Health Service]] checks program in the United Kingdom, which aims to increase diagnosis across demographics, noted that "the reported lower screening in specific black and minority ethnic communities... may increase inequalities in health."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Riley R, Coghill N, Montgomery A, Feder G, Horwood J | title = The provision of NHS health checks in a community setting: an ethnographic account | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 15 | pages = 546 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26651487 | pmc = 4676171 | doi = 10.1186/s12913-015-1209-1 }}</ref> In this specific case, the lack of attention to certain demographics can be seen as a cause of increased instances of disease from this lack of proper, equal preventative care. One must consider these external factors when evaluating statistics on the prevalence of disease in populations, even though genetic components can play a role in predispositions to contracting some illnesses.

Individuals who share a similar genetic makeup can also share certain propensity or resistance to specific diseases. However, there are confronted positions in relation to the utility of using 'races' to talk about populations sharing a similar genetic makeup. Some geneticists argued that human variation is geographically structured and that genetic differences correlate with general conceptualizations of racial groups.<ref name="Categorization of humans in biomedi">{{cite journal | vauthors = Risch N, Burchard E, Ziv E, Tang H | title = Categorization of humans in biomedical research: genes, race and disease | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = comment2007 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12184798 | pmc = 139378 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2002-3-7-comment2007 }}</ref> Others claimed that this correlation is too unstable and that the genetic differences are minimal and they are "distributed over the world in a discordant manner”.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbujani G, Ghirotto S, Tassi F | title = Nine things to remember about human genome diversity | journal = Tissue Antigens | volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 155–64 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24032721 | doi = 10.1111/tan.12165 }}</ref> Therefore, race is regarded by some as a useful tool for the assessment of genetic epidemiological risk,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenberg NA, Pritchard JK, Weber JL, Cann HM, Kidd KK, Zhivotovsky LA, Feldman MW | title = Genetic structure of human populations | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5602 | pages = 2381–5 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12493913 | doi = 10.1126/science.1078311 | bibcode = 2002Sci...298.2381R }}</ref> while others consider it can lead to an increased underdiagnosis in 'low risk' populations.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bamshad |first=Michael J. |last2=Olson |first2=Steve E. | name-list-style = vanc |date= December 2003 |title=Does Race Exist? |journal=Scientific American |volume=289 |issue=6 |pages=78–85 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1203-78 |pmid=14631734 |bibcode=2003SciAm.289f..78B }}</ref>

===Single-gene disorders===
{{See also|Genetic disorder}}
There are many [[autosomal recessive]] single gene [[genetic disorder]]s that differ in frequency between different populations due to the region and ancestry as well as the [[founder effect]]. Some examples of these disorders include:

*[[Cystic fibrosis]], the most common life-limiting [[autosomal recessive]] disease among people of Northern European heritage
*[[Sickle-cell anemia]], most prevalent in populations with sub-Saharan African ancestry but also common among Latin-American, Middle Eastern populations, as well as those people of South European regions such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy<ref>Bloom, Miriam.

===Multifactorial polygenic diseases===
Many diseases differ in frequency between different populations. However, complex diseases are affected by multiple factors, both genetic and environmental. There is controversy over the extent to which some of these conditions are influenced by genes, and ongoing research aims to identify which genetic loci, if any, are linked to these diseases. "Risk is the probability that an event will occur. In epidemiology, it is most often used to express the probability that a particular outcome will occur following a particular exposure."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Burt BA | title = Definitions of risk | journal = Journal of Dental Education | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 1007–8 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11699970 | url = https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041031003820/http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/NR/rdonlyres/59E8463F-469F-4D06-95C3-CB877673DC98/0/Brian_Burt_Risk.pdf | archive-date = October 31, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/genomics/public/geneticdiseases/en/index3.html|title=WHO - Genes and human disease}}</ref> Different populations are considered "high-risk" or "low-risk" groups for various diseases due to the probability of that particular population being more exposed to certain risk factors. Beyond genetic factors, history and culture, as well as current environmental and social conditions, influence a certain populations' risk for specific diseases.

===Disease progression===
Racial groups may differ in how a disease progresses. Different access to healthcare services, different living and working conditions influence how a disease progresses  within racial groups.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall HI, Byers RH, Ling Q, Espinoza L | title = Racial/ethnic and age disparities in HIV prevalence and disease progression among men who have sex with men in the United States | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 97 | issue = 6 | pages = 1060–6 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17463370 | pmc = 1874211 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2006.087551 }}</ref> However, the reasons for these differences are multiple, and should not be understood a consequence of genetic differences between races, but rather as effects of social and environmental factors affecting.<ref name=":0" />

===Prevention===
Genetics have been proven to be a strong predictor for common diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and psychiatric illnesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hernandez|first=Lyla M.|last2=Blazer|first2=Dan G.| author3= Behavioral Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Assessing Interactions Among Social | name-list-style = vanc |date=2006-01-01|title=Genetics and Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19932/ }}</ref> Some geneticists have determined that "[[human genetic variation]] is geographically structured" and that different geographic regions correlate with different races.<ref name=pmid15508000>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jorde LB, Wooding SP | title = Genetic variation, classification and 'race' | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 11 Suppl | pages = S28–33 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15508000 | doi = 10.1038/ng1435 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Meanwhile, others have claimed that the human genome is characterized by clinal changes across the globe, in relation with the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|"Out of Africa" theory]] and how migration to new environments cause changes in populations' genetics over time.

Some diseases are more prevalent in some populations identified as races due to their common ancestry. Thus, people of African and Mediterranean descent are found to be more susceptible to [[sickle-cell disease]] while [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[HFE hereditary haemochromatosis|hemochromatosis]] are more common among European populations.<ref name=pmid15508000/>  Some physicians claim that race can be used as a proxy for the risk that the patient may be exposed to in relation to these diseases. However, racial self-identification only provides fragmentary information about the persons ancestry. Thus, racial profiling in medical services would also lead to the risk of underdiagnosis.

While genetics certainly play a role in determining how susceptible a person is to specific diseases, environmental, structural and cultural factors play a large role as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Norman B.|last2=Bulatao|first2=Rodolfo A.|last3=Cohen|first3=Barney|author4=National Research Council (US) Panel on Race Ethnicity | name-list-style = vanc |date=2004-01-01|title=Genetic Factors in Ethnic Disparities in Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25517/ }}</ref>  For this reason, it is impossible to discern exactly what causes a person to acquire a disease, but it is important to observe how all these factors relate to each other. Each person's health is unique, as they have different genetic compositions and life histories.

===Race-based treatment===

Racial groups, especially when defined as minorities or ethnic groups, often face structural, cultural and linguistic barriers to access healthcare services.

Scientific studies have shown the lack of efficacy of adapting pharmaceutical treatment to racial categories. "Race-based medicine" is the term for medicines that are targeted at specific racial clusters which are shown to have a propensity for a certain disorder. The first example of this in the U.S. was when [[BiDil]], a medication for congestive heart failure, was licensed specifically for use in American patients that self-identify as black.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor AL, Ziesche S, Yancy C, Carson P, D'Agostino R, Ferdinand K, Taylor M, Adams K, Sabolinski M, Worcel M, Cohn JN | title = Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 20 | pages = 2049–57 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15533851 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934 | author12 = African-American Heart Failure Trial Investigators }}</ref> Previous studies had shown that African American patients with congestive heart failure generally respond less effectively to traditional treatments than white patients with similar conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Exner DV, Dries DL, Domanski MJ, Cohn JN | title = Lesser response to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor therapy in black as compared with white patients with left ventricular dysfunction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 344 | issue = 18 | pages = 1351–7 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11333991 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200105033441802 }}</ref>

After two trials, BiDil was licensed exclusively for use in African American patients. Critics have argued that this particular licensing was unwarranted, since the trials did not in fact show that the drug was more effective in African Americans than in other groups, but merely that it was more effective in African Americans than other similar drugs. It was also only tested in African American males, but not in any other racial groups or among women. This peculiar trial and licensing procedure has prompted suggestions that the licensing was in fact used as a race-based advertising scheme.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1740-9713.2006.00181.x |title=Medicine in black and white: BiDil®: race and the limits of evidence‐based medicine |journal=Significance |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=118–21 |year=2006 |last1=Ellison |first1=George }}</ref>

Critics are concerned that the trend of research on race-specific pharmaceutical treatments will result in inequitable access to pharmaceutical innovation and smaller minority groups may be ignored. This has led to a call for regulatory approaches to be put in place to ensure scientific validity of racial disparity in pharmacological treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Winickoff DE, Obasogie OK | title = Race-specific drugs: regulatory trends and public policy | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = 6 | pages = 277–9 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18453000 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2008.03.008 }}</ref>

==Environmental factors==
{{see also|Environmental racism|Race and health in the United States}}
A positive correlation between minorities and a socioeconomic status of being low-income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low-income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in [[health]]. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low-income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San Diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that [[Minority group|minorities]] in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets.<ref name="Suarez 912–920">{{cite journal | vauthors = Suarez JJ, Isakova T, Anderson CA, Boulware LE, Wolf M, Scialla JJ | title = Food Access, Chronic Kidney Disease, and Hypertension in the U.S | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 912–20 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26590940 | pmc = 4656149 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.017 }}</ref> Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible ([[food desert]]s) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet.<ref name="Suarez 912–920"/> As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone to [[obesity]], which can lead to diseases such as [[chronic kidney disease]], [[hypertension]], or diabetes.<ref name="Suarez 912–920"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kidney.org/kidneydisease/aboutckd |title=About Chronic Kidney Disease |website=The National Kidney Foundation |access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

Furthermore, this can also occur when minorities living in rural areas undergoing urbanization, are introduced to [[fast food]]. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students who participated in this study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]], or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Angkurawaranon C, Wisetborisut A, Rerkasem K, Seubsman SA, Sleigh A, Doyle P, Nitsch D | title = Early life urban exposure as a risk factor for developing obesity and impaired fasting glucose in later adulthood: results from two cohorts in Thailand | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 15 | pages = 902 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26376960 | pmc = 4572635 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-015-2220-5 }}</ref> Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food.  Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet;  this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from [[Cyprus]], a country east of the Mediterranean Sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazarou C, Kalavana T | title = Urbanization influences dietary habits of Cypriot children: the CYKIDS study | journal = International Journal of Public Health | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–77 | date = 2009-01-01 | pmid = 19234670 | doi = 10.1007/s00038-009-8054-0 }}</ref> It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.

==Genetic factors==
The fact that every human has a unique genetic code is the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting. Versions of a trait, known as alleles, occur at different frequencies in different human populations; populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tend to differ more.

A phenotype is the "outward, physical manifestation" of an organism."<ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/ahp/BioInfo/GP/Definition.html|title=Definition}}</ref> For humans, phenotypic differences are most readily seen via skin color, eye color, hair color, or height; however, any observable structure, function, or behavior can be considered part of a phenotype. A genotype is the "internally coded, inheritable information" carried by all living organisms. The human genome is encoded in DNA.<ref name="brooklyn.cuny.edu"/>

For any trait of interest, observed differences among individuals "may be due to differences in the genes" coding for a trait or "the result of variation in environmental condition". This variability is due to gene-environment interactions that influence genetic expression patterns and trait heritability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/efc/classes/biol710/heritability/heritability.htm|title=Estimating additive genetic variation and heritability of phenotypic traits|website=userwww.sfsu.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}</ref>

For humans, there is "more genetic variation among individual people than between larger racial groups".<ref name="Collins-2004"/> In general, an average of 80% of genetic variation exists within local populations, around 10% is between local populations within the same continent, and approximately 8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-9063-3_14 |chapter=The Apportionment of Human Diversity |title=Evolutionary Biology |pages=381–98 |year=1972 |last1=Lewontin |first1=R.

Genes may be under strong selection in response to local diseases. For example, people who are [[duffy antigen|duffy negative]] tend to have higher resistance to malaria. Most Africans are duffy negative and most non-Africans are duffy positive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaria and the Red Cell|publisher=Harvard University|year=2002|url=http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127201806/http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/malaria_sickle.html|archive-date=2011-11-27}}</ref> A number of genetic diseases more prevalent in malaria-afflicted areas may provide some [[genetic resistance to malaria]] including [[sickle cell disease]], [[thalassaemias]], [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]], and possibly others.

[[Cystic fibrosis#Theories about prevalence|Many theories about the origin of the cystic fibrosis]] have suggested that it provides a [[heterozygote advantage]] by giving resistance to diseases earlier common in Europe.

In earlier research, a common theory was the "[[common disease-common variant]]" model. It argues that for common illnesses, the genetic contribution comes from the additive or multiplicative effects of gene variants that each one is common in the population. Each such gene variant is argued to cause only a small risk of disease and no single variant is enough to cause the disease. An individual must have many of these common gene variants in order for the risk of disease to be substantial.<ref name=pmid20403315>{{cite journal | vauthors = McClellan J, King MC | title = Genetic heterogeneity in human disease | journal = Cell | volume = 141 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–7 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20403315 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.03.032 }}</ref>

More recent research indicates that the "common disease-rare variant" may be a better explanation for many common diseases.

===Gene flow===
[[Gene flow]] and [[Genetic admixture|admixture]] can also have an effect on relationships between race and race-linked disorders. Multiple sclerosis, for example, is typically associated with people of European descent, but due to admixture African Americans have elevated levels of the disorder relative to Africans.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cree BA, Khan O, Bourdette D, Goodin DS, Cohen JA, Marrie RA, Glidden D, Weinstock-Guttman B, Reich D, Patterson N, Haines JL, Pericak-Vance M, DeLoa C, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL | title = Clinical characteristics of African Americans vs Caucasian Americans with multiple sclerosis | journal = Neurology | volume = 63 | issue = 11 | pages = 2039–45 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15596747 | doi = 10.1212/01.WNL.0000145762.60562.5D }}</ref>

=== Gene interactions ===
The same gene variant, or group of gene variants, may produce different effects in different populations depending on differences in the gene variants, or groups of gene variants, they interact with. One example is the rate of progression to [[AIDS]] and death in [[HIV]]&ndash;infected patients. In Caucasians and Hispanics, HHC [[haplotype]]s were associated with disease retardation, particularly a delayed progression to death, while for African Americans, possession of HHC haplotypes was associated with disease acceleration. In contrast, while the disease-retarding effects of the CCR2-641 allele were found in African Americans, they were not found in Caucasians.<ref name=gonz1996>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzalez E, Bamshad M, Sato N, Mummidi S, Dhanda R, Catano G, Cabrera S, McBride M, Cao XH, Merrill G, O'Connell P, Bowden DW, Freedman BI, Anderson SA, Walter EA, Evans JS, Stephan KT, Clark RA, Tyagi S, Ahuja SS, Dolan MJ, Ahuja SK | title = Race-specific HIV-1 disease-modifying effects associated with CCR5 haplotypes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 21 | pages = 12004–9 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10518566 | pmc = 18402 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.21.12004 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...9612004G }}</ref>

== Theoretical approaches in addressing health and race disparities ==
Public health researchers and policy makers are working to reduce health disparities. Health effects of racism are now a major area of research. In fact, these seem to be the primary research focus in biological and social sciences.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Interdisciplinary methods have been used to address how race affects health. according to published studies, many factors combine together to affect the health of individuals and communities.<ref name = "Gravlee_2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gravlee CC, Sweet E | title = Race, ethnicity, and racism in medical anthropology, 1977-2002 | journal = Medical Anthropology Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–51 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18610812 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1387.2008.00002.x }}</ref> Whether people are healthy or not, is determined by their circumstances and environment.

The WHO categorizes these determinants into three broader topics: the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors. Due to the diversity of factors that often attribute to health disparities outcomes, interdisciplinary approaches are often implemented.<ref name="who.int"/>

'''Interdisciplinarity''' or interdisciplinary studies involves the combining of two or more [[Discipline (academia)|academic disciplines]] into one activity (e.g., a research project) The term ''interdisciplinary'' is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies—along with their specific perspectives—in the pursuit of a common task.

===Biocultural approach===

[[Biocultural evolution]] was introduced and first used in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bioculturalevolution.net/biocultural-overview/|title=Biocultural Evolution–An Overview|date=2013-05-22|newspaper=The Biocultural Evolution Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/873634419 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/866547226 cite #3 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}</ref> Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological [[adaptation]] and [[Human genetic variation|variation]]. These studies:

                       “research on questions of human biology and medical ecology that specifically includes social, cultural, or behavioral variables in the research design, offer valuable models for studying the interface between biological and cultural factors affecting human well-being”

This approach is useful in generating holistic viewpoints on human biological variation. There are two biocultural approach models. The first approach fuses biological, environmental, and cultural data. The second approach treats biological data as primary data and culture and environmental data as secondary.

The salt sensitivity hypothesis is an example of implementing biocultural approaches in order to understand cardiovascular health disparities among African American populations. This theory, founded by Wilson and Grim, stems from the disproportional rates of salt sensitive high blood pressure seen between U.S. African American and White populations and between U.S. African American and West Africans as well. The researchers hypothesized that the patterns were in response to two events. One the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which resulted in massive death totals of Africans who were forced over, those who survived and made to the United States were more likely able to withstand the harsh conditions because they retained salt and water better. The selection continued once they were in the United States. African Americans who were able to withstand hard working conditions had better survival rates due to high water and salt retention. Second, today, because of different environmental conditions and increased salt intake with diets, water and salt retention are disadvantageous, leaving U.S. African Americans at disproportional risks because of their biological descent and culture.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Grim CE, Wilson TW |title=Salt, Slavery, and Survival: Physiological Principles Underlying the Evolutionary Hypothesis of Salt-Sensitive Hypertension in Western Hemisphere Blacks |date=1993 |journal=Pathophysiology of Hypertension in Blacks|pages=25–49|series=Clinical Physiology Series|publisher=Springer, New York, NY |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7577-4_2|isbn=9781461475774 }}</ref>

===Bio social inheritance model===

Similar to the biocultural approach, the bio social inheritance model also looks at biological and social methods in examining health disparities. Hoke et al. define Biosocial inheritance as “the process whereby social adversity in one generation is transmitted to the next through reinforcing biological and social mechanisms that impair health, exacerbating social and health disparities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McDade|first=Thomas|last2=Hoke|first2=Morgan K. | name-list-style = vanc |date=2014-01-01|title=Biosocial inheritance: A framework for the study of the intergenerational transmission of health disparities |journal=Annals of Anthropological Practice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=187–213|doi=10.1111/napa.12052|issn=2153-957X}}</ref>”

There is a controversy regarding race as a method for classifying humans. Different sources argue it is purely social construct<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Witzig R | title = The medicalization of race: scientific legitimization of a flawed social construct | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 125 | issue = 8 | pages = 675–9 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8849153 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-125-8-199610150-00008 }}</ref> or a biological reality reflecting average genetic group differences.  New interest in human biological variation has resulted in a resurgence of the use of race in biomedicine.<ref>Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IL0pQBoJXMMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference]'', MIT press. Page 188. "Far from waning in the age of molecular genetics, race has been resurgent in biomedical discourse, especially in relation to a torrent of new interest in human biological variation and its quantification."</ref>

The main impetus for this development is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of certain [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors, such as genetically conditioned health factors, based on more easily ascertained characteristics such as phenotype and racial self-identification. Since medical judgment often involves decision making under uncertain conditions,<ref name="whitmarsh 9">Ian Whitmarsh and David S. Jones, 2010, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IL0pQBoJXMMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false What's the Use of Race? Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference]'', MIT press. Chapter 9.</ref> many doctors consider it useful to take race into account when treating disease because diseases and treatment responses tend to cluster by geographic ancestry.<ref>Satel, Sally. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/i-am-a-racially-profiling-doctor.html "I Am a Racially Profiling Doctor"]. The New York Times, published May 5, 2002</ref> The discovery that more diseases than previously thought correlate with racial identification have further sparked the interest in using race as a proxy for bio-geographical ancestry and genetic buildup.

Race in medicine is used as an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less than perfect.<ref name="Collins-2004"/>

Taking the example of [[sickle-cell disease]], in an [[Emergency department|emergency room]], knowing the geographic origin of a patient may help a doctor doing an initial diagnosis if a patient presents with symptoms compatible with this disease. This is unreliable evidence with the disease being present in many different groups as noted above with the trait also present in some Mediterranean European populations. Definitive diagnosis comes from examining the blood of the patient. In the US, screening for sickle cell anemia is done on all newborns regardless of race.<ref name="whitmarsh 9" />

The continued use of racial categories has been criticized.

Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group that is important to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.

David Williams (1994) argued, after an examination of articles in the journal ''Health Services Research'' during the 1966–90 period, that how race was determined and defined was seldom described. At a minimum, researchers should describe if race was assessed by self-report, proxy report, extraction from records, or direct observation. Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator of socioeconomic status.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DR | title = The concept of race in Health Services Research: 1966 to 1990 | journal = Health Services Research | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 261–74 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8063565 | pmc = 1070005 }}</ref> Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with and the role of the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman AH | title = Why genes don't count (for racial differences in health) | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 90 | issue = 11 | pages = 1699–702 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11076233 | pmc = 1446406 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.90.11.1699 }}</ref>

=== From concepts of race to ethnogenetic layering ===

There is general agreement that a goal of health-related genetics should be to move past the weak surrogate relationships of racial health disparity and get to the root causes of health and disease. This includes research which strives to analyze human genetic variation in smaller groups than races across the world.<ref name="Collins-2004"/>

One such method is called ethnogenetic layering. It works by focusing on geographically identified microethnic groups. For example, in the Mississippi Delta region ethnogenetic layering might include such microethnic groups as the [[Cajuns|Cajun]] (as a subset of European Americans), the Creole and Black groups [with African origins in Senegambia, Central Africa and Bight of Benin] (as a subset of African Americans), and Choctaw, Houmas, Chickasaw, Coushatta, Caddo, Atakapa, Karankawa and Chitimacha peoples (as subsets of Native Americans).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson FL | title = Ethnogenetic layering (EL): an alternative to the traditional race model in human variation and health disparity studies | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–44 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18428008 | doi = 10.1080/03014460801941752 | url = https://works.bepress.com/fatimah-linda-collier-jackson/6/download/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson FL | title = Human genetic variation and health: new assessment approaches based on ethnogenetic layering | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 69 | pages = 215–35 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15226208 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/ldh012 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Better still may be individual genetic assessment of relevant genes.<ref name=pmid15508000/> As genotyping and sequencing have become more accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ng PC, Zhao Q, Levy S, Strausberg RL, Venter JC | title = Individual genomes instead of race for personalized medicine | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 84 | issue = 3 | pages = 306–9 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18714319 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2008.114 | url = http://www.gis.a-star.edu.sg/internet/site/data/sup_data/2253/individual_genomes_instead_of_race_for_personalized_medicine.pdf }}</ref> Even when such methods become commonly available, race will continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.<ref name=pmid15508000/>

Some doctors and scientists such as geneticist [[Neil Risch]] argue that using self-identified race as a proxy for ancestry is necessary to be able to get a sufficiently broad sample of different ancestral populations, and in turn to be able to provide health care that is tailored to the needs of minority groups.<ref name="Categorization of humans in biomedi"/>

==Association studies==
{{See also|Genetic association}}
One area in which population categories can be important considerations in genetics research is in controlling for confounding between population genetic substructure, environmental exposures, and health outcomes. [[Association studies]] can produce spurious results if cases and controls have differing allele frequencies for genes that are not related to the disease being studied,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardon LR, Palmer LJ | title = Population stratification and spurious allelic association | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9357 | pages = 598–604 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12598158 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12520-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchini J, Cardon LR, Phillips MS, Donnelly P | title = The effects of human population structure on large genetic association studies | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 512–7 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15052271 | doi = 10.1038/ng1337 | doi-access = free }}</ref> although the magnitude of its problem in genetic association studies is subject to debate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas DC, Witte JS | title = Point: population stratification: a problem for case-control studies of candidate-gene associations? | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 505–12 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050090 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wacholder S, Rothman N, Caporaso N | title = Counterpoint: bias from population stratification is not a major threat to the validity of conclusions from epidemiological studies of common polymorphisms and cancer | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 513–20 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050091 | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/11/6/513.long }}</ref> Various techniques detect and account for population substructure,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton NE, Collins A | title = Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 19 | pages = 11389–93 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9736746 | pmc = 21652 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.19.11389 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9511389M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoggart CJ, Parra EJ, Shriver MD, Bonilla C, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | title = Control of confounding of genetic associations in stratified populations | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 1492–1504 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12817591 | pmc = 1180309 | doi = 10.1086/375613 }}</ref> but these methods can be difficult to apply in practice.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Freedman ML, Reich D, Penney KL, McDonald GJ, Mignault AA, Patterson N, Gabriel SB, Topol EJ, Smoller JW, Pato CN, Pato MT, Petryshen TL, Kolonel LN, Lander ES, Sklar P, Henderson B, Hirschhorn JN, Altshuler D | title = Assessing the impact of population stratification on genetic association studies | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 388–93 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15052270 | doi = 10.1038/ng1333 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Population genetic substructure also can aid genetic association studies. For example, populations that represent recent mixtures of separated ancestral groups can exhibit longer-range [[linkage disequilibrium]] between susceptibility alleles and genetic markers than is the case for other populations.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoggart CJ, Shriver MD, Kittles RA, Clayton DG, McKeigue PM | title = Design and analysis of admixture mapping studies | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–78 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15088268 | pmc = 1181989 | doi = 10.1086/420855 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patterson N, Hattangadi N, Lane B, Lohmueller KE, Hafler DA, Oksenberg JR, Hauser SL, Smith MW, O'Brien SJ, Altshuler D, Daly MJ, Reich D | title = Methods for high-density admixture mapping of disease genes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 979–1000 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15088269 | pmc = 1181990 | doi = 10.1086/420871 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MW, Patterson N, Lautenberger JA, Truelove AL, McDonald GJ, Waliszewska A, Kessing BD, Malasky MJ, Scafe C, Le E, De Jager PL, Mignault AA, Yi Z, De The G, Essex M, Sankale JL, Moore JH, Poku K, Phair JP, Goedert JJ, Vlahov D, Williams SM, Tishkoff SA, Winkler CA, De La Vega FM, Woodage T, Sninsky JJ, Hafler DA, Altshuler D, Gilbert DA, O'Brien SJ, Reich D | title = A high-density admixture map for disease gene discovery in African Americans | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | pages = 1001–13 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15088270 | pmc = 1181963 | doi = 10.1086/420856 | display-authors = 6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McKeigue PM | title = Prospects for admixture mapping of complex traits | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 76 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15540159 | pmc = 1196412 | doi = 10.1086/426949 }}</ref> Genetic studies can use this disequilibrium to search for disease alleles with fewer markers than would be needed otherwise.

==Human genome projects==
The [[Human Genome Diversity Project]] has collected genetic samples from 52 indigenous populations.

==Sources of racial disparities in care==
In a report by the [[Institute of Medicine]] called Unequal Treatment, three major source categories are put forth as potential explanations for disparities in health care: patient-level variables, healthcare system-level factors, and care process-level variables.<ref name=Smed2002>{{cite book|last=Smedley|first=Brian D. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-0-309-50911-4|pages=7–12|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10260}}</ref>

===Patient-level variables===
There are many individual factors that could explain the established differences in health care between different racial and ethnic groups.  First, attitudes and behaviors of minority patients are different.  They are more likely to refuse recommended services, adhere poorly to treatment regimens, and delay seeking care, yet despite this, these behaviors and attitudes are unlikely to explain the differences in health care.<ref name=Smed2002/> In addition to behaviors and attitudes, biological based racial differences have been documented, but these also seem unlikely to explain the majority of observed disparities in care.<ref name=Smed2002/>

===Health system-level factors===
Health system-level factors include any aspects of health systems that can have different effects on patient outcomes.  Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and interpretation services, and geographic availability of different services.<ref name=Smed2002/> Many studies assert that these factors explain portions of the existing disparities in health of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States when compared to their white counterparts.

===Care process-level variables===
Three major mechanisms are suggested by the Institute of Medicine that may contribute to healthcare disparities from the provider's side: bias (or prejudice) against racial and ethnic minorities; greater clinical uncertainty when interacting with minority patients; and beliefs held by the provider about the behavior or health of minorities.<ref name=Smed2002/> Research in this area is new and ongoing.
