The '''British Lying-In Hospital''' was a [[maternity hospital]] established in London in 1749, the second such foundation in the capital.
 
==Background==
The impetus for the creation of a dedicated maternity hospital was dissatisfaction on the part of the governors of the [[Middlesex Hospital]] with its maternity facilities. A new hospital with 20 beds was established in 1749 in Brownlow Street, [[Long Acre]], [[Holborn]], under the presidency of the [[William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland|2nd Duke of Portland]], and initially called the '''Lying-In Hospital for Married Women'''. ("[[Lying-in]]" is an archaic term for childbirth, referring to the long [[bedrest]] prescribed for new mothers in their [[postpartum confinement]].) Consequent on the establishment of the [[City of London Maternity Hospital|City of London Lying-In Hospital for Married Women]] in 1750,<ref>{{cite web |title=The National Archives {{!}} Search the archives {{!}} Hospital Records{{!}} Details |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=40 |website=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref> and the [[General Lying-In Hospital]] (later renamed the [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|Queen Charlotte's Hospital]])  in 1752, the Holborn hospital changed its name to the British Lying-In Hospital for Married Women in 1856.<ref name=lost>{{cite web|url=https://ezitis.myzen.co.uk/britishlyingin.html|title=British Lying-In Hospital|publisher=Lost Hospitals of London|accessdate=13 July 2018}}</ref>

==Early years==
The hospital was funded by voluntary subscriptions and donations.<ref name="OaNL">{{cite book|first=Walter|last=Thornbury|chapter=St Giles-in-the-Fields|title=Old and New London|volume=3|location=London|date=1878|pages=197–218|chapter-url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol3/pp197-218}}</ref> At the outset, the hospital provided only for in-patients, but by 1828 extended to an out-patient service, supervising home deliveries.<ref name="Ryan"/> In the 1870s, it was treating about 750 in-patients per annum.<ref name="OaNL"/><ref name="AIM25"/>
 
The creation of the hospital was not without controversy at the time, and the nature, characteristics and effects of the British in particular, and maternity hospitals in general, continue to be a subject of study. Prior to the hospital's creation, childbirth was for the most-part a domestic affair relying on the good offices of largely untrained (if well-experienced) midwives ([[traditional birth attendant]]); only the rich were served by male physicians. The British Lying-In Hospital offered — to married women only — a largely [[women-only space|female-only space]] removed from the home in which childbirth was supervised almost exclusively by female [[midwives]] under the supervision of female [[matron]]s. The intervention of male physicians was a rare event.<ref name="Cody">{{cite journal|title=Living and Dying in Georgian London's Lying-In Hospitals|first=Lisa Foreman|last=Cody|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|volume=78|number=2|date=Summer 2004|pages=309–348|doi=10.1353/bhm.2004.0061|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1477505/files/article.pdf}}</ref>
 
The hospital was attacked within the first two years of operation by [[Frank Nicholls]], a prominent physician who issued, anonymously, a [[satire|satirical essay]], the ''Petition of the Unborn Babes'', which raised a number of concerns questioning the involvement of (allegedly brutal) men-midwives, and asserting high mother and baby mortality rates. Nicholls's publication can be seen to set the tone for much of the subsequent discussion of maternity hospitals to this day. ''A Vindication of Man Midwifery'' (1752) attempted a positive spin, but the debate about Man Midwifery and the use of forceps raged for at least the next century.<ref name="Cody"/>

==Victorian era==
It moved to a new purpose-built building with 40 beds in [[Endell Street]], in 1849.<ref name="LMA">{{cite web|title=Information Leaflet Number 35 Records of patients in London hospitals|website=London Metropolitan Archives|publisher=City of London|accessdate=3 September 2016|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/35-records-of-patients-in-london-hospitals.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Ryan">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofqueench00ryan |title=The History of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital |first=Thomas |last=Ryan |date=1885|pages=ix–xv|publisher=[London : The Hospital] }}</ref><ref name="AIM25">{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11885&inst_id=118&nv1=search&nv2=basic|website=AIM25 - Archives in London and the M25 area|title=British Lying-In Hospital|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref>

The gender separation of roles at the British was called into question from 1862 when the then physician-in-residence, James Edmunds, established with other the [[Female Medical Society]], and in 1864 when the [[Ladies' Medical College]] was established to train women in [[midwifery]] and [[obstetrics]]. From 1867, its students gained clinical experience at the British - albeit the nature of Edmunds's innovation led to disputes amongst the governing board and unsuccessful effort to unseat him.<ref name="Cody"/>
 
A note in ''Old and New London: Volume 3'' states that the hospital had by 1874 treated 47,000 in-patients.<ref name="OaNL"/>

==Merger and re-invention==
The British Lying-In Hospital closed in May 1913 in anticipation of its amalgamation with the Home for Mothers and Babies and Training School for District Midwives in January 1915.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vartan |first1=C Keith |title=The Lying-in Hospital 1747- |date=May 1972 |volume=65 |doi=10.1177/003591577206500518 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The newly amalgamated establishment was called the [[British Hospital for Mothers and Babies]].<ref name="AIM25"/>

[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] hold records of births and baptisms at the hospital in the period 1749-1868, and the [[London Metropolitan Archives]] holds a wealth of organisational records.<ref name="LMA"/><ref name="AIM25"/>
