The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has had a significant impact on the [[aviation]] industry due to [[Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic|travel restrictions]] and a slump in demand among travellers.

== Flight cancellations ==
Government regulations in Europe and the United States mandated that airlines refund fares when flights are cancelled, but in many cases airlines have instead offered vouchers or travel credits that must be used by the end of the year. (Some airlines have extended the voucher window to May 2022.) Despite pleas from industry [[Lobbying|lobbyists]] to expand the regulations to allow travel credits, the US [[Department of Transportation]] has reiterated that airlines are obligated to provide refunds for cancelled flights. Travel vouchers are currently allowed when passengers cancel travel plans due to travel warnings, stay at home orders and other restrictions.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/07/829091394/airlines-want-to-cancel-rule-requiring-them-to-refund-fares-for-canceled-flights |title=Airlines Want To Cancel Rule Requiring Them To Refund Fares For Canceled Flights |date=April 7, 2020 |publisher=NPR}}</ref>

[[File:HKIA March 26, 2020 flights cancelled.jpg|thumb|Many flights from Hong Kong were cancelled in March 2020 due to the pandemic.]]
Early March 2020 saw 10% of all flights cancelled compared to 2019. As the pandemic progressed, 40–60% fewer flight movements were recorded in late March with international flights affected the most. By April 2020, over 80% flight movements were restricted across all regions.<ref name="aislelabs1"/> Research shows that world recovery of passenger demand to pre-COVID-19 levels is estimated to take 2.4 years (recovery by late-2022), with the most optimistic estimate being 2 years (recovery by mid-2022), and the most pessimistic estimate 6 years (recovery in 2026). Large regional differences are detected: the [[Asia-Pacific]] has the shortest estimated average recovery time of 2.2 years, followed by [[North America]] in 2.5 years, and Europe 2.7 years. For [[air freight]] demand, a shorter average world recovery time of 2.2 years is predicted if compared to passenger demand. On the regional level, Europe and North America are comparable with average recovery times of 2.2 years, while the Asia-Pacific is predicted to recover faster in 2.1 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342051795_Forecasting_recovery_time_in_air_transport_markets_in_the_presence_of_large_economic_shocks_COVID-19 |title=Gudmundsson, S.V., Cattaneo, M., Redondi, R.

== Air cargo ==
As passenger flights were cancelled, the cost of sending cargo by air changed rapidly. The cost of sending cargo across the Pacific Ocean tripled by late March 2020.<ref name="The U.S. needs China's masks">{{cite news |last1=Bradsher |first1=Keith |last2=Swanson |first2=Ana |title=The U.S. Needs China's Masks, as Acrimony Grows |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/coronavirus-china-masks.html |access-date=23 March 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=23 March 2020}}</ref>

Adjusted cargo capacity fell by 4.4% in February 2020 while air cargo demand also fell by 9.1%, but the near-halt in passenger traffic cut capacity even deeper as half of global air cargo is carried in passenger jets' bellies.<!--ref name=Flight3apr2020-->
Air freight rates rose as a consequence, from $0.80 per kg for transatlantic cargoes to $2.50–4 per kg, enticing passenger airlines to operate cargo-only flights, while cargo airlines brought back into service fuel-guzzling [[Aircraft recycling#Storage statistics|stored aircraft]], helped by falling [[oil price]]s.<ref name=Flight3apr2020>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/freight-rates-on-the-rise-amid-slump-in-passenger-flights/137714.article |title= Freight rates on the rise amid slump in passenger flights |author= Cirium |date= 3 April 2020 |work= Flightglobal}}</ref>
Passenger airlines were enticed to convert aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Asaf |first1=Seher |title=Airlines remove seats from planes for cargo |url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/features/in-photos-airlines-remove-seats-from-planes-for-cargo/ |publisher=[[Business Traveller]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200816033204/https://www.businesstraveller.com/features/in-photos-airlines-remove-seats-from-planes-for-cargo/ |archive-date=16 August 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

At the end of March 2020, cargo capacity was down by 35% compared to the previous year: North America to Asia Pacific capacity fall by 17% (19% in the opposite direction) Asia-Pacific to Europe was down by 30% (reverse: -32%), intra-Asia was down by 35%.<!--ref name=Flight21apr2020-->
Lagging the capacity reductions, demand was down by 23% in March, resulting in higher freight rates: from China/Hong Kong, between 2 March 2020 and 6 April 2020 +158% to Europe and +90.5% to North America.<ref name=Flight21apr2020>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/networks/air-freight-market-goes-into-overdrive/137993.article |title= Air freight market goes into overdrive |first= Damian |last= Brett |date= 21 April 2020 |work= Flightglobal}}</ref> By May, freight rates from Shanghai were $12/kg to North America, $11/kg to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Damian |first1=Brett |title=Emirates calls A380s up for all-cargo duties |url=https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/freighter-operator/emirates-calls-a380s-up-for-all-cargo-duties/ |website=Air Cargo News |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201111144446/https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/freighter-operator/emirates-calls-a380s-up-for-all-cargo-duties/ |archive-date=11 November 2020 |language=en |date=11 November 2020 |quote=$12.27 per kg carriers were able to achieve on Shanghai to North America and $11.18 per kg to Europe in mid-May – at the height of the PPE capacity crunch |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Business aviation==
Business aviation was less affected than airline traffic, in that top executives' travel is often considered essential. [[London Biggin Hill Airport]] reported traffic to be around 30% of 2019 levels, with transatlantic traffic strong. Once lockdown restrictions are eased, business aviation has an opportunity to capture premium passengers who might previously have chosen airlines, but who may prefer the social distancing afforded by a private jet.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Morrison |first1=Murdo |title=Transatlantic traffic keeps Biggin Hill's head above water |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/business-aviation/transatlantic-traffic-keeps-biggin-hills-head-above-water/138210.article |work=Flight Global |date=4 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

United States [[air charter]] travel strongly increased in February and March as airlines slashed schedules, making commercial flights increasingly unpredictable; however, some charter operators such as [[JetSuite]] subsequently saw a drastic drop in business as widespread stay-at-home orders took effect in April 2020.<ref name=DMN_JetSuite_23Apr/>

Analysts expect airlines to reduce the size of their fleets as a result of the downturn, and point out that this could be done either by modernising fleets{{snd}}hastening the retirement of older aircraft and maintaining planned deliveries of new, more fuel-efficient models{{snd}}or by retaining older planes and reducing capital expenditure on new aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hemmerdinger|first1=Jon|date=13 April 2020|title=Out with the old jets?

[[File:CommonPass_Logo.png|thumb|CommonsPass logo]]
On 25 November, separately from IATA's digital health pass initiative, five major airlines – [[United Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[Swiss International Air Lines]], and [[JetBlue]] – announced the 1 December 2020 introduction of the CommonPass, which shows the results of passengers' COVID-19 tests. It was designed as an international standard by the [[World Economic Forum]] and The Commons Project, and set up in such a way that it could also be used to record vaccination results in the future. It standardises test results and aims to prevent forgery of vaccination records, while storing only limited data on a passenger's phone to safeguard their privacy. The CommonPass had already successfully undergone a trial period in October with United Airlines and [[Cathay Pacific Airways]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/united-airlines-virgin-covid-19-digital-health-pass-negative-test-2020-11?international=true&r=US&IR=T |title=5 major airlines are rolling out shared digital health passes to prove negative COVID-19 tests.

On 26 November, the Danish Ministry of Health confirmed that it was working on a Covid-19 "vaccine passport", which would likely not only work as proof of vaccination for air travel, but for other activities such as concerts, private parties and access to various businesses, a perspective welcomed by the [[Confederation of Danish Industry]]. The Danish College of General Practitioners also welcomed the project, saying that it doesn't force anyone to vaccinate, but encourages them to do so if they want to enjoy certain privileges in society.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20201126/danish-health-ministry-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine-passport |title=Danish health ministry to develop Covid-19 'vaccine passport' |work=The Local DK |date=26 November 2020 |accessdate=28 November 2020}}</ref>

Irish Foreign Minister [[Simon Coveney]] said on 27 November 2020 that, although he "currently has no plans" for a passport vaccination stamp, his government was working on changing the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland#Passenger locator form|passenger locator form]] to include proof of PCR negative tests for the coronavirus, and that it was likely to be further adjusted to include vaccination data when a COVID-19 vaccine would become available. Coveney stressed that "We do not want, following enormous efforts and sacrifices from people, to reintroduce the virus again through international travel, which is a danger if it is not managed right."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/system-being-planned-to-allow-vaccinated-airline-passengers-avoid-restrictions-1.4421765 |title=System being planned to allow vaccinated airline passengers avoid restrictions |author=Marie O'Halloran |work=The Irish Times |date=27 November 2020 |accessdate=28 November 2020}}</ref>
