'''The BioInitiative Report''' is a report on the relationship between the [[Electromagnetic radiation and health|electromagnetic fields]] (EMF) associated with powerlines and wireless devices and health. It was self-published online, without [[peer review]], on 31 August 2007, by a group "of 14 scientists, researchers, and public health policy professionals". The BioInitiative Report states that it is an examination of the controversial health risks of electromagnetic fields and  radiofrequency radiation.<ref>[http://www.bioinitiative.org/ Bioinitiative Report]</ref> Some updated BioInitiative material was published in a journal in an issue guest-edited by one of the members of the group,<ref name="PathoMBlank">{{cite journal|last= Blank|first= Martin|title= Preface|date=August 2009|journal= Pathophysiology|volume= 16|pmid= 19264462|issue= 2–3|pages= 67–69|doi= 10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.02.002}} And {{cite web|title=List of BioInitiative Participants |url=http://www.bioinitiative.org/participants/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422053240/http://www.bioinitiative.org/participants/index.htm |publisher=BioInitiative Report |accessdate=2010-01-20 |archive-date=22 April 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> and a 2012 version of the report was released on 7 January 2013.<ref name="2012ReportPressRelease">{{cite web|url= http://bioinitiative.org/report/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/BioInitiativePressRelease1-1-2013.pdf|format= PDF|title= BioInitiative 2012 Report Issues New Warnings on Wireless and EMF|publisher= Bionitiative Report|date= 7 January 2013|accessdate= 2013-01-20|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130623115601/http://bioinitiative.org/report/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/BioInitiativePressRelease1-1-2013.pdf|archive-date= 23 June 2013|url-status= dead}}</ref> It has been heavily criticized by independent and governmental research groups for its lack of balance.

==History==
In 2006, at the Bioelectromagnetics Society's annual meeting, there was a mini-symposium on electromagnetic fields and radiofrequency radiation to present the science showing biological effects, and the precautionary measures taken by countries around the world.  The Bioinitiative Working Group grew out of this conference and decided to write a report on the science and health risks to alert people who could translate the science into public policy.  From October 2006 to August 2007, 14 scientists and public health experts, headed by Cindy Sage and [[David O. Carpenter]], worked to come up with recommendations for the Bioinitiative Report.<ref>{{cite web  | title =  The BioInitiative Report - Biological Standards for Wireless | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tZDor-_co0  | accessdate = 2008-06-07}}</ref>

Since 2007, some of the material was revised, updated and submitted for peer-reviewed publication and published in the August 2009 issue of ''Pathophysiology'', an issue guest-edited by Martin Blank, one of the three members of the BioInitiative Organizing Committee.<ref name="PathoMBlank"/>

An updated 2012 version of the report was released on 7 January 2013.<ref name="2012ReportPressRelease"/>

==Criticism==
The following government health authorities and independent expert groups have reviewed the BioInitiative Report and made the following comments on the merit of its claims.

===Health Council of the Netherlands===

The [[Health Council of the Netherlands]] reviewed the BioInitiative report in September 2008 and concluded it is a selective review of existing research and does not present a balanced analysis considering the relative scientific quality of different studies. Some of the shortcomings identified included that the report made false claims as well as claims which lacked scientific basis.

In 2008, they concluded: 
{{quote|In view of the way the BioInitiative report was compiled, the selective use of scientific data and the other shortcomings mentioned above, the Committee concludes that the BioInitiative report is not an objective and balanced reflection of the current state of scientific knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|title= BioInitiative report (publication no. 2008/17E)|url= http://www.gezondheidsraad.nl/en/publications/bioinitiative-report-0|publisher= Health Council of the Netherlands|date= 1 September 2008|accessdate= 2010-01-20}}</ref>}}

===Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR)===

In December 2008 the Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research (ACRBR) reviewed the BioInitiative Report and concluded:

{{quote|Overall we think that the BioInitiative Report does not progress science, and would agree with the Health Council of the Netherlands that the BioInitiative Report is “not an objective and balanced reflection of the current state of scientific knowledge”. As it stands it merely provides a set of views that are not consistent with the consensus of science, and it does not provide an analysis that is rigorous-enough to raise doubts about the scientific consensus.}}

The ACRBR also points out there are statements in the report that do not accord with the standard view of science, and the report does not provide a reasonable account of why we should reject the standard view in favour of the views espoused in the report.

The ACRBR also noted that the state of science in this area is continually being debated and updated by a number of expert bodies composed of the leading experts in this field and strongly urged people to consult these views for a balanced assessment of the research.<ref>{{cite web|last1= Rodney|first1= Croft|last2= Abramson|first2= Michael|last3= Cosic|first3= Irena|last4= Finnie|first4= John|last5= McKenzie|first5= Ray|last6= Wood|first6= Andrew|title= ACRBR Position Statement on ''BioInitiative Report''|url= http://www.acrbr.org.au/FAQ/ACRBR%20Bioinitiative%20Report%2018%20Dec%202008.pdf|format= PDF|publisher= Australian Centre for Radiofrequency Bioeffects Research|date= 18 December 2008|accessdate= 2010-01-20|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119205536/http://www.acrbr.org.au/FAQ/ACRBR%20Bioinitiative%20Report%2018%20Dec%202008.pdf|archive-date= 19 January 2010|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===European Commission’s EMF-NET===

The [[European Commission|European Commission's]] EMF-NET coordination group for investigating the impact of electromagnetic fields on health made the following comments in October 2007 regarding the BioInitiative Report:

{{quote|There is a lack of balance in the report; no mention is made in fact of reports that do not concur with authors’ statements and conclusions.

===Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR)===

The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR) reviewed the BioInitiative Report in 2009. They concluded:

{{quote|...that the weight of scientific evidence in the RF bioeffects literature does not support the safety limits recommended by the BioInitiative group. For this reason, COMAR recommends that public health officials continue to base their policies on RF safety limits recommended by established and sanctioned international organizations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety and the [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]], which is formally related to the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite journal|author= Committee on Man and Radiation (COMAR)|title= COMAR technical information statement: expert reviews on potential health effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and comments on the bioinitiative report|date=October 2009|journal= Health Physics|volume= 97|issue= 4|pages= 348–356|pmid= 19741364|doi= 10.1097/HP.0b013e3181adcb94}}</ref>}}

===German Federal Office for Radiation Protection===

The German [[Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz|Federal Office for Radiation Protection]] (BfS) commented in October 2007 on a newsmagazine TV show on the German network [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] that featured the BioInitiative Report shortly after its release. They said:

{{quote|The BfS conducted a preliminary review of the so-called "BioInitiative Report" immediately after its release and concluded that it had clear scientific shortcomings.
