A '''scar''' is an area of [[fibrosis|fibrous tissue]] that replaces normal [[skin]] after an injury. Scars result from the biological process of [[wound repair]] in the skin, as well as in other [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Thus, scarring is a natural part of the [[healing]] process. With the exception of very minor [[lesion]]s, every wound (e.g., after [[accident]], [[disease]], or [[surgery]]) results in some degree of scarring. An exception to this are animals with complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], which regrow tissue without scar formation.

Scar tissue is composed of the same protein ([[collagen]]) as the tissue that it replaces, but the fiber composition of the protein is different; instead of a random basketweave formation of the collagen fibers found in normal tissue, in fibrosis the collagen cross-links and forms a pronounced alignment in a single direction.<ref name="collagenskinscar2010-08-20">{{Cite web  | last = Sherratt  | first = Jonathan A.  | title = Mathematical Modelling of Scar Tissue Formation  | quote = This is composed of the same main protein (collagen) as normal skin, but with differences in details of composition. Most crucially, the protein fibres in normal tissue have a random (basketweave) appearance, while those in scar tissue have pronounced alignment in a single direction.  | publisher = Department of Mathematics, Heriot-Watt University  | year = 2010  | url = http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~jas/researchinterests/scartissueformation.html  | access-date = 20 August 2010}}</ref> This collagen scar tissue alignment is usually of inferior functional quality to the normal collagen randomised alignment. For example, scars in the skin are less resistant to [[ultraviolet radiation]], and [[sweat gland]]s and [[hair follicle]]s do not grow back within scar tissues.<ref name=Kraftlynde/> A [[myocardial infarction]], commonly known as a heart attack,  causes [[Myocardial scarring|scar formation]] in the [[heart]] muscle, which leads to loss of muscular power and possibly [[heart failure]]. However, there are some tissues (e.g. [[bone]]) that can heal without any structural or functional deterioration.

All scarring is composed of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but the composition of the scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different.<ref name=collagenskinscar2010-08-20/> Scar tissue also lacks elasticity<ref name=elasticFibersScars>{{cite book | last = A.

Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and [[keloid]] scarring,<ref name=Roseborough2004/> both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. Stretch marks (striae) are regarded as scars by some.

High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sder.2009.04.002 |pmid=19608056 |title=Update on the Management of Keloids |journal=Seminars in Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=71–76 |year=2009 |last1=Kelly |first1=A. Paul }}</ref>

=== Hypertrophic ===
{{main|Hypertrophic scars}}
[[Hypertrophic scars]] occur when the body overproduces collagen, which causes the scar to be raised above the surrounding skin. [[Organ hypertrophy|Hypertrophic]] scars take the form of a red raised lump on the skin. They usually occur within 4 to 8 weeks following wound infection or wound closure with excess tension and/or other traumatic skin injuries.<ref name=Roseborough2004>{{cite journal |doi=10.2119/molmed.2009.00153 |pmid=20927486 |pmc=3022978 |year=2011 |last1=Gauglitz |first1=Gerd |journal=Molecular Medicine |volume=17 |issue=1–2 |pages=113–25 |last2=Korting |first2=Hans |title=Hypertrophic Scarring and Keloids: Pathomechanisms and Current and Emerging Treatment Strategies }}</ref>

===Keloid===
{{Main|Keloid}}
Keloid scars are a more serious form of excessive scarring, because they can grow indefinitely into large, tumorous (although benign) [[neoplasm]]s.<ref name=Roseborough2004/>

Hypertrophic scars are often distinguished from keloid scars by their lack of growth outside the original wound area, but this commonly taught distinction can lead to confusion.<ref name="Roseborough2004a">{{cite journal |vauthors=Roseborough IE, Grevious MA, Lee RC | title = Prevention and treatment of excessive dermal scarring | journal = J Natl Med Assoc | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 108–16 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14746360 | pmc = 2594768 }}</ref>

Keloid scars can occur on anyone, but they are most common in dark-skinned people.<ref>Martini, Frederic H. (2006). ''Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology,'' Seventh Edition, p. 171. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.</ref> They can be caused by surgery, accident, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or, sometimes, [[body piercings]]. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a cosmetic problem, keloid scars are only inert masses of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the [[shoulder]]s and [[chest]]. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention.<ref name=secinten201104/> Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may exacerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.

=== Atrophic ===
An atrophic scar takes the form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when underlying structures supporting the skin, such as [[fat]] or [[muscle]], are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Goodman GJ | title = Postacne scarring: A review of its pathophysiology and treatment | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 26 | issue = 9 | pages = 857–871 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10971560 | doi=10.1046/j.1524-4725.2000.99232.x| s2cid = 25244676 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fabbrocini G, Annunziata MC, D'Arco V, De Vita V, Lodi G, Mauriello MC, Pastore F, Monfrecola G | title = Acne Scars: Pathogenesis, Classification and Treatment | journal = Dermatology Research and Practice | volume = 2010 | pages = 1–13 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20981308 | pmc = 2958495 | doi = 10.1155/2010/893080 }}</ref> [[chickenpox]], other diseases (especially ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents.

=== Stretch marks ===
{{Main|Stretch marks}}
Stretch marks (technically called ''striae'') are also a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is stretched rapidly (for instance during [[pregnancy]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Miriam|last2=Young|first2=Gavin|last3=Devane|first3=Declan|date=2012-11-14|title=Topical preparations for preventing stretch marks in pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|pages=CD000066|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000066.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=23152199}}</ref> significant weight gain, or adolescent [[growth spurt]]s),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Baumann LS, Elsaaiee LT | title = Striae Distensae (Stretch Marks) and Different Modalities of Therapy: An Update | journal = Dermatologic Surgery | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 563–573 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19400881 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-4725.2009.01094.x | s2cid = 7887237 }}</ref> or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near [[joints]]). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.<ref name=":0" />

Elevated [[corticosteroid]] levels are implicated in striae development.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hengge UR, Ruzicka T, Schwartz RA, Cork MJ | title = Adverse effects of topical glucocorticosteroids | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16384751 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2005.01.010 }}</ref>

=== Umbilical ===
Humans and other [[List of placental mammals|placental mammals]] have an umbilical scar (commonly referred to as to a [[navel]]) which starts to heal when the [[umbilical cord]] is cut after birth. Egg-laying animals have an umbilical scar which, depending on the species, may remain visible for life or disappear within a few days after birth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-types-of-animals-have-been-to-space-and-more-questions-from-our-readers-63029589/ |title=What Types of Animals Have Been to Space and More Questions From our Readers|work= Smithsonian Magazine |date=May 2012|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/Documents/Redbook/Flat-Tailed%20Horned%20Lizard%20RB.pdf |title=Flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcallii)|website= US Fish & Wildlife Service |access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref>

Prolonged [[inflammation]], as well as the [[fibroblast]] proliferation<ref name="Fibroblast"/> can occur.

Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Skin scars occur when the [[dermis]] (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original [[injury]] that caused them. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Collagen synthesis===
Any injury does not become a scar until the wound has completely healed; this can take many months, or years in the worst pathological cases, such as keloids. To begin to patch the damage, a clot is created; the clot is the beginning process that results in a provisional matrix. In the process, the first layer is a provisional matrix and is not scar. Over time, the wounded body tissue then overexpresses collagen inside the provisional matrix to create a collagen matrix. This collagen overexpression continues and crosslinks the fiber arrangement inside the collagen matrix, making the collagen dense. This densely packed collagen, morphing into an inelastic whitish collagen<ref name="Fibroblast"/> scar wall, blocks off cell communication and regeneration; as a result, the new tissue generated will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding unwounded tissue. This prolonged collagen-producing process results in a fortuna scar.

====Fibroblasts====
The scarring is created by fibroblast proliferation,<ref name="Fibroblast"/> a process that begins with a reaction to the clot.<ref name=pmid18086923>{{cite journal |doi=10.1083/jcb.200704042 |pmid=18086923 |pmc=2140013 |lay-url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-12/epfd-nmi121707.php |title=Myofibroblast contraction activates latent TGF-β1 from the extracellular matrix |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |volume=179 |issue=6 |pages=1311–1323 |year=2007 |last1=Wipff |first1=Pierre-Jean |last2=Rifkin |first2=Daniel B. |last3=Meister |first3=Jean-Jacques |last4=Hinz |first4=Boris }}</ref>

To mend the damage, fibroblasts slowly form the collagen scar. The fibroblast proliferation is circular<ref name=pmid18086923/> and cyclically, the fibroblast proliferation lays down thick, whitish [[collagen]]<ref name="Fibroblast"/> inside the provisional and collagen matrix, resulting in the abundant production of packed [[collagen]] on the fibers<ref name="Fibroblast">{{cite encyclopedia  | title = Facts about fibroblast: scar tissue formation| quote = As part of the healing process, specialized cells called fibroblasts in adjacent areas of skin produce a fibrous connective tissue made up of collagen. The bundles formed by these whitish, rather inelastic fibres make up the bulk of the scar tissue...| encyclopedia = Britannica.com| url = http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/264152/fibroblast-as-discussed-in-scar-biology| access-date = 19 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=pmid18086923/> giving scars their uneven texture. Over time, the fibroblasts continue to crawl around the matrix, adjusting more fibers and, in the process, the scarring settles and becomes stiff.<ref name=pmid18086923/> This fibroblast proliferation also contracts the tissue.<ref name=pmid18086923/> In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick collagen and do not contract.

=====Myofibroblast=====
Mammalian wounds that involve the dermis of the skin heal by repair, not regeneration (except in 1st trimester inter-uterine wounds and in the regeneration of deer antlers). Full thickness wounds heal by a combination of wound contracture and edge re-epitheliasation. Partial thickness wounds heal by edge re-epithelialisation and epidermal migration from adnexal structures (hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands. The site of keratinocyte stem cells remains unknown but stem cells are likely to reside in the basal layer of the epidermis and below the bulge area of hair follicles.

The fibroblast involved in scarring and contraction is the [[myofibroblast]],<ref name="myo201103" /> which is a specialized contractile fibroblast.<ref name="myo2011033" /> These cells express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).<ref name="pmid17586870">{{cite journal |pmid=17586870 |url=https://www.o-wm.com/content/regenerative-healing-fetal-skin-a-review-literature?page=0,11 |year=2007 |last1=Wilgus |first1=T. A. |title=Regenerative healing in fetal skin: A review of the literature |journal=Ostomy/Wound Management |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=16–31; quiz 32–3 }}</ref>

The myofibroblasts are absent in the first trimester in the embryonic stage where damage heals scar free;<ref name=pmid17586870/>  in small incisional or excision wounds less than 2&nbsp;mm that also heal without scarring;<ref name=pmid17586870/> and in adult unwounded tissues where the fibroblast in itself is arrested; however, the myofibroblast is found in massive numbers in adult wound healing which heals with a scar.<ref name=myo2011033/>

The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing. In the rat model, for instance, myofibroblasts can constitute up to 70% of the fibroblasts,<ref name=myo201103>{{Cite web |author=Linge, Claire (Harrow, GB), Mackie, Ian Paul (Sheffield, GB) | title = Method of preventing or reducing scarring of human skin | quote = myofibroblasts become differentiated from other cells in the wound within a few days after the onset of healing, and in the rat model can reach a peak where about 70% of the fibroblastic cells present are of the myofibroblast phenotype. | publisher = freepatentsonline.com | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2005/0054608.html| access-date = 26 March 2010}}</ref> and is responsible for fibrosis on tissue.<ref name=pmid18802478>{{cite journal |doi=10.1172/JCI35381 |pmid=18802478 |pmc=2542848 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080918192824.htm |lay-source=Science Daily |lay-date=September 24, 2008 |title=GSK-3β in mouse fibroblasts controls wound healing and fibrosis through an endothelin-1–dependent mechanism |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=118 |issue=10 |pages=3279–90 |year=2008 |last1=Kapoor |first1=Mohit |last2=Liu |first2=Shangxi |last3=Shi-Wen |first3=Xu |last4=Huh |first4=Kun |last5=McCann |first5=Matthew |last6=Denton |first6=Christopher P. |last7=Woodgett |first7=James R. |last8=Abraham |first8=David J. |last9=Leask |first9=Andrew }}{{vs|retracted|date=February 2019}}</ref>

Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for acne surgery | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | pages = S28–36 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688101 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=28;epage=36;aulast=Khunger }}</ref> Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to [[keloid]] formation or with active infections.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khunger N | title = Standard guidelines of care for chemical peels | journal = Indian Journal of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology | volume = 74 Suppl | pages = S5–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18688104 | url = http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year=2008;volume=74;issue=7;spage=5;epage=12;aulast=Khunger }}</ref>

=== Filler injections ===
Filler injections of [[collagen]] can be used to raise [[Atrophy|atrophic]] scars to the level of surrounding skin.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper JS, Lee BT | title = Treatment of facial scarring: lasers, filler, and nonoperative techniques | journal = Facial Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 311–5 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20024872 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1243079 }}</ref> Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and [[allergic reaction]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lemperle G, Rullan PP, Gauthier-Hazan N | title = Avoiding and treating dermal filler complications | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 118 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 92S–107S | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16936549 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000234672.69287.77 | s2cid = 32471639 | url = http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4t0019d6 }}</ref>

=== Laser treatment ===
Nonablative lasers, such as the 585&nbsp;nm [[pulsed dye laser]], 1064&nbsp;nm and 1320&nbsp;nm [[Nd:YAG]], or the 1540&nbsp;nm [[Er:Glass]] are used as laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.<ref name="pmid21061757">{{cite journal |vauthors=Elsaie ML, Choudhary S |title=Lasers for scars: A review and evidence-based appraisal |journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=1355–62 |date=November 2010 |pmid=21061757}}</ref> There is tentative evidence for burn scars that they improve the appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Willows |first1=B.M. |last2=Ilyas |first2=M. |last3=Sharma |first3=A. |title=Laser in the management of burn scars |journal=Burns |date=4 August 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.burns.2017.07.001 |pmid=28784339 |volume=43 |issue=7 |pages=1379–1389}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedstat |first1=JS |last2=Hultman |first2=CS |title=Hypertrophic burn scar management: what does the evidence show?

Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.<ref name="pmid21061757"/>
Combination laser therapy and [[microneedling]] may offer superior results to single modality treatment. The biggest recent advance in scar management is the use of fractionated CO{{sub|2}} laser and immediate application of topical steroid [[Triamcinolone]].

=== Radiotherapy ===
Low-dose, superficial [[radiotherapy]] is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. It is thought to be effective despite a lack of clinical trials, but only used in extreme cases due to the perceived risk of long-term side effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogawa R, Yoshitatsu S, Yoshida K, Miyashita T | title = Is radiation therapy for keloids acceptable?

=== Dressings & topical silicone===
Silicone scar treatments are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stavrou D, Weissman O, Winkler E, Yankelson L, Millet E, Mushin OP, Liran A, Haik J | title = Silicone-based scar therapy: a review of the literature | journal = Aesthetic Plastic Surgery | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 646–51 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20354695 | doi = 10.1007/s00266-010-9496-8 | s2cid = 43820233 }}</ref> A meta-study by the Cochrane collaboration found weak evidence that silicone gel sheeting helps prevent scarring.<ref name=Ob2013/> However, the studies examining it were of poor quality and susceptible to bias.<ref name=Ob2013>{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=L|last2=Jones|first2=DJ|title=Silicone gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 September 2013|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD003826|pmid=24030657|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003826.pub3|pmc=7156908}}</ref>

[[Pressure dressing]]s are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking.<ref name=Shih2007>{{cite journal |vauthors=Shih R, Waltzman J, Evans GR | title = Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 1091–5 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17312518 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000255814.75012.35 | s2cid = 2756632 }}</ref> Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids.<ref name=Shih2007/> The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.<ref name=Shih2007/>

=== Steroids ===
A long-term course of [[corticosteroid]] injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Roques C, Téot L | title = The Use of Corticosteroids to Treat Keloids: A Review | journal = The International Journal of Lower Extremity Wounds | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 137–145 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18611924 | doi = 10.1177/1534734608320786 | s2cid = 9577277 }}</ref>

Topical steroids are ineffective.<ref name="ReferenceB">Jenkins M, Alexander JW, MacMillan BG, Waymack JP, Kopcha R. Failure of topical steroids and vitamin E to reduce postoperative scar formation following reconstructive surgery. J Burn Care Rehabil. 1986 Jul–Aug;7(4):309–312.</ref> However, [[clobetasol propionate]] can be used as an alternative treatment for keloid scars.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=A Randomized, Single-Blind Trial of Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% Cream Under Silicone Dressing Occlusion Versus Intra-Lesional Triamcinolone for Treatment of Keloid | journal=Clinical Drug Investigation | volume=37 | issue=3 | pages=295–301 | date=2016-11-25 | pmid=27888448 | last1=Nor | first1=N.

Topical steroid applied immediately after fractionated CO2 laser treatment is however very effective (and more efficacious than laser treatment alone) and has shown benefit in numerous clinical studies.

=== Surgery ===
[[File:scar revision.jpg|right|thumb|Scarring caused by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] (left), and photo one day after scar revision surgery: The area around sutures is still swollen from surgery.]]

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by [[primary intention]], instead of [[secondary intention]]. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.<ref name=scarrevision2010>{{Cite web  | title = Scar revisions  | quote = Deep cuts need multi-layered closure to heal optimally; otherwise, depressed or dented scars can result  | url = http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | access-date = 16 October 2010  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119050557/http://www.haplasticsurgery.com/scar-revision-surgery-dallas-texas.html  | archive-date = 19 January 2012  | url-status = dead  | df = dmy-all  }}</ref>

Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars.

''Subcision'' is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe [[glabella]] lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as [[laser resurfacing]], [[microdermabrasion]] or [[chemical peel]]s can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Vitamins===
Research shows the use of [[vitamin E]] and onion extract (sold as [[Mederma]]) as treatments for scars is ineffective.<ref name=Shih2007/> Vitamin E causes contact [[dermatitis]] in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance and could cause minor skin irritations,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> but Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.<ref name="ReferenceA">Farris PK.

==Society and culture==

=== Intentional scarring ===
{{main|Scarification}}
The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of [[body art]] within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

===Etymology===
First attested in English in the late 14th century, the word ''scar'' derives from a conflation of [[Old French]] ''escharre'', from [[Late Latin]] ''eschara'',<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Deschara eschara], 
Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus</ref> which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἐσχάρα (''eskhara''), meaning "hearth, fireplace", but in medicine "scab, [[eschar]] on a wound caused by burning or otherwise",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29sxa%2Fra ἐσχάρα], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on perseus</ref><ref name="etymology scar">[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scar Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> and [[Middle English]] ''skar'' ("cut, crack, incision"), which is from [[Old Norse]] ''skarð'' ("notch, gap").<ref name="etymology scar"/> The conflation helped to form the English meaning. Compare [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] for evolution of ''skarð'' to ''scar''.

==Research==
Research, before 2009, focused on scar improvements with research in to molecular mechanisms. Molecular mechanisms such as: juvista,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60322-6 |pmid=19362676 |title=Prophylactic administration of avotermin for improvement of skin scarring: Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I/II studies |journal=The Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9671 |pages=1264–1274 |year=2009 |last1=Ferguson |first1=Mark WJ |last2=Duncan |first2=Jonathan |last3=Bond |first3=Jeremy |last4=Bush |first4=James |last5=Durani |first5=Piyush |last6=So |first6=Karen |last7=Taylor |first7=Lisa |last8=Chantrey |first8=Jonquille |last9=Mason |first9=Tracey |last10=James |first10=Gaynor |last11=Laverty |first11=Hugh |last12=Occleston |first12=Nick L. |last13=Sattar |first13=Abdul |last14=Ludlow |first14=Anna |last15=O'Kane |first15=Sharon |s2cid=35671002 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60705-4 |pmid=19362658 |title=Wound healing: From embryos to adults and back again |journal=The Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9671 |pages=1226–1228 |year=2009 |last1=Tredget |first1=Edward E. |last2=Ding |first2=Jie |s2cid=10236414 }}</ref> [[ribosomal s6 kinase]] (RSK),<ref>{{cite news |title=Liver damage 'could be reversed' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7152415.stm |date=27 December 2007 |work=BBC News |access-date=1 January 2008}}</ref> and [[osteopontin]]<ref>[http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/content/abstract/205/1/43 'Molecular mechanisms linking wound inflammation and fibrosis: knockdown of osteopontin leads to rapid repair and reduced scarring']</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7199897.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gel 'to speed up wound healing' | date=22 January 2008 | access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref> were investigated.<!---*** The research above has been historically finished a long time. ***--->

By 2016, skin had been regenerated ''[[in vivo]]'', and ''[[in vitro]]'' and scar free healing had been operationalized  and induced by four main techniques:  regeneration by instrument; regeneration by materials; regeneration by drugs and regeneration by ''in vitro'' 3d printing. In 2018, a [[silk]]-derived [[sericin]] [[hydrogel]] dressing  was under going research, the material was shown to prevent scar formation.<ref name="cw">{{cite news |last=Dey |first=Becky |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/silk-route-to-scar-free-skin/3009682.article |title=Silk route to scar-free skin |work=[[Chemistry World]] |date=2018-10-29 |access-date=2019-06-18 }}</ref>
