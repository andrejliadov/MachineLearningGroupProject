'''Disease burden''' is the impact of a [[health problem]] as measured by [[financial cost]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], [[morbidity]], or other indicators. It is often quantified in terms of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALYs) or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs). Both of these metrics quantify the number of years lost due to disability (YLDs), sometimes also known as years lost due to disease or years lived with disability/disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Metrics: Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)|website=WHO|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> One DALY can be thought of as one year of healthy life lost, and the overall disease burden can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current health status and the ideal health status (where the individual lives to [[old age]] free from disease and [[disability]]).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease.pdf | last1=Prüss-Üstün | first1=Annette | last2 = Corvalán | first2=Carlos|year =2006 |title=Preventing disease through healthy environments: Towards an estimate of the environmental burden of disease | publisher =World Health Organization | work = Quantifying environmental health impacts }}</ref><ref name="kay00">{{cite conference| first1=David |last1=Kay | first2=Annette |last2=Prüss |first3=Carlos |last3=Corvalán |title=Methodology for assessment of Environmental burden of disease |book-title=ISEE session on environmental burden of disease |location=Buffalo |date=23–24 August 2000 |url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/methods/en/wsh0007.pdf}}</ref><ref name="pruss-ustun2003">{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-9241546201|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}</ref> According to an article published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in June 2015, low back pain and major depressive disorder were among the top ten causes of YLDs and were the cause of more health loss than diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma combined.{{Where|date=June 2019}} The study based on data from 188 countries, considered to be the largest and most detailed analysis to quantify levels, patterns, and trends in ill health and disability, concluded that "the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21.1% in 1990 to 31.2% in 2013."<ref name="Lancet_2015">{{cite journal |title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |date=8 June 2015 |journal=The Lancet |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4 |pmid=26063472 |pmc=4561509 |volume=386 |issue=9995 |pages=743–800|author1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Collaborators }}<!--|accessdate=24 June 2015 --></ref> The '''environmental burden of disease '''is defined as the number of DALYs that can be attributed to [[environmental factor]]s.<ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /><ref name="knol09">{{cite journal|vauthors=Knol AB, Petersen AC, van der Sluijs JP, Lebret E|title=Dealing with uncertainties in environmental burden of disease assessment|journal=Environmental Health|date=1 January 2009|volume=8|issue=1|page=21|doi=10.1186/1476-069X-8-21|pmid=19400963|pmc=2684742}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Briggs|first=D.|title=Environmental pollution and the global burden of disease|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=1 December 2003|volume=68|issue=1|pages=1–24|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldg019|pmid=14757707|url=http://bmb.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/1/1.short|doi-access=free}}</ref> Similarly, The '''work-related burden of disease '''is defined as the number of deaths and DALYs that can be attributed to [[occupational risk factor]]s to human health.<ref name="Hulshof_2019">{{cite journal |title=WHO/ILO work-related burden of disease and injury: Protocol for systematic reviews of exposure to occupational ergonomic risk factors and of the effect of exposure to occupational ergonomic risk factors on osteoarthritis of hip or knee and selected other musculoskeletal diseases |date=2019 |journal=Environment International | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2018.09.053 |pmid=30583853|volume=125|pages=554–66|author1=Huslhof, Carel |author2=Colosio, Claudio |author3=Nygård, Claas |author4=Pega, Frank |author5=Frings-Dresen, Monique |doi-access=free }}</ref>  These measures allow for comparison of disease burdens, and have also been used to forecast the possible impacts of health interventions.

==History==

The first study on the [[global burden of disease]], conducted in 1990, quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the DALY as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s.<ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /><ref name="aboutgbd">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref name="globalburden">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> From 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.<ref name="aboutgbd" />

==Modifiable risk factors==

In 2006, the WHO released a report which addressed the amount of global disease that could be prevented by reducing environmental risk factors.<ref name="knol09" /> The report found that approximately one-fourth of the global disease burden and more than one-third of the burden among children was due to modifiable environmental factors. The "environmentally-mediated" disease burden is much higher in developing countries, with the exception of certain [[non-communicable disease]]s, such as [[cardiovascular disease]]s and cancers, where the [[per capita]] disease burden is larger in [[developed countries]]. Children have the highest death toll, with more than 4 million environmentally-caused deaths yearly, mostly in [[developing countries]]. The [[infant death rate]] attributed to environmental causes is also 12 times higher in developing countries. 85 out of the 102 major diseases and injuries classified by WHO were due to environmental factors.<ref name="knol09" />

To measure the environmental health impact, ''environment'' was defined as "all the physical, chemical and biological factors external to a person, and all the related behaviours".<ref name="whatisenv">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/preventingdisease2.pdf|title=What is the environment in the context of health?|work=Environmental burden of disease series|publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref> The definition of ''modifiable environment'' included:
* Air, soil, and water pollution with [[chemical]]s or [[biological agent]]s
* [[Ultraviolet]] and [[ionizing radiation]]
* [[Noise pollution|Noise]] and [[electromagnetic field]]s
* [[Built environment]]
* Agricultural methods and [[irrigation]] schemes
* [[Human impact on the environment|Man-made climate change]] and ecosystem degradation
* [[Occupational hazard|Occupational risks]]
* Individual behaviors, such as hand-washing and [[food contamination]] due to unsafe water or dirty hands<ref name="whatisenv" /><ref name="quantification">{{cite web|title=Quantification of the disease burden attributable to environmental risk factors|year=2010|work=Programme on quantifying environmental health impacts|author=Department of Public Health and Environment|publisher=World Health Organization|url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/summaryEBD_updated.pdf}}</ref>

Certain environmental factors were excluded from this definition:
* Indoor smoke from [[solid fuel]] use
* Lead
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]<ref name="oberg10">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/SHS.pdf|title=Second-hand smoke: Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels|author1=Öberg, M.|author2=Jaakkola, M.S.|year=2010|work=Environmental Burden of Disease Series|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=January 2, 2019|author3=Prüss-Üstün, A.|author4=Schweizer, C.|author5=Woodward, A.|volume=18}}</ref>

==Estimation==

The WHO developed a methodology to quantify the health of a population using summary measures, which combine information on mortality and non-fatal health outcomes. The measures quantify either health gaps or health expectancies; the most commonly used health summary measure is the DALY.<ref name="kay00" /><ref name="globalburden" /><ref name="quantification" />

The exposure-based approach, which measures exposure via [[pollutant]] levels, is used to calculate the environmental burden of disease.<ref name="knol05">{{cite web|last1=Knol|first1=A.B.|last2=Staatsen|first2=B.A.M.|title=Trends in the environmental burden of disease in the Netherlands, 1980–2020|date=8 August 2005|publisher=National Institute of Public Health and the Environment|url=http://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/rapporten/500029001.pdf}}</ref> This approach requires knowledge of the outcomes associated with the relevant risk factor, exposure levels and distribution in the [[study population]], and [[dose-response relationship]]s of the pollutants.

A dose-response relationship is a function of the exposure parameter assessed for the study population.<ref name="kay00" /> Exposure distribution and dose-response relationships are combined to yield the study population's ''health impact distribution'', usually expressed in terms of [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]. The health impact distribution can then be converted into health summary measures, such as DALYs. Exposure-response relationships for a given risk factor are commonly obtained from [[epidemiological studies]].<ref name="kay00" /><ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /> For example, the disease burden of outdoor air pollution for [[Santiago, Chile]], was calculated by measuring the concentration of [[atmospheric particulate matter]] (PM10), estimating the susceptible population, and combining these data with relevant dose-response relationships. A reduction of particulate matter levels in the air to recommended standards would cause a reduction of about 5,200 deaths, 4,700 respiratory [[hospital admission]]s, and 13,500,000 days of restricted activity per year, for a total population of 4.7 million.<ref name="kay00" />

In 2002, the WHO estimated the global environmental burden of disease by using [[risk assessment]] data to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease.<ref name="kay00" /><ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /><ref name="fewtrell07">{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241595759_eng.pdf|last1=Fewtrell|first1=Lorna|last2=Prüss-Üstün|first2=Annette|last3=Bos|first3=Robert|last4=Gore|first4=Fiona|last5=Bartram|first5=Jamie|title=Water, sanitation and hygiene: quantifying the health impact at national and local levels in countries with incomplete water supply and sanitation coverage|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2007|work=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=15}}</ref> In 2007, they released the first country-by-country analysis of the impact environmental factors had on health for its then 192 member states. These country estimates were the first step to assist governments in carrying out [[preventive action]]. The country estimates were divided into three parts:

;Environmental burden of disease for selected risk factors
:This presents the yearly burden, expressed in deaths and DALYs, attributable to: [[Indoor air quality|indoor air pollution]] from [[solid fuel]] use; outdoor air pollution; and unsafe water, [[sanitation]], and [[hygiene]]. Results are calculated using the exposure-based approach.
;Total environmental burden of disease for the relevant country
:The total number of deaths, DALYs per capita, and the percentage of the national burden of disease attributable to the environment represent the disease burden that could be avoided by modifying the environment as a whole.
;Environmental burden by disease category
:Each country summary was broken down by the disease group, where the annual number of DALYs per capita attributable to environmental factors were calculated for each group.<ref name="pruss-ustun2003" />

==Implementation and interpretation==

The public health impacts of air pollution (annual means of PM10 and ozone), noise pollution, and radiation ([[radon]] and UV), can be quantified using DALYs. For each disease, a DALY is calculated as:
:DALYs = number of people with the disease × duration of the disease (or loss of [[life expectancy]] in the case of mortality) × severity (varying from 0 for perfect health to 1 for death)

Necessary data include [[prevalence]] data, exposure-response relationships, and weighting factors that give an indication of the severity of a certain disorder. When information is missing or vague, experts will be consulted in order to decide which alternative data sources to use. An uncertainty analysis is carried out so as to analyze the effects of different assumptions.<ref name="knol05" /><ref name="severity01">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wyper GM, Grant I, Fletcher E, McCartney G, Stockton DL | title=The impact of worldwide, national and sub-national severity distributions in Burden of Disease studies: A case study of cancers in Scotland | journal=PLoS ONE| year= 2019 | volume= 14 | issue= 8 | pmid=31398232 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0221026 | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="severity02">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wyper GM, Grant I, Fletcher E, Chalmers N, McCartney G, Stockton DL | title=Prioritising the development of severity distributions in burden of disease studies for countries in the European region | journal=BMC Archives of Public Health| year= 2020 | volume= 78 | issue= 3 | pmid=31921418 | doi=10.1186/s13690-019-0385-6 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Uncertainty===

When estimating the environmental burden of disease, a number of potential sources of error may arise in the measure of exposure and exposure-risk relationship, assumptions made in applying the exposure or exposure-risk relationship to the relevant country, health statistics, and, if used, expert opinions.

Generally, it is not possible to estimate a formal [[confidence interval]], but it is possible to estimate a range of possible values the environmental disease burden may take based on different input parameters and assumptions.<ref name="kay00" /><ref name="pruss-ustun2003" /><ref name="knol09" /> When more than one definition has to be made about a certain element in the assessment, multiple analyses can be run, using different sets of definitions. [[Sensitivity analysis|Sensitivity]] and [[Decision analysis|decision analyses]] can help determine which sources of uncertainty affect the final results the most.<ref name="knol09" />

==Representative examples==

===The Netherlands===

In [[the Netherlands]], air pollution is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and exposure to certain forms of radiation can lead to the development of cancer. Quantification of the health impact of the environment was done by calculating DALYs for air pollution, noise, radon, UV, and indoor dampness for the period 1980 to 2020. In the Netherlands, 2–5% of the total disease burden in 2000 could be attributed to the effects of (short-term) exposure to air pollution, noise, radon, natural UV radiation, and [[dampness]] in houses. The percentage can increase to up to 13% due to uncertainty, assuming no threshold.

Among the investigated factors, long-term PM10 exposure have the greatest impact on [[public health]]. As levels of PM10 decrease, related disease burden is also expected to decrease. Noise exposure and its associated disease burden is likely to increase to a level where the disease burden is similar to that of traffic accidents. The rough estimates do not provide a complete picture of the environmental health burden, because data are uncertain, not all environmental-health relationships are known, not all environmental factors have been included, and it was not possible to assess all potential health effects. The effects of a number of these assumptions were evaluated in an uncertainty analysis.<ref name="knol05" />

===Canada===

Exposure to environmental hazards may cause [[chronic disease]]s, so the magnitude of their contribution to Canada's total disease burden is not well understood. In order to give an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease for four major categories of disease, the {{abbr|EAF|environmentally attributable fractions}} developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions were used.<ref name="wigmore">{{cite web|author=Wigmore, Cameron|date=2 November 2007|title=Study: Environmental burden of disease in Canada|url=https://greenparty.ca/fr/node/3079}}</ref> Results showed a total of 10,000–25,000 deaths, with 78,000–194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000–1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1–1.8 million restricted activity days for sufferers of [[asthma]]; 8000–24,000 new cases of cancer; 500–2,500 babies with low [[birth weight]]s; and [[Canadian dollar|C$]]3.6–9.1 billion in costs each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures.<ref name="wigmore" />

==Criticism==

There is no consensus on the best measures of the public’s health. This is not surprising because measurements are used to accomplish diverse functions (e.g., population health assessment, evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions, formulation of health policies, and projection of future resource need). The choice of measures may also depend on individual and societal values. Measures that only consider premature death will omit the burden of living with a disease or disability, and measures that combine both in a single measure (i.e. DALYs) need to make a judgment to the significance of these measures compared to each other. Other metrics such as economic costs will not capture pain and suffering or other broader aspects of burden.<ref>{{cite journal | issn=0033-3549 | volume=121 | issue=1 | pages=14–22 | last=Thacker | first=Stephen B |author2=Stroup, Donna F |author3=Carande-Kulis, Vilma |author4=Marks, James S |author5=Roy, Kakoli |author6= Gerberding, Julie L  | title=Measuring the Public's Health | journal=Public Health Reports | year= 2006 |pmc=1497799 | pmid=16416694 | doi=10.1177/003335490612100107}}</ref>

DALYs are a simplification of a complex reality, and therefore only give a crude indication of environmental health impact. Relying on DALYs may make donors take a narrow approach to health care programs. [[Foreign aid]] is most often directed at diseases with the highest DALYs, ignoring the fact that other diseases, despite having lower DALYs, are still major contributors to disease burden. Less-publicized diseases thus have little or no funding for health efforts. For example, maternal death (one of the top three killers in most poor countries) and pediatric respiratory and intestinal infections maintain a high disease burden, and safe pregnancy and the prevention of coughs in infants do not receive adequate funding.<ref>{{cite journal | issn=0015-7120 | issue=January/February 2007 | last=Garrett | first=Laurie | title=The Challenge of Global Health | journal=Foreign Affairs | date=1 January 2007 | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/doc/2010_GARRETT_Challenge_of_Global_Health.pdf|volume=86|pages=14–38}}</ref>
