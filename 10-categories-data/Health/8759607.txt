'''Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital''' is one of the oldest [[maternity hospital]]s in Europe, founded in 1739 in London. Until October 2000,<ref>[[Google Earth]] imagery shows the site being demolished in September 2000.</ref> it occupied a site at 339–351 [[Goldhawk Road]], [[Hammersmith]], but is now located between [[East Acton]] and [[White City, London|White City]], adjacent to the [[Hammersmith Hospital]]. It is managed by the [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust]]. Today, the hospital is very active in both maternal medicine and research.

==Facilities==
[[File:Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London in spring 2013 (4).jpg|thumb|The main entrance of the hospital.]]
The hospital has a specialist "maternal medicine" unit for London, recognising that a need existed for specialist care to be offered to pregnant women who suffered from pre-existing medical conditions, or conditions that developed during pregnancy, whose treatment might impact upon the pregnancy. The unit is known as the '''de Swiet Obstetric Medicine Centre''', and is currently housed in a small suite of rooms on the second floor of the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital.<ref>[http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/services/maternity/maternalmedicine/index.htm Maternal medcine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903112442/http://www.imperial.nhs.uk/services/maternity/maternalmedicine/index.htm|date=3 September 2014}}.</ref>

The maternal medicine unit is separated into two distinct areas: a labour ward and a birth centre.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.which.co.uk/birth-choice/maternity-units/ou-the-delivery-suite-queen-charlottes-and-chelsea-hospital|title=The Delivery Suite, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital - Which?|website=Which? Birth Choice|language=en|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> The delivery suites in the labour ward offer women a more traditional childbirth experience, while the birth centre strives to create a more "homely" environment.<ref name=":1" /> The labour ward is a much larger unit with 18 labour rooms, conducting approximately 5,700 births between April 2016 and April 2017.<ref name=":1" /> Women giving birth in this ward have access to epidurals during their birth. The birth centre is a smaller ward, with seven birthing rooms available for use. Approximately 1,030 births occurred in this centre between April 2017 and April 2018.<ref name=":1" /> In the birth centre, the primary aim is conducting a natural birth that lacks medical aid. These births take place using birth pools and do not utilize epidural shots. Infants born in both the labour ward and birth centre have access to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).<ref name=":1" />

In addition to the birth center, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital also offers a relatively new program called the "Jentle Midwifery" scheme.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jan/19/healthandwellbeing.health|title=What price for a perfect delivery?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=2006-01-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-05-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> This birth program ensures that the mother receives personalized, one-on-one care for the duration of her pregnancy, during labour, and up to four weeks after giving birth. Women who participate in this program receive care from the same midwife for the duration of their childbirth experience. The program is described as an alternative to the standard National Health Service (NHS) birthing options as well as private pay-for-treatment services.<ref name=":2" /> In the program's first year, 74 women registered for the "Jentle Midwifery" scheme, bringing in over £160,000 for the hospital.<ref name=":2" />

== Research ==
In 2016 the hospital partnered with Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriages, an organization that provides financial support for research on birth complications. This partnership established a miscarriage clinic at the hospital, which provides medical treatment for women who are participating in a research study related to miscarriages.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/172011/first-national-miscarriage-research-centre-opens/|title=First National Miscarriage Research Centre opens at Imperial {{!}} Imperial News {{!}} Imperial College London|last=London|first=Main campus address: Imperial College|last2=Campus|first2=South Kensington|website=Imperial News|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01|last3=SW7 2AZ|first3=London|last4=maps|first4=tel: +4420 7589 5111 Campus|last5=in|first5=information {{!}} About this site {{!}} This site uses cookies {{!}} Report incorrect content {{!}} Log}}</ref> The goal of this initiative is to reduce the number of miscarriages by 50% by the year 2030 through better understanding of what causes miscarriages.<ref name=":4" /> Tommy's created a pledge to research genetic causes of miscarriages, bacteria in miscarriages, and risk indicators of miscarriage during the first five years of the program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2016/04/Birmingham-Tommys-Centre-for-Miscarriage-Research.aspx|title=National Centre for Miscarriage Research officially opens|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>

These boxes, popular in Finland, are designed to stop infants from rolling onto their stomachs, which induces sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).<ref name=":5" />

Today, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital is the home of several ongoing research projects through the [[Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust|Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Trust]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fusfoundation.org/news/research-site-profile-imperial-college-healthcare-nhs-trust|title=Research Site Profile: Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust - Focused Ultrasound Foundation|website=www.fusfoundation.org|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> The hospital is one of five teaching and research hospitals in London included in the Imperial Healthcare Trust. Research projects include essential tremor thalamotomy, Parkinson's dyskinesia pallidotomy, ablation of rectal and other pelvic cancers, uterine fibroid ablation, and drug delivery for oncology.<ref name=":3" />

The hospital is accessible by public transport; the nearest bus stops are "Wulfstan Street" and "Hammersmith Hospital"; the nearest tube station is [[East Acton tube station|East Acton]] (Central Line).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.nhs.uk/our-locations/queen-charlottes-and-chelsea-hospital/find-us|title=Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital|publisher=Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>
