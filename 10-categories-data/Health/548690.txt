'''Bhaiṣajyaguru''' ({{lang-sa|भैषज्यगुरु}}, {{lang-zh|t={{linktext|藥師佛}}}}, {{lang-ja|薬師仏}}, {{lang-ko|약사불}}, {{lang-bo|སངས་རྒྱས་སྨན་བླ}}), formally '''Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-rāja''' ("Medicine Master and King of [[lapis lazuli|Lapis Lazuli]] Light"; {{lang-zh|t=藥師琉璃光(王)如來}}, {{lang-ja|薬師瑠璃光如来}}, {{lang-ko|약사유리광여래}}), is the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] of healing and medicine in [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna Buddhism]]. Commonly referred to as the "Medicine Buddha", he is described as a doctor who cures suffering (Pali/Sanskrit: [[dukkha]]/[[Saṃsāra#Samsara in Buddhism|samsara]]) using the medicine of his teachings.

Bhaiṣajyaguru's original name and title was ''rāja'' (King), but [[Xuanzang]] translated it as [[Tathāgata]] (Buddha). Subsequent translations and commentaries followed Xuanzang in describing him as a Buddha. The image of Bhaiṣajyaguru is usually expressed with a canonical Buddha-like form holding a [[gallipot]] and, in some versions, possessing blue skin. Though also considered to be a guardian of the East, in most cases [[Akshobhya]] is given that role. As an exceptional case, the [[honzon]] of [[Mount Kōya]]'s [[Kongōbu-ji|Kongōbu Temple]] was changed from Akshobhya to Bhaiṣajyaguru.<ref>[http://www.reihokan.or.jp/bunkazai/nenpyo/kondo-s.html Koya-san and Cultural assets.] Retrieved 5 October 2015.</ref>

==Origin==

Bhaiṣajyaguru is described in the eponymous ''Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-rāja Sūtra'', commonly called the ''Medicine Buddha Sutra'', as a [[bodhisattva]] who made twelve (12) great vows.  On achieving [[Buddhahood]], he became the Buddha of the eastern [[pure land]] of Vaiḍūryanirbhāsa "Pure Lapis Lazuli".<ref>{{cite book|last=Birnbaum|first=Raoul|title=The Healing Buddha|year=2003|pages=64}}</ref>  There, he is attended to by two [[bodhisattva]]s symbolizing the light of the sun and the light of the moon respectively:<ref>Oriental Medicine: an illustrated guide to the Asian arts of Healing</ref>

A Sanskrit manuscript of the ''Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-rāja Sūtra'' was among the texts attesting to the popularity of Bhaiṣajyaguru in the ancient northwest Indian kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]].<ref name="Bakshi, S.R. 1998. p. 194">Bakshi, S.R.

The Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] visited a [[Mahāsāṃghika]] monastery at [[Bamiyan]], [[Afghanistan]], in the 7th century CE, and the site of this monastery has been rediscovered by archaeologists.<ref name="Schøyen Collection: Buddhism">{{cite web|url=http://www.schoyencollection.com/buddhism.html|title=Schøyen Collection: Buddhism|accessdate=23 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610164637/http://www.schoyencollection.com/buddhism.html|archive-date=10 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Birchbark manuscript fragments from several Mahāyāna sūtras have been discovered at the site, including the ''Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaidūrya-prabha-rāja Sūtra'' (MS 2385).<ref name="Schøyen Collection: Buddhism"/>

== The Twelve Vows ==

The Twelve Vows of the Medicine Buddha upon attaining Enlightenment, according to the Medicine Buddha Sutra<ref name='sutra'>{{cite web| url = http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/medbudsutra.pdf| title = Sutra of the Medicine Buddha | accessdate = 2007-04-15| author= Ven. Hsuan Jung| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404140301/http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/medbudsutra.pdf| archive-date= 4 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> are:

1. I vow that my body shall shine as beams of brilliant light on this infinite and boundless world, showering on all beings, getting rid of their ignorance and worries with my teachings. May all beings be like me, with a perfect status and character, upright mind and soul, and finally attaining enlightenment like the Buddha.

2. I vow that my body be like crystal, pure and flawless, radiating rays of splendid light to every corner, brightening up and enlightening all beings with wisdom. With the blessings of compassion, may all beings strengthen their spiritual power and physical energy, so that they could fulfill their dreams on the right track.

3. I vow that I shall grant by means of boundless wisdom, all beings with the inexhaustible things that they require, and relieving them from all pains and guilt resulting from materialistic desires. Although clothing, food, accommodation and transport are essentials, it should be utilized wisely as well. Besides self-consumption, the remaining should be generously shared with the community so that all could live harmoniously together.

4. I vow to lead those who have gone astray back to the path of righteousness. Let them be corrected and returned to the Buddha way for enlightenment.

5. I vow that I shall enable all sentient beings to observe precepts for spiritual purity and moral conduct. Should there be any relapse or violation, they shall be guided by repentance. Provided they sincerely regret their wrong-doings, and vow for a change with constant prayers and strong faith in the Buddha, they could receive the rays of forgiveness, recover their lost moral and purity.

6. I vow that all beings who are physically disabled or sick in all aspects be blessed with good health, both physically and mentally. All who pay homage to Buddha faithfully will be blessed.

7. I vow to relieve all pain and poverty of the very sick and poor. The sick be cured, the helpless be helped, the poor be assisted.

8. I vow to help women who are undergoing sufferings and tortures and seeking for transformation into men. By hearing my name, paying homage and praying, their wishes would be granted and ultimately attain Buddhahood.

9. I vow to free all beings from evil thought and its control. I shall lead them onto the path of light through inculcating them with righteousness and honour so that they will walk the Buddha way.

10. I vow to save prisoners who have genuinely repented and victims of natural disasters. My supreme powers will bless those who are sincere and be freed from sufferings.

11. I vow to save those who suffer from starvation and those who committed a crime to obtain food. If they hear my name and faithfully cherish it, I shall lead them to the advantages of Dharma and favour them with the best food that they may eventually lead a tranquil and happy life.

12. I vow to save those who suffer from poverty, tormented by mosquitoes and wasps day and night. If they come across my name, cherish it with sincerity and practice dharma to strengthen their merits, they will be able to achieve their wishes

== Dharani and Mantra ==

In the ''Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabhā-rāja Sūtra'', the Medicine Buddha is described as having entered into a state of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]] called "Eliminating All the Suffering and Afflictions of Sentient Beings." From this samadhi state he spoke the Medicine Buddha Dharani.<ref name="sutra"/>

:''{{IAST|namo bhagavate bhaiṣajyaguru vaiḍūryaprabharājāya}}''
:''{{IAST|tathāgatāya arahate samyaksambuddhāya tadyathā:}}''
:''{{IAST|oṃ bhaiṣajye bhaiṣajye bhaiṣajya-samudgate svāhā.}}''

The last line of the dharani is used as Bhaisajyaguru's short form mantra. There are several other mantras for the Medicine Buddha as well that are used in different schools of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]].

==Iconography==
Bhaiṣajyaguru is typically depicted seated, wearing the three robes of a Buddhist monk, holding a lapis-colored jar of medicine nectar in his left hand and the right hand resting on his right knee, holding the stem of the Aruna fruit or [[Terminalia chebula|Myrobalan]] between thumb and forefinger.  In the sutra, he is also described by his aura of lapis lazuli-colored light. In Chinese depictions, he is sometimes holding a [[pagoda]], symbolising the ten thousand Buddhas of the three periods of time. He is also depicted standing on a Northern Wei stele from approximately 500 AD now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, accompanied by his two attendants, Suryaprabha and Candraprabha. Within the halo are depicted the ''Seven Bhaiṣajyaguru Buddhas'' and seven apsaras.<ref>S. C. Bosch Reitz, "Trinity of the Buddha of Healing", ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', Vol 19, No. 4 (Apr., 1924), pp. 86-91.</ref>

==Role in Chinese Buddhism==
[[Image:Pure Land of Bhaisajyaguru, Yuan Dynasty.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''The Pure Land of Bhaisajyaguru'', a wall mural made circa 1319 CE, [[Yuan dynasty]]]] 
The practice of veneration of the Medicine Buddha is also popular in China, as he is depicted as one of the three prominent Buddhas, the others being the founder [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]] and [[Amitabha]]. He can also be viewed as the healing attribute of Śākyamuni, as he is often called the "Medicine King" in sutras.  There are two popular Chinese translations of this sutra: one by Xuanzang<ref>Hsing Yun,"Sutra of the Medicine Buddha with an Introduction, Comments, and Prayers", Buddha's Light Publishing, 2005, Revised Edition, {{ISBN|1-932293-06-X}}</ref> and the other by [[I Ching (monk)|Yijing]] both translated in the [[Tang dynasty]]. The [[Taisho Tripitaka]] and [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong]] Tripitaka ({{zh|t=乾隆大藏經}}) each have three translations of the sutra:<ref>Hsing Yun 2005, p 42</ref>

# By Dharmagupta in 615 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 449; Qianlong: no. 166)
# By Xuanzang in 650 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 450; Qianlong: no. 167)
# By Yijing in 707 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 451; Qianlong: no. 168)

The version translated by Yijing includes not only the vows of the Medicine Buddha but also the vows of the Seven Past Buddhas.<ref>Chen Li Quan and Zhu Mo.

Like Tibetan Buddhists, Chinese Buddhists recite the mantra of the Medicine Buddha to overcome mental, physical and spiritual sickness. The ''Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhārāja Sūtra'', which the Medicine Buddha is associated with and described in great detail in, is a common sutra to recite in Chinese temples as well. Furthermore, much like the [[nianfo]] path of Amitabha, the name of Medicine Buddha is also recited for the benefit of being reborn in the Eastern Pure Lands, though this is deemphasized in favor of the Medicine Buddha's role for the living.

==Role in Japanese Buddhism==
[[File:Yakushi (Bhaishajaguru) by Enku (1628-95).jpg|left|thumb|Yakushi (Bhaishajaguru, The Buddha of Healing) by Enkū (1628-95). [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
Starting in the 7th century in [[Japan]], Yakushi was prayed to in the place of [[Ashuku]] (Akshobhya).  Some of Yakushi's role has been taken over by [[Jizō]] (Ksitigarbha), but Yakushi is still invoked in the traditional memorial services for the dead.

Older temples, those mostly found in the [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon]] sects, especially those around [[Kyoto]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and the [[Kinki]] region often have Yakushi as the center of devotion, unlike later Buddhist sects which focus on [[Amitabha]] Buddha or [[Kannon]] Bodhisattva almost exclusively.  Often, when Yakushi is the center of devotion in a Buddhist temple, he is flanked by the {{nihongo|[[Twelve Heavenly Generals]]|十二神将|Jūni-shinshō}}, who were twelve [[yaksha]] generals who had been converted through hearing the ''Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhārāja Sūtra'':<ref name="sutra"/>

{{quote|Wherever this sutra circulates or wherever there are sentient beings who hold fast to the name of the Medicine Buddha [Yakushi Buddha] and respectfully make offerings to him, whether in villages, towns, kingdoms or in the wilderness, we [the Twelve Generals] will all protect them.  We will release them from all suffering and calamities and see to it that all their wishes are fulfilled.}}

==Role in Tibetan Buddhism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
The practice of Medicine Buddha, the Supreme Healer (or Sangye Menla in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]) is not only a very powerful method for healing and increasing healing powers both for oneself and others, but also for overcoming the inner sickness of attachment, hatred, and ignorance, thus to [[meditate]] on the Medicine Buddha can help decrease physical and mental illness and suffering.

The Medicine Buddha mantra is held to be extremely powerful for healing of physical illnesses and purification of negative [[karma]]. One form of practice based on the Medicine Buddha is done when one is stricken by disease. The patient is to recite the long Medicine Buddha mantra 108 times over a glass of water. The water is now believed to be blessed by the power of the mantra and the blessing of the Medicine Buddha himself, and the patient is to drink the water. This practice is then repeated each day until the illness is cured.
