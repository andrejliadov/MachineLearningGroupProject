==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Location.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Abdominal aortic aneurysm location]]
The vast majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. However, as abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, they may become painful and lead to pulsating sensations in the abdomen or pain in the chest, lower back, or scrotum.<ref name="harrisons">{{cite book|last=Fauci|first=Anthony|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2008-03-06|edition=17|chapter=242|isbn=978-0-07-146633-2}}</ref>

===Complications===
The complications include rupture, peripheral [[embolization]], acute aortic occlusion, and aortocaval (between the aorta and [[inferior vena cava]]) or aortoduodenal (between the aorta and the [[duodenum]]) [[fistulae]]. On physical examination, a [[palpable]] and pulsatile abdominal mass can be noted. [[Bruit]]s can be present in case of renal or visceral arterial [[stenosis]].<ref name=emedicine/>

The signs and symptoms of a ruptured AAA may include severe pain in the lower back, flank, abdomen or groin. A mass that pulses with the heart beat may also be felt.<ref name=Spa2014/> The bleeding can lead to a [[hypovolemic shock]] with [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]]. This may lead to [[Syncope (medicine)|brief passing out]].<ref name=Spa2014/> The mortality of AAA rupture is as high as 90 percent. 65 to 75 percent of patients die before they arrive at the hospital and up to 90 percent die before they reach the operating room.<ref name=SmallAneurysmTrial>{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown LC, Powell JT | title = Risk Factors for Aneurysm Rupture in Patients Kept Under Ultrasound Surveillance | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 230 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–96; discussion 296–7 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10493476 | pmc = 1420874 | doi = 10.1097/00000658-199909000-00002 }}</ref> The bleeding can be [[wikt:retroperitoneal|retroperitoneal]] or into the [[intraperitoneal|abdominal cavity]].

==Causes==
The exact causes of the degenerative process remain unclear. There are, however, some hypotheses and well-defined [[risk factors]].<ref name="pmid25884861">{{cite journal | vauthors = Keisler B, Carter C | title = Abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 91 | issue = 8 | pages = 538–43 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25884861 }}</ref>
* Tobacco smoking: More than 90% of people who develop an AAA have [[Health effects of tobacco|smoked]] at some point in their lives.<ref name="Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT 2008 494–501">{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenhalgh RM, Powell JT | title = Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = N.

* Alcohol and hypertension: The inflammation caused by prolonged use of alcohol and hypertensive effects from abdominal edema which leads to [[hemorrhoids]], [[esophageal varices]], and other conditions, is also considered a long-term cause of AAA.
* Genetic influences: The influence of genetic factors is high. AAA is four to six times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20–30%.<ref name=siblings>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baird PA, Sadovnick AD, Yee IM, Cole CW, Cole L | title = Sibling risks of abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Lancet | volume = 346 | issue = 8975 | pages = 601–4 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 7651004 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(95)91436-6 | s2cid = 27523622 }}</ref> The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Clifton MA | title = Familial abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = Br J Surg | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 765–6 | date = Nov 1977 | pmid = 588966 | doi = 10.1002/bjs.1800641102 }}</ref> There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of [[X-linked]] [[mutation]], which would explain the lower incidence in [[heterozygous]] females. Other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated.<ref name=emedicine/> [[Connective tissue]] disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have also been strongly associated with AAA.<ref name=Treska/> Both [[relapsing polychondritis]] and [[pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.<ref name="Bolognia">{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4160-2999-1 }}</ref>
* Atherosclerosis: The AAA was long considered to be caused by [[atherosclerosis]], because the walls of the AAA frequently carry an atherosclerotic burden. However, this hypothesis cannot be used to explain the initial defect and the development of [[Vascular occlusion|occlusion]], which is observed in the process.<ref name=emedicine/>
* Other causes of the development of AAA include: [[infection]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[arteritis]], and [[cystic medial necrosis]].<!-- (m. Erdheim). --><ref name=Treska/>

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Aortadiagramgray.png|thumb|A plate from ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' with yellow lines depicting the most common infrarenal location of the AAA]]
[[File:Aortic Aneurism 76F 3D SR Nevit Dilmen.stl|thumb|3D file showing an aortic aneurysm]]
The most striking [[histopathology|histopathological]] changes of the aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the [[tunica media]] and [[intima]] layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in [[foam cells]], extracellular free [[cholesterol]] crystals, [[calcification]]s, [[thrombosis]], and [[venous ulcer|ulcerations]] and ruptures of the layers. [[Adventitial]] [[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]] is present.<ref name=Treska/>
However, the [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of the tunica media by means of a [[proteolytic]] process seems to be the basic [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] mechanism of AAA development. Some researchers report increased expression and activity of matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s in individuals with AAA. This leads to elimination of [[elastin]] from the media, rendering the aortic wall more susceptible to the influence of [[blood pressure]].<ref name=emedicine/> Other reports have suggested the [[serine protease]] [[granzyme B]] may contribute to aortic aneurysm rupture through the cleavage of [[decorin]], leading to disrupted [[collagen]] organization and reduced tensile strength of the adventitia.<ref name="pmid20035050">{{cite journal |vauthors=Chamberlain CM, Ang LS, Boivin WA, Cooper DM, Williams SJ, Zhao H, Hendel A, Folkesson M, Swedenborg J, Allard MF, McManus BM, Granville DJ | title = Perforin-independent extracellular granzyme B activity contributes to abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Am.

[[Hemodynamics]] affect the development of AAA, which has a [[wikt:predilection|predilection]] for the [[wikt:infrarenal|infrarenal]] aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta differ from those of the [[thoracic aorta]]. The diameter decreases from the root to the [[aortic bifurcation]], and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of [[elastin]]. The mechanical [[muscle tension|tension]] in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall. The [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[wikt:distensibility|distensibility]] also decline with age, which can result in gradual [[wikt:dilatation|dilatation]] of the segment. Higher [[intraluminal]] pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process.<ref name=Treska/> Suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA's development.<ref name="Biasetti">{{cite journal |vauthors=Biasetti J, Hussain F, Gasser TC | title = Blood flow and coherent vortices in the normal and aneurysmatic aortas: a fluid dynamical approach to intra-luminal thrombus formation | journal = J R Soc Interface | volume = 8 | issue = 63 | pages = 1449–61 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21471188 | pmc = 3163425 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2011.0041 }}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually diagnosed by [[physical exam]], [[abdominal ultrasound]], or [[CT scan]]. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the outline of an aneurysm when its walls are calcified. However, the outline will be visible on Xray in less than half of all aneurysms. Ultrasonography is used to screen for aneurysms and to determine the size of any present. Additionally, free peritoneal fluid can be detected. It is noninvasive and sensitive, but the presence of bowel gas or obesity may limit its usefulness. CT scan has a nearly 100% sensitivity for an aneurysm and is also useful in preoperative planning, detailing the anatomy and possibility for endovascular repair. In the case of suspected rupture, it can also reliably detect retroperitoneal fluid. Alternative less often used methods for visualization of an aneurysm include [[MRI]] and [[angiography]].

An aneurysm ruptures if the mechanical stress (tension per area) exceeds the local wall strength; consequently, peak wall stress (PWS)<ref name="Fillinger_2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fillinger MF, Marra SP, Raghavan ML, Kennedy FE | title = Prediction of rupture risk in abdominal aortic aneurysm during observation: wall stress versus diameter | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 724–32 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12663969 | doi = 10.1067/mva.2003.213 }}</ref> and peak wall rupture risk (PWRR)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gasser TC, Auer M, Labruto F, Swedenborg J, Roy J | title = Biomechanical rupture risk assessment of abdominal aortic aneurysms: model complexity versus predictability of finite element simulations | journal = Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 176–185 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20447844 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejvs.2010.04.003 }}</ref> have been found to be more reliable parameters than diameter to assess AAA rupture risk.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly divided according to their size and symptomatology. An aneurysm is usually defined as an outer aortic diameter over 3&nbsp;cm (normal diameter of the [[aorta]] is around 2&nbsp;cm),<ref name=ACC2005/> or more than 50% of normal diameter.<ref name="SolomonKent2014">{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=Caren G.|last2=Kent|first2=K.

Ruptured AAA should be suspected in any older (age >60) person with collapse, unexplained low blood pressure, or sudden-onset back or abdominal pain. Abdominal pain, shock, and a pulsatile mass is only present in a minority of cases. Although an unstable person with a known aneurysm may undergo surgery without further imaging, the diagnosis will usually be confirmed using CT or ultrasound scanning.

The suprarenal aorta normally measures about 0.5&nbsp;cm larger than the infrarenal aorta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm|title=Clinical features and diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm|author=Jeffrey Jim, Robert W Thompson|website=[[UpToDate]]|date=2018-03-05|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212246/https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm|archive-date=2018-03-30}}</ref>

==Prevention==
*[[Smoking cessation]]

==Screening==
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends a single screening [[abdominal ultrasound]] for abdominal aortic aneurysm in males age 65 to 75 years who have a history of smoking.<ref name=USPSTF2019>{{cite journal |last1=US Preventive Services Task |first1=Force. |last2=Owens |first2=DK |last3=Davidson |first3=KW |last4=Krist |first4=AH |last5=Barry |first5=MJ |last6=Cabana |first6=M |last7=Caughey |first7=AB |last8=Doubeni |first8=CA |last9=Epling JW |first9=Jr |last10=Kubik |first10=M |last11=Landefeld |first11=CS |last12=Mangione |first12=CM |last13=Pbert |first13=L |last14=Silverstein |first14=M |last15=Simon |first15=MA |last16=Tseng |first16=CW |last17=Wong |first17=JB |title=Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement. |journal=JAMA |date=10 December 2019 |volume=322 |issue=22 |pages=2211–2218 |doi=10.1001/jama.2019.18928 |pmid=31821437|doi-access=free }}</ref> Among this group who does not smoke screening may be selective.<ref name=USPSTF2019/> It is unclear if screening is useful in women who have smoked and the USPSTF recommend against screening in women who have never smoked.<ref name=USP2014/><ref name=Ali2016>{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=MU|last2=Fitzpatrick-Lewis|first2=D|last3=Miller|first3=J|last4=Warren|first4=R|last5=Kenny|first5=M|last6=Sherifali|first6=D|last7=Raina|first7=P|title=Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in asymptomatic adults.|journal=Journal of Vascular Surgery|date=December 2016|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1855–1868|doi=10.1016/j.jvs.2016.05.101|pmid=27871502|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom the NHS AAA Screening Programme invites men in England for screening during the year they turn 65.

==Management==
The treatment options for asymptomatic AAA are [[wikt:conservative treatment|conservative]] management, surveillance with a view to eventual repair, and immediate repair. Two modes of repair are available for an AAA: [[Open aortic surgery|open aneurysm repair]], and endovascular aneurysm repair ([[EVAR]]). An intervention is often recommended if the aneurysm grows more than 1&nbsp;cm per year or it is bigger than 5.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Ulug|first=Pinar|last2=Powell|first2=Janet T.|last3=Martinez|first3=Melissa Ashley-Marie|last4=Ballard|first4=David J.|last5=Filardo|first5=Giovanni|date=1 July 2020|title=Surgery for small asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609382|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|pages=CD001835|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001835.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmc=7389114|pmid=32609382}}</ref> Repair is also indicated for symptomatic aneurysms.

===Conservative===
Conservative management is indicated in people where repair carries a high risk of mortality and in patients where repair is unlikely to improve life expectancy. The mainstay of the conservative treatment is [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] cessation.

Surveillance is indicated in small asymptomatic aneurysms (less than 5.5&nbsp;cm) where the risk of repair exceeds the risk of rupture.<ref name=":0" /> As an AAA grows in diameter, the risk of rupture increases. Surveillance until an aneurysm has reached a diameter of 5.5&nbsp;cm has not been shown to have a higher risk as compared to early intervention.<ref name=SmallAneurysm>{{cite journal |vauthors=Powell JT, Brown LC, Forbes JF, Fowkes FG, Greenhalgh RM, Ruckley CV, Thompson SG | title = Final 12-year follow-up of surgery versus surveillance in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial | journal = Br J Surg | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 702–8 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17514693 | doi = 10.1002/bjs.5778 }}</ref><ref name=ADAM>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederle FA, Wilson SE, Johnson GR, Reinke DB, Littooy FN, Acher CW, Ballard DJ, Messina LM, Gordon IL, Chute EP, Krupski WC, Busuttil SJ, Barone GW, Sparks S, Graham LM, Rapp JH, Makaroun MS, Moneta GL, Cambria RA, Makhoul RG, Eton D, Ansel HJ, Freischlag JA, Bandyk D | title = Immediate repair compared with surveillance of small abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = 19 | pages = 1437–44 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12000813 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa012573 }}</ref>

===Surgery===
The threshold for repair varies slightly from individual to individual, depending on the balance of risks and benefits when considering repair versus ongoing surveillance. The size of an individual's native aorta may influence this, along with the presence of comorbidities that increase operative risk or decrease life expectancy. Evidence, however, does not usually support repair if the size is less than 5.5&nbsp;cm.<ref name=":0" />

====Open repair====
{{Main|Open aortic surgery}}
Open repair is indicated in young patients as an elective procedure, or in growing or large, symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. The aorta must be clamped off during the repair, denying blood to the abdominal organs and sections of the [[spinal cord]]; this can cause a range of complications. It is essential to make the critical part of the operation fast, so the incision is typically made large enough to facilitate the fastest repair. Recovery after open AAA surgery takes significant time. The minimums are a few days in intensive care, a week total in the hospital and a few months before full recovery.

====Endovascular repair====
[[File:Endovasc.jpg|thumb|Abdominal aortic endoprosthesis, CT scan, original aneurysm marked in blue]]
{{Main|Endovascular aneurysm repair}}
Endovascular repair first became practical in the 1990s and although it is now an established alternative to open repair, its role is yet to be clearly defined. It is generally indicated in older, high-risk patients or patients unfit for open repair. However, endovascular repair is feasible for only a proportion of AAAs, depending on the morphology of the aneurysm. The main advantages over open repair are that there is less peri-operative mortality, less time in [[intensive care]], less time in hospital overall and earlier return to normal activity. Disadvantages of endovascular repair include a requirement for more frequent ongoing hospital reviews, and a higher chance of further procedures being required. According to the latest studies, the EVAR procedure does not offer any benefit for overall survival or health-related [[quality of life]] compared to open surgery, although aneurysm-related mortality is lower.<ref name=pmid16782510>{{cite journal | author = Rutherford RB | title = Randomized EVAR trials and advent of level i evidence: a paradigm shift in management of large abdominal aortic aneurysms? | journal = Semin Vasc Surg | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–74 | date = Jun 2006 | pmid = 16782510 | doi = 10.1053/j.semvascsurg.2006.03.001 }}</ref><ref name=pmid17502634>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lederle FA, Kane RL, MacDonald R, Wilt TJ | title = Systematic review: repair of unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 146 | issue = 10 | pages = 735–41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17502634 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-146-10-200705150-00007 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=EVAR1>{{cite journal | author = Evar Trial Participants | title = Endovascular aneurysm repair versus open repair in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 1): randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9478 | pages = 2179–86 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15978925 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66627-5 | s2cid = 54288202 }}</ref><ref name=DREAM>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blankensteijn JD, de Jong SE, Prinssen M, van der Ham AC, Buth J, van Sterkenburg SM, Verhagen HJ, Buskens E, Grobbee DE | title = Two-year outcomes after conventional or endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 352 | issue = 23 | pages = 2398–405 | date = Jun 2005 | pmid = 15944424 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa051255 | hdl = 1874/14151 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> In patients unfit for open repair, EVAR plus conservative management was associated with no benefit, more complications, subsequent procedures and higher costs compared to conservative management alone.<ref name=EVAR2>{{cite journal | author = Evar Trial Participants | title = Endovascular aneurysm repair and outcome in patients unfit for open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR trial 2): randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9478 | pages = 2187–92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15978926 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66628-7 | s2cid = 26174408 }}</ref> Endovascular treatment for paraanastomotic aneurysms after aortobiiliac reconstruction is also a possibility.<ref name="doi:10.1590/S1677-54492008000300016">{{cite journal |vauthors=Amato AC, Kahlberg AK, Bertoglio LB, Melissano GM, Chiesa RC |title=Endovascular treatment of a triple paraanastomotic aneurysm after aortobiiliac reconstruction |journal=Jornal Vascular Brasileiro|volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |doi=10.1590/S1677-54492008000300016 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A 2017 [[Cochrane review]] found tentative evidence of no difference in outcomes between endovascular and open repair of ruptured AAA in the first month.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badger|first1=S|last2=Forster|first2=R|last3=Blair|first3=PH|last4=Ellis|first4=P|last5=Kee|first5=F|last6=Harkin|first6=DW|title=Endovascular treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=26 May 2017|volume=5|pages=CD005261|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005261.pub4|pmid=28548204|pmc=6481849}}</ref>

===Rupture===
In those with [[aortic rupture]] of the AAA, treatment is immediate surgical repair.

Although the current standard of determining rupture risk is based on maximum diameter, it is known that smaller AAAs that fall below this threshold (diameter<5.5&nbsp;cm) may also rupture, and larger AAAs (diameter>5.5&nbsp;cm) may remain stable.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Darling RC, Messina CR, Brewster DC, Ottinger LW | title = Autopsy study of unoperated abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Alternative methods of rupture assessment have been recently reported. The majority of these approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions have been shown to correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Webster MW | title = Mechanical wall stress in abdominal aortic aneurysm: influence of diameter and asymmetry | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 632–9 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9576075 | doi = 10.1016/S0741-5214(98)70227-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sacks MS, Vorp DA, Raghavan ML, Federle MP, Webster MW | title = In vivo three-dimensional surface geometry of abdominal aortic aneurysms | journal = Annals of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 469–79 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10468231 | doi = 10.1114/1.202 | s2cid = 21394944 }}</ref><ref name="Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, et al. 2009 443–54">{{cite journal |vauthors=Doyle BJ, Callanan A, Burke PE, Grace PA, Walsh MT, Vorp DA, McGloughlin TM | title = Vessel Asymmetry as an Additional Diagnostic Tool in the Assessment of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms | journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | pages = 443–54 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19028061 | pmc = 2666821 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2008.08.064 }}</ref> It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength.

==History==
The first historical records about AAA are from [[Ancient Rome]] in the 2nd century AD, when Greek surgeon [[Antyllus]] tried to treat the AAA with [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], central [[Surgical incision|incision]] and removal of [[thrombosis|thrombotic]] material from the [[aneurysm]].
However, attempts to treat the AAA surgically were unsuccessful until 1923. In that year, [[Rudolph Matas]] (who also proposed the concept of endoaneurysmorrhaphy), performed the first successful aortic ligation on a human.<ref name=livesay>{{cite journal |vauthors=Livesay JJ, Messner GN, Vaughn WK | title = Milestones in Treatment of Aortic Aneurysm: Denton A.

Endovascular aneurysm repair was first performed in the late 1980s and has been widely adopted in the subsequent decades. Endovascular repair was first used for treating a ruptured aneurysm in Nottingham in 1994.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yusuf SW, Whitaker SC, Chuter TA, Wenham PW, Hopkinson BR | title = Emergency endovascular repair of leaking aortic aneurysm | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8937 | page = 1645 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7984027 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90443-X | s2cid = 45648419 }}</ref>

==Society and culture==

Theoretical physicist [[Albert Einstein]] was operated on for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in 1949 by [[Rudolph Nissen]], who wrapped the aorta with polyethene [[cellophane]]. Einstein's aneurysm ruptured on April 13, 1955. He declined surgery, saying, "I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly." He died five days later at age 76.<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 Famous Patients, Famous Operations, 2002&nbsp;— Part 3: The Case of the Scientist with a Pulsating Mass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708043220/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/436253 |date=2009-07-08 }} from Medscape Surgery</ref>

==Research==

===Risk assessment===
There have been many calls for alternative approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a valuable tool to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. ''In vivo'', AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Raghavan ML, Kratzberg J, Castro de Tolosa EM, Hanaoka MM, Walker P, da Silva ES | title = Regional distribution of wall thickness and failure properties of human abdominal aortic aneurysm | journal = J.

===Prevention and treatment===
An animal study showed that removing a single protein prevents early damage in blood vessels from triggering a later-stage, complications. By eliminating the gene for a signaling protein called cyclophilin A (CypA) from a strain of mice, researchers were able to provide complete protection against abdominal aortic aneurysm.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Study establishes major new treatment target in diseased arteries |date=May 10, 2009 |magazine=U.S. News & World Report |url=http://www.physorg.com/news161183060.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606091215/http://www.physorg.com/news161183060.html |archive-date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>
