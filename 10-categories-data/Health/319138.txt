[[File:Brie 01.jpg|thumb|right|Cheese, like this [[Brie de Meaux]], is high in saturated fats, and is a popular food in [[French cuisine]].]]

The '''French paradox'''  is a catchphrase first used in the late 1980s, that summarizes the apparently paradoxical [[epidemiological]] observation that French people have a relatively low [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[coronary heart disease]] (CHD), while having a diet relatively rich in [[saturated fat]]s,<ref name="ferrieres">{{cite journal | author = Ferrieres, J. | year = 2004 | title = The French Paradox; Lessons for other countries | journal = Heart | volume = 90 | pages = 107–111 | doi = 10.1136/heart.90.1.107 | pmid = 14676260 | issue = 1 | pmc = 1768013}}</ref> in apparent contradiction to the [[Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease|widely held belief that the high consumption of such fats is a risk factor for CHD]].  The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower.

It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in part by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in part by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier.<ref name="Law & Wald">{{cite journal |author1=Law, M.  |author2=Wald, N. | year = 1999 | title = Why heart disease mortality is low in France: the time lag explanation | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 318 | pages = 1471–1480 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.318.7196.1471 |pmid=10346778 | issue = 7196| pmc = 1115846 }}</ref> Nevertheless the French diet may be considered to be a type of [[Mediterranean diet]] which has fairly well established benefits.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/the-french-paradox-turned-out-to-be-an-illusion-but-it-led-to-some-interesting-research-a7839086.html The Independent: The 'French paradox' turned out to be an illusion, but it led to some interesting research</ref>

==Identifying and quantifying the French paradox==
The term "French Paradox" was first used in ''The Letter'', the newsletter of the [[International Organisation of Vine and Wine]], in 1986. In 1989, theatre Professor George Riley Kernodle of the [[University of Arkansas]] used the term in a chapter in his book ''Theatre In History'', later republished as a separate academic paper.<ref>{{cite book |author=George Riley Kernodle |title=Theatre In History |publisher=[[University of Arkansas]] Press |date=December 1, 1989 |isbn=978-1557280121 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/theatreinhistory0000kern }}</ref>

In 1991, Serge Renaud, a scientist from [[Bordeaux University]], France—considered today the father of the phrase—presented the results of his scientific study into the term and actual scientific data behind the perception of the phrase.<ref name=LancetSimini>{{cite journal | title = Serge Renaud: from French paradox to Cretan miracle | journal = The Lancet | volume = 355 | issue = 9197 | pages = 48 | author = B. Simini | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71990-5 | year = 2000 | pmid=10615898 | s2cid = 8142036 }}</ref> This was followed by a public documentary broadcast on the American [[CBS News]] television channel, ''[[60 Minutes]]''.

Renaud's observations regarding the apparent disconnect between French patterns of high saturated fat consumption and their low rates of cardiovascular disease can be quantified using data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.<ref>[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/servlet/XteServlet3?Areas=68&Areas=231&Items=2941&Items=2740&Items=2741&Items=2901&Items=2733&Elements=684&Years=2002&Format=Table&Xaxis=Years&Yaxis=Countries&Aggregate=&Calculate=&Domain=FS&ItemTypes=FS.NonPrimaryLivestockAndProducts&language=EN FAOSTAT] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}} In 2002, the average French person consumed 108&nbsp;grams per day of fat from animal sources, while the average American consumed only 72 grams. The French eat four times as much butter, 60 percent more cheese and nearly three times as much pork. Although the French consume only slightly more total fat (171 g/d vs 157 g/d), they consume much more saturated fat because Americans consume a much larger proportion of fat in the form of vegetable oil, with most of that being soybean oil.<ref>[http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/servlet/XteServlet3?Areas=68&Areas=231&Items=2571&Items=2573&Items=2914&Elements=684&Years=2002&Format=Table&Xaxis=Years&Yaxis=Countries&Aggregate=&Calculate=&Domain=FS&ItemTypes=FS.CropsAndProducts&language=EN FAOSTAT] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> However, according to data from the [[British Heart Foundation]],<ref>[http://www.heartstats.org/datapage.asp?id=744ytfytfy Tab 3.5 RSD web08: Age-standardised rate of finished consultant episodes for operations for CHD by sex and local authority, all ages and under 75 years, 2001/06, England (Table)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204082418/http://www.heartstats.org/datapage.asp?id=744ytfytfy |date=4 February 2009 }}</ref> in 1999, rates of death from [[coronary heart disease]] among males aged 35–74 years were 115 per 100,000 people in the U.S. but only 83 per 100,000 in France.

In 1991, Renaud extended his studies in partnership with then junior researchers, [[cardiologist]] Michel de Lorgeril and [[dietician]] Patricia Salen. The three enhanced Renaud's study, with their paper concluding that: a diet based on southwestern [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; which is high in [[omega-3]] oils, antioxidants and includes "moderate consumption" of [[red wine]]; created lower cases of [[cancer]], [[myocardial infarction]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]; partly through increasing HDL cholesterol whilst reducing LDL cholesterol.<ref name=LancetSimini/>

== Statistical illusion hypothesis ==
In 1999, Malcolm Law and Nicholas Wald published a study in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'',<ref name="Law & Wald" />  using data from a 1994 study of alcohol and diet to explain how the French paradox might actually be an illusion, caused by two statistical distortions.

First, Law and Wald attributed about 20% of the difference in the observed rates of CHD between France and the United Kingdom to the [[under-certification]] of CHD in France, relative to the UK.

Second, Law and Wald presented a time-lag hypothesis: if there were a delay in serum cholesterol concentrations increasing and a subsequent increase in [[ischaemic heart disease]] mortality, then the current rate of mortality from CHD is more likely to be linked to past levels of serum cholesterol and fat consumption than to current serum cholesterol levels and patterns of fat consumption. They wrote,

<blockquote>We propose that the difference is due to the time lag between increases in consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations and the resulting increase in mortality from heart disease—similar to the recognised time lag between smoking and lung cancer. Consumption of animal fat and serum cholesterol concentrations increased only recently in France but did so decades ago in Britain.

Evidence supports this explanation: mortality from heart disease across countries, including France, correlates strongly with levels of animal fat consumption and serum cholesterol in the past (30 years ago)....</blockquote>

In addition, the French population has become increasingly overweight. A study published by the [[French Institute of Health and Medical Research]] (INSERM) revealed an increase in obesity from 8.5% in 1997 to 14.5% in 2009, with women showing a greater tendency toward obesity than men.<ref>{{cite news |title= Nestlé Bringing American-Style Diet Plans to Europe |author=Matthew Saltmarsh |date=7 March 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/business/global/08diet.html }}</ref>

==Impact==

===Cultural impact===
The overall impact of the popular perception, in the English-speaking world, that the French paradox is a real phenomenon, has been to give added credibility to health claims associated with specific French dietary practices.

This was seen most dramatically when, in 1991, an early account of the then-novel concept of the French paradox was aired in the United States on ''[[60 Minutes]].'' The broadcast left the impression    that France's high levels of red wine consumption accounted for much of the country's lower incidence of cardiac disease. Within a year, the consumption of [[red wine]] in the United States had increased by 40%<ref>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Rod | title = Alcohol: A History | publisher = University of North Carolina Press Books | year = 2014 | pages = 517 | isbn = 978-1-4696-1760-2}}</ref> and some wine sellers began promoting their products as "[[health food]]."<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-11-06/news/1992311065_1_french-paradox-alcohol-red-wine]</ref>

The cultural impact of the French paradox can be seen in the large number of book titles in the diet-and-health field which purport to give the reader access to the secrets behind the paradox: 
*''The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss'' (William Clower, 2003);
*''The French Don't Diet Plan: 10 Simple Steps to Stay Thin for Life'' (William Clower, 2006)
*''French Women Don't Get Fat'' (Mireille Guiliano, 2004, which became a #1 best-seller in 2006)
*''Cholesterol and The French Paradox'' (Frank Cooper, 2009);
*''The French Women Don't Get Fat Cookbook'' (Mireille Guiliano, 2010).

Other books sought to boost their credibility by reference to the French paradox.  The American edition of ''[[Dukan Diet|The Dukan Diet]]'', written by Pierre Dukan, a Paris-based doctor, is marketed with the subtitle, “The real reason the French stay thin.”

===Scientific impact===
The existence of the French paradox has caused some researchers to speculate that the link between dietary consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease might not be as strong as had previously been imagined. This has resulted in a review of the earlier studies which had suggested this link.

Some researchers have thrown into question the entire claimed connection between natural saturated fat consumption and cardiovascular disease. In 2006 this view received some indirect support from the results of the [[Nurses' Health Study]] run by the [[Women's Health Initiative]]. After accumulating approximately 8 years of data on the diet and health of 49,000 post-menopausal American women, the researchers found that the balance of saturated versus unsaturated fats did not appear to affect heart disease risk, whereas the consumption of [[trans fat]] was associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Couzin, Jennifer | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/311/5762/755 | title = Women's Health: Study Yields Murky Signals on Low-Fat Diets and Disease | journal = Science | year = 2006 | volume = 311 | issue = 5762 | pmid = 16469884 | pages = 755 | doi = 10.1126/science.311.5762.755| s2cid = 36484516 }}</ref>

Similarly, the authors of a 2009 review of dietary studies concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a causal link between consumption of saturated fats and coronary heart disease risk.<ref>{{cite journal | title = A Systematic Review of the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link Between Dietary Factors and Coronary Heart Disease |author1=Andrew Mente |author2=Lawrence de Koning |author3=Harry S.

==Possible explanations==

===Explanations based on the high per capita consumption of red wine in France===
It has been suggested that France's high [[red wine]] consumption is a primary factor in the trend. This hypothesis was expounded in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' broadcast in 1991.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4750380n The French Paradox], ''CBS News'', 23 January 2009</ref> The program catalysed a large increase in North American demand for red wines from around the world. It is believed that one of the components of red wine potentially related to this effect is [[resveratrol]];<ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081126122203.htm Potentially Universal Mechanism Of Aging Identified], ''ScienceDaily'', 27 November 2008</ref>  however, the authors of a 2003 study concluded that the amount of resveratrol absorbed by drinkers of red wine is small enough that it is unlikely to explain the paradox.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0009-9120(02)00397-1 |title=Absorption of three wine-related polyphenols in three different matrices by healthy subjects |year=2003 |last1=Goldberg |first1=David M. |last2=Yan |first2=Joseph |last3=Soleas |first3=George J. |journal=Clinical Biochemistry |volume=36 |pages=79–87 |pmid=12554065 |issue=1}}</ref>

====Alcohol in wine====
{{Main|Alcohol and cardiovascular disease}}

Research suggests that moderate drinkers are less likely to suffer [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s than are abstainers or heavy drinkers (see [[alcohol and cardiovascular disease]] for details). Therefore, the alcohol in wine might be a factor in the French paradox.

However, the difference between U.S. annual ''per capita'' alcohol consumption (9.2 litres per year)<ref>WHO [https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/usa.pdf report on alcohol consumption in the United States of America]</ref> and French consumption (12.2 litres per year) is only 3 litres per year more.<ref>WHO [https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/profiles/fra.pdf report on alcohol consumption in France]</ref>

There is a lack of medical consensus about whether moderate consumption of beer, wine, or distilled spirits has a stronger association with longevity. Of ten major studies, three found stronger evidence for wine, three for beer, three for liquor, and one study found no difference between alcoholic beverages.<ref>{{cite book | last = Edell | first = D. | title = Eat, Drink and be Merry: America's Doctor Tells You Why the Health Experts are Wrong | url = https://archive.org/details/eatdrinkbemerrya00edel | url-access = registration | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/eatdrinkbemerrya00edel/page/191 191–192] | isbn = 978-0-06-019155-9}}</ref>

====Resveratrol====
{{Main|Resveratrol}}

Wines, particularly red wines, are a source of low levels of [[resveratrol]]. However, there is no [[evidence-based medicine|high-quality evidence]] that resveratrol improves [[longevity|lifespan]] or has an effect on any human disease.<ref name="pmid25885871">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sahebkar A, Serban C, Ursoniu S, Wong ND, Muntner P, Graham IM, Mikhailidis DP, Rizzo M, Rysz J, Sperling LS, Lip GY, Banach M | title = Lack of efficacy of resveratrol on C-reactive protein and selected cardiovascular risk factors--Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = Int.

====Polyphenols====

=== Explanations based on aspects of the French diet===

====The French diet is rich in short-chain saturated fatty acids and poor in trans fats====
The French diet is based on natural [[saturated fats]] such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon [[butyric acid]] to the 16-carbon [[palmitic acid]]. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids.  In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of [[trans fats]] which may have associated health risks.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hu | first = FB |author2=van Dam RM |author3=Liu S.Hu FB |author4=van Dam RM |author5=Liu S

====Explanations relying on multiple factors====
In his 2003 book, ''The Fat Fallacy: The French Diet Secrets to Permanent Weight Loss'', Will Clower suggests the French paradox may be narrowed down to a few key factors, namely:
* Good fats versus bad fats — French people get up to 80% of their fat intake from dairy and vegetable sources, including [[whole milk]], cheeses, and whole milk [[yogurt]].
* Higher quantities of fish (at least three times a week).
* Smaller portions, eaten more slowly and divided among courses that let the body begin to digest food already consumed before more food is added.
* Lower sugar intake — American low-fat and no-fat foods often contain high concentrations of sugar. French diets avoid these products preferring full-fat versions without [[added sugar]].
* Low incidence of snacks between meals.
* Avoidance of common American food items, such as soda, deep-fried foods, snack foods, and especially prepared foods which can typically make up a large percentage of the foods found in American grocery stores.

Clower tends to downplay the common beliefs that wine consumption and smoking are greatly responsible for the French paradox. While a higher percentage of French people smoke, this is not greatly higher than the U.S. (35% in France vs. 25% in U.S.) and is unlikely to account for the weight difference between countries.

[[Mireille Guiliano]], author of the 2006 bestseller ''French Women Don't Get Fat'',<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E3D71530F93AA35757C0A9609C8B63 Paperback best sellers], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 April 2006</ref> agrees that the weight differences are not due to French smoking habits.  She points out that the smoking rates for women in France and the U.S. are virtually identical.<ref name=mireilleguiliano>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080124145431/http://www.mireilleguiliano.com/qanda.htm Archive.org]</ref> Guiliano explains the key factors to the French woman's ability to stay slim as:
* Smaller portion sizes: - she advocates the 50% rule, i.e. asking for half of whatever food one is offered, "la moitié, s'il vous plaît" in French [http://frenchwomendontgetfat.com/french_phrases/L]
* Savoring food to increase the feeling of satisfaction, choosing a small amount of high quality food rather than larger amounts of low quality food
* Eating 3 meals a day and not snacking
* Taking in plenty of liquid such as water, herbal tea and soup
* Sitting down and eating mindfully (no multitasking and eating while standing up, watching TV, or reading)
* Emphasizing freshness, variety, balance, and, above all, pleasure<ref name=mireilleguiliano/>

==== Whole diet ====
In his 2008 book ''[[In Defense of Food]]'', [[Michael Pollan]] suggests the explanation is not any single nutrient, but the combination of nutrients found in unprocessed food; not any one nutrient, nor the amount of carbohydrates or fats or proteins, but the whole length and breadth of nutrients found in "natural" foods as opposed to "processed" foods.<ref>Pollan, Michael ''In Defense of Food''. Penguin Press, 2008.</ref>

==== Higher fruit and vegetable intake ====
It has been suggested that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables in the diet may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=23736950|year=2013|last1=Hartley|first1=L|title=Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=6|pages=CD009874|last2=Igbinedion|first2=E|last3=Holmes|first3=J|last4=Flowers|first4=N|last5=Thorogood|first5=M|last6=Clarke|first6=A|last7=Stranges|first7=S|last8=Hooper|first8=L|last9=Rees|first9=K|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009874.pub2|pmc=4176664}}</ref>

==== Early life nutrition ====
One proposed explanation of the French paradox regards possible effects ([[epigenetic]] or otherwise) of dietary improvements in the first months and years of life, exerted across multiple generations. Following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871, the French government introduced an aggressive nutritional program providing high quality foods to pregnant women and young children with the aim of fortifying future generations of soldiers (the program was implemented about three decades prior to an analogous initiative in England in response to the [[Boer War]]). It has been suggested that the particular timing of this historical intervention  might help explain the relatively low rates of obesity and heart disease found in France.<ref name=Newnham2009>{{cite journal |last=Newnham|first=JP|author2=Pennell, CE|author3= Lye, SJ|author4= Rampono, J|author5= Challis, JR|title=Early life origins of obesity|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America|date=June 2009|volume=36|issue=2|pages=227–44, xii|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2009.03.004|pmid=19501311}}</ref>
