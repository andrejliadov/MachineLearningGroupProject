{{Advanced Placement}}
'''Advanced Placement [[History of the United States|United States History]]''' (also known as '''AP U.S. History''' or '''APUSH''') is a college-level course and examination offered by [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]].

==The Course==

The AP U.S. History course is designed to provide the same level of content and instruction that students would face in a freshman-level college survey class. AP U.S. History classes generally use a college-level textbook as the foundation for the course.

===Conservative criticism===
[[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] have criticized the course framework for downplaying [[American exceptionalism]] and failing to foster patriotism.  In 2015, a bill to replace the course framework was passed by the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]]’ Education Committee, but later withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ap-us-history-controversy-becomes-a-debate-on-america-115381.html|title=AP U.S. History controversy becomes a debate on America -|last=Lerner|first=Adam B.|date=21 February 2015|work=[[Politico]]|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/23/oklahoma-legislature-targets-ap-us-history-framework-being-negative |title=Oklahoma Board of Education targets US History course for being "negative"}}</ref>  The course framework was revised in 2015 in response to the criticism. In 2014, [[2014 Jefferson County Public Schools protests|student protests]] in Colorado were held over plans by the [[Jefferson County Public Schools (Colorado)|Jefferson County Public Schools district]] board to revise the AP US History curriculum to emphasize citizenship, patriotism, and respect for authority.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hundreds of Colorado students stage protest over history curriculum |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/denver-students-walkout-protest-history-school-board |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News & Media Limited |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref>

==Exam==
The AP U.S. History exam lasts 3 hours and 15 minutes and consists of two sections; additionally, each section is divided into two parts.  Section I, part A includes 55 multiple choice questions with each question containing four choices. The multiple choice questions cover American History from [[Pre-Columbian era|just before European contact with Native Americans]] to the present day. Questions are presented in sets of two to five questions organized around a primary source or an image (including, but not limited to, maps and [[political cartoon]]<nowiki/>s). Section I, part B includes three short-answer questions. The first two questions are required, but students choose between the third and fourth questions. In total, students are given 95 minutes (55 for the multiple choice section and 40 for three short-answer questions) to complete section I.

Section II of the exam is the free-response section, in which examinees write two [[essay]]s. Section II, part A, is a [[document-based question]] (DBQ), which provides an essay prompt and seven short primary sources or excerpts related to the prompt. Students are expected to write an essay responding to the prompt in which they utilize the sources in addition to outside information. Section II, part B, provides three thematic essay prompts. Students must respond to only one of the three essay prompts. (In 2020, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]], the AP exams were administered remotely as drastically shortened open-note exams. The AP US History exam consisted of a single modified DBQ essay.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-22|title=AP Exam Schedule 2020 – AP Coronavirus Updates {{!}} College Board|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422142127/https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/students/taking-ap-exams/ap-exam-schedule|access-date=2020-12-15|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>)

Each long essay question on the AP exam may address any one of three possible historical reasoning processes: patterns of continuity and change, comparison, or causation. Each of the essay questions will address the same historical reasoning process. There is a fifteen-minute reading period for students to read the essay prompts, take notes, and brainstorm, but students may begin to write the essays before this period ends. Students will then have 85 minutes to write the two essays; 45 minutes are recommended for the DBQ and 40 minutes for the long essay, but students are free to work on the two essays as they see fit.<ref name="Exam">{{cite web |url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-us-history-course-and-exam-description.pdf |title=AP US History: Course and Exam Description |publisher=CollegeBoard |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}</ref>

In May 2011, the AP U.S. History Test was taken by 402,947 students worldwide,<ref name="2011 Scores">{{cite web |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/2011_US_History_Score_Dist.pdf |title=AP United States History Student Score Distributions Global AP Exams - May 2011 |year=2011 |accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> making it second in terms of number of examinees, behind the AP English Language and Composition exam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|title=AP Data – Archived Data 2011|accessdate=9 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401102514/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_sum/2011.html|archive-date=2013-04-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Scoring==
The AP U.S. History exam is divided into two sections. Section one consists of the multiple choice and short answer questions, while section two consists of the document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question. Section one is worth 60% of the total AP exam score, with 40% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the multiple choice section and 20% of the total exam score derived from the student's performance on the short answer questions. The remaining 40% of the total exam score is derived from section two; the document-based question is worth 25% of the total exam score, while the long essay question is worth 15% of the total exam score.<ref name="Exam"/>
