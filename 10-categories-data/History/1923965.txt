'''Historical geography''' is the branch of [[geography]] that studies the ways in which geographic phenomena have changed over time. It is a synthesizing discipline which shares both topical and methodological similarities with [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[ecology]], [[geology]], [[environmental studies]], [[literary studies]], and other fields. Although the majority of work in historical geography is considered [[human geography]], the field also encompasses studies of geographic change which are not primarily [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]]. Historical geography is often a major component of school and university curricula in geography and [[social studies]]. Current research in historical geography is being performed by scholars in more than forty countries.<ref>Powell, Richard, and Robert M Wilson.

==Themes==
Historical geography seeks to determine how cultural features of various societies across the planet emerged and evolved by understanding their interaction with their local environment and surroundings.

==Development of the discipline==
In its early days, historical geography was difficult to define as a subject. A textbook  from the 1950s cites a previous definition as an 'unsound attempt by geographers to explain history'.<ref>Mitchell,J.B. Historical Geography (Hodder and Stoughton educational, 1954)</ref> Its author, J. B. Mitchell, came down firmly on the side of geography: 'the historical geographer is a geographer first last and all the time'. By 1975 the first number of the ''Journal of Historical Geography'' <ref>Journal of Historical Geography Volome 1, Number 1,1975</ref> had widened the discipline to a broader church: 'the writings of scholars of any disciplinary provenance who have something to say about matters of geographical interest relating to past time'.

For some{{who|date=March 2016}} in the United States of America, the term ''historical geography'' has a more specialized meaning: the name given by [[Carl O. Sauer|Carl Ortwin Sauer]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to his program of reorganizing cultural geography (some say all geography) along regional lines, beginning in the first decades of the 20th century. To Sauer, a landscape and the cultures in it could only be understood if all of its influences through history were taken into account: physical, cultural, economic, political, environmental. Sauer stressed regional specialization as the only means of gaining sufficient expertise on regions of the world. Sauer's philosophy was the principal shaper of American geographic thought in the mid-20th century. Regional specialists remain in academic geography departments to this day. Despite this, some geographers feel that it harmed the discipline; that too much effort was spent on data collection and classification, and too little on analysis and explanation. Studies became more and more area-specific as later geographers struggled to find places to make names for themselves. These factors may have led in turn to the [[Quantitative revolution#The 1950s Crisis in Geography|1950s crisis in geography]], which raised serious questions about geography as an academic discipline in the USA.

This sub-branch of [[human geography]] is closely related to [[history]], [[environmental history]], and [[historical ecology]].<ref>Balée, William (2006): The Research Program of Historical Ecology. In Annual Review of Anthropology 35 (1), pp. 75–98.</ref>
