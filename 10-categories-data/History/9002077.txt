The '''Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration''' was an era in the exploration of the continent of [[Antarctica]] which began at the end of the 19th century, and ended after the [[First World War]]; the [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition]] of 1921–1922 is often cited by historians as the dividing line between the "Heroic" and "Mechanical" ages.<ref name="Fisherlate"/><ref>Smith, p. 414</ref><ref>The historian [[Aant Elzinga]] gives the much later date of 1945, considering [[World War II]] to be the turning point in Antarctic research.{{cite book|first= Aang|last= Elzinga|title= Changing Trends in Antarctic Research|publisher= Springer|year= 1993|location= Dordrecth|isbn= 978-0-58-528849-9}}</ref>

During the Heroic Age, the [[Antarctic]] region became the focus of international efforts that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration by 17 major [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic expeditions]] launched from ten countries.<ref name= B19>Barczewski, pp. 19–20.</ref> The common factor in these expeditions was the limited nature of the resources available to them before advances in [[Transport in Antarctica|transport]] and [[Telecommunications in Antarctica|communication technologies]] revolutionized the work of exploration.<ref name= Fisherlate/><ref>Huntford, p. 691&nbsp;– "before machines took over."</ref> Each of these expeditions therefore became a feat of endurance that tested, and sometimes exceeded, its personnel's physical and mental limits. The "heroic" label, bestowed later, recognized the adversities which had to be overcome by these pioneers, some of whom did not survive the experience: a total of 19 expedition members died during this period.

Both the [[Geographic South Pole|geographic]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|magnetic]] South Poles were reached for the first time during the Heroic Age. The achievement of being first to the geographical pole was the primary object in many expeditions, as well as the sole rationale for [[Roald Amundsen]]'s venture, which became the first to reach it in 1911. Other expeditions aimed for different objectives in different areas of the continent. As a result of all this activity, much of the continent's coastline was discovered and mapped, and significant areas of its interior were explored. The expeditions also generated large quantities of scientific data across a wide range of disciplines, the examination and analysis of which would keep the world's scientific communities busy for decades.<ref>For example, the scientific results of the [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], 1902–04 were still being published in 1920 (Speak, p. 100). 25 volumes of results from the [[Terra Nova Expedition]], 1910–13 had been published by 1925.

Exploration of the southernmost part of the globe had been an off-and-on area of interest for centuries prior to the Heroic Age, yet the sheer isolation of the region as well as its inhospitable climate and treacherous seas presented enormous practical difficulties for early maritime technology. Curtailing what is commonly known as the [[Age of Exploration]], British explorer [[James Cook]] became one of the first explorers known to have traveled to the region. The discoveries of [[Second voyage of James Cook|his second voyage]] (1772–1775) changed the world map forever.<ref name="Kaye 1969">{{cite book|first= I.|last= Kaye|title= Captain James Cook and the Royal Society |publisher= Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 24, No.1|year= 1969|location= London}}</ref> Prior to this expedition it was believed that a large continent known as ''[[Terra Australis]]'' occupied the majority of the Southern Hemisphere. Cook discovered that no such landmass existed, though massive ice floes prevented his reaching Antarctica proper.<ref name="Kaye 1969"/> In the process his expedition became the first recorded voyage to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]]. He did hypothesize that, based upon the amount of ice, there must be a landmass from which the ice originated, but was convinced that if it existed this land was too far south to be either habitable or of any economic value.<ref name="Kaye 1969"/> Subsequently, exploration of the southern regions of the world came to a halt.

Interest was renewed again between 1819 and 1843.<ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887">{{cite book|last= American Association for the Advancement of Science |title= The Exploration of the Antarctic Regions|publisher= Science, Vol. 9, No. 223|year= 1887|location= New York}}</ref> As Europe settled after a period of war and unrest, explorers [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]], [[John Biscoe]], [[John Balleny]], [[Charles Wilkes]], [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]], and [[James Clark Ross]] sought greater knowledge of the Antarctic regions.<ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/> The primary goal of these explorers was to penetrate the vast barriers of sea ice that hid Antarctica proper, beginning with Bellingshausen and [[Mikhail Lazarev]]'s [[First Russian Antarctic Expedition|circumnavigation of the region]] in 1819–1821, during which they became the first to sight and therefore officially discover mainland Antarctica, and culminating in Wilkes' discovery of [[Victoria Land]] and naming of the volcanoes now known as [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] and [[Mount Erebus]] in 1840.<ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/> Much early knowledge of the lands south of the Antarctic Circle was also derived from economic pursuits by sealers and whalers, including the probable first landing on mainland Antarctica by an American sealer in 1821, though whether this landing was truly the first is disputed by historians. These explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were nonetheless unable to penetrate the interior of the continent, and their discoveries instead formed a broken line of newly discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica.

What followed this early period of exploration is what historian [[Hugh Robert Mill|H. R. Mill]] called "the age of averted interest".<ref name="Fogg 2000">{{cite book|first= G.E.|last= Fogg|title= The Royal Society and the Antarctic|publisher= Notes and Records of the Royal Society London, Vol. 54, No. 1|year= 2000|location= London, The Royal Society}}</ref> Following James Clark Ross' expedition aboard the ships [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] in January 1841, Ross suggested that there were no scientific discoveries worth exploration in the far South.<ref name="Fogg 2000"/> It has been suggested that Ross' influence, as well as the widely publicized loss of the [[Franklin expedition]] in the Arctic in 1848, led to a period of disinterest, or at least an unwillingness to invest significant resources, in polar inquiry, particularly by the [[Royal Society]]. In the twenty years following Ross' return, there was a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.<ref name="Fogg 2000"/>

[[File:SirJMurrayatwork.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sir John Murray|alt=An old bearded man drawing or measuring with a compass.]] 
The initial impetus for the renewed exploration of the Antarctic that became known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration is somewhat contested, as it was a vague and multifarious international movement. [[Georg von Neumayer|George von Neumayer]] of [[Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg]], also an Antarctic explorer, worked to renew Antarctic exploration from 1861 onward as he worked in an observatory in [[Melbourne]].<ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/> His particular interests were the importance of meteorology and how more information about the South Pole could lead to more accurate weather predictions. This helps explain German involvement in Antarctic research. Another, particularly British, impetus more closely tied to the period is a lecture given by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|John Murray]] titled [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1773599 "The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration"], given to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London, on 27 November 1893.<ref>{{cite book|first= John|last= Murray|title= The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration|publisher= The Geographical Journal, Vol. 3, No. 1|year= 1894|location= London}}</ref> Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to "resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south".<ref>Crane, p. 75</ref> Shortly prior to this, in 1887, the Royal Geographic Society had instated an Antarctic Committee which successfully incited many whalers to explore the southern regions of the world and foregrounded the lecture given by Murray.<ref name="American Association for the Advancement of Science 1887"/> In August 1895, the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration "in whatever ways seem to them most effective".<ref name= Borchbook9>{{cite book|author = Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&q=Southern+Cross+Expedition&pg=PA24|publisher = George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|access-date=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-90-583841-0}} pp. 9–10</ref> Such work, the resolution argued, would "bring additions to almost every branch of science".<ref name= Borchbook9/> The Congress was addressed by the Norwegian [[Carsten Borchgrevink]], who had just returned from a whaling expedition during which he had become one of the first people to set foot on the Antarctic mainland. During his address, Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition, to be based at [[Cape Adare]].<ref name= Borchbook4>{{cite book|author = Borchgrevink, Carstens|title= ''First on the Antarctic Continent''|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aMRgMxzhEI8C&q=Southern+Cross+Expedition&pg=PA24|publisher = George Newnes Ltd|year= 1901|access-date=11 August 2008|isbn = 978-0-90-583841-0}} pp. 4–5</ref>

However, the inauguration of the Heroic Age is now generally considered to be [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition|an expedition]] launched by the Belgian Geographical Society in 1897; [[Carsten Borchgrevink|Borchgrevink]] followed a year later with a privately sponsored expedition.<ref>Jones, p. 59</ref><ref>Some histories consider the ''Discovery'' expedition, which departed in 1901, as the first proper expedition of the Heroic Age.

It is not clear when the term was first coined or adopted generally. It was used in March 1956 by the British explorer [[Duncan Carse]], writing in ''[[The Times]]''. Describing the first crossing of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] by [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1916, Carse wrote of "three men from the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, with 50&nbsp;feet of rope between them, and a carpenter's adze".<ref>Carse, quoted by M. and J. Fisher, p. 389</ref>

The expedition achieved the southernmost penetration of the Weddell Sea to date, reaching 77°45'S, and discovered the [[Luitpold Coast]], [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]], and [[Vahsel Bay]].

==Expedition deaths during the Heroic Age==
Twenty-two men died on Antarctic expeditions during the Heroic Age. Of these, four died of illnesses unrelated to their Antarctic experiences, and two died from accidents in New Zealand, and one in France. The remaining 15 perished during service on or near the Antarctic continent.

==End of the Heroic Age==
There are different views about when the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came to an end.

Gadgets! Gadgets everywhere!".<ref name= Fisherlate/> These included wireless, an electrically heated crow's nest and an "odograph" that could trace and record the ship's route and speed.<ref name= Fisherlate/>

{{quote |
The heroic era of Antarctic exploration was ‘heroic’ because it was anachronistic before it began, its goal was as abstract as a pole, its central figures were romantic, manly and flawed, its drama was moral (for it mattered not only what was done but how it was done), and its ideal was national honour. It was an early testing-ground for the racial virtues of new nations such as Norway and Australia, and it was the site of Europe’s last gasp before it tore itself apart in the Great War.
