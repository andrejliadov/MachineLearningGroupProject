'''Ajamu X''' (born 1963 in [[Huddersfield]]) is a British artist, curator, archivist and activist. He is best known for his fine art photography which explores same-sex desire, and the Black male body, and his work as an archivist and activist to document the lives and experiences of black [[LGBTQ]] people in the UK.

==Early life==
Ajamu was born in 1963 in [[Huddersfield]] to [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] parents. His grandparents arrived to England in 1958 and his parents followed in 1962.<ref name="GuardianTnt">{{cite news|last1=Surtees|first1=Joshua|title=Ajamu challenges homophobia|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/lifestyle/2014-07-24/ajamu-challenges-homophobia|accessdate=29 June 2017|work=Guardian Trinidad and Tobago|date=25 July 2014}}</ref>

Ajamu came out as gay to his parents in his late teens and describes their reaction as "impressively progressive for the times".<ref name="GuardianTnt"/> He studied Black History and photography in [[Leeds]]. While in Leeds, he and two friends created the magazine ''BLAC'', an acronym for Black Liberation Activist Core. In October 1987, after seeing it advertised in the newspaper ''[[Caribbean Times]]'', Ajamu attended the first, and only, National Black Gay Men's Conference held at the [[Black Lesbian and Gay Centre]] in Camden. By January the following year, he had moved to London.<ref name="AjamuXInt2008">{{cite web|title=Ajamu X interview|url=http://www.samthewheels.co.uk/2008-interviews-volunteers/450|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509131828/http://www.samthewheels.co.uk/2008-interviews-volunteers/450|website=Sam The Wheels|accessdate=13 April 2016|url-status=dead|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="Cook2014">{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Matt|title=Queer Domesticities: Homosexuality and Home Life in Twentieth-Century London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHOEAwAAQBAJ|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31607-3}}</ref>
He was given the name Ajamu in 1991; it means "he who fights for what he believes".<ref name="GuardianTnt" />

{{Quote|text=My name Ajamu X is a reference to [[Malcolm X]] who was my first key role model. Changing my name to an African one was very significant. |author=Ajamu X<ref name="AjamuXInt2008" />}}

== Career ==
Ajamu's work often highlights stories of black [[LGBT]] individuals who he feels are often marginalised from mainstream British Society; additionally he has chosen to focus on those who are black and openly "out" and have been accepted by their families.  Ajamu has said he rejects the claim that Jamaican culture is particularly homophobic and believes that homophobia exists across cultures and families of all backgrounds.<ref name="GuardianTnt" />

He often speaks of his work as a "sex activist"; he has run "sex parties for men who want to have sex with men" since the 1990s,<ref name="GuardianTnt" /> and same-sex desire and pleasure are recurring themes in his photography. His first major exhibition ''Black Bodyscapes'', in 1994, focused on the private sexual realities of black gay men.<ref name="OpenEye2014">{{cite web|last1=Seery |first1=Emma |title=Ajamu: Sexual Idenitifcation |url=http://www.openeye.org.uk/2014/03/4489/ |website=Open Eye Gallery |accessdate=2 December 2015 |date=28 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085336/http://www.openeye.org.uk/2014/03/4489/ |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> More recent projects include ''Fierce: Portraits of Young Black Queers''. an exhibition of 24 portraits of a "…new generation of Black and proudly out young, emerging and established talent"<ref name="Afropunk2013">{{cite web|last1=Minott|first1=Zinzi|title=Fierce and That: Pondering the Work of Ajamu X an Original Afropunk|url=http://www.afropunk.com/profiles/blogs/fierce-and-that-ponderings-on-the-work-of-ajamu-x-an-original|website=AfroPunk|accessdate=2 December 2015|date=27 March 2013}}</ref> at London's [[Guildhall Art Gallery]] in 2014<ref name="OpenDem 2014Nov" /> and ''I Am For You Can Enjoy''<ref name="ContactTheatre2016" /> with Khalil West, at [[Contact Theatre]], Manchester, in 2016, which uses photography and video, to explore the lives of [[queer]] Black male sex workers and their clients.
