'''British Library Sounds''' (previously named Archival Sound Recordings) is a [[British Library]] service providing free online access to a diverse range of spoken word, music and environmental sounds from the [[British Library Sound Archive]].  Anyone with web access can use the service to search, browse and listen to 50,000 digitised recordings. Playback and download of an additional 22,000 recordings is available to Athens or Shibboleth users in UK higher and [[further education]]. The service was originally launched with funding by the [[Jisc]].

There are over 20,000 hours of rarely heard audio material available online.  Images and transcripts are also available for some recordings to further enrich the content.

Recordings may be searched by keywords or browsed by collection types, dates, languages, performer names and subjects. Several collections can be browsed using a map interface.

==Selected highlights==

'''African Writers' Club'''

Over 250 hours of radio programmes about African literary, social and cultural affairs. Made at the Transcription Centre in [[London]], the recordings were broadcast throughout [[Africa]] and sometimes on the [[BBC World Service]]. Ranging from radio dramas to magazine programmes, from politics to poetry, this collection provides a view of Africa in the mid-1960s.

Interviewees include sculptors [[Elisabeth Frink]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]]; painters [[Terry Frost]], [[Paula Rego]] and [[Michael Rothenstein]]; photographers [[Grace Robertson]], [[Mari Mahr]] and [[Helen Chadwick]]; and architects [[Denys Lasdun]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], Edward Hollamby and Patrick Gwynne. 

'''David Rycroft Africa recordings'''

South African-born linguist and musicologist, Rycroft made many field trips to villages, townships and settlements around [[South Africa]] between the 1960s and '80s. Fascinated by the relationship between oral traditions and musical structure, Rycroft focused on unaccompanied choral singing, songs composed for indigenous musical instruments, and urban music. 

'''Klaus Wachsmann Uganda recordings'''

[[Klaus Wachsmann]] made roughly 1,500 unique recordings of indigenous music in [[Uganda]], most of which have never been published before. This collection dates from the late 1940s, when Wachsmann was curator of the Uganda Museum in [[Kampala]], and includes field recordings and performances at the museum.

'''Oral history of jazz in Britain'''

An informal and anecdotal history of the music, venues and people that defined [[jazz]] in the UK. Through interviews with musicians, promoters and label owners, this collection focuses on some of the less well known aspects of [[British jazz]] – including the impact in Britain of overseas musicians, British developments in free improvisation in the 1960s, jazz outside London, and the contribution of women to the music.

'''Oral history of recorded sound'''

This teaching package reflects in sound, image and text the cultural and economic impact of developments in recording technology over the 20th century. It also features oral history interviews with significant figures in the worlds of music, radio, and the recording industry – with a focus on backroom innovators who have rarely enjoyed the limelight.

'''Sound Maps'''

A series of interactive maps allowing browsing and listening of accents and dialects, nature sounds, oral memories and traditional music.

'''Soundscapes'''

The word "''[[soundscape]]''" was coined by composer [[R. Murray Schafer]] to identify sounds that “describe a place, a sonic identity, a sonic memory, but always a sound that is pertinent to a place”<ref>Wagstaff, Gregg (2000) "From the Isles of Lewis and Harris", ''Soundscape, The Journal of Acoustic Ecology'', 1/1, p. 19.</ref> This selection draws together mechanical and industrial sounds (including transport and fog-horns), soundscapes of the natural world across continents, urban soundscapes, and wildlife sounds from around the globe. 

'''[[St Mary-le-Bow public debates]]'''

At one o’clock every Tuesday lunchtime for fifteen years (1964–79), Joseph McCulloch, the Rector of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St Mary-le-Bow Church]] in the City of London, invited a well-known public figure to debate an issue of the day. Popular among city workers, guests included [[Enoch Powell]] on race, [[Diana Rigg]] on single parentage, [[A. J. Ayer]] on moral responsibility, [[Edna O'Brien|Edna O’Brien]] on fear, and [[Germaine Greer]] on free will.

'''Syliphone record label recordings from Guinea'''

Over 7,800 recordings of music from Guinea, originally released on the Syliphone record label. It includes many unique recordings not previously heard outside of Guinea. A large proportion has not been broadcast in over 20 years, as it was politically sensitive and subject to censorship. The list of artists and musicians represented in the collection is a who’s who of Guinean and African music. There are many unreleased recordings by major stars such as Kandia Sory Kouyaté, Bembeya Jazz National, Fodé Conté, and Kadé Diawara, in addition to hundreds of unreleased recordings by Guinea’s national and regional orchestras, troupes and ensembles. There is also a wealth of material by famous Guinean artists who, as they were never commercially recorded, are virtually unknown outside of Guinea, including Farba Tela (an inspiration to Ali Farka Touré), Mama Kanté, Binta Laaly Sow, Koubia Jazz, and Jeanne Macauley. The collection also features thousands of traditional songs from all of Guinea’s regions and ethnic groups.<ref>http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/endangeredarchives/2013/06/syliphone-label-music.html "Syliphone - an early recording label from Guinea"</ref>
