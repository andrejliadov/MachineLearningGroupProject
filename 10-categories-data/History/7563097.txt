'''Archaic globalization''' is a phase in the [[history of globalization]], and conventionally refers to globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly 1600 (the following period is known as [[early modern globalization]]). Archaic globalization describes the relationships between [[communities]] and [[state (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and [[social norm]]s at both local and regional levels.<ref name="M 45">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=45}}</ref>

States began to interact and trade with others within close proximity as a way to acquire coveted goods that were considered [[luxury goods|a luxury]]. This trade led to the spread of ideas such as religion, economic structures and political ideals. [[Merchant]]s became connected and aware of others in ways that had not been apparent. Archaic globalization is comparable to present day [[globalization]] on a much smaller scale. It not only allowed the spread of [[goods]] and [[commodities]] to other regions, but it also allowed people to experience other cultures. Cities that partook in trading were bound together by [[sea lane]]s, [[inland shipping|rivers]], and great overland [[trade route]]s, some of which had been in use since antiquity.<ref name="A-L 33">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=33}}</ref> Trading was broken up according to geographic location, with centers between flanking places serving as "[[breakbulk|break-in-bulk]]" and exchange points for goods destined for more distant markets.<ref name="A-L 33"/> During this time period the subsystems were more self-sufficient than they are today and therefore less vitally dependent upon one another for everyday survival.<ref name="A-L 33"/> While long-distance trading came with many trials and tribulations, still so much of it went on during this early time period. Linking the trade together involved eight interlinked subsystems that were grouped into three large circuits, which encompassed the [[western Europe]]an, the [[Middle East]]ern, and the [[Far East]]ern circuits. This interaction during trading was early civilization's way to communicate and spread many ideas that caused [[modern globalization]] to emerge and allowed a new aspect to present-day society.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Defining globalization==
Globalization is the process of increasing interconnectedness between regions and individuals. Steps toward globalization include economic, political, technological, social, and cultural connections around the world. The term "archaic" can be described as early ideals and functions that were once historically apparent in society but may have disintegrated over time.

There are three main prerequisites for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East.<ref name="M 47">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=47}}</ref> Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East and certain parts of Europe.<ref name="M 47"/> With early globalization it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with [[interdependency]], stability and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another then there is no way for them to be mutually affected by one another. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.<ref name="M 48">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=48}}</ref>

==Emergence of a world system==
Historians argue that a [[world system]] was in order before the rise of capitalism between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is referred to as the early age of capitalism where long-distance trade, market exchange and capital accumulation existed amongst states.<ref name="M 45"/> In 800 AD Greek, Roman and Muslim empires emerged covering areas known today as China and the Middle East. Major religions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism spread to distant lands where many are still intact today. One of the most popular examples of distant trade routes can be seen with the silk route between China and the Mediterranean, movement and trade with art and luxury goods between Arab regions, South Asia and Africa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=44}}</ref> These relationships through trade mainly formed in the east and eventually led to the development of capitalism. It was at this time that power and land shifted from the nobility and church to the bourgeoisie and division of labor in production emerged.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Ino|title=Frontiers of Globalization Research: Theoretical and Methodological Approaches|url=https://archive.org/details/frontiersglobali00ross|url-access=limited|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science + Business Media|pages=[https://archive.org/details/frontiersglobali00ross/page/n40 33]–36}}</ref>  During the later part of the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth century an international trade system was developed between states ranging from northwestern Europe to China.<ref name="A-L 8">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=8}}</ref>

During the 1500s other Asian empires emerged, which included trading over longer distances than before. During the early exchanges between states, Europe had little to offer with the exception of slaves, metals, wood and furs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}</ref> The push for selling of items in the east drove European production and helped integrate them into the exchange.<ref name="A-L 47">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=47}}</ref> The European expansion and growth of opportunities for trade made possible by the Crusades increased the renaissance of agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.<ref name="A-L 47"/> Rapid urbanization throughout Europe allowed a connection from the North Sea to Venice.<ref name="A-L 47"/> Advances in industrialization coupled with the rouse of population growth and the growing demands of the eastern trade, led to the growth of true trading emporia with outlets to the sea.<ref name="A-L 47"/>

There is a 'multi-polar' nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, in which [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by [[Europe]] but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal China and [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}</ref>

These pre-capitalist movements were regional rather than global and for the most part temporary. This idea of early globalization was proposed by the historian [[A.G. Hopkins]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pramanick|title=Globalization in India: New Frontiers Emerging|year=2010|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|location=New Dehli|page=49}}</ref>  Hopkins main points on archaic globalization can be seen with trade, and diaspora that developed from this, as well as religious ideas and empires that spread throughout the region.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|page=45}}</ref> This new interaction amongst states led to interconnections between parts of the world which led to the eventual interdependency amongst these state actors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=45}}</ref> The main actors that partook in the spreading of goods and ideas were kings, warriors, priests and traders. Hopkins also addresses that during this time period mini-globalizations were prominent and that some collapsed or became more insular.<ref name="M 47"/> These mini-globalizations are referred to as episodic and ruptured, with empires sometimes overreaching and having to retract.<ref name="M 47"/> These mini-globalizations left remnants that allowed the West to adopt these new ideals, leading to the idea of [[Western Capitalism]]. The adopted ideals can be seen in the Western monetary system and are central to systems like capitalism that define modernity and modern globalization.<ref name="M 48"/>

=== The three principles of archaic globalization ===
Archaic globalization consists of three principles: universalizing kingship, expansion of religious movements, and medicinal understanding.
* The universalizing of kingship led soldiers and monarchs far distances to find honor and prestige. However, the crossing over foreign lands also gave the traveling men opportunity to exchange prized goods. This expanded trade between distant lands, which consequently increased the amount of social and economic relations.
* Despite the vast distances covered by monarchs and their companies, [[pilgrimages]] remain one of the greatest global movements of people.
* Finally, the desire for better health was the remaining push behind archaic globalization. While the trading of spices, precious stones, animals, and weapons remained of major importance, people began to seek medicine from faraway lands. This implemented more trade routes, especially to China for their tea.<ref>C.A. Bayly, ''Birth of the Modern World'', (Oxford, 2004) pp. 42–44</ref>

===Economic exchange===
With the increase in trade and state linkage, economic exchange extended throughout the region and caused actors to form new relationships.<ref name="M 44">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press|page=44}}</ref>  This early economic development can be seen in [[Champagne Fairs]], which were outdoor markets where traveling merchants came to sell their products and make purchases.<ref name="A-L 52">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=52}}</ref> Traditionally, market fairs used barter as opposed to money, once larger itinerant merchants began to frequent them, the need for currency became greater and a money changer needed to be established.<ref name="A-L 52"/> Some historical scholars{{Who|date=June 2011}} argue that this was the beginning of the role of banker and the institution of credit. An example can be seen with one individual in need of an item the urban merchant does not ordinarily stock. The product seeker orders the item, which the merchant promises to bring him next time. The product seeker either gives credit to the merchant by paying them in advance, gets credit from the merchant by promising to pay them once the item is in stock, or some type of concession is made through a down payment. If the product seeker does not have the amount required by the merchant he may borrow from the capital stored by the money changer or he may mortgage part of his expected harvest, either from the money charger or the merchant he is seeking goods from.<ref name="A-L 53">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=53}}</ref> This lengthy transaction eventually resulted in a complex economic system and once the weekly market began to expand from barter to the monetized system required by long-distance trading.<ref name="A-L 53"/>

A higher circuit of trade developed once urban traders from outside city limits travelled from distant directions to the market center in the quest to buy or sell goods. Merchants would then begin to meet at the same spot on a weekly basis allowing for them to arrange with other merchants to bring special items for exchange that were not demanded by the local agriculturalists but for markets in their home towns.<ref name="A-L 53"/> When the local individuals placed advanced orders, customers from towns of different traders may begin to place order for items in a distant town that their trader can order from their counterpart. This central meeting point, becomes the focus of long-distance trade and how it began to increase.<ref name="A-L 53"/>

===Expansion of long distance trade===
In order for trade to be able to expand during this early time period, it required some basic functions of the market as well as the merchants. The first was security. Goods that were being transported began to have more value and the merchants needed to protect their coveted goods especially since they were often traveling through poor areas where the risk of theft was high. To overcome this problem merchants began to travel in [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] as a way to ensure their personal safety as well as the safety of their goods.<ref name="A-L 54">{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=54}}</ref> The second prerequisite to early long distant trade had to be an agreement on a rate of exchange. Since many of the merchants came from distant lands with different monetary systems a system had to be put into place as a way to enforce repayment of previous goods, repay previous debt and to ensure contracts were upheld.<ref name="A-L 54"/> Expansion was also able to thrive so long as it had a motive for exchange as a way to promote trade amongst foreign lands. Also, outside merchants access to trading sites was a critical factor in trade route growth.

===The spread of goods and ideas===
The most popular goods produced were spices, which were traded over short distances, while manufactured goods were central to the system and could not have been aided without them.<ref name="A-L 8"/> The invention of money in the form of gold coins in Europe and Middle East and paper money in China around the thirteenth century allowed trade to move more easily between the different actors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n16 15]}}</ref> The main actors involved in this system viewed gold, silver, and copper as valuable on different levels. Nevertheless, goods were transferred, prices set, exchange rates agreed upon, contracts entered into, credit extended, partnerships formed and agreements that were made were kept on record and honored.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony The World System A.D. 1250–1350|year=1991|page=8}}</ref> During this time of globalization, credit was also used as a means for trading. The use of credit began in the form of blood ties but later led to the emergence the "banker" as a profession.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n16 15]–16}}</ref>

With the spread of people came new ideas, religion and goods throughout the land, which had never been apparent in most societies before the movement.<ref name="M 44"/>  Also, this globalization lessened the degree of [[feudal]] life by transitioning from self-sufficient society to a money economy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dobb|first=Maurice|title=Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism|year=1962|page=3}}</ref>  Most of the trade connecting North Africa and Europe was controlled by the Middle East, China and India around 1400.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n15 14]}}</ref> Because of the danger and great cost of long-distance travel in the pre-modern period, archaic globalization grew out of the trade in high-value commodities which took up a small amount of space. Most of the goods that were produced and traded were considered a luxury and many{{Who|date=June 2011}} considered those with these coveted items to have a higher place on the societal scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Examples of such luxury goods would include Chinese silks, exotic herbs, coffee, cotton, iron, Indian [[Calico (textile)|calicoes]], [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Gemstone|gems]] and spices or drugs such as [[nutmeg]], [[cloves]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[ambergris]] and [[opium]]. The thirteenth century as well as present day favor luxury items due to the fact that small high-value goods can have high transport costs but still have a high value attached to them, whereas low-value heavy goods are not worth carrying very far.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet|title=Before European Hegemony|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=55}}</ref> Purchases of luxury items such as these are described as archaic consumption since trade was largely popular for these items as opposed to everyday needs. The distinction between [[food]], [[drugs]] and [[materia medica]] is often quite blurred in regards to these substances, which were valued not only for their rarity but because they appealed to [[humorism|humoral theories]] of health and the body that were prevalent throughout premodern [[Eurasia]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Major trade routes===
During the time of archaic globalization there were three major trade routes which connected Europe, China and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n77 137]}}</ref> The northernmost route went through mostly the [[Mongol Empire]] and was nearly 5000 miles long.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n95 176]}}</ref> Even though the route consisted of mostly vast stretches of desert with little to no resources, merchants still traveled it. The route was still traveled because during the 13th century [[Kubilai Khan]] united the Mongol Empire and charged only a small protective rent to travelers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n84 154]}}</ref> Before the unification, merchants from the Middle East used the path but were stopped and taxed at nearly every village.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n86 157]}}</ref> The middle route went from the coast of Syria to Baghdad from there the traveler could follow the land route through Persia to India, or sail to India via the Persian Gulf. Between the 8th and 10th centuries, Baghdad was a world city<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n80 145]}}</ref> but in the 11th century it began to decline due to natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, and fires.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n103 192]}}</ref> In 1258, Baghdad was taken over by the Mongols. The Mongols forced high taxes on the citizens of Baghdad which led to a decrease in production, causing merchants to bypass the city<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n106 195]}}</ref> The third, southernmost route, went through Mamluk controlled Egypt, After the fall of Baghdad, Cairo became the Islamic capital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abu-Lughod|first=Janet L.|title=Before European Hegemony|url=https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul|url-access=limited|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc|page=[https://archive.org/details/beforeeuropeanhe00abul/page/n105 196]}}</ref>

Some major cities along these trading routes were wealthy and provided services for merchants and the  international markets. Palmyra and Petra which are located on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, flourished mainly as power centers of trading. They would police the trade routes and be the source of supplies for the merchants caravans. They also became places where people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds could meet and interact. These trading routes were the communication highways for the ancient civilizations and their societies. New inventions, religious beliefs, artistic styles, languages, and social customs, as well as goods and raw materials, were transmitted by people moving from one place to another to conduct business.<ref>Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art.

===Proto-globalization===
[[Proto-globalization]] is the period following archaic globalization which occurred from the 17th through the 19th centuries. The global routes established within the period of archaic globalization gave way to more distinguished expanding routes and more complex systems of trade within the period of proto-globalization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Ny: Norton|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalizationinw00agho/page/3 3]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globalizationinw00agho/page/3}}</ref> Familiar trading arrangements such as the [[East India Company]] appeared within this period, making larger-scale exchanges possible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=A.C|title=The Birth of the Modern World|url=https://archive.org/details/birthmodernworld00bayl|url-access=limited|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=[https://archive.org/details/birthmodernworld00bayl/page/n44 62]}}</ref>   Slave trading was especially extensive and the associated mass-production of [[commodities]] on [[plantations]] is characteristic of this time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bayly|first=C.A.|title=The Birth of the Modern World|url=https://archive.org/details/birthmodernworld00bayl|url-access=limited|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|page=[https://archive.org/details/birthmodernworld00bayl/page/n33 42]}}</ref>

As a result of a measurable amount of polyethnic regions due to these higher frequency trade routes, war became prominent. Such wars include the [[French and Indian War]], [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=A.G.|title=Globalization in World History|year=2003|publisher=Norton|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97942-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/globalizationinw00agho/page/4 4–5]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/globalizationinw00agho/page/4}}</ref> and the [[Anglo-Dutch War]] between England and the Dutch Republic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rommelse|first=Gijs|title=The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)|year=2006|publisher=Hilversum|page=11}}</ref>

===Modern globalization===
The modern form of globalization began to take form during the 19th century. The evolving beginnings of this period were largely responsible for the expansion of the West, capitalism and [[imperialism]] backed up by the [[nation-state]] and industrial technology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|pages=53–54}}</ref> This began to emerge during the 1500s, continuing to expand exponentially over time as industrialization developed in the 18th century. The conquests of the British Empire and the Opium Wars added to the industrialization and formation of the growing global society because it created vast consumer regions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Polity Press|page=60}}</ref>

[[World War I]] is when the first phase of modern globalization began to take force. It is said by [[VM Yeates]] that the economic forces of globalization were part of the cause of the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yeates|first=VM|title=Winged Victory|year=1962|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|pages=54–55}}</ref> Since World War I, globalization has expanded greatly. The evolving improvements of [[multinational corporations]], technology, science, and [[mass media]] have all been results of extensive worldwide exchanges. In addition, institutions such as the [[World Bank]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and many international telecommunication companies have also shaped modern globalization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jurgen|first=Osterhammel|title=Globalization: A Short History|year=2005|page=8}}</ref> The World Wide Web has also played a large role in modern globalization. The [[Internet]] provides connectivity across national and international borders, aiding in the enlargement of a global network.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elmer|first=Greg|title=Critical Perspectives on the Internet|year=2002|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=183}}</ref>
