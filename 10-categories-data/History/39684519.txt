The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to prehistoric technology.

'''[[Prehistoric technology]]''' – [[technology]] that predates [[recorded history]]. History is the study of the past using written records; it is also the record itself. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] (meaning "before history"), including earlier technologies. About 2.5 million years before writing was developed, technology began with the earliest [[hominid]]s who used [[stone tool]]s, which they may have used to start fires, hunt, cut food, and bury their dead.

== Nature of prehistoric technology ==
{{Human timeline}}
Prehistoric technology can be described as:
* [[Prehistoric]] – "before we had written records," from the [[Latin]] word for "before," præ. Prehistory is the span of time before recorded history, that is, before the invention of writing systems.
* [[Technology]] – making, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems, and methods of organization, in order to solve a problem, improve a preexisting solution to a problem, achieve a goal, handle an applied input/output relation or perform a specific function.

== Old World prehistoric technology ==
* [[Three-age system]] – in archaeology and physical anthropology, the periodization of human prehistory into three consecutive time periods, each named after the main material used in its respective tool-making technologies: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.
* Beginning of prehistoric technology – the earliest technology began (2.5 million years) before recorded history, that is, at the beginning of the Stone Age.
* Latest prehistoric technology – the level of technology reached before true writing was introduced differed by region (and usually included proto-writing)...
** Latest prehistoric technology in the Near East – cultures in the Near East achieved the development of writing first, during their Bronze Age.
** Latest prehistoric technology in the rest of the Old World: Europe, India, and China reached Iron Age technological development before the introduction of writing there.

=== Stone Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Stone Age]] – broad prehistoric period, lasting roughly 2.5 million years, during which stone was widely used in the manufacture of implements with a sharp edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period began with hominids and ended between 6000 and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.

==== Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Paleolithic]] – prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 99% of human technological prehistory.

==== Lower Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Lower Paleolithic]] – earliest subdivision of the [[Paleolithic]] or Old [[Stone Age]]. It spans the time from around [[1 E13 s|2.5 million years]] ago when the first evidence of craft and use of [[stone tool]]s by [[Hominidae|hominids]] appears in the current [[archaeological record]], until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the [[Oldowan]] ("mode 1") and [[Acheulean]] ("mode 2") [[lithic technology]].
** [[Stone tools|Stone tool use]] – early human (hominid) use of stone tool technology, such as the [[hand axe]], was [[Tool use by animals|similar to that of primates]], which is found to be limited to the intelligence levels of modern children aged 3 to 5 years. Ancestors of homo sapiens (modern man) used stone tools as follows:

==== Middle Paleolithic technology ====
* [[Middle Paleolithic]] period – in Europe and the Near East during which the [[Neanderthal]]s lived (c. 300,000–28,000 years ago). Their technology is mainly the [[Mousterian]].  The earliest evidence ([[Mungo Man]]) of settlement in [[Australia]] dates [[History of Australia before 1901|to around 55,000 years ago]] when modern humans likely crossed from Asia by island-hopping.  The [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] exhibit the earliest traces of human life in [[India]], some of which are approximately 30,000 years old.
** ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]''
*** [[Stone tool]]s – ''[[homo neanderthalensis]]'' used [[Mousterian]] stone tools that date back to around 300,000 years ago<ref>Skinner, A.; Blackwell, B.; Long, R.; Seronie-Vivien, M.R.; Tillier, A.-M.; Blickstein, J.

==== Mesolithic technology ====
* Mesolithic – the transitional period between the Paleolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, beginning with the [[Holocene]] warm period around 11,660 [[Before Present|BP]] and ending with the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic]] introduction of farming, the date of which varied in each geographical region.  Adaptation was required during this period due to climate changes that affected environment and the types of available food.
** Stone tool changes – small stone tools called [[Microlith]]s, including small [[Bladelet (archaeology)|bladelets]] and [[microburin]]s, emerged during this period.<ref>Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson.

==== Neolithic Revolution ====
* [[Neolithic Revolution]] – first agricultural revolution, representing a transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] nomadic life to an [[agriculture]] existence.  It evolved independently in six separate locations worldwide circa 10,000–7000 years [[Before Present|BP]] (8,000–5,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]). The earliest known evidence exists in the tropical and subtropical areas of [[Southwest Asia|southwestern]]/[[southern Asia]], [[North Africa|northern]]/[[central Africa]] and [[Central America]].<ref name=Gupta>Gupta, Anil.(October 2010).

=== Prehistoric Bronze Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Bronze Age]] – stage of development characterized by the use of [[copper]] and its alloy [[bronze]] as the chief hard materials in the manufacture of some implements and weapons and of developing trade networks.
*** [[Bronze Age China]]
*** [[Bronze Age India]]
***** Early [[Indus script]], ca. 3500 BC

=== Prehistoric Iron Age technology in the Old World ===
* [[Iron Age]] – age characterized by the widespread use of iron or steel, which coincided with other changes in society, including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles.
** Tools – best tools and weapons were made from steel.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

=== End of prehistory and the beginning of history ===
* Development of true writing systems – in the Old World, true writing systems developed from [[neolithic]] writing in the [[Early Bronze Age]] ([[4th millennium BC]]).  The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic (pre-[[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]) writing and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest true writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BC]].

====Transition from proto-writing to true writing====
* General developmental stages leading from proto-writing to true writing:
** ''Picture writing system'': glyphs directly represent objects and ideas or objective and ideational situations. In connection with this the following substages may be distinguished:
**# The mnemonic: glyphs primarily a reminder;
**# The pictographic (pictography): glyphs represent directly an object or an objective situation such as (A) chronological, (B) notices, (C) communications, (D) totems, titles, and names, (E) religious, (F) customs, (G) historical, and (H) biographical;
**# The ideographic (ideography): glyphs represent directly an idea or an ideational situation.
** ''Transitional system'': glyphs refer not only to the object or idea which it represents but to its name as well.
** ''Phonetic system'': glyphs refer to sounds or spoken symbols irrespective of their meanings. This resolves itself into the following substages:
**# The verbal: glyph ([[logogram]]) represents a whole word;
**# The syllabic: glyph represent a syllable;
**# The alphabetic: glyph represent an elementary sound.

* [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] – was dated from 8,000 to 2,000 years before present.<ref name=Cassells9/> People were hunters of small game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gatherers of wild plants, moving seasonally to hunting and gathering sites.  Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 CE, corn was introduced into the diet and pottery-making became an occupation for storing and carrying food.<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000).
