The scientific question of within which larger group of animals [[evolution of birds|birds evolved]] has traditionally been called the ''''origin of birds'''<nowiki/>'. The present [[scientific consensus]] is that [[bird]]s are a group of [[maniraptora]]n [[Theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]s that [[evolution|originated]] during the [[Mesozoic|Mesozoic Era]].

A close relationship between birds and dinosaurs was first proposed in the nineteenth century after the discovery of the primitive bird ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' in Germany. Birds and extinct non-avian dinosaurs share many unique skeletal traits.<ref name="Chiappe2009">{{cite journal|last=Chiappe|first=Luis M.|year=2009|title=Downsized Dinosaurs: The Evolutionary Transition to Modern Birds|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|pages=248–256|doi=10.1007/s12052-009-0133-4|volume=2|issue=2|doi-access=free}}</ref> Moreover, fossils of more than thirty species of non-avian dinosaur with preserved feathers have been collected. There are even very small dinosaurs, such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Anchiornis]]'', which have long, [[Feathers#Structures and characteristics|vaned]] arm and leg feathers forming wings. The Jurassic basal [[avialan]] ''[[Pedopenna]]'' also shows these long foot feathers. [[Paleontology|Paleontologist]] [[Lawrence Witmer]] concluded in 2009 that this evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that avian evolution went through a four-winged stage.<ref name=Witmer2009/> Fossil evidence also demonstrates that birds and dinosaurs shared features such as hollow, [[pneumatized bones]], [[gastrolith]]s in the [[gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] system, nest-building and [[Avian incubation|brooding behaviors]].

Although the origin of birds has historically been a contentious topic within [[evolutionary biology]], only a few scientists still dispute the dinosaurian origin of birds, suggesting descent from other types of [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s. Within the consensus that supports dinosaurian ancestry, the exact sequence of evolutionary events that gave rise to the early birds within maniraptoran theropods is disputed. The origin of [[bird flight]] is a separate but related question for which there are also several proposed answers.

==Research history==

===Huxley, ''Archaeopteryx'' and early research===
[[File:T.H.Huxley(Woodburytype).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1825–1895)]]
Scientific investigation into the origin of birds began shortly after the 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref name=darwin>{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles R. |author-link=Charles Darwin |year=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life |location=London |publisher=John Murray |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=side&pageseq=16 |page=502pp |isbn=978-1-4353-9386-8}}</ref> In 1860, a fossilized feather was discovered in [[Germany]]'s [[Late Jurassic]] [[Solnhofen limestone]].

[[Biologist]] [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], known as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his tenacious support of the new theory of evolution by means of natural selection, almost immediately seized upon ''Archaeopteryx'' as a [[transitional fossil]] between birds and reptiles. Starting in 1868, and following earlier suggestions by [[Karl Gegenbaur]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gegenbaur | first1 = K. | year = 1863 | title = Vergleichend-anatomische Bemerkungen über das Fußskelet der Vögel | journal = Archiv für Anatomie, Physiologie und Wissenschaftliche Medicin | volume = 1863 | pages = 450–472 }}</ref> and [[Edward Drinker Cope]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cope | first1 = E.D. | year = 1867 | title = An account of the extinct reptiles which approached the birds | journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | volume = 19 | pages = 234–235 }}[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofaca19acad link]</ref> Huxley made detailed comparisons of ''Archaeopteryx'' with various prehistoric reptiles and found that it was most similar to dinosaurs like ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'' and ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=huxley1868>{{cite journal |last= Huxley|first= T.H.  |author-link=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1868|title= On the animals which are most nearly intermediate between birds and reptiles |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |volume=2 |pages=66–75 |series=4th |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22247928}}</ref><ref name=huxley1870>{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=Thomas H. |author-link=Thomas Henry Huxley |year=1870 |title=Further evidence of the affinity between the dinosaurian reptiles and birds |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=26 |pages=12–31 |doi=10.1144/GSL.JGS.1870.026.01-02.08 |issue=1–2|s2cid=129125487 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2518771 }}</ref> The discovery in the late 1870s of the iconic "Berlin specimen" of ''Archaeopteryx'', complete with a set of reptilian teeth, provided further evidence. Like Cope, Huxley proposed an evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs. Although Huxley was opposed by the very influential Owen, his conclusions were accepted by many biologists, including [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás|Baron Franz Nopcsa]],<ref name=nopcsa>{{cite journal |last=Nopcsa |first=Franz. |author-link=Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás |year=1907 |title=Ideas on the origin of flight |journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London |pages=223–238}}</ref> while others, notably [[Harry Seeley]],<ref name=seeley>{{cite book |last=Seeley |first=Harry G. |year=1901 |author-link=Harry Seeley |title=Dragons of the Air: An Account of Extinct Flying Reptiles |url=https://archive.org/details/dragonsairanacc00seelgoog |location=London |publisher=Methuen & Co. |page=239pp}}</ref> argued that the similarities were due to [[convergent evolution]].

===Heilmann and the thecodont hypothesis===
{{main|The Origin of Birds (book)}}
A turning point came in the early twentieth century with the writings of [[Gerhard Heilmann]] of [[Denmark]]. An artist by trade, Heilmann had a scholarly interest in birds and from 1913 to 1916, expanding on earlier work by [[Othenio Abel]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = O | year = 1911 | title = Die Vorfahren der Vögel und ihre Lebensweise | journal = Verhandlungen der Zoologisch-Botanischen Gesellschaft in Wien | volume = 61 | pages = 144–191 }}</ref> published the results of his research in several parts, dealing with the anatomy, [[embryology]], behavior, paleontology, and evolution of birds.<ref name=nieuwland2004>{{cite journal |last=Nieuwland |first=Ilja J.J. |year=2004 |title=Gerhard Heilmann and the artist's eye in science, 1912-1927 |journal=PalArch's Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology |volume=3 |issue=2 |url=http://www.palarch.nl/wp-content/ver_2004_3_2.pdf}}</ref> His work, originally written in [[Danish language|Danish]] as ''Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamning'', was compiled, translated into English, and published in 1926 as ''[[The Origin of Birds (book)|The Origin of Birds]]''.
[[File:Proav16 large.jpg|thumb|left|Heilmann's hypothetical illustration of a pair of fighting '[[Proavis|Proaves]]' from 1916]]
Like Huxley, Heilmann compared ''Archaeopteryx'' and other birds to an exhaustive list of prehistoric reptiles, and also came to the conclusion that theropod dinosaurs like ''Compsognathus'' were the most similar. However, Heilmann noted that birds had [[clavicle]]s (collar bones) fused to form a bone called the [[furcula]] ("wishbone"), and while clavicles were known in more primitive reptiles, they had not yet been recognized in dinosaurs. Since he was a firm believer in [[Dollo's law]], which states that evolution is not reversible, Heilmann could not accept that clavicles were lost in dinosaurs and re-evolved in birds. He was therefore forced to rule out dinosaurs as bird ancestors and ascribe all of their similarities to [[convergent evolution]]. Heilmann stated that bird ancestors would instead be found among the more primitive "[[Thecodontia|thecodont]]" grade of reptiles.<ref name=heilmann>{{cite book |last=Heilmann |first=Gerhard |year=1926 |title=The Origin of Birds |location=London |publisher=Witherby |page=[https://archive.org/details/originofbirds0000heil/page/208 208pp] |isbn=978-0-486-22784-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/originofbirds0000heil/page/208 }}</ref> Heilmann's extremely thorough approach ensured that his book became a classic in the field, and its conclusions on bird origins, as with most other topics, were accepted by nearly all evolutionary biologists for the next four decades.<ref name=padian2004>{{cite book |last=Padian |first=Kevin. |year=2004 |chapter=Basal Avialae |editor=[[David B.

Clavicles are relatively delicate bones and therefore in danger of being destroyed or at least damaged beyond recognition. Nevertheless, some fossil theropod clavicles had actually been excavated before Heilmann wrote his book but these had been misidentified.<ref>For example in 1923, three years before Heilmans's book, [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] found a good ''[[Oviraptor]]'' fossil in ''[[Mongolia]]'', but [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], who analyzed the fossil in 1924, misidentified the furcula as an [[interclavicle]]; described in {{cite book |title = Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds|author = Paul, G.S.|year = 2002|publisher = JHU Press|isbn = 978-0-8018-6763-7|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OUwXzD3iihAC&q=oviraptor+furcula&pg=PA9}} <!--The first correct identification of dinosaur clavicles / furcula was in 1983, also in an ''Oviraptor'': {{cite journal |author=Barsbold, R. |date=1983 |title=[Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Trudy Soumestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontogicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=19 |pages=1–117 (in Russian!) }} --></ref>
The absence of clavicles in dinosaurs became the orthodox view despite the discovery of clavicles in the primitive theropod ''[[Segisaurus]]'' in 1936.<ref name=camp>{{cite journal |last=Camp |first=Charles L. |author-link=Charles Lewis Camp |year=1936 |title=A new type of small theropod dinosaur from the Navajo Sandstone of Arizona |journal=Bulletin of the University of California Department of Geological Sciences |volume=24 |pages=39–65}}</ref> The next report of clavicles in a dinosaur was in a Russian article in 1983.<ref name="Barsbold1983CarnivorousDinosCretaceousMongolia">In an ''[[oviraptorosauria|Oviraptor]]'': {{cite journal |author=Barsbold, R. |year=1983 |title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |journal=Trudy Soumestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontogicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=19 |pages=1–117 |language=ru }} See the summary and pictures at {{cite web |url=http://www.hmnh.org/archives/2007/10/11/a-wish-for-coelophysis/ |title=A wish for ''Coelophysis'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203064406/http://www.hmnh.org/archives/2007/10/11/a-wish-for-coelophysis/ |archive-date=February 3, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Contrary to what Heilmann believed, paleontologists now accept that clavicles and in most cases furculae are a standard feature not just of theropods but of [[saurischia]]n dinosaurs. Up to late 2007 ossified furculae (i.e. made of bone rather than [[cartilage]]) have been found in all types of theropods except the most basal ones, ''[[Eoraptor]]'' and ''[[Herrerasaurus]]''.<ref name="LipkinSerenoHorner2007FurculaSuchomimusTyrannosaurus">{{cite journal |author=Lipkin, C., Sereno, P.C., and Horner, J.R. |journal=Journal of Paleontology |date=November 2007 |volume=81 |pages=1523–1527 |doi=10.1666/06-024.1 |url=http://jpaleontol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/81/6/1523 |title=The Furcula In Suchomimus Tenerensis And Tyrannosaurus Rex (Dinosauria: Theropoda: Tetanurae) |issue=6 |s2cid=86234363 }} - full text currently online at {{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1139122/the_furcula_in_suchomimus_tenerensis_and_tyrannosaurus_rex_dinosauria_theropoda/index.html |title=The Furcula in ''Suchomimus Tenerensis'' and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |access-date=2008-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522043704/http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1139122/the_furcula_in_suchomimus_tenerensis_and_tyrannosaurus_rex_dinosauria_theropoda/index.html |archive-date=2011-05-22 |url-status=dead |date=2007-11-11 }} This lists a large number of theropods in which furculae have been found, as well as describing those of ''Suchomimus Tenerensis'' and ''Tyrannosaurus rex''.</ref> The original report of a furcula in the primitive theropod ''[[Segisaurus]]'' (1936) was confirmed by a re-examination in 2005.<ref name="CarranoHutchinsonSampson2005Segisaurus">{{cite journal |author=Carrano, M.R., Hutchinson, J.R., and Sampson, S.D. |title=New information on ''Segisaurus halli'', a small theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of Arizona |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=835–849 |date=December 2005 |url=http://www.rvc.ac.uk/AboutUs/Staff/jhutchinson/documents/JH18.pdf |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0835:NIOSHA]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512053601/http://www.rvc.ac.uk/AboutUs/Staff/jhutchinson/documents/JH18.pdf |archive-date=2006-05-12 }}</ref> Joined, furcula-like clavicles have also been found in ''[[Massospondylus]]'', an Early Jurassic [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]].<ref name=YV05>{{cite journal |last1=Yates |first1=Adam M. |author2=and Vasconcelos, Cecilio C. |year=2005 |title=Furcula-like clavicles in the prosauropod dinosaur ''Massospondylus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=466–468 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0466:FCITPD]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref><!--Other sources for furcuale / clavicles - KEEP IN CASE CarranoHutchinsonSampson2005Segisaurus or LipkinSerenoHorner2007FurculaSuchomimusTyrannosaurus goes off-line:

At one time, it was believed that dinosaurs lacked [[furcula]]e (fused left and right [[clavicle]]s, or "wishbones"). This was considered an overwhelming argument to refute the dinosaur ancestry of birds by Heilmann (1926). However, it has been shown since then that numerous [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropod species indeed have a furcula,<ref>Included as a cladistic definer, e.g. [http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/courses/v1001/masterclads.html (Columbia University) Master Cladograms] or mentioned even in the broadest context, such as  {{cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.earth.25.1.435 | last1 = Sereno | first1 = Paul C. | year = 1997| title = The origin and evolution of dinosaurs | journal = Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 435–489 |bibcode = 1997AREPS..25..435S }}</ref> apparently a tetanuran innovation.

===Digit homology===
There is a debate between [[embryology|embryologists]] and [[paleontology|paleontologists]] whether the hands of [[theropoda|theropod]] dinosaurs and birds are essentially different, based on [[Phalanges of the hand|phalangeal]] counts, a count of the number of phalanges (fingers) in the hand. This is an important and fiercely debated area of research because its results may challenge the consensus that birds are (descendants of) dinosaurs.

Embryologists and some paleontologists who oppose the bird-dinosaur link have long numbered the digits of birds II-III-IV on the basis of multiple studies of the development in the egg.<ref name=Chatterjee>{{cite journal|last=Chatterjee|first=Sankar|author-link=Sankar Chatterjee|title=Counting the Fingers of Birds and Dinosaurs|date=17 April 1998|doi=10.1126/science.280.5362.355a|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5362|pages=355a–355|bibcode=1998Sci...280..355C|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is based on the fact that in most [[amniote]]s, the first digit to form in a 5-fingered hand is digit IV, which develops a primary axis. Therefore, embryologists have identified the primary axis in birds as digit IV, and the surviving digits as II-III-IV. The fossils of advanced [[theropoda|theropod]] ([[Tetanurae]]) hands appear to have the digits I-II-III (some genera within [[Avetheropoda]] also have a reduced digit IV<ref>[[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm "Theropoda I" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.</ref>). 
If this is true, then the II-III-IV development of digits in birds is an indication against theropod (dinosaur) ancestry. However, with no [[ontogeny|ontogenical]] (developmental) basis to definitively state which digits are which on a theropod hand (because no non-avian theropods can be observed growing and developing today), the labelling of the theropod hand is not absolutely conclusive.

Paleontologists have traditionally identified avian digits as I-II-III. They argue that the digits of birds number I-II-III, just as those of theropod dinosaurs do, by the conserved phalangeal formula. The phalangeal count for archosaurs is 2-3-4-5-3; many archosaur lineages have a reduced number of digits, but have the same [[phalanx bones|phalangeal formula]] in the digits that remain. In other words, paleontologists assert that archosaurs of different lineages tend to lose the same digits when digit loss occurs, from the outside to the inside. The three digits of [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], and ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' have the same phalangeal formula of I-II-III as digits I-II-III of [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] archosaurs. Therefore, the lost digits would be V and IV. If this is true, then modern birds would also possess digits I-II-III.<ref name=Chatterjee/> 
Also, one 1999 publication proposed a frame-shift in the digits of the theropod line leading to birds (thus making digit I into digit II, II to III, and so forth).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.9.5111 | last1 = Wagner | first1 = G.

However, such frame shifts are rare in amniotes and—to be consistent with the theropod origin of birds—would have had to occur solely in the bird-theropod lineage forelimbs and not the hindlimbs (a condition unknown in any animal).<ref>[http://8e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=16&id=161 Developmental Biology 8e Online.

===Thermogenic muscle hypothesis===
A 2011 publication suggested that selection for the expansion of [[skeletal muscle]], rather than the evolution of flight, was the driving force for the emergence of this clade.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Newman SA | title = Thermogenesis, muscle hyperplasia, and the origin of birds | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | pages = 653–656 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21695679 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100061 | issue = 9| s2cid = 42012034 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman SA, Mezentseva NV, Badyaev AV | title = Gene loss, thermogenesis, and the origin of birds | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1289 | pages = 36–47 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23550607 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12090 | issue = 1| bibcode = 2013NYASA1289...36N | s2cid = 12240405 }}</ref> Muscles became larger in prospectively [[warm-blooded|endothermic]] [[saurian]]s, according to this hypothesis, as a response to the loss of the [[vertebrate]] [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[uncoupling protein]], [[UCP1]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mezentseva NV, Kumaratilake JS, Newman SA | title  =  The brown adipocyte differentiation pathway in birds: An evolutionary road not taken | journal = BMC Biology | volume = 6 | page = 17 | year = 2008 |  doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-17 | pmid = 18426587 | pmc = 2375860 | issue=1}}</ref> which is [[Thermogenics|thermogenic]]. In [[mammal]]s, UCP1 functions within [[brown adipose tissue]] to protect newborns against [[hypothermia]]. 
In modern birds, skeletal muscle serves a similar function and is presumed to have done so in their ancestors. In this view, [[bipedality]] and other avian [[skeleton|skeletal]] alterations were side effects of muscle [[hyperplasia]], with further evolutionary modifications of the forelimbs, including adaptations for flight or swimming, and [[vestigiality]], being secondary consequences of two-leggedness.

''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', the first good example of a "feathered dinosaur", was discovered in 1861. The first specimen was found in the [[Solnhofen limestone]] in southern Germany, which is a ''[[lagerstätte]]'', a rare and remarkable [[geology|geological]] formation known for its superbly detailed fossils. ''Archaeopteryx'' is a [[transitional fossil]], with features clearly intermediate between those of non-avian theropod dinosaurs and [[birds]]. Discovered just two years after Darwin's seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'', its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one [[Biological specimen|specimen]] was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=PW88>{{cite journal | last1 = Wellnhofer | first1 = P. | year = 1988 | title = Ein neuer Exemplar von ''Archaeopteryx'' | journal = Archaeopteryx | volume = 6 | pages = 1–30 }}</ref>

Since the 1990s, a number of additional [[feathered dinosaurs]] have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. The first of these were initially described as simple filamentous ''protofeathers'', which were reported in dinosaur lineages as primitive as [[Compsognathidae|compsognathids]] and [[Tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosauroids]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15470426  |name-list-style=vanc| last1 = Xu | first1 = X| doi=10.1038/nature02855 | last2 = Norell | first2 = MA | last3 = Kuang | first3 = X | last4 = Wang | first4 = X | last5 = Zhao | first5 = Q | last6 = Jia | first6 = C | title = Basal tyrannosauroids from China and evidence for protofeathers in tyrannosauroids | journal = Nature | volume=431 | issue=7009 |date=October 2004 | pages=680–4|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..680X |s2cid=4381777}}</ref> However, feathers indistinguishable from those of modern birds were soon after found in non-avialan dinosaurs as well.<ref name = "jietal1998"/>

A small minority of researchers have claimed that the simple filamentous "protofeather" structures are simply the result of the decomposition of collagen fiber under the dinosaurs' skin or in fins along their backs, and that species with unquestionable feathers, such as [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]] and [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]] are not dinosaurs, but true birds unrelated to dinosaurs.<ref name=feducciaetal2012>Feduccia, A.

===Skeleton===
Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the [[transitional fossil|missing link]] between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for [[paleontology|paleontologists]]. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that the relationship between birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably [[Gregory S. Paul]], conclude that dinosaurs such as the [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]] may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers in a manner similar to the modern [[ostrich]] and other [[ratite]]s.

Comparisons of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]], strengthens the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called [[maniraptora|maniraptors]]. Skeletal similarities include the neck, [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[wrist]] (semi-lunate [[Carpal bones|carpal]]), arm and [[pectoral girdle]], [[scapula|shoulder blade]], [[furcula|clavicle]], and [[keel (bird)|breast bone]].

A study comparing embryonic, juvenile and adult archosaur skulls concluded that bird skulls are derived from those of [[theropod]] dinosaurs by [[progenesis]], a type of paedomorphic [[heterochrony]], which resulted in retention of juvenile characteristics of their ancestors.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bhullar | first1 = B.

===Lungs===
[[File:Dino bird h.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.75|Comparison between the air sacs of ''Majungasaurus'' and a bird (duck)]]
<!-- ZoolJLinnSoc112 p389 -->
Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation led by Patrick M. O'Connor of [[Ohio University]]. In theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had birdlike feet) flexible soft tissue air sacs likely pumped air through the stiff lungs, as is the case in birds. "What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds", O'Connor said.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = P.M. | last2 = Claessens | first2 = L.P.A.M. | year = 2005 | title = Basic avian pulmonary design and flow-through ventilation in non-avian theropod dinosaurs | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = 7048| doi=10.1038/nature03716 | pmid=16015329 | bibcode=2005Natur.436..253O | pages = 253–6| s2cid = 4390587 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Paul C.

===Heart===

A study published in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry to the question of the object's identity, including more advanced CT scanning, [[histology]], [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], and [[scanning electron]] microscopy. From these methods, the authors found that: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an [[ostrich]]'s heart; the "walls" are composed of [[sedimentary]] minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as goethite, [[feldspar]] minerals, [[quartz]], and [[gypsum]], as well as some plant fragments; [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], [[chemical element]]s important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.<ref name=TCetal11>{{cite journal |last1=Cleland |first1=Timothy P. |author2=Stoskopf, Michael K.; and Schweitzer, Mary H. |title=Histological, chemical, and morphological reexamination of the "heart" of a small Late Cretaceous ''Thescelosaurus'' |journal=Naturwissenschaften |year=2011 |volume=98 |doi=10.1007/s00114-010-0760-1 |issue=3 |pages=203–211|bibcode = 2011NW.....98..203C |pmid=21279321 |s2cid=2408562 }}</ref>

The question of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity.<ref name=TCetal11/> Both modern [[crocodilia]]ns and [[bird]]s, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.<ref name=CH04>Chinsamy, Anusuya; and Hillenius, Willem J. (2004). "Physiology of nonavian dinosaurs". ''The Dinosauria'', 2nd. 643–659.</ref>

===Sleeping posture===
Fossils of the [[Troodontidae|troodonts]] ''[[Mei (dinosaur)|Mei]]'' and ''[[Sinornithoides]]'' demonstrate that the dinosaurs slept like certain modern birds, with their heads tucked under their arms.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature02898 | last1 = Xu | first1 = X. | last2 = Norell | first2 = M.A. | year = 2004 | title = A new troodontid dinosaur from China with avian-like sleeping posture | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7010| pages = 838–41 | pmid = 15483610 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..838X| s2cid = 4362745 }} [https://www.theguardian.com/life/news/story/0,12976,1326559,00.html See commentary on the article]</ref> This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds.

===Reproductive biology===
When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone in their limbs. This [[medulla ossea|medullary]] bone forms as a calcium-rich layer inside the hard outer bone, and is used as a calcium source to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' specimen's hind limb suggested that ''T. rex'' used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed that the specimen is female.<ref name="schweitzeretal2005">{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=M.H. |author2=Wittmeyer, J.L.; and Horner, J.R. |year=2005 |title=Gender-specific reproductive tissue in ratites and ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |journal=Science |volume=308 |pages=1456–60|doi=10.1126/science.1112158 |pmid=15933198 |issue=5727|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1456S |s2cid=30264554 }}</ref> Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''.

===Brooding and care of young===

Several ''[[Citipati (dinosaur)|Citipati]]'' specimens have been found resting over the eggs in its nest in a position most reminiscent of [[avian incubation|brooding]].<ref name="NorellEtAl1994TheropodDinosaurEmbryo">{{cite journal |date=November 1994 |title=A theropod dinosaur embryo and the affinities of the Flaming Cliffs Dinosaur eggs |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5186 |pages=779–82 |doi=10.1126/science.266.5186.779 |author=Norell, M.

Numerous dinosaur species, for example ''[[Maiasaura]]'', have been found in herds mixing both very young and adult individuals, suggesting rich interactions between them.

A dinosaur embryo was found without teeth, which suggests some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur, possibly the adult dinosaur regurgitated food into the young dinosaur's mouth (''see'' [[altricial]]). This behaviour is seen in numerous bird species; parent birds regurgitate food into the hatchling's mouth.

===Gizzard stones===
Both birds and dinosaurs use [[gizzard]] stones. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibres once they enter the stomach. When found in association with [[fossil]]s, gizzard stones are called [[gastrolith]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wings O|title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification|journal=Palaeontologica Polonica|volume=52|issue=1|pages=1–16|year=2007|url=http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app52-001.html}}</ref>
Gizzard stones are also found in some fish ([[Mullet (fish)|mullets]], [[American gizzard shad|mud shad]], and the [[gillaroo]], a type of trout) and in crocodiles.

===Molecular evidence ===
On several occasions, the extraction of DNA and proteins from Mesozoic dinosaurs fossils has been claimed, allowing for a comparison with birds. Several [[protein]]s have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12952172 | last1 = Embery | first1 = G| doi=10.1080/03008200390152070 | last2 = Milner | first2 = AC | last3 = Waddington | first3 = RJ | last4 = Hall | first4 = RC | last5 = Langley | first5 = MS | last6 = Milan | first6 = AM | title = Identification of proteinaceous material in the bone of the dinosaur Iguanodon | journal = Connective Tissue Research | volume=44 |issue=Suppl 1 | year=2003 | pages=41–6| s2cid = 2249126 }}</ref> including [[hemoglobin]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9177210 | last1 = Schweitzer | pmc = 21042 | first1 = MH| doi=10.1073/pnas.94.12.6291 | last2 = Marshall | first2 = M | last3 = Carron | first3 = K | last4 = Bohle | first4 = DS | last5 = Busse | first5 = SC | last6 = Arnold | first6 = EV | last7 = Barnard | first7 = D | last8 = Horner | first8 = JR | last9 = Starkey | first9 = JR  | title = Heme compounds in dinosaur trabecular bone | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=94 | issue=12 |date=June 1997 | pages=6291–6|bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.6291S}}</ref>

==Origin of bird flight==
{{Main|Origin of avian flight}}
Debates about the origin of bird flight are almost as old as the idea that birds evolved from [[dinosaur]]s, which arose soon after the discovery of ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' in 1862. Two theories have dominated most of the discussion since then: the cursorial ("from the ground up") theory proposes that birds evolved from small, fast predators that ran on the ground; the arboreal ("from the trees down") theory proposes that powered flight evolved from unpowered gliding by arboreal (tree-climbing) animals. A more recent theory, "wing-assisted incline running" (WAIR), is a variant of the cursorial theory and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as trees, which would help small feathered dinosaurs escape from predators.

In March 2018, scientists reported that ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was likely capable of [[Bird flight|flight]], but in a manner substantially different from that of [[Birds|modern birds]].<ref name="NAT-20180313">{{cite journal |author=Voeten, Dennis F.A.E.|display-authors=etal|title=Wing bone geometry reveals active flight in Archaeopteryx |date=13 March 2018 |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |volume=9 |pages=923 |number=923 |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-03296-8 |pmid=29535376 |pmc=5849612 |bibcode=2018NatCo...9..923V }}</ref><ref name="WP-20180313">{{cite news |last=Guarino |first=Ben |title=This feathery dinosaur probably flew, but not like any bird you know |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/03/13/this-feathery-dinosaur-probably-flew-but-not-like-any-bird-you-know/ |date=13 March 2018 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=13 March 2018 }}</ref>

===Cursorial ("from the ground up") theory===
[[File:Rahonavis NT.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of ''[[Rahonavis]]'', a ground-dwelling feathered dinosaur that some researchers think was well equipped for flight]]
The cursorial theory of the origin of flight was first proposed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], and elaborated upon by [[Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás|Baron Nopcsa]]. This hypothesis proposes that some fast-running animals with long tails used their arms to keep their balance while running. Modern versions of this theory differ in many details from the Williston-Nopcsa version, mainly as a result of discoveries since Nopcsa's time.

Nopcsa theorized that increasing the surface area of the outstretched arms could have helped small cursorial predators keep their balance, and that the scales of the forearms elongated, [[evolution|evolving]] into feathers. The feathers could also have been used to trap insects or other prey. Progressively, the animals leapt for longer distances, helped by their evolving wings. Nopcsa also proposed three stages in the evolution of flight. First, animals developed passive flight, in which developing wing structures served as a sort of [[parachute]]. Second, they achieved active flight by flapping the wings. He used ''Archaeopteryx'' as an example of this second stage. Finally, birds gained the ability to soar.<ref name="Terres">{{cite book|last=Terres|first=John K.|author-link=John Kenneth Terres|title=The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds|publisher=Knopf|year=1980|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398 398–401]|isbn=978-0-394-46651-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/audubonsocietyen00terr/page/398}}</ref>

Most recent refutations of the "from the ground up" hypothesis attempt to refute the modern version's assumption that birds are modified coelurosaurian dinosaurs.

===Wing-assisted incline running===
The [[wing-assisted incline running]] (WAIR) hypothesis was prompted by observation of young [[Chukar Partridge|chukar]] chicks, and proposes that wings developed their [[aerodynamic]] functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators.<ref name="YouTubeWAIR">There is a video clip of a very young chick doing this at {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNxt_-f9dmw |title=Wing assisted incline running and evolution of flight}}</ref> This makes it a specialized type of cursorial ("from the ground up") theory.

===Arboreal ("from the trees down") theory===
[[File:Microraptor gui (dinos).jpg|thumb|right|The four-winged ''[[Microraptor]]'', a member of the Dromaeosauridae, a group of dinosaurs closely related to birds]]
Most versions of the arboreal hypothesis state that the ancestors of birds were very small dinosaurs that lived in trees, springing from branch to branch. This small dinosaur already had feathers, which were co-opted by evolution to produce longer, stiffer forms that were useful in aerodynamics, eventually producing wings. Wings would have then evolved and become increasingly refined as devices to give the leaper more control, to parachute, to glide, and to fly in stepwise fashion. The arboreal hypothesis also notes that, for arboreal animals, aerodynamics are far more energy efficient, since such animals simply fall to achieve minimum gliding speeds.<ref name="Chatterjee2004">Chatterjee, Sankar, Templin, R.J.

Several small dinosaurs from the Jurassic or Early Cretaceous, all with feathers, have been interpreted as possibly having arboreal and/or aerodynamic adaptations. These include ''[[Scansoriopteryx]]'', ''[[Epidexipteryx]]'', ''[[Microraptor]]'', ''[[Pedopenna]]'', and ''[[Anchiornis]]''. ''Anchiornis'' is particularly important to this subject, as it lived at the beginning of the Late Jurassic, long before ''Archaeopteryx''.<ref name="Hu et al.2009">{{Cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=D. |last2=Hou |first2=L. |last3=Zhang |first3=L. |last4=Xu |first4=X. |name-list-style=amp |year=2009 |title=A pre-''Archaeopteryx'' troodontid theropod from China with long feathers on the metatarsus |journal=Nature |volume=461 |issue=7264 |pages=640–3 |doi=10.1038/nature08322 |pmid=19794491 |bibcode=2009Natur.461..640H|s2cid=205218015 }}</ref>

===Diminished significance of ''Archaeopteryx''===
''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' was the first and for a long time the only known feathered [[Mesozoic]] animal. As a result, discussion of the evolution of birds and of bird flight centered on ''Archaeopteryx'' at least until the mid-1990s.
[[File:WingMuscles.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The supracoracoideus works using a pulley-like system to lift the wing while the pectorals provide the powerful downstroke.]]
There has been debate about whether ''Archaeopteryx'' could really fly. It appears that ''Archaeopteryx'' had the brain structures and inner-ear balance sensors that birds use to control their flight.<ref name="AlonsoMilnerEtAl2004AvianBrainInnerEarArchaeopteryx">{{cite journal |title=The avian nature of the brain and inner ear of Archaeopteryx |journal=Nature |volume=430 |issue=7000 |pages=666–9|date=August 2004 |doi=10.1038/nature02706 |author=Alonso, P.D., Milner, A.C., Ketcham, R.A., Cokson, M.J and Rowe, T.B. |pmid=15295597 |bibcode=2004Natur.430..666A|s2cid=4391019 }}</ref> ''Archaeopteryx'' also had a wing feather arrangement like that of modern birds and similarly asymmetrical flight feathers on its wings and tail. But ''Archaeopteryx'' lacked the [[Bird anatomy#Muscular system|shoulder mechanism]] by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes (see diagram above of supracoracoideus pulley); this may mean that it and other early birds were incapable of flapping flight and could only glide.<ref name="Senter2006ScapularOrientation"/>

But the discovery since the early 1990s of many [[feathered dinosaurs]] means that ''Archaeopteryx'' is no longer the key figure in the evolution of bird flight. Other small feathered coelurosaurs from the [[Cretaceous]] and Late [[Jurassic]] show possible precursors of avian flight.

<!-- What's this about? Is it claiming birds are polyphyletic? And why specifically "ancestors of Neornithes"? Or is it suggesting Archaeopteryx is no longer the central character (a reasonable idea).
[[Exaptation]]s for true avian flight, as opposed to gliding or four-winged flight, apparently evolved in a group of closely related species. These then evolved into different lineages, each featuring a slightly different approach to the challenge, and probably were well advanced in this process already by the time of ''Archaeopteryx''. Thus, the question might be rephrased more accurately: "did the ancestors of [[Neornithes]] develop flight from the ground up or from trees (slopes, cliffs...) down?"

</div>Simplified cladogram from Mayr ''et al.'' (2005)<br />Groups usually regarded as birds are in bold type.<ref name=mayretal2005/></div>

A hypothesis, credited to [[Gregory Paul]] and propounded in his books ''Predatory Dinosaurs of the World'' (1988) and ''Dinosaurs of the Air'' (2002), suggests that some groups of non-flying carnivorous dinosaurs - especially [[deinonychosaur]]s, but perhaps others such as [[oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaurs]], [[therizinosaur]]s, [[alvarezsauridae|alvarezsaurids]] and [[ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] - actually descend from birds. Paul also proposed that the bird ancestor of these groups was more advanced in its flight adaptations than ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. The hypothesis would mean that ''Archaeopteryx'' is less closely related to extant birds than these dinosaurs are.<ref name=Paul2002>Paul, G.S. (2002). "Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds." Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. page 257</ref>

Paul's hypothesis received additional support when Mayr ''et al.'' (2005) analyzed a new, tenth specimen of ''Archaeopteryx'', and concluded that ''Archaeopteryx'' was the sister clade to the Deinonychosauria, but that the more  advanced bird ''[[Confuciusornis]]'' was within the Dromaeosauridae. This result supports Paul's hypothesis, suggesting that the Deinonychosauria and the Troodontidae are part of Aves, the bird lineage proper, and secondarily flightless.<ref name=MayrPetersSept2006>{{cite journal | last1=Mayr | first1=G. | title=Response to Comment on ''A Well-Preserved Archaeopteryx Specimen with Theropod Features''| journal = Science | volume= 313 | year= 2006 |page= 1238c | doi = 10.1126/science.1130964 | issue=5791 |bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1238M | doi-access= free }}</ref> This paper, however, excluded all other birds and thus did not sample their character distributions. The paper was criticized by Corfe and Butler (2006) who found the authors could not support their conclusions statistically. Mayr ''et al.'' agreed that the statistical support was weak, but added that it is also weak for the alternative scenarios.<ref name="CorfeButler2006">{{cite journal | last1=Corfe | first1=I.

Current [[cladistic analysis|cladistic analyses]] do not support Paul's hypothesis about the position of ''Archaeopteryx''. Instead, they indicate that ''Archaeopteryx'' is closer to birds, within the clade ''[[Avialae]]'', than it is to deinonychosaurs or oviraptorosaurs. However, some fossils support the version of this theory that holds that some non-flying carnivorous dinosaurs may have had flying ancestors. In particular, ''[[Microraptor]]'', ''[[Pedopenna]]'', and ''[[Anchiornis]]'' all have winged feet, share many features, and lie close to the base of the clade [[Paraves]]. This suggests that the ancestral paravian was a four-winged glider, and that larger Deinonychosaurs secondarily lost the ability to glide, while the bird lineage increased in aerodynamic ability as it progressed.<ref name=Witmer2009>{{cite journal | last1= Witmer | first1= LM | title= Palaeontology: Feathered dinosaurs in a tangle | journal= Nature | volume= 461 | issue= 7264 | pages= 601–2 | year= 2009 | pmid = 19794481 | doi= 10.1038/461601a |bibcode = 2009Natur.461..601W | s2cid= 205049989 }}</ref> ''[[Deinonychus]]'' may also display partial volancy, with the young being capable of flight or gliding and the adults being flightless.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Parsons | first1 = William L. | last2 = Parsons | first2 = Kristen M. | year = 2015 | title = Morphological Variations within the Ontogeny of Deinonychus antirrhopus (Theropoda, Dromaeosauridae) | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 4| page = e0121476 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0121476 | pmid = 25875499 | pmc = 4398413 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1021476P }}</ref> In 2018, a study concluded that the last common ancestor of the [[Pennaraptora]] had joint surfaces on the fingers, and between the metatarsus and the wrist, that were optimised to stabilise the hand in flight. This was seen as an indication for secondary flightlessness in heavy basal members of that group.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hutson | first1 = Joel D. | last2 = Hutson | first2 = Kelda N. | year = 2018 | title = Retention of the flight-adapted avian finger-joint complex in the Ostrich helps identify when wings began evolving in dinosaurs | journal = Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology | volume =  89| issue = 2| pages =  173–186| doi = 10.2989/00306525.2017.1422566 | s2cid = 91081348 }}</ref>

In [[Euornithes]], the earliest unequivocal example of secondary flightlessness is ''[[Patagopteryx]]''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chiappe|first=Luis|title=Osteology of the Flightless Patagopteryx deferrariisi from the Late Cretaceous of Patagonia (Argentina)|date=2002-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281640883|pages=281–316|isbn=978-0-520-20094-4|access-date=2020-07-27}}</ref>
