'''Cosmogony''' is any model concerning the origin of either the [[cosmos]] or the [[universe]].<ref name="DicAstro2">{{cite encyclopedia|title=A Dictionary of Astronomy|last=Ridpath|first=Ian|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012}}</ref><ref name="CosmoToday2">{{cite journal|last=Woolfson|first=Michael Mark|author-link=Michael Woolfson|year=1979|title=Cosmogony Today|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=20|issue=2|pages=97–114|bibcode=1979QJRAS..20...97W}}</ref><ref name="TU-201409172">{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ge/gona&la=greek|title=γίγνομαι – come into a new state of being|author=Staff|work=[[Tufts University]]|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>

== Overview ==

=== Scientific theories ===
[[File:Universe expansion-en.svg|thumb|The [[Big Bang]] theory, which states that the universe originally expanded from high or infinite density, is widely accepted by physicists.]]
In [[astronomy]], cosmogony refers to the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the universe, the [[Solar System]], or the [[Earth–Moon system]].<ref name="DicAstro2"/><ref name="CosmoToday2"/> The prevalent [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[scientific theory|model]] of the early development of the [[universe]] is the [[Big Bang]] theory.<ref name="Wollack">{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011}}</ref> [[Sean M.

It is generally accepted that the universe began at a point of singularity, and when the singularity of the universe started to expand, the Big Bang occurred, which evidently began the universe. The other explanation, held by proponents like [[Stephen Hawking]], asserts that "time" did not exist when it emerged along with the universe. This assertion implies that the universe does not have an origin story. Time did not exist "prior" to the creation of the universe. Hence, it is unclear whether properties such as space, or time emerged with the singularity and the universe as it is known.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity|last=Carroll|first=Sean|last2=Carroll|first2=Sean M.|publisher=Pearson|year=2003}}</ref>

Despite the research, there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe's existence (during the [[Planck epoch]]) due to a lack of a testable theory of [[quantum gravity]]. Nevertheless, researchers in [[string theory]], its extensions (see [[M-theory|M theory]]), and of [[loop quantum cosmology]] like [[Barton Zwiebach]] and Washington Taylor, have proposed solutions to assist in the explanation of the universe's earliest moments<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/research-strings.html|title=String Theory/Holography/Gravity|website=Center for Theoretical Physics|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning. The proposed theoretical scenarios include [[string theory]], [[M-theory]], the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle—Hawking initial state]], [[String theory landscape|string landscape]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]], the [[Big Bang]], and the [[ekpyrotic universe]]. Some of these proposed scenarios, like the [[string theory]], are compatible; whereas, others are not.<ref>{{Cite book|title=String Theory and M-Theory|last=Becker|first=Katrin|last2=Becker|first2=Melanie|last3=Schwartz|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|location=Cambridge, UK}}</ref>
[[File:Calabi-Yau.png|thumb|left|200px|Projection of a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] from [[string theory]]. In [[quantum physics]], there remain different, plausible theories regarding what combination of "stuff", space, or time emerged along with the singularity (and therefore this universe).<ref name=Carroll>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2012/04/28/a-universe-from-nothing/|title=A Universe from Nothing?, by Sean Carroll, Discover Magazine Blogs, 28 April 2012.|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=28 April 2012}}</ref> The main disagreement among theories is whether [[time]] existed "before" the emergence of our universe.]]

=== Mythology ===
[[File:Sumerian creation myth.jpg|thumb|Written on this Sumerian tablet are parts of the creation epic, [[Sumerian creation myth|Eridu Genesis.]]]]
Cosmogony does not only relate to scientific theories, but also has connections to the [[humanities]], more specifically [[creation myth]]s. Creation, or cosmogonic myths, explain the creation of the [[universe]] or the [[cosmos]] by either

* a [[God|supreme being]], or beings,
* the process of [[metamorphosis]], 
* the copulation of female and male [[Deity|deities]], 
* through [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], or 
* via the [[World egg|cosmic egg]] (also known as [[world egg]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/creation-myth#ref1239147|title=Creation Myth|last=Long|first=Charles|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref>

Before cosmogony had roots in scientific theories, creation myths were used to provide explanations for the origin story of the universe. For instance, [[Sumerian creation myth|Eridu Genesis]], the oldest known creation myth founded on [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Sumerian tablets]], reveal how the epic concerned itself with the creation of the world, formulating of cities, and a great flood. The universe was created out of the primeval sea (see also [[Abzu]]), and thus, the gods are created and men were created to tend to nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eridu-Genesis|title=Eridu Genesis Mesopotamia Epic|date=20 July 1998|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Charles|date=1897|title=The Primeval Ocean|journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|volume=49|pages=12–17|jstor=4062253}}</ref> Creation myths vary, but they may share a similar deity or [[symbol]]. For instance, the ruler of the gods in [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]], is similar to the ruler of the gods in [[Roman mythology]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] ([[Jove]]).<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mythology Contemporary Approaches to Classical and World Myths, 4th ed.|last=Thury|first=Eva|last2=Devinney|first2=Margaret|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|location=Madison Avenue, New York|pages=4, 187}}</ref> Another example is the ruler of the gods in Tagalog mythology, [[Bathala]], who is similar to various rulers of certain pantheons within [[Philippine mythology|the varied mythologies in the Philippines]] such as the Bisaya's [[Philippine mythology|Kaptan]].<ref>Garverza, J.

== Compared with cosmology ==
Cosmogony can be distinguished from [[cosmology]], which studies the universe at large, its existence and does not inquire directly into the source of its origins. Yet, there is little ambiguity between cosmogony and cosmology in terms of the [[humanities]]. For instance, the cosmological argument from [[theology]] regarding the existence of God is an appeal to cosmogonical rather than cosmological ideas. However, in practice, there is a scientific distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/cosmology/|title=Philosophy of Cosmology|last=Smeenk|first=Christopher|last2=Ellis|first2=George|date=Winter 2017|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref> [[Physical cosmology]] is the science that attempts to explain all observations relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe as a whole. Questions regarding why the universe behaves in such a way have been described by physicists and cosmologists as being extra-scientific (i.e., [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]), though speculations are made from a variety of perspectives that include extrapolation of scientific theories to untested regimes (i.e., at [[Planck's law|Planck]] scales), and philosophical or religious ideas.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name="Wollack" />
