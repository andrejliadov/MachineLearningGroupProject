The "'''Azes era'''" (also known as the ''Aja'' or ''Ajasa'' era, [[Prakrit]]: ''Ayasa vaṣaye'')<ref>{{cite journal |title=Silk Road Art and Archaeology |journal=Journal of the Institute of Silk Road Studies, Kamakura |date=2003 |volume=9 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVDrAAAAMAAJ |publisher=The Institute |language=en}}</ref> starting 47/46 BCE,<ref name="HF"/> was named after the [[Indo-Scythian]] king, "King Azes the Great" or [[Azes I]]. As a number of inscriptions are dated in this era it is of great importance in dating the reigns of several kings and events in early [[Indian history]].

Earlier, some scholars believed that the Azes era was same as the [[Vikrama Samvat]] (57 BCE) used in on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of [[Vijayamitra]], which is dated in two eras.<ref>{{cite book |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC |date=2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-18566-1 |page=103}}</ref> Research by Falk and Bennett (2009) shows that these two were indeed separate eras, and that the Azes era can be dated with a high degree of likelihood to 47 BCE, or c. 48/47 or 47/46 BCE, depending on whether it began in the spring or the autumn.<ref>Falk and Bennett (2009), pp. 197-215.</ref><ref name="HF">{{cite journal |last1=Falk |first1=Harry |title=Ancient Indian Eras: An Overview |journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute |volume=21 |date=2007 |pages=136 |jstor=24049367 }}</ref>

It is now thought that the Azes era was probably created by Azes as a continuation of the [[Arsacid era]] which started in 247 BCE and marked the foundation of the [[Parthian Empire]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The "Arsacid" era – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arsacids-v |website=www.iranicaonline.org |publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica}}</ref> year 1 of Azes corresponding exactly to year 201 of the Arsacid era.<ref name="HF"/>

The Azes era was recently connected to the [[Yavana era]] thanks to the [[Rukhana reliquary]] inscription.
