The issue of why the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] did not act on early reports of atrocities in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] by destroying it or its railways by air during [[World War II]] has been a subject of controversy since the late 1970s. Brought to public attention by a 1978 article from historian [[David Wyman]], it has been descried by [[Michael Berenbaum]] as "a moral question emblematic of the Allied response to the plight of the [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]]",<ref name="BerenbaumEB"/> and whether or not the Allies had the requisite knowledge and the technical capability to act continues to be explored by historians.

In 1942, Lieutenant [[Jan Karski]] reported to the Polish, British and U.S. governments on the situation in [[occupied Poland]], especially the [[Grossaktion Warsaw (1942)|liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto]] and the general systematic extermination of the Poles and Jews nationally. He did not know about the murder by gas, repeating the common belief at the time that deported Jews were being exterminated with electricity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Joel Zisenwine |title=British Intelligence and information about murder by gas – A reappraisal |journal=Yad Vashem Studies |year=2013 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=151–186}}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> Karski met with the [[Polish government-in-exile]], including the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]], [[Władysław Sikorski]], as well as with members of political parties such as the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]], [[Labour Faction (1937)|Labor Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Labour Bund]] and [[Poalei Zion|Zionist Party]]. He also spoke to [[Anthony Eden]], the British Foreign Secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and in [[Belzec extermination camp|Bełżec]]. In 1943 in London he met the author and journalist [[Arthur Koestler]]. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

:Jews are being transported, in conditions of appalling horror and brutality, to Eastern Europe. In Poland, which has been made the principal Nazi slaughterhouse, the ghettoes established by the German invaders are being systematically emptied of all Jews except a few highly skilled workers required for war industries. None of those taken away are ever heard of again. The able-bodied are slowly worked to death in labour camps. The infirm are left to die of exposure and starvation or are deliberately massacred in mass executions. The number of victims of these bloody cruelties is reckoned in many hundreds of thousands of entirely innocent men, women and children. ... So far as the responsibility is concerned, I would certainly say it is the intention that all persons who can properly be held responsible for these crimes, whether they are the ringleaders or the actual perpetrators of the outrages, should be treated alike, and brought to book.

On 13 December 1942, the [[List of Chief Rabbis of the United Hebrew Congregations|Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom]] [[Joseph Hertz]], ordained a day of mourning to mark the suffering of "the numberless victims of the Satanic carnage". [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] wrote a letter to the Times to condemn ".. a horror beyond what imagination can grasp".

They discussed the question of [[Jew]]ish [[refugee]]s who had been liberated by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and of those who still remained in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe. The only agreement made was that the war against the Nazis must be won.

===Auschwitz prisoners reports===
====The Polish underground reports====
At the beginning of [[Operation Reinhard]], the principal source of intelligence for the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] about the existence of Auschwitz was the [[Witold's Report]], forwarded via the Polish resistance to the [[British government]] in [[London]]. It was written by the Polish Army Captain [[Witold Pilecki]] who spent a total of 945 days at the camp&nbsp;– the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz. He forwarded his report about the camp to [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] headquarters in [[Warsaw]] through the underground network known as [[Związek Organizacji Wojskowej]] which he organized inside Auschwitz.<ref name="Garlinski">[[Jozef Garlinski]], ''Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp'', [[Fawcett Publications|Fawcett]], 1975, {{ISBN|0-449-22599-2}}, reprinted by [[Time Life]] Education, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8094-8925-2}}</ref> [[Witold Pilecki|Pilecki]] hoped that either the Allies would drop weapons for the [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK) to organize an assault on the camp from the outside, or bring in the [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]] troops to liberate it. A spectacular escape took place on 20 June 1942, when [[Kazimierz Piechowski]] (prisoner no. 918) organized a daring passing through the camp's gate along with three friends and co-conspirators, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, Józef Lempart and Eugeniusz Bendera.<ref name="Piechowski">Kazimierz Piechowski, Eugenia Bozena Kodecka-Kaczynska, Michal Ziokowski, ''Byłem Numerem: swiadectwa Z Auschwitz'' Wydawn.

Polish reports about Auschwitz were also published in English versions.

====The Jewish escapees reports====
On April 7, 1944, two young Jewish inmates, [[Rudolf Vrba]] and [[Alfréd Wetzler]], had escaped from the [[Auschwitz]] camp with detailed information about the camp's geography, the gas chambers, and the numbers being killed. The information, later called the [[Vrba-Wetzler report]], is believed to have reached the Jewish community in [[Budapest]] by April 27. Roswell McClelland, the U.S. [[War Refugee Board]] representative in [[Switzerland]], is known to have received a copy by mid-June, and sent it to the board's executive director on June 16, according to [[Raul Hilberg]].<ref name="Hilberg1215">[[Raul Hilberg|Hilberg, Raul]].

The full report was first published on November 25, 1944, by the U.S. [[War Refugee Board]], the same day that the last 13 prisoners, all women, were killed in Auschwitz (the women were "unmittelbar getötet"—killed immediately—leaving open whether they were gassed or otherwise killed).<ref>Czech, Danuta (ed) ''Kalendarium der Ereignisse im Konzentrationslager Auschwitz-Birkenau 1939–1945'', Reinbek bei Hamburg, 1989, pp.920 and 933, using information from a series called ''Hefte von Auschwitz'', and cited in [[Karny, Miroslav]].

==Bombing Auschwitz: technical considerations==
The issue of bombing Auschwitz-Birkenau first attracted wide public attention in May 1978 with the publication in ''Commentary'' of the article "Why Auschwitz Was Never Bombed," by historian David S. Wyman (subsequently incorporated into his 1984 ''New York Times'' bestseller, ''The Abandonment of the Jews'').<ref>David S. Wyman, ''Commentary'' 65 (May 1978), 37–46.</ref> Since then, several studies have explored the question of whether the Allies had the requisite knowledge and technical capability to bomb the killing facilities at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

In 2000, the edited collection ''The Bombing of Auschwitz: Should the Allies Have Attempted It?'' appeared. In the introduction, editor Michael Neufeld wrote: "As David Wyman was able to show at the outset, it is impossible to claim that Auschwitz-Birkenau could not have been bombed. In fact, the Fifteenth Air Force did drop bombs on it by accident on 13 September 1944, when SS barracks were hit by bombs falling short of their intended industrial targets. The question rather becomes one of the likelihood of hitting the four main gas chamber/crematoria complexes along the west side of Birkenau, and the likelihood that bombs would have fallen in profusion on the rows and rows of adjacent prisoner barracks. Accuracy is thus the central issue…"<ref>''The Bombing of Auschwitz: Should the Allies Have Attempted it?'', edited by Michael J. Neufeld and Michael Berenbaum (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2000), 7.</ref>

==Submitted proposals to bomb Auschwitz and reactions==
The first proposal to bomb Auschwitz was made on 16 May 1944 by a Slovak rabbi, [[Michael Dov Weissmandl]], a leader in an underground Slovak organization known as the [[Bratislava Working Group|Working Group]] to the Jewish Agency. According to Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]], Weissmandl's proposal is the basis of subsequent proposals.{{sfn|Bauer|2001|p=234}} At about the same time, two officials of the Jewish Agency in Palestine separately made similar suggestions. Yitzhak Gruenbaum made his to the U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem, Lowell C. Pinkerton, and Moshe Shertok made his to George Hall, the British under secretary of state for foreign affairs. However, the idea was promptly squashed by the Executive Board of the Jewish Agency. On 11 June 1944, the Executive of the Jewish Agency considered the proposal, with [[David Ben-Gurion]] in the chair, and it specifically opposed the bombing of Auschwitz. Ben Gurion summed up the results of the discussion: "The view of the board is that we should not ask the Allies to bomb places where there are Jews."<ref name="myth">William D. Rubinstein, The Myth of Rescue, London, Routledge 1997, especially Chapter 4, "The Myth of Bombing Auschwitz".</ref>

In the meantime, [[George Mantello]] distributed the [[Auschwitz Protocols]] (including the [[Vrba–Wetzler report]]) and [[Vrba–Wetzler report#Report's arrival in Switzerland, press coverage|triggered a significant grass roots protest in Switzerland]], including Sunday masses, street protests and the Swiss Press Campaign. On 19 June 1944 [[Jewish Agency for Israel|the Jewish Agency]] in Jerusalem received the reports summary. David Ben-Gurion and the Jewish Agency had reversed its opposition immediately upon learning that Auschwitz was indeed a death camp, and urged U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to bomb the camp and the train tracks leading to the camp.<ref name=haaretz_auschwitz_bombing />

Shortly thereafter, [[Benjamin Akzin]], a junior official on the War Refugee Board staff made a similar recommendation. It was put in writing in an inter-office memorandum dated June 29 to his superior, a senior staff member, Lawrence S. Lesser. These recommendations were totally rejected by leading Jewish organizations. On June 28, Lesser met with A. Leon Kubowitzki, the head of the Rescue Department of the World Jewish Congress, who flatly opposed the idea. On July 1, Kubowitzki followed up with a letter to War Refugee Board Director [[War Refugee Board#Composition|John W. Pehle]], recalling his conversation with Lesser and stating:

<blockquote>The destruction of the death installations can not be done by bombing from the air, as the first victims would be the Jews who are gathered in these camps, and such a bombing would be a welcome pretext for the Germans to assert that their Jewish victims have been massacred not by their killers, but by the Allied bombers.</blockquote>

===The American reactions===
In June 1944, [[War Refugee Board#Composition|John Pehle]] of the [[War Refugee Board]] and [[Benjamin Akzin]], a [[Zionist]] activist in America, urged the [[United States Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] to bomb the camps. McCloy told his assistant to "kill" the request,<ref name="Gilbert_Churchill_Holocaust" /> as the [[United States Army Air Forces]] had decided in February 1944 not to bomb anything "for the purposes of rescuing victims of enemy oppression", but to concentrate on military targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/press/man-wanted-bomb-auschwitz.1510.htm|title=The man who wanted to bomb Auschwitz|work=The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation}}</ref> However, Rubinstein says that Akzin was not involved in discussions between Pehle and McCloy, and that Pehle specifically told McCloy that he was transmitting an idea proposed by others, that he had "several doubts about the matter," and that he was not "at this point at least, requesting the [[US War Department|War Department]] to take any action on this proposal other than to appropriately explore it."<ref name=myth />

On August 2, General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz]], commander of the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe]], expressed sympathy for the idea of bombing Auschwitz.<ref name="Breitman2013p284" /> Several times thereafter, in the summer and early autumn of 1944, the War Refugee Board relayed to the War Department suggestions by others that Auschwitz and/or the rail lines could be bombed. It repeatedly noted that it was not endorsing anything. On October 4, 1944, the War Department sent (and only this time) a rescue-oriented bombing proposal to General Spaatz in England for consideration. Although Spaatz's officers had read Mann's message reporting acceleration of extermination activities in the camps in Poland, they could perceive no advantage to the victims in smashing the killing machinery, and decided not to bomb [[Auschwitz]]. Nor did they seem to understand, despite Mann's statement that "the Germans are increasing their extermination activities," that wholesale massacres had already been perpetrated.<ref name="Saur1989p316" />

Finally, on November 8, 1944, having half-heartedly changed sides, Pehle ordered McCloy to bomb the camp. He said it could help some of the inmates to escape and would be good for the "morale of underground groups." According to [[Kai Bird]], [[Nahum Goldmann]] apparently also changed his mind. Sometime in the autumn of 1944, Goldmann went to see McCloy in his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] office and personally raised the bombing issue with him. However, by November 1944, Auschwitz was more or less completely shut down.

===The British reactions===
The British Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], did not see bombing as a solution, given that bombers were inaccurate and would also kill prisoners on the ground. The land war would have to be won first. Bombers were used against German cities and to carpet-bomb the front lines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} According to [[Martin Gilbert]],<ref name="Gilbert" /> Churchill pushed for bombing. Concerning the concentration camps, he wrote to his Foreign Secretary on July 11, 1944: "... all concerned in this crime who may fall into our hands, including the people who only obeyed orders by carrying out these butcheries, should be put to death ..."<ref>Churchill, Winston. ''Triumph and Tragedy''. Penguin 2005, p. 597.</ref> The British [[Air Ministry]] was asked to examine the feasibility of bombing the camps and decided not to for "operational reasons," which were not specified in wartime. In August 1944, 60 tons of supplies were flown to assist the [[Warsaw Uprising|uprising in Warsaw]] and, considering the dropping accuracy at that time, were to be dropped "into the south-west quarter of Warsaw." For various reasons, only seven aircraft reached the city.<ref>Churchill, 2005. pp. 115–17.</ref>

==Post-war analysis==
[[Michael Berenbaum]] has argued that it is not only a historical question, but "a moral question emblematic of the Allied response to the plight of the [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]]."<ref name="BerenbaumEB">Berenbaum, Michael. "Why wasn't Auschwitz bombed?" ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> [[David Wyman]] has asked: "How could it be that the governments of the two great Western democracies knew that a place existed where 2,000 helpless human beings could be killed every 30 minutes, knew that such killings actually did occur over and over again, and yet did not feel driven to search for some way to wipe such a [[scourge#Metaphoric use|scourge]] from the earth?"<ref name="Wyman583">Wyman, David S. "Why Auschwitz wasn't bombed," in Gutman, Yisrael & Berenbaum, Michael. ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp''. Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 583.</ref> [[Kevin A. Mahoney|Kevin Mahoney]], in an analysis of three requests submitted to the allies to bombard railway lines leading to Auschwitz, concludes that:

{{quote|The fate of the three requests to the MAAF in late August and early September 1944 dramatically illustrates why all proposals to bomb the rail facilities used to deport the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz during 1944, as well as to bomb the camp itself, failed. None was able to outweigh overriding military aims in pursuit of final victory over the Germans.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mahoney |first=K.
