The '''Assyrian eclipse''', also known as the Bur-Sagale eclipse, is a [[solar eclipse]] recorded in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] [[eponym list]]s, most likely dating the ninth year of the reign of king [[Ashur-dan III]].  The eclipse is identified with the one that occurred on 15 June 763 BC (proleptic Julian calendar).

The entry is short and reads:
:"[year of] Bur-Sagale of Guzana. Revolt in the city of Assur. In the month [[Babylonian calendar#Months|Simanu]] an eclipse of the sun took place."
The phrase used — ''[[shamash]]'' ("the sun") ''akallu'' ("bent", "twisted", "crooked", "distorted", "obscured") — has been interpreted  as a reference to a solar eclipse since the first [[decipherment of cuneiform]] in the mid 19th century.
The name ''Bur-Sagale'' (also rendered ''Bur-Saggile, Pur-Sagale'' or ''Par-Sagale'') is the name of the [[limmu]] official 
in the [[eponym dating system|eponymous year]].

In 1867, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] identified near-[[total eclipse]] of 15 June 763 BC as the most likely candidate (the month ''Simanu'' corresponding to the May/June lunation),<ref>Rawlinson, Henry Creswicke, "The Assyrian Canon Verified by the Record of a Solar Eclipse, B.C. 763", ''The Athenaeum: Journal of Literature, Science and the Fine Arts'', nr. 2064, 660-661 [18 May 1867].[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5dTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA660#v=onepage&q&f=true]</ref>  visible in northern Assyria just before noon. 
This date has been widely accepted ever since;  the identification is also substantiated by other astronomical observations from the same period.<ref>Hermann Hunger, "Zur Datierung der neuassyrischen Eponymenliste," ''Altorientalische Forschungen'', Vol. 35:2, 2008, pp. 323-325. An English translation is available on the web: [http://kristenfrihet.se/kf4/dating.htm#_ftnref1]</ref>

This record is one of the crucial pieces of evidence providing an absolute [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]] for the Assyrian period.

The mainstream view is that the beginning of the Babylonian year was not determined by observing the equinox, but by observing the appearance of certain constellations.<ref>Schaumberger, Johann ''3.

A detailed examination of 101 New Year dates between 748 and 539 BC shows that the dates of the New Year shifted{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In the eighth century it often began before the vernal equinox. The commonly-held belief is that "the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year in the eighth century fell about two weeks before the equinox." During the reign of [[Nabopolassar]] (625-605 BC) there was a shift to about ten days after the equinox, although there still were years when the New Year began before the equinox.

<blockquote>In summary, the situation in Babylonia before the last third of the eighth century seems to agree with the statement in MUL.APIN (Hunger and Pingree 1989) that the vernal equinox fell on Nisan 15. Probably around 730 the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year was shifted some two weeks upwards in relation to the solar year, so the average New Year's Day fell shortly before the vernal equinox. This holds true for the entire seventh century. Only around 600 did a second shift occur, which pushed the average beginning of the year to about two weeks after the vernal equinox (figure 4B).<ref>Gerber, Manuel "A Common Source for the Late Babylonian Chronicles Dealing with the Eighth and Seventh Centuries," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 120:4, October–December 2000, p. 559</ref></blockquote>
