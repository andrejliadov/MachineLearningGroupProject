== Early life ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}

Baer was born in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=ChiTribDemand>{{Cite web|last=Draper |first=Electa |title=Ex-CIA Middle East field officer a man in demand   |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=August 15, 2006 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-15/features/0608150266_1_robert-baer-skis-passes  }}</ref> At the age of 9, his parents divorced and he moved to [[Aspen, Colorado]] where he aspired to become a professional skier.<ref name=ChiTribDemand /> After a fairly poor academic performance during his first year at high school, his mother, a wealthy heiress, took him to Europe where they traveled throughout Europe including [[Paris]] during the [[May 1968 events in France|1968 riots]], [[Germany]], [[Prague]] during the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], and [[Russia]].<ref name=Counterpunch>{{Cite web|last=Ketcham |first=Christopher |title=Unlearning the CIA |publisher=[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]|date=October 23, 2009 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-08-15/features/0608150266_1_robert-baer-skis-passes  }}</ref> When he returned to the US, his mother sent him to Indiana's [[Culver Military Academy]]. In 1976 he graduated from the [[Georgetown University]] [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] (where then-future CIA director [[George Tenet]] was a classmate). While a graduate student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], he applied to the CIA's [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] (now the [[National Clandestine Service]]), originally as a prank. Upon admittance to the CIA after graduating, Baer engaged in a year's training, which included a four-month paramilitary course, parachute training, and several foreign language courses.

He is fluent in [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], French and his native English. He is also conversant in Russian, [[Tajik language|Tajik]], and [[Balochi language|Baluch]].

== Career ==

Baer worked field assignments, starting in [[Madras]] and [[New Delhi]], [[India]]; and subsequently in [[Beirut, Lebanon]]; [[Damascus, Syria]]; [[Khartoum, Sudan]]; [[Paris, France]]; [[Dushanbe, Tajikistan]]; [[Morocco]]; the former republic of [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah al-Din]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] during his twenty-one years with the CIA. During the mid-1990s, Baer was sent to Iraq with the mission of organizing opposition to Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] but was recalled and investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for allegedly conspiring to assassinate the Iraqi leader.<ref>Ignatius, David (2002) "Not a job for Kissinger," ''Washington Post''. December 20, 2002.</ref><ref>Turner, Michael A. (2006) ''Why Secret Intelligence Fails'' (revised edition). Potomac Books: Washington DC. {{ISBN|1-57488-891-9}}</ref> While in Salah al-Din, Baer unsuccessfully urged the [[Clinton administration]] to back an internal Iraqi attempt to overthrow Hussein (organized by a group of [[Sunni]] military officers, the [[Iraqi National Congress]]' [[Ahmad Chalabi]], and the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]]'s [[Jalal Talabani]]) in March 1995 with covert CIA assistance. Baer quit the Agency in 1997 and received the CIA's [[Career Intelligence Medal]] on March 11, 1998.

Baer wrote the book ''[[See No Evil (Baer book)|See No Evil]]'' documenting his experiences while working for the Agency. ''The C.I. Desk: FBI and CIA Counterintelligence As Seen From My Cubicle'', by Christopher Lynch (Dog Ear Publishing), describes parts of the contentious CIA pre-publication review process for Baer's first book. In a blurb for ''[[See No Evil (Baer book)|See No Evil]]'',  [[Seymour Hersh]] said Baer "was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field officer in the Middle East." In the book, Baer offers an analysis of the Middle East through the lens of his experiences as a CIA operative.

In 2004, he told a reporter of the British political weekly ''[[New Statesman]]'', regarding the way the CIA deals with terrorism suspects, "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear - never to see them again - you send them to Egypt."<ref name=statesman2004may17>[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/147955 America's gulag].

He retired to [[Silverton, Colorado]].<ref>[http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/ex-spy-feels-at-home-in-mountain-town/article_4ca1c677-af8c-5c7a-8ee3-ac4a215061dd.html Ex-spy feels at home in mountain town | Wyoming News | trib.com] Retrieved 2016-11-14.</ref>

=== Commentary ===
Baer wrote about the events of the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "[D]id [[Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] act alone, through his own [[al-Qaida]] network, in launching the attacks? About that I'm far more certain and emphatic: no."<ref>''The Guardian'': [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jan/12/extract1 See No Evil.]  January 11, 2002.</ref> He later stated, "For the record, I don't believe that the World Trade Center was brought down by our own explosives, or that a rocket, rather than an airliner, hit the Pentagon. I spent a career in the CIA trying to orchestrate plots, wasn't all that good at it, and certainly couldn't carry off 9/11. Nor could the real pros I had the pleasure to work with."<ref>{{cite web|last=Baer|first=Robert|date=December 7, 2007|title=Commentary: The CIA's Gift to Conspiracy Theorists|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1692518,00.html|access-date=2010-03-18|work=Time}}</ref>

In June 2009, Baer commented on the disputed election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] as Iranian President and the protests that accompanied it. "For too many years now, the Western media have looked at Iran through the narrow prism of Iran's liberal middle class—an intelligentsia that is addicted to the Internet and American music and is more ready to talk to the Western press, including people with money to buy tickets to Paris or Los Angeles; but do they represent the real Iran?"<ref name="TIME.com" /> Following reports of an attempt by Iranian agents to [[2011 alleged Iran assassination plot|assassinate the ambassador of Saudi Arabia]] to the United States, Baer told ''[[Die Zeit]]'' that he doubted that Iran was behind the attempt since there seemed no obvious motive and Iran had been more careful in past collaboration with terrorists.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2011-10/baer-anschlag-usa-iran "Warum sollte Iran so ein Risiko auf sich nehmen?"] Zeit Online, 2011-10</ref>

Baer has long been a supporter of the theory that the [[PFLP-GC]] brought down [[Pan Am Flight 103]]. Later he began to promote the theory that Iran was behind the bombing.
On August 23, 2009, Baer claimed that the CIA had known from the start that the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] had been orchestrated by Iran, and that a secret dossier proving this was to be presented as evidence in the final appeal by convicted [[Libya]]n bomber [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]]. According to Baer, this suggests that Megrahi's withdrawal of the appeal in return for a release on compassionate grounds was encouraged to prevent this information from being presented in court.<ref>

==Personal life==
Baer has been married twice. He has two daughters and a son from his first marriage,<ref name=ChiTribDemand /> to a [[State Department]] secretary.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ian|first=Shapira |title=How to keep your marriage going when you're in the CIA |work=[[Washington Post]]|date=March 14, 2012|url=https://live.washingtonpost.com/cia-divorce.html }}</ref> His second marriage  was to fellow CIA operative Dayna Williamson.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pesta|first=Abigail |title=A Real-Life Spy Couple - Robert Baer and Dayna Williamson hid their real identities and spent their lives trying to be invisible.

== Books and Media ==

Baer's books ''[[See No Evil (Baer book)|See No Evil]]'' and ''[[Sleeping with the Devil]]'' were the basis for the 2005 Academy Award-winning [[Warner Brothers]] motion picture ''[[Syriana]]''. The film's character Bob Barnes (played by [[George Clooney]]) is loosely based on Baer. For this role, Clooney won a [[Golden Globe]] Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. To better resemble Baer, Clooney gained weight. When Baer learned of this, he was inspired to get back into shape.

Baer worked closely with the director Kevin Toolis and Many Rivers Films, a [[Channel 4]] production company in the UK, to present four authoritative documentaries, beginning with the series, ''Cult of the Suicide Bomber I'', ''The Cult of the Suicide Bomber II'' and ''Cult of the Suicide Bomber III'' on the origins of [[suicide bombing]]. ''Cult of the Suicide Bomber I'' was nominated for an [[Emmy award|Emmy]] in 2006. In 2008 Baer presented ''Car Bomb'', a film history about [[car bomb]]s.

Baer was interviewed in the [[Robert Greenwald]] documentary ''[[Uncovered: The War on Iraq]]''. He was also one of the main participants in the 2009 documentary film ''[[Lockerbie Revisited]]'' by Dutch film director [[Gideon Levy (film director)|Gideon Levy]].

In 2015-2017, Baer has appeared on ''[[Hunting Hitler]]'' (2015-2017),<ref>http://www.history.ca/hunting-hitler/</ref> and ''[[JFK Declassified: Tracking Oswald]]''.<ref>http://www.history.ca/jfk-declassified-tracking-oswald/</ref>
