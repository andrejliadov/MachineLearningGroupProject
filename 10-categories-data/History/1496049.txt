{{short description|Mythical High King of Ireland}}
{{for|other personages called Ailill|Ailill}}
'''Ailill''' (or '''Oilioll'''), son of [[Slánoll]], was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a [[High King of Ireland]]; scholars now believe these kings to be a [[pseudohistorical]] construct of the eighth century AD, a projection into the distant past of a political entity which did not become a reality till Maelseachlainn I. He took power after killing his cousin [[Berngal]]. He ruled for twelve, fifteen or sixteen years, according to various versions of the ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]''<ref>R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), ''Lebor Gabála Érenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V'', Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 239-240</ref> ([[Geoffrey Keating]]<ref>[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text036.html 1.26]</ref> and the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]]<ref>''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005A/text010.html M4003-4019]</ref> agree on sixteen) before he was killed by [[Sírna Sáeglach]], a great grandson of [[Rothechtaid mac Main]]. The ''Lebor Gabála'' synchronises his reign with that of [[Deioces]] of the [[Medes]] (694-665 BC). The chronology of Keating's ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' dates his reign to 831–815 BC, that of the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' to 1197–1181 BC.
