The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].<ref name=press_release>{{cite web | title = WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2010 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 October 2009 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.<ref name=press_release /> An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.<ref name=press_release /> 

For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can qualify for grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.<ref>{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>

==2010 Watch List==
The 2010 World Monuments Watch List of Endangered Sites was announced on October 6, 2009 by WMF President Bonnie Burnham.<ref name=press_release /> The 2010 Watch List highlights the need to create a balance between heritage concerns and the social, economic, and environmental interests of communities around the world.<ref name=press_release />
{{quote|The sites on the 2010 Watch list make a dramatic case for the need to bring together a variety of sectors—economic, environmental, heritage preservation, and social—when we are making plans that will affect us all. Greater cooperation among these sectors would benefit humanity today, while ensuring our place as stewards of the Earth for the next generation.|source=Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|launch of 2010 Watch List<ref name=press_release />}}
