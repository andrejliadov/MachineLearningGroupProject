'''Ethnic history''' is a branch of [[social history]] that studies ethnic groups and immigrants. Barkan (2007) argues that the field allows historians to use alternate models of interpretation, unite qualitative and quantitative data, apply sociological models to historical patterns, examine more deeply macro-level policies and decisions, and, especially, empathize with the ethnic groups under study.

==Defining the field==
Ethnic history is especially important in the U.S. and Canada. [[Oscar Handlin]] (b. 1915), the director of scores of PhD dissertations at Harvard University was an important pioneer and sponsor of ethnic historiography. Handlin's Pulitzer-prize-winning interpretation, ''[[The Uprooted]]'' (1951) was highly influential.<ref>Oscar Handler and Mary F. Handler, "The New History and the Ethnic Factor in American Life," ''Perspectives in American History,'' 1970, Vol. 4, pp 5-24</ref>

Major encyclopedias have helped define the field; Handlin sponsored one published by Harvard University Press in 1980 that received wide media attention because it tied in with an American interest in their roots.<ref name="HEAEG1980">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Thernstrom|editor-first=Stephan|editor-link=Stephan Thernstrom|editor-last2=Orlov|editor-first2=Ann|editor-last3=Handlin|editor-first3=Oscar|editor-link3=Oscar Handlin|title=Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups|url=https://archive.org/details/harvardencyclope00ther|year=1980|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=0674375122|oclc=1038430174}}</ref><ref>Paul R.

Perin (1983) looks at the historiography of Canadian ethnic history and finds two alternative methodologies. One is more static and emphasizes how closely immigrant cultures replicate the Old World. This approach tends to be filiopietistic. The alternative approach has been influenced by the recent historiography on labor, urban, and family history. It sees the immigrant community as an essentially North American phenomenon and integrates it into the mainstream of Canadian culture.<ref>Roberto Perin, "Clio as Ethnic: The Third Force in Canadian Historiography," ''Canadian Historical Review,'' Dec 1983, Vol. 64 Issue 4, pp441-467</ref>

[[Jason J. McDonald|McDonald]] (2007) identifies five main areas of interest for scholarship on U.S. ethnic history: the origins and meaning of ethnicity, particularly the issue of whether it is inherited or invented; the origins of ethnic diversity (such as conquest, immigration, involuntary migration); models of ethnic adaptation (especially the [[Melting pot|Melting Pot]], [[Cultural mosaic|mosaic]], [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] and kaleidoscope metaphors); ethnic incorporation into the social, economic, and political fabric of the receiving country; and minority group survival strategies, including responses to competing forms of allegiance like class and gender.<ref>Jason McDonald. ''American Ethnic History: Themes and Perspectives''. (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4227-0}}</ref>

Much research is done by reading the letters immigrants wrote to relatives back home, often comparing the advantages and disadvantages of their new lives.<ref>Walter D. Kamphoefner, "Immigrant Epistolary and Epistemology: On the Motivators and Mentality of Nineteenth-Century German Immigrants." ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2009): 34-54. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40543427 in JSTOR], on deep-reading their letters</ref>

A significant trend has been to integrate ethnic history with other new historiographical tendencies, such as [[Atlantic history]],<ref>Colin Kidd, ''British Identities before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600-1800'' (1999)</ref> [[labor history (discipline)|labor history]] or [[women's history]].
