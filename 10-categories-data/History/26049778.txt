'''Against the Christians''' is a third century book written by Roman [[neoplatonism|neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], criticizing the writings of Christian philosophers and theologists. Thanks to censorship by Christian imperial authorities, no known copies of this book exist, only references to it in books attacking it.

==The book==

During his retirement in Sicily, Porphyry wrote ''Against the Christians'' (Κατὰ Χριστιανῶν; ''Adversus Christianos'') which consisted of fifteen books. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as Methodius, Eusebius, Apollinaris, Augustine, Jerome, etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry's arguments is found in these refutations, largely because Theodosius II ordered every copy burned in A.D. 435 and again in 448.{{sfn|Digeser| 1998|p=130|ps=: "Constantine and other emperors banned and burned Porphyry's work".}}{{sfn|Socrates Scholasticus|1885|pp=Book I, Ch 9, pp. 30-31|loc=Letter of Constantine proscribing the works of Porphyry and Arius}}{{sfn|Stevenson|1987|p=|ps=: Gelasius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', II.36}}{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=326}}

Porphyry became one of the most able pagan adversaries of Christianity of his day. His aim was not to disprove the substance of Christianity's teachings but rather the records within which the teachings are communicated.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=327}}

According to Jerome, Porphyry especially attacked the prophecy of Daniel because Jews and Christians pointed to the historical fulfillment of its prophecies as a decisive argument. But these prophecies, he maintained, were written not by Daniel but by some Jew who in the time of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] (d. 164 BC) gathered up the traditions of Daniel's life and wrote a history of recent past events but in the future tense, falsely dating them back to Daniel's time.

:Daniel was right. Finally what he had told up to Antiochus contained true history; if anything was guessed beyond that point it was false, for he had not known the future. (quoted by Jerome)

The first part of Daniel, with the exception of the dream in Daniel 2, is historic, not prophetic. Porphyry, attacking only the prophetic portion, declares it to be merely a late anonymous narrative of past events, purporting to have been predicted long before by Daniel. Thus Porphyry's scheme was based on the supposed spuriousness of Daniel's prophecies.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=328}}

Porphyry devised his own interpretation where the third “prophetic kingdom” was Alexander, and assigned the Macedonian Ptolemies and Seleucids to the fourth kingdom. From among these he chose ten kings, making the eleventh to be Antiochus Epiphanes. In this way he threw his main strength against the book of Daniel, recognizing that if this pillar of faith be shaken, the whole structure of prophecy must tremble. If the writer was not Daniel, then he lied on a frightful scale, ascribing to God prophecies which were never uttered, and making claim of miracles that were never wrought. And if Daniel's authorship could be shown to be false, then Christ Himself would be proved to bear witness to an imposter. (Matt. 24: 15.){{sfn|Froom|1950|p=329}} Porphyry's thesis was adopted by [[Edward Gibbon]], the English deist [[Anthony Collins]], and most [[Modernist]] scholars.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=330}}

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]], assert that Porphyry was once a Christian.{{sfn|Socrates Scholasticus|1885b|pp= Book III, Ch 23}}
