He is best known for his tract, "''De Marii, Lepidi" and "Ac Sertorii Bellis Civilibus"''  which some argue may have been abridged from the histories of [[Sallust]]ius. Additionally he is notable for being one of the last late confirmed members of the ancient [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] [[Julia gens|Julian]] family. Exsuperantius' work's provides a concise account of the rise of [[Gaius Marius]] and the subsequent civil war between Marius and [[Sulla]] until the end of [[Quintus Sertorius|Sertorius]]' reign. Exuperantius' work's were significantly reprinted in 1588, with the support of [[Friedrich Sylburg]] and [[Pierre Pithou]] who published several copies of "''Ac Sertorii Bellis Civilibus".'' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.attalus.org/translate/exsuper.html|title=Julius Exsuperantius|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/RE:Exsuperantius_2|title=RE:Exsuperantius 2 – Wikisource|website=de.wikisource.org|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> <ref>{{Citation|last1=Eustanthius|work=Eustathii metropolitae Thessalonicensis opuscula|pages=362–374|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-17668-2|last2=Basileensi|first2=E Codicibus MSS.|editor1-first=Gottlieb Lukas Friedrich|editor1-last=Tafel|title=Trapezuntinae Historiae Scriptores|year=2013|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139176682.028}}</ref>
