The '''[[Klondike Gold Rush#Culture|Klondike Gold Rush]]''' is commemorated through film, literature, historical parks etc.

==Literature==
[[File:Jim Mason plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque to [[Keish|Skookum Jim Mason]]]]
Amongst the many to take part in the gold rush was writer [[Jack London]], whose books ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903), ''[[White Fang]]'' (1906), and his short story "[[To Build a Fire]]" (1902 and 1908), were influenced by his northern experiences. London was inspired to write stories by various adventurers he met. ''The Thousand Dozen'' for instance was inspired by a brief market corner on eggs created by [[Bill Gates (frontiersman)|"Swiftwater" Bill Gates]]. Part I of Jack London's 1910 novel ''Burning Daylight'' is centered on the Klondike Gold Rush. 

Another literary luminary connected with the rush, and whose cabin still stands in Dawson City, was folk-lyricist [[Robert W. Service]], whose short epics [[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]] (1907) and other works describe the fierce grandeur of the north and the survival ethic and gold fever of men and women in the frozen, gold-strewn north. Service's best-known line is the opening of [[The Cremation of Sam McGee]] (1907), which goes;

:''There are strange things done in the midnight sun''
:''By the men who moil for gold;''

One of the last books of [[Jules Verne]], ''Le Volcan d'Or'' (''The Volcano of Gold''), deals with the terrible hardships endured by the gold-seekers in the Klondike. The book was written circa 1899 but was not published until 1989.<ref>Olivier Dumas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VyVidJFp26oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22the+golden+volcano%22&source=bl&ots=nUzs9QiCer&sig=dinajx-4HX_UHKRbCGIRfI6cEnY&hl=en&ei=9tiPS-2HHI3SsgO9t_yfCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Preface to ''The Golden Volcano''], 1989.</ref> The Klondike became a popular setting for adventure stories and travel memoirs in North American and European markets.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ville|first=Léon|url=http://archive.org/details/auklondyke00vill|title=Au Klondyke|date=1898|publisher=Paris : Tolra & Simonet|year=1898|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hitchcock|first=Mary E.

Canadian author [[Vicki Delany]] writes the Klondike Gold Rush series of mystery novels from Dundurn Press, which include ''Gold Digger'' (2009) and ''Gold Fever'' (2010) and ''Gold Mountain'' (May 2012).

==Film and television==
[[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' (1925), the highest grossing silent comedy, was set in the Klondike. Also about the gold rush were [[Lev Kuleshov]]'s silent-era adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s "The Unexpected" ''[[By the Law]]'' (1926), the silent epic ''[[The Trail of '98]]'' (1928), and [[Mae West]]'s ''[[Klondike Annie]]'' (1936).

Dawson City was also the starting place of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]]. He opened a small theater to entertain the miners. He also became the partner and lover of [["Klondike Kate" Rockwell]]. Soon, however, his activities expanded and he became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons.

The song "Gold Dust" by Canadian independent artist Right On Yukon makes multiple references to the hardships endured by fortune seekers and animals along the White Pass trail from Skagway to Dawson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rightonyukon.bandcamp.com/track/gold-dust|title=Gold Dust, by Right on Yukon}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Back to the Klondike.png|thumb|Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck comics established the character as a participant in the Klondike rush. Cover to the Carl Barks story ''[[Back to the Klondike]]'', Uncle Scrooge #2, 1952. Art by Carl Barks]] -->[[Carl Barks]]' 1950s [[Scrooge McDuck]] comics established the character as a successful participant in the Klondike rush when he was young, around the turn of the century. While Barks was content with leaving Scrooge's backstory of his Klondike days at the level of short flashbacks, his successor [[Don Rosa]] has gone to extend Barks's legacy of short glimpses into Scrooge's gold rush exploits into a number of adventure stories, particularly ''Last Sled to Dawson'' and individual chapters of his opus magnum ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'', which are chapter 8a: ''[[King of the Klondike]]'', chapter 8b: ''[[The Prisoner of White Agony Creek]]'', and chapter 8c: ''Hearts of the Yukon''.

Soapy Smith is the villain in the [[Lucky Luke]] album ''Le Klondike'', by [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], Yann and Jean Léturgie. The story features Smith's saloon and fake telegraph, but set in Dawson rather than Skagway.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[Lefty Frizzell]]'s 1964 song [[Saginaw, Michigan (song)|"Saginaw, Michigan"]] tells the tale of a poor fisherman who feigns the discovery of Klondike gold in a plot to remove the hostile father of the woman he loves.

A game called [[The Yukon Trail]] was created by [[MECC]] in 1994. There is also a populaire solitaire called [[Klondike (solitaire)|Klondike]].

In addition, the Klondike gold rush proved to be one of the most famous eras of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's history. Not only did the exemplary conduct of the force ensure its continuation at a time when its dissolution was being debated in the [[Parliament of Canada]], but the Force's depiction in popular western culture is often set at this time. The most popular examples include dramatic depictions such as the radio series ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'' and comedic ones like ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]''.

A certain amount of [[slang]] came out of the gold rush. Experienced miners were often known as "[[wikt:sourdough|Sourdoughs]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sourdough |title=Merriam-Webster online – Sourdough |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}</ref> Potential miners new to the Klondike  were known as "[[wikt:cheechako|Cheechakos]]", from [[Chinook Jargon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cheechakos |title=Merriam-Webster online – Cheechakos |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-02-18}}</ref> These two names live on in Dawson City, in tourist literature, and enjoy occasional usage by miners still working the tributaries of the Yukon River and Klondike River as well as in literature relating to the Klondike gold rush era.

==Celebrations==
The gold rush was celebrated in the city of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], with [[K-Days|Klondike Days]] (now simply K-Days), an annual summer fair with a Klondike gold rush theme. Although far away from Dawson City and the Klondike River, Edmonton became known as a "Gateway to the North" for gold prospectors en route to Canada's North. It was in the city that many would collect the necessary goods for trekking up north in search of wealth. Individuals and teams of explorers arrived in Edmonton and prepared for travel by foot, [[York boat]], [[Sled dog|dog team]], or horses. Travel to the Yukon over land via what was sometimes called the "all Canada" route—and the prospectors that took this route—were often referred to as "overlanders". Few overlanders made it to the Klondike (160 out of about 1,600 that started<ref>[http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm Chalmers Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812143900/http://www.klondiketrail.ca/chalmersprint.htm |date=2009-08-12 }}</ref>).

Alberta's Northlands Association, which is based in Edmonton, honoured the memory and spirit of the overlanders with Klondike Days. For many years, Klondike Days was a fun summer exhibition with themed events such as the Sunday Promenade, the Sourdough raft race, free pancake breakfasts, saloons, gold panning and era costume parties.  Despite the many sad realities of the gold rush, Edmonton appreciated the Klondike spirit, which was characterised by a tenacious hope for success in the face of hardship, and an energetic zest for life. As a fair theme it was meant to provide the impetus for fun fantasy characters (e.g., Klondike Mike (Bobby Breen), Klondike Kate, The Klondike Kid (Ken Armstrong), Klondike Kitty (Debra Cook), Klondike Kattie to mention but a few) and fun events celebrating an interesting time. Many in the Yukon resented Edmonton's Klondike celebrations because of their historical inaccuracy and the perceived competition with the Yukon's tourism. The sentimental aspect of the gold rush lost its popular appeal in the 1980s and 90s and in 2003 the theme was dropped.

In addition, every other summer, on odd numbered years, the sleep away camp Camp Shohola for Boys has what it calls Klondike Day. In the morning an area of camp, including the creek that runs through the camp, are staged as Dawson City and campers run into the creek to search for "gold." In the afternoon they receive "money" for their prospecting and attend a camp wide carnival.

In 2019, as a way to celebrate the original Klondike Gold Rush, the Yukon government attempted to <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/dawson-gold-rush-revival-1.5157613|title=Dawson City group plans to scatter gold to trigger second gold rush |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> crowdsource a second Gold Rush by inviting the public to <ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gold-rush-2-help-us-re-make-history#/ |accessdate=18 March 2020|title=GOLD RUSH 2: Help us re-make history.}}</ref> buy perks via Indiegogo. Using the money raised, the government bought real Klondike gold and sprinkled it into the Territory's creeks. They then invited people to pan it back out as a re-creation of the original Klondike Gold Rush of the 1890s.
