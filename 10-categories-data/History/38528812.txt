The '''Chicxulub impactor''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ə|l|uː|b}} {{respell|CHEEK|shə-loob}}), also known as the '''K/Pg impactor''' and (more speculatively) as the '''Chicxulub asteroid''', was an [[asteroid]] or other [[celestial body]] some {{convert|11|to|81|km|0}} in diameter and having a mass between {{val|1.0|e=15}} and {{val|4.6|e=17|u=kg}},<ref name="DMCT2014">{{cite arxiv|last1=Durand-Manterola|first1=H.

The impactor's crater is over {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} in diameter<ref name="eid">{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Chicxulub | accessdate = December 30, 2008 }}</ref> making it [[List of impact craters on Earth#Largest craters (10 Ma or more)|one of the largest]] known [[impact crater]]s on Earth.

==Parent body==
Several competing models for the impactor's origin exist, and for its relationship to other asteroids that continue to exist in the Solar System. In September 2007, [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlický, and David Nesvorný proposed an origin for the impactor in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]]. They proposed that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid member of this group, referring to the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments at the site, suggesting that it was a member of a rare class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina. According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} across, with the impacting body being around 6&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;mi) in diameter.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

However, in 2011 new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago, casting doubt on the hypothesis, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.<ref name=Universe>Tammy Plotner, ''[http://www.universetoday.com/89050/did-asteroid-baptistina-kill-the-dinosaurs-think-other-wise/#more-89050 Did Asteroid Baptistina Kill the Dinosaurs? Think other WISE...]'' in ''Universe Today'' (2011) at universetoday.com</ref>

Other work has associated the asteroid [[P/2010 A2]], a member of the [[Flora family]] of asteroids, as a possible remnant cohort of the Chicxulub impactor.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/02/us-space-asteroid-idUSTRE61154120100202 "Smashed asteroids may be related to dinosaur killer"] Reuters, February 2, 2010</ref>

== Angle ==
A study in 2020 showed that the asteroid came from the northeast at a steep angle. This maximized the amount of climate-changing gas that was launched into the atmosphere and was one of the deadliest possible scenarios. The study says that their 3D simulations showed that the impactor hit at a 40 to 60 degree angle.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Katie Hunt|title=The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs hit at 'deadliest possible' angle|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/world/asteroid-dinosaurs-extinction-angle-trnd-scn/index.html|access-date=2020-12-15|website=CNN}}</ref>
