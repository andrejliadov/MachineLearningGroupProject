'''[[Demographics|Demographic]] history''' is the reconstructed record of human population in the past. Given the lack of population records prior to the 1950s, there are many gaps in our record of demographic history. Historical demographers must make do with estimates. models and extrapolations.  For the methodology, see [[Historical demography]]

With a habitat of 68 million km² ("the [[Old World]] south of latitude 50° north, minus [[Australia]]"), ''Homo erectus'' could have numbered around 1.7 million individuals.

The initial population "upswing" began around 5000 BC. Global population gained 50% in the 5th millennium BC, and 100% each millennium until 1000 BC, reaching 50 million people. After the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], growth rate reached its peak with a [[doubling time]] of 500 years. However, growth slackened between 500 BC and 1 AD, before ceasing around 200 AD. This "primary cycle" was, at this time in history, confined to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and mainland [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/343 343]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref> McEvedy and Jones describe a secondary, "medieval cycle" being led by [[Feudalism|feudal Europe]] and [[Song dynasty|Song China]] from around 900 AD.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/345 345]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref>

During the period from 500 to 900 [[world population]] grew slowly but the growth rate accelerated between 900 and 1300 when the population doubled. During the 14th century, there was a fall in population associated with the [[Black Death]] that spread from [[Asia]] to [[Europe]]. This was followed by a period of restrained growth for 300 years.<ref name="EoPH">[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005</ref>

In the 18th century world population entered a period of accelerated growth. European population reached a peak growth rate of 10 per thousand per year in the second half of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the growth rate among the European populations fell and was overtaken by a rapid acceleration in the growth rate in other continents, which reached 21 per thousand per year in the last 50 years of the millennium. Between 1900 and 2000, the population of the world increased by 277%, a fourfold increase from 1.5 billion to 6 billion. The European component increased by 124%, and the remainder by 349%.<ref name="EoPH"/>

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).<ref>J.H. Khan,  "Population growth and demographic change in India," ''Asian Profile'' (2004) 32#5 pp 441-460</ref>

Mortality rates fell in 1920-45 era, primarily due to biological immunization. Other factors included rising incomes and better living conditions, improved better nutrition, a safer and cleaner environmental, and better official health policies and medical care.<ref>Ira Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," ''Indian Economic Social History Review'' (1990) 27#1 pp 33-63 doi: 10.1177/001946469002700102 [http://ier.sagepub.com/content/27/1/33 Online]</ref>

Severe overcrowding in the cities caused major public health problems, as noted in an official report from 1938:<ref>Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," p 42</ref>
:In the urban and industrial areas ... cramped sites, the high values of land and the necessity for the worker to live in the vicinity of his work ... all tend to intensify congestion and overcrowding. In the busiest centres houses are built close together, eave touching eave, and frequently back to back .... Indeed space is so valuable that, in place of streets and roads, winding lanes provide the only approach to the houses. Neglect of sanitation is often evidenced by heaps of rotting garbage and pools of sewage, whilst the absence of latrines enhance the general pollution of air and soil.

*England and Wales, 4,500,000
*Scotland and Ireland, 2,000,000
*Netherlands, 3,000,000, including the Spanish Netherlands in 1600<ref>Beloch gives it an area of 75,000 km2, enough to include Belgium and possibly even Luxemburg.</ref>
*Denmark, 600,000
*Sweden, Norway, and Finland: 1,400,000
*Poland with Prussia: 3,000,000
*Germany: 20,000,000, probably including most or all of the territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] outside Italy.<ref>Beloch gives it an area of 720,000 km2, about twice the size of modern Germany.</ref>

With a habitat of 68 million km² ("the [[Old World]] south of latitude 50° north, minus [[Australia]]"), ''Homo erectus'' could have numbered around 1.7 million individuals. After being replaced by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and moving into the [[New World]] and de-glaciated territory, by 10,000 BC world population was approaching four million people.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/14 14]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref> McEvedy and Jones argue that, after populating the maximum available range, this was the limit of our [[Hunter-gatherer|food-gathering]] ancestors, with further population growth requiring [[Neolithic Revolution|food-producing]] activities.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/15 15]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref>

The initial population "upswing" began around 5000 BC. Global population gained 50% in the 5th millennium BC, and 100% each millennium until 1000 BC, reaching 50 million people. After the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], growth rate reached its peak with a [[doubling time]] of 500 years. However, growth slackened between 500 BC and 1 AD, before ceasing around 200 AD. This "primary cycle" was, at this time in history, confined to [[Europe]], [[North Africa]], and mainland [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/343 343]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref> McEvedy and Jones describe a secondary, "medieval cycle" being led by [[Feudalism|feudal Europe]] and [[Song dynasty|Song China]] from around 900 AD.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Colin McEvedy |author2=Richard Jones |title=Atlas of World Population History |date=June 29, 1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/atlasofworldpopu00mcev/page/345 345]|title-link=Atlas of World Population History }}</ref>

During the period from 500 to 900 [[world population]] grew slowly but the growth rate accelerated between 900 and 1300 when the population doubled. During the 14th century, there was a fall in population associated with the [[Black Death]] that spread from [[Asia]] to [[Europe]]. This was followed by a period of restrained growth for 300 years.<ref name="EoPH">[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005</ref>

In the 18th century world population entered a period of accelerated growth. European population reached a peak growth rate of 10 per thousand per year in the second half of the 19th century. During the 20th century, the growth rate among the European populations fell and was overtaken by a rapid acceleration in the growth rate in other continents, which reached 21 per thousand per year in the last 50 years of the millennium. Between 1900 and 2000, the population of the world increased by 277%, a fourfold increase from 1.5 billion to 6 billion. The European component increased by 124%, and the remainder by 349%.<ref name="EoPH"/>

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).<ref>J.H. Khan,  "Population growth and demographic change in India," ''Asian Profile'' (2004) 32#5 pp 441-460</ref>

Mortality rates fell in 1920-45 era, primarily due to biological immunization. Other factors included rising incomes and better living conditions, improved better nutrition, a safer and cleaner environmental, and better official health policies and medical care.<ref>Ira Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," ''Indian Economic Social History Review'' (1990) 27#1 pp 33-63 doi: 10.1177/001946469002700102 [http://ier.sagepub.com/content/27/1/33 Online]</ref>

Severe overcrowding in the cities caused major public health problems, as noted in an official report from 1938:<ref>Klein, "Population growth and mortality in British India: Part II: The demographic revolution," p 42</ref>
:In the urban and industrial areas ... cramped sites, the high values of land and the necessity for the worker to live in the vicinity of his work ... all tend to intensify congestion and overcrowding. In the busiest centres houses are built close together, eave touching eave, and frequently back to back .... Indeed space is so valuable that, in place of streets and roads, winding lanes provide the only approach to the houses. Neglect of sanitation is often evidenced by heaps of rotting garbage and pools of sewage, whilst the absence of latrines enhance the general pollution of air and soil.

*England and Wales, 4,500,000
*Scotland and Ireland, 2,000,000
*Netherlands, 3,000,000, including the Spanish Netherlands in 1600<ref>Beloch gives it an area of 75,000 km2, enough to include Belgium and possibly even Luxemburg.</ref>
*Denmark, 600,000
*Sweden, Norway, and Finland: 1,400,000
*Poland with Prussia: 3,000,000
*Germany: 20,000,000, probably including most or all of the territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] outside Italy.<ref>Beloch gives it an area of 720,000 km2, about twice the size of modern Germany.</ref>
