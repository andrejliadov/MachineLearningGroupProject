'''Advanced Placement World History: Modern''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different human societies. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students used to study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 BC to the present day. However, it was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 AD, starting in the 2019â€“2020 school year, with plans for a new course with the time before that called AP World History: Ancient.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}</ref> The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. Students in the United States usually take the course in their second year of high school, although they are not generally required to do so.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit. The number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}</ref>

This test underwent a major overhaul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 & 2, another addressing periods 3 & 4, and a third addressing periods 5 & 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, [[Trevor Packer]], stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, and many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>
