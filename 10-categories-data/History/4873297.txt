There are several types of timeline articles.

*''Historical timelines'' show the significant historical events and developments for a specific topic, over the course of centuries or millennia.
* ''Graphical timelines'' provide a visual representation for the timespan of multiple events that have a particular duration, over the course of centuries or millennia.
*''Timelines by year'' are timelines for one particular year that show the developments for that year within the topical area of that timeline.
* ''Lists of years'' or ''Tables of years'' are indexes that list all of the individual timelines by year that pertain to a specific topic.

Timespans next to the timeline articles listed here include the date of the earliest item included in the linked timeline article.
