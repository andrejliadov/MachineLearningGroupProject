'''Heinz Höhne''' (1926 [[Berlin]], Germany - 27 March 2010 in [[Großhansdorf]]) was a German journalist and historian who specialized in [[Nazi]] and intelligence [[history]].

== Biography ==
Born in [[Berlin]] in 1926, Höhne was educated there until he was called to fight during the last months of the [[Second World War]]. After the war, he studied [[journalism]] in [[Munich]] and went on to work for various newspapers as a freelance reporter. In 1955, he was hired by the weekly magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', where he joined the foreign staff of the magazine and eventually took charge of the Anglo-American department.

Heinz's efforts covered Nazi history. His work is entitled ''The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's [[SS]]. (Der Orden unter dem Totenkopf: Die Geschichte der SS).'' This work first appeared in 1967, and other works subsequently followed, such as his 1971 study of the [[Soviet Union]]'s spy network entitled ''Codeword: Direktor.''

In 1976, Höhne went on to write ''[[Wilhelm Canaris|Canaris]]'', an interpretation of Hitler's spymaster, who was in charge of the ''[[Abwehr]]''.<ref>Heinz Höhne, ''The Order of the Death's Head'' (New York: [[Penguin Books]], 1971).</ref>

There are a number of references to Höhne's work on the SS by other historians who have written works on Nazi Germany. More recently, [[Adrian Weale]]'s work, ''Army of Evil: A History of the SS'' frequently cites Höhne's ''The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS'', although challenging some of the assertions found therein.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weale|first=Adrian|title=Army of Evil: A History of the SS|year=2012|publisher=NAL Caliber|location=New York|isbn=978-0-451-23791-0}}</ref>

Another work from Höhne is ''Krieg im Dunkeln'' (1985), which examines the centuries-old relationship between Russian and German intelligence. After his retirement, Heinz Höhne worked on a history of the [[Third Reich]], the first volume of which, ''Gebt mir vier Jahre Zeit'', appeared in 1996.

His book ''The General Was a Spy: The Truth about [[General Gehlen]] and his [[Gehlen Organization|spy ring]]'' received a less than glowing review from a [[CIA]] analyst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol16no3/html/v16i3a06p_0001.htm|title=The Service: The Memoirs of General Reinhard Gehlen by Reinhard Gehlen.
