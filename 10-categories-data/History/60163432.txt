==Philatelic writing==
Baldus's first book was the two-volume ''Schwarze Post'' (1998), which dealt with the forged and propaganda stamps produced during the wars of the twentieth century.<ref name=LP1336>"German Propaganda Parodies against Great Britain", ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. 115, No. 1336 (June 2006), p. 181.</ref> It was later republished in an extended and revised edition as ''Postal Warfare: Espionage Forgeries and Propaganda Parodies of Postage Stamps, Postcards, and Letters''.<ref>[http://wolfgang-baldus.de/16%20Postal%20Warfare%20Volume%201.htm Postal Warfare.] Wolfgang Baldus. Retrieved 8 March 2019.</ref> In 2002 he produced ''Philatelic Witnesses: Stamps of Revolutions'', one of only two of his works that were not self-published.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Williams. p.39.</ref> "futsch" translates as "gone" or "broken" in English]]
In 2003 he published ''The Postage Stamps of the Principality of Trinidad'', the first in his series titled History and Background Stories of Unusual Stamps, which had reached nine volumes by 2012. Baldus is known for his meticulous approach,<ref name=mob/> in which he describes the background, production, and distribution of stamps produced by non-government entities, fraudsters, and fantasists, which are among the cinderella stamps of philately: often well known to collectors, but previously unresearched. The most recent book in the series is ''The Postage Stamps of the Principality of Atlantis'' (2012).<ref name=atl>"Book Review ''The Postage Stamps of the Principality of Atlantis''", Chris Mobsby, ''The Cinderella Philatelist'', Vol. 52, No. 4 (October 2012), Whole No. 208, p. 146.</ref>

In 2005 he continued the subject of espionage forgeries and propaganda parody stamps that he had begun with ''Schwarze Post'' by publishing ''German Propaganda Parodies against Great Britain'' that covers the topic of forgeries and propaganda stamps produced by prisoners of the Nazi regime at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] during the Second World War.<ref name=LP1336/> Often the forged or parody stamps have been of so much interest to philatelists that they have themselves been forged to meet collector demand, and Baldus describes the different versions of the stamps, identifying the characteristics of the original forgeries or parodies and the later imitations.<ref name=mob/>

Also in 2005, he published ''OSS Hitler Stamps, A Philatelic Study on a Disputed Stamp Issue'', a study of the stamps depicting [[Adolf Hitler]] that were produced by the United States [[Office of Strategic Services]] as part of [[Operation Cornflakes]] during the Second World War.<ref name=OSS/> This operation included the forging of genuine German stamps as well as the creation of parody stamps such as one based on a genuine German 12pf stamp of 1941 that was changed to superimpose a skull over Hitler's face and with the wording changed from ''Deutsches Reich'' (German Empire) to ''Futsches Reich'' (broken or lost empire); the Americans hoped to insert the stamps into the German mail system in order to undermine civilian morale.<ref name=will/><ref name="Child">{{cite book|author=Child, Jack.|title=Miniature Messages: The Semiotics and Politics of Latin American Postage Stamps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0DMl-sYT8kC&pg=PR45|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0-8223-8927-4|page=25}}</ref>

In 2006, he published ''The Postage Stamps of Clipperton Island'', a [[postal history]] of [[Clipperton Island]] in the Pacific, and a description of the [[local stamps]] issued in San Francisco in 1895 by the [[Oceanic Phosphate Company]] that had a [[guano]] business there from 1893 to 1897.<ref>"The Postage Stamps of Clipperton Island", ''The London Philatelist'', Vol. 115, No. 1341 (Dec. 2006), p. 417.</ref><ref>[http://www.thepostalgazette.com/issues/26/Clipperton_Stamps.pdf "The Stamps of Clipperton Island"], by Wolfgang Baldus, ''The Postal Gazette'', Vol. 4, No. 5 (October 2009), pp. 42–45.</ref>

In 2006, Baldus was invited to sign the [[Maurice Williams Roll of Notable Cinderella Philatelists]].<ref>"The Maurice Williams Roll of Notable Cinderella Philatelists", ''The Cinderella Philatelist'', Vol. 54, No. 4 (October 2014), Whole No. 216, p. 169.</ref>
