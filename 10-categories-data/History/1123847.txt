A '''family history society''' or '''genealogical society''' is a [[society]], often [[Charitable organization|charitable]] or [[not-for-profit]], that allows member [[genealogist]]s and [[family history|family historian]]s to profit from shared knowledge.  Large societies often own libraries, sponsor research seminars and foreign trips, and publish journals. Some societies concentrate on a specific niche, such as the family history of a particular geographical area, [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], or [[religion]].  Lineage societies are societies that limit their membership to descendants of a particular person or group of people of historical importance.
