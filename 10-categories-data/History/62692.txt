The '''Archean''' Eon ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɑr|ˈ|k|iː|ə|n}} {{Respell|ar|KEE|ən}}, also spelled '''Archaean''' or '''Archæan'''), is one of the four [[geology|geologic]] [[eon (geology)|eon]]s of [[Earth|Earth's]] history, occurring {{Ma|3875|2750}} (4 to 2.5&nbsp;[[Billion years|Gya]]). During the Archean, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] had cooled enough to allow the formation of [[continents]] and the [[Abiogenesis|beginning of life on Earth]].

== Etymology and changes in classification ==
The word 'Archean' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|Αρχή}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Arkhē}}''), meaning 'beginning, origin.'<ref>{{OEtymD|Archaean}}</ref> It was first used in 1872, when it meant "of the earliest geological age."{{efn|The name '''Archean''' was coined by American geologist [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813–1895).<ref name=Dana1872>{{cite journal |last1=Dana |first1=James D. |name-list-style=vanc |title=Green Mountain geology.

Instead of being based on [[stratigraphy]], the beginning and end of the Archean Eon are defined [[Chronometric dating|chronometrically]]. The eon's lower boundary or starting point of 4&nbsp;[[Billion years|Gya]] (4&nbsp;[[Bya|billion years ago]]) is officially recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]].<ref name="ICS2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf |title=International Chronostratigraphic Chart v.2013/01 |publisher=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] |date=January 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Geology==
[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat.svg|thumb|left|The evolution of Earth's [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic heat]] flow over time]]
When the Archean began, the Earth's [[Earth's internal heat budget|heat flow]] was nearly three times as high as it is today, and it was still twice the current level at the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic (2,500&nbsp;Ma). The extra heat was the result of a mix of remnant heat from [[Accretion (astrophysics)|planetary accretion]], from the formation of the [[structure of the Earth|metallic core]], and from the decay of [[radioactive]] elements.

Although a few mineral grains are known to be [[Hadean]], the oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the [[Earth]] are Archean. Archean rocks are found in [[Greenland]], [[Siberia]], the [[Canadian Shield]], [[Montana]] and [[Wyoming]] (exposed parts of the [[Wyoming Craton]]), the [[Baltic Shield]], the [[Geology of Bulgaria|Rhodope Massif]], [[Geology of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Geological history of India|India]], [[Brazil]], western [[Geology of Australia|Australia]], and southern [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} [[Granitic]] rocks predominate throughout the crystalline remnants of the surviving Archean crust. Examples include great melt sheets and voluminous plutonic masses of [[granite]], [[diorite]], [[layered intrusion]]s, [[anorthosite]]s and [[monzonite]]s known as [[sanukitoid]]s. Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments, and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Volcanic]] activity was considerably higher than today, with numerous lava eruptions, including unusual types such as [[komatiite]].<ref name="Dostal2008">{{cite journal |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/11074/11722 |title=Igneous Rock Associations 10.

The metamorphosed igneous rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the metamorphosed sediments represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a [[forearc]] basin. Greenstone belts, being both types of metamorphosed rock, represent sutures between the protocontinents.<ref name=Stanley>{{cite book |last=Stanley |first=Steven M.  |title=Earth System History |location=New York |publisher=W.H.

The Earth's continents started to form in the Archean, although details about their formation are still being debated, due to lack of extensive geological evidence. One hypothesis is that rocks that are now in India, western Australia, and southern Africa formed a continent called [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] as of 3,100&nbsp;Ma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogers JJ |title=A history of continents in the past three billion years| year = 1996 |journal=Journal of Geology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=91–107 |doi=10.1086/629803 |jstor=30068065 |bibcode=1996JG....104...91R|s2cid=128776432}}</ref> A differing conflicting hypothesis is that rocks from western Australia and southern Africa were assembled in a continent called [[Vaalbara]] as far back as 3,600&nbsp;Ma.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheney ES |title=Sequence stratigraphy and plate tectonic significance of the Transvaal succession of southern Africa and its equivalent in Western Australia |year=1996 |journal=Precambrian Research |volume=79 |issue=1–2 |pages=3–24 |doi=10.1016/0301-9268(95)00085-2 |bibcode=1996PreR...79....3C}}</ref> Although the first [[continent]]s formed during this eon, rock of this age makes up only 7% of the present world's [[craton]]s; even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations, evidence suggests that only 5–40% of the present area of continents formed during the Archean.<ref name=Stanley/>{{rp|pages=301–302}}

By the end of the Archean around 2500&nbsp;Ma (2.5&nbsp;Gya), plate tectonic activity may have been similar to that of the modern Earth. There are well-preserved [[sedimentary basin]]s, and evidence of [[volcanic arc]]s, intracontinental [[rift]]s, continent-continent collisions and widespread globe-spanning [[Orogeny|orogenic events]] suggesting the assembly and destruction of one and perhaps several [[supercontinent]]s. Evidence from  [[banded iron formation]]s, [[chert]] beds, chemical sediments and [[Basalt|pillow basalts]] demonstrates that liquid water was prevalent and deep oceanic basins already existed.

==Environment==
The Archean atmosphere is thought to have nearly lacked [[oxygen|free oxygen]]. Astronomers think that the Sun had about 70–75&nbsp;percent of the present luminosity, yet temperatures on Earth appear to have been near modern levels after only 500&nbsp;Ma of Earth's formation (the [[faint young Sun paradox]]). The presence of liquid water is evidenced by certain highly deformed [[gneiss]]es produced by metamorphism of [[sediment]]ary [[protolith]]s. The moderate temperatures may reflect the presence of greater amounts of greenhouse gases than later in the [[History of Earth|Earth's history]].<ref name=Walker>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=James C.G. |date=June 1985 |title=Carbon dioxide on the early earth | journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=117–127 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/43349/1/11084_2005_Article_BF01809466.pdf |access-date=2010-01-30 |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1007/BF01809466 |bibcode=1985OrLi...16..117W |hdl=2027.42/43349 |pmid=11542014|s2cid=206804461 }}</ref><ref name = "Pavlov">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pavlov AA, Kasting JF, Brown LL, Rages KA, Freedman R |title=Greenhouse warming by CH<sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere of early Earth |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=105 |issue=E5 |pages=11981–11990 |date=May 2000 |doi=10.1029/1999JE001134 |bibcode=2000JGR...10511981P |pmid=11543544}}</ref> Alternatively, Earth's [[albedo]] may have been lower at the time, due to less land area and cloud cover.<ref name=Rosing>{{cite journal |vauthors = Rosing MT, Bird DK, Sleep NH, Bjerrum CJ |title=No climate paradox under the faint early Sun |journal=Nature |volume=464 |issue=7289 |pages=744–747 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20360739 |doi=10.1038/nature08955 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..744R|s2cid=205220182 }}</ref>

==Early life==
{{Life timeline}}
The [[abiogenesis|processes that gave rise to life on Earth]] are not completely understood, but there is substantial evidence that life came into existence either near the end of the [[Hadean]] Eon or early in the Archean Eon.

The [[Earliest known life forms|earliest evidence]] for [[life]] on Earth are [[graphite]] of [[Biogenic substance|biogenic]] origin found in 3.7&nbsp;billion-year-old [[metasedimentary rock]]s discovered in [[Kitaa|Western Greenland]].<ref name="NG-20131208">{{Cite journal |vauthors=Ohtomo Y, Kakegawa T, Ishida A, Nagase T, Rosing MT |title=Evidence for biogenic graphite in early Archaean Isua metasedimentary rocks |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=25–28 |doi=10.1038/ngeo2025 |date=8 December 2013 |bibcode=2014NatGe...7...25O}}</ref>

The earliest identifiable fossils consist of [[stromatolite]]s, which are [[microbial mats]] formed in shallow water by [[cyanobacteria]].

Further evidence for early life is found in 3.47&nbsp;billion-year-old [[baryte]], in the [[Warrawoona Group]] of Western Australia.

Evidence of life in the Late [[Hadean]] is more controversial.

Earth was very hostile to life before 4.2–4.3&nbsp;Ga and the conclusion is that before the Archean Eon, life as we know it would have been challenged by these environmental conditions.
