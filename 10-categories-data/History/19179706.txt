== Thermodynamics, self-organization, and information: Physics ==

===Thermodynamics principles: Energy and entropy===

In antiquity it was commonly thought, for instance by Empedocles and Aristotle, that the life of the individuals of some species, and more generally, life itself, could start with high temperature, i.e. implicitly by thermal cycling.<ref>{{cite book|title=In the beginning: Some Greek views on the origins of life and the early state of man |year= 1957|last1= Guthrie|first1= W. K. C.|publisher=Methuen, London}}</ref>

Similarly, it was realized early on that life requires a loss of [[entropy]], or disorder, when molecules organize themselves into living matter. This [[Second law of thermodynamics|Second Law of thermodynamics]] needs to be considered when self-organization of matter to higher complexity happens. Because living organisms are machines,<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Simon| first1 = Michael A. | year = 1971| title = The Matter of Life | edition = 1| location = New Haven and London| publisher = Yale University Press}}</ref> the Second Law applies to life as well.

Thus, contrary to a naive view of the Second Law, the emergence of life and increased complexity does not contradict this law: First, a living organism creates order in some places (e.g. its living body or dwelling) on the expense of an increase of entropy elsewhere (e.g. heat and waste production). Second, the Second Law of thermodynamics actually predicts an increase in complexity<ref>Ladyman, J.; Lambert, J.; Weisner, K.B. What is a Complex System? Eur. J. Philos. Sci. 2013, 3,
33–67.</ref> and in correlations between a system and its surrounding, when undergoing interaction<ref>Esposito, M., Lindenberg, K., & Van den Broeck, C. (2010). Entropy production as correlation between system and reservoir. New Journal of Physics, 12(1), 013013.</ref> - with memory and genetic adaptation being examples of such correlations between a living organism and its environment.

====Obtaining free energy====
Bernal said on the Miller–Urey experiment that <blockquote>it is not enough to explain the formation of such molecules, what is necessary, is a physical-chemical explanation of the origins of these molecules that suggests the presence of suitable sources and sinks for free energy.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|p=143}}</ref></blockquote>

Multiple sources of energy were available for chemical reactions on the early Earth. For example, heat (such as from [[geothermal energy|geothermal]] processes) is a standard energy source for chemistry. Other examples include sunlight and electrical discharges (lightning), among others.<ref name="Follmann2009" /> In fact, lightning is a plausible energy source for the origin of life, given that just in the tropics lightning strikes about 100 million times a year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gora|first1=Evan M.|last2=Burchfield|first2=Jeffrey C.|last3=Muller‐Landau|first3=Helene C.|last4=Bitzer|first4=Phillip M.|last5=Yanoviak|first5=Stephen P.|title=Pantropical geography of lightning-caused disturbance and its implications for tropical forests|journal=Global Change Biology|year=2020|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|pages=5017–5026|doi=10.1111/gcb.15227|pmid=32564481|bibcode=2020GCBio..26.5017G|issn=1365-2486}}</ref>

Computer simulations also suggest that [[cavitation]] in primordial water reservoirs such as breaking sea waves, streams and oceans can potentially lead to the synthesis of biogenic compounds.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/acscentsci.7b00325|pmid= 28979946|pmc= 5620973|title= Cavitation-Induced Synthesis of Biogenic Molecules on Primordial Earth|journal= ACS Central Science|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 1041–1049|year= 2017|last1= Kalson|first1= Natan-Haim|last2= Furman|first2= David|last3= Zeiri|first3= Yehuda}}</ref>

Unfavourable reactions can also be driven by highly favourable ones, as in the case of iron-sulfur chemistry. For example, this was probably important for [[carbon fixation]] (the conversion of carbon from its inorganic form to an organic one).{{efn|The reactions are:
:FeS + H<sub>2</sub>S → FeS<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>−</sup>
:FeS + H<sub>2</sub>S + CO<sub>2</sub> → FeS<sub>2</sub> + HCOOH}} Carbon fixation via iron-sulfur chemistry is highly favourable, and occurs at neutral pH and 100C. Iron-sulfur surfaces, which are abundant near hydrothermal vents, are also capable of producing small amounts of amino acids and other biological metabolites.<ref name="Follmann2009" />

===Self-organization===
[[File:Hermann Haken, Pour le Merite 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Hermann Haken]]
The discipline of synergetics studies self-organization in physical systems. In his book ''[[Synergetics (Haken)|Synergetics]]''<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Haken| first1= Hermann | title=Synergetics. An Introduction. |year=1978 | publisher=Springer | location= Berlin  }}</ref> [[Hermann Haken]] has pointed out that different physical systems can be treated in a similar way. He gives as examples of self-organization several types of lasers, instabilities in fluid dynamics, including convection, and chemical and biochemical oscillations. In his preface he mentions the origin of life, but only in general terms:

<blockquote>
The spontaneous formation of well organized structures out of germs or even out of chaos is one of the most fascinating phenomena and most challenging problems scientists are confronted with. Such phenomena are an experience of our daily life when we observe the growth of plants and animals. Thinking of much larger time scales, scientists are led into the problems of evolution, and, ultimately, of the origin of living matter. When we try to explain or understand in some sense these extremely complex biological phenomena it is a natural question, whether processes of self-organization may be found in much simpler systems of the unanimated world.

In recent years it has become more and more evident that there exists numerous examples in physical and chemical systems where well organized spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal structures arise out of chaotic states. Furthermore, as in living organisms, the functioning of these systems can be maintained only by a flux of energy (and matter) through them. In contrast to man-made machines, which are devised to exhibit special structures and functionings, these structures develop spontaneously—they are ''selforganizing''. ...<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Haken| first1= Hermann | title=Synergetics. An Introduction. |year=1978 | publisher=Springer }}</ref>
</blockquote>

====Multiple dissipative structures====
This theory postulates that the hallmark of the origin and evolution of life is the microscopic dissipative structuring of [[Biological pigment|organic pigments]] and their proliferation over the entire Earth surface.<ref name="Michaelian, K. 2017" /> Present day life augments the entropy production of Earth in its solar environment by dissipating [[ultraviolet]] and [[Visible spectrum|visible]] [[photon]]s into heat through organic pigments in water. This heat then catalyzes a host of secondary dissipative processes such as the [[water cycle]], [[Ocean current|ocean]] and [[wind]] currents, [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]], etc.<ref name="Michaelian, K. 2011"/><ref name="HESS Opinions 'Biological catalysis">{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/hess-16-2629-2012 |title=HESS Opinions 'Biological catalysis of the hydrological cycle: Life's thermodynamic function' |journal=Hydrology and Earth System Sciences |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=2629–2645 |year=2012 |last1=Michaelian |first1=K |bibcode=2012HESS...16.2629M |arxiv= 0907.0040 }}</ref>

====Selforganization by dissipative structures====
[[File:Ilya Prigogine 1977c.jpg|thumb|upright|Ilya Prigogine 1977c]]The 19th-century physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] first recognized that the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor [[energy]], but instead had to do with [[entropy production]] derived from the conversion of the solar [[spectrum]] into [[heat]] by these systems.<ref>Boltzmann, L. (1886) The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in: Ludwig Boltzmann: Theoretical physics and Selected writings, edited by: McGinness, B., D. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1974.</ref> Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible processes]], were dependent on the [[dissipation]] of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book "What is Life", the 20th-century physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]]<ref>Schrödinger, Erwin (1944) What is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell. Cambridge University Press</ref> emphasized the importance of Boltzmann's deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life.

However, irreversible processes, and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until [[Lars Onsager]],<ref>Onsager, L. (1931) Reciprocal Relations in Irreversible Processes I and II, ''Phys. Rev.'' 37, 405; 38, 2265 (1931)</ref> and later Ilya [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine]],<ref>Prigogine, I. (1967) An Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, Wiley, New York</ref> developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the "self-organization" of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1977 "for his contributions to [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], particularly the theory of [[Dissipative system|dissipative structures]]". The analysis by Prigogine showed that if a [[system]] were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its [[entropy]]) forming what he called "dissipative structures" which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dewar | first1 = R | last2 = Juretić | first2 = D. | last3 = Županović | first3 = P. | year = 2006 | title = The functional design of the rotary enzyme ATP synthase is consistent with maximum entropy production | journal = Chem.

==Current life, the result of abiogenesis: biology==

===Definition of life===
As many as 123 definitions of life have been compiled.<ref name="JBSD-20110317">{{cite journal |last=Trifonov |first=Edward N. |title=Vocabulary of Definitions of Life Suggests a Definition |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/073911011010524992 |date=17 March 2011 |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=259-266 |doi=10.1080/073911011010524992 |accessdate=15 December 2020 }}</ref>

When discussing the origin of life, a definition of life itself is fundamental. The definition is somewhat disagreed upon (although follows the same basic principles) because different biology textbooks define life differently. James Gould:
<blockquote>
Most dictionaries define ''life'' as the property that distinguishes the living from the dead, and define ''dead'' as being deprived of life. These singularly circular and unsatisfactory definitions give us no clue to what we have in common with protozoans and plants. <ref “Gould”>{{cite book| last1 = Gould | first1 = James L. | last2 = Keeton | first2 = William T. | year = 1996| edition = 6 | title = Biological Science | location= New York | publisher = W.W. Norton }}</ref></blockquote>
whereas according to Neil Campbell and Jane Reece <blockquote>The phenomenon we call life defies a simple, one-sentence definition.<ref “Campbell”>{{cite book| last1 = Campbell | first1 = Neil A. |  last2 = Reece | first2 = Jane B.| year = 2005| edition = 7 | title = Biology | location= Sn Feancisco | publisher = Benjamin }}</ref></blockquote>

This difference can also be found in books on the origin of life. John Casti gives a single sentence:
<blockquote>By more or general consensus nowadays, an entity is considered to be "alive" if it has the capacity to carry out three basic functional activities: metabolism, self-repair, and replication.
<ref “Casti”>{{cite book| last1 = Casti | first1 = John L. | year = 1989| title = Paradigms lost.

====Fermentation====
[[File:Citric acid cycle.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Citric acid cycle]]
[[File:Metabolism diagram.svg|thumb|Overall diagram of the chemical reactions of metabolism, in which the citric acid cycle can be recognized as the circle just below the middle of the figure]] [[Albert L. Lehninger|Albert Lehninger]] has stated around 1970 that fermentation, including glycolysis, is a suitable primitive energy source for the origin of life.<ref “Lehninger”>{{cite book| last1 = Lehninger | first1 = Albert L. | year = 1970| title = Biochemistry. The Molecular Basis of Cell Structure and Function | location= New York | publisher = Worth | page = 313}}</ref>
<blockquote> Since living organisms probably first arose in an atmosphere lacking oxygen, anaerobic fermentation is the simplest and most primitive type of biological mechanism for obtaining energy from nutrient molecules. </blockquote>

Fermentation involves glycolysis, which, rather inefficiently, transduces the chemical energy of sugar into the chemical energy of ATP.

====Chemiosmosis====
[[File:Oxiphos.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Oxidative phosphorylation]]
[[File:Chemiosmotic coupling mitochondrion.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Chemiosmotic coupling mitochondrion]]

As [[Fermentation]] had around 1970 been elucidated, whereas the mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation had not and some controversies still existed, fermentation may have looked too complex for investigators of the origin of life at that time. [[Peter D. Mitchell|Peter Mitchell]]'s [[Chemiosmosis]] is now however generally accepted as correct.

Even Peter Mitchell himself assumed that fermentation preceded chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis is however ubiquitous in life. A model for the origin of life has been presented in terms of chemiosmosis.

Both respiration by mitochondria and photosynthesis in chloroplasts make use of chemiosmosis to generate most of their ATP.

Today the energy source of all life can be linked to photosynthesis, and one speaks of primary production by sunlight. The oxygen used for oxidizing reducing compounds by organisms at hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean is the result of photosynthesis at the Oceans' surface.

=====ATP synthase=====
[[File:ATP-Synthase.svg|thumb|upright|left|Depiction of ATP synthase using the chemiosmotic proton gradient to power ATP synthesis through [[oxidative phosphorylation]].]]
[[File:Paul D. Boyer.jpg|thumb|upright|Paul Boyer]]
The mechanism of ATP synthesis is complex and involves a closed membrane in which the [[ATP synthase]] is embedded. The ATP is synthesized by the F1 subunit of ATP synthase by the [[ATP synthase#Binding model|binding change mechanism]] discovered by [[Paul D. Boyer|Paul Boyer]]. The energy required to release formed strongly-bound ATP has its origin in protons that move across the membrane. These protons have been set across the membrane during respiration or photosynthesis.

===Key issues in abiogenesis===
====What came first: protein or nucleic acids?====
Possible precursors for the evolution of protein synthesis include a mechanism to synthesize short peptide cofactors or form a mechanism for the duplication of RNA. It is likely that the ancestral ribosome was composed entirely of RNA, although some roles have since been taken over by proteins. Major remaining questions on this topic include identifying the selective force for the evolution of the ribosome and determining how the [[genetic code]] arose.<ref name="Noller2012">{{cite journal |last=Noller |first=Harry F. |author-link=Harry F. Noller |date=April 2012 |title=Evolution of protein synthesis from an RNA world. |journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=a003681 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a003681 |pmc=3312679 |pmid=20610545}}</ref>

[[Eugene Koonin]] said, <blockquote>Despite considerable experimental and theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently exist for the origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account for the emergence of an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO ["many worlds in one"] version of the cosmological model of [[eternal inflation]] could suggest a way out of this conundrum because, in an infinite [[multiverse]] with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable.<ref name="pmc1892545">{{cite journal |last=Koonin |first=Eugene V. |date=31 May 2007 |title=The cosmological model of eternal inflation and the transition from chance to biological evolution in the history of life |journal=Biology Direct |volume=2 |page=15 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-2-15 |pmc=1892545 |pmid=17540027}}</ref></blockquote>

====Homochirality====
{{Main|Homochirality}}
Homochirality refers to a geometric uniformity of some materials composed of [[chirality|chiral]] units. Chiral refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions,<ref>{{harvnb|Chaichian|Rojas|Tureanu|2014|pp=353–364}}</ref> amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and [[Carbohydrate|sugars]] are right-handed. Chiral molecules can be synthesized, but in the absence of a chiral source or a chiral [[Catalysis|catalyst]], they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both [[enantiomer]]s (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystals]], or the Earth's rotation, [[statistical fluctuations]] during racemic synthesis,<ref name="Plasson2007">{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"</ref> and [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]].<ref name="jafarpour2017">{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/109170/1/PhysRevE.95.032407.pdf }}</ref><ref name="jafarpour2015">{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J |s2cid=9775791 }}</ref><ref name="frank1953">{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1|pmid=13105666 }}</ref>

===Early universe with first stars===
{{Nature timeline}} {{Life timeline}}
Soon after the [[Big Bang]], which occurred roughly 14 Gya, the only chemical elements present in the universe were hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the three lightest atoms in the periodic table. These elements gradually came together to form stars. These early stars were massive and short-lived, producing heavier elements through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. [[Carbon]], currently the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fourth most abundant chemical element]] in the universe (after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and [[oxygen]]), was formed mainly in [[white dwarf stars]], particularly those bigger than two solar masses.<ref name="INV-20200706">{{cite news|last=Rabie|first=Passant|date=6 July 2020|title=Astronomers Have Found The Source Of Life In The Universe|work=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|url=https://www.inverse.com/science/carbon-from-white-dwarfs|access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="NA-20200706">{{cite journal|author=Marigo, Paola|display-authors=et al.|date=6 July 2020|title=Carbon star formation as seen through the non-monotonic initial–final mass relation|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1132-1|journal=[[Nature Astronomy]]|volume=152|issue=11|pages=1102–1110|arxiv=2007.04163|doi=10.1038/s41550-020-1132-1|bibcode=2020NatAs...4.1102M|access-date=7 July 2020|s2cid=220403402}}</ref>

As these stars reached the end of their [[Stellar life cycle|lifecycles]], they ejected these heavier elements, among them carbon and oxygen, throughout the universe. These heavier elements allowed for the formation of new objects, including rocky planets and other bodies.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_life.html |title = WMAP- Life in the Universe}}</ref>

===Emergence of the Solar System===
According to the [[nebular hypothesis]], the formation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] began 4.6 Gya with the [[gravitational collapse]] of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].<ref>[http://www.astro.umass.edu/~myun/teaching/a100_old/solarnebulartheory.htm Formation of Solar Systems: Solar Nebular Theory.] University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Astronomy. Accessed on 27 September 2019.</ref> Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a [[protoplanetary disk]] out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] formed.

===Emergence of Earth===
The Earth, formed 4.5 Gya, was at first inhospitable to any living organisms. Based on numerous observations and studies of the [[geological time scale|geological time-scale]], the [[Hadean]] Earth is thought to have had a [[secondary atmosphere]], formed through [[Degasification|degassing]] of the rocks that accumulated from [[planetesimal]] [[impact event|impactors]]. At first, it was thought that the Earth's [[atmosphere]] consisted of hydrogen compounds—[[methane]], [[ammonia]] and [[Water vapor]]—and that life began under such [[redox|reducing]] conditions, which are conducive to the formation of organic molecules. According to later models, suggested by studying ancient minerals, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of water vapor, [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with smaller amounts of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[sulfur]] compounds.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kasting |first=James F. |author-link=James Kasting |date=12 February 1993 |title=Earth's Early Atmosphere |url=http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |journal=Science |volume=259 |issue=5097 |pages=920–926 |doi=10.1126/science.11536547 |pmid=11536547 |bibcode=1993Sci...259..920K |s2cid=21134564 |access-date=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074651/http://wwwdca.iag.usp.br/www/material/fornaro/ACA410/Kasting%201993_EarthEarlyAtmos.pdf |archive-date=10 October 2015}}</ref> During its formation, the Earth lost a significant part of its initial mass, with a nucleus of the heavier rocky elements of the protoplanetary disk remaining.<ref>{{harvnb|Fesenkov|1959|p=9}}</ref> As a consequence, Earth lacked the [[gravity]] to hold any molecular hydrogen in its atmosphere, and rapidly lost it during the Hadean period, along with the bulk of the original inert gases.

===Late heavy bombardment===
The Hadean environment would have been highly hazardous to modern life. Frequent collisions with large objects, up to 500&nbsp;km in diameter, would have been sufficient to sterilize the planet and vaporize the oceans within a few months of impact, with hot steam mixed with rock vapor becoming high altitude clouds that would completely cover the planet. After a few months, the height of these clouds would have begun to decrease but the cloud base would still have been elevated for about the next thousand years. After that, it would have begun to rain at low altitude. For another two thousand years, rains would slowly have drawn down the height of the clouds, returning the oceans to their original depth only 3,000&nbsp;y after the impact event.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sleep |first1=Norman H. |last2=Zahnle |first2=Kevin J. |author-link2=Kevin J.

Traditionally it was thought that during the period between 4.28<ref name="NAT-20170301" /><ref name="NYT-20170301" /> and 3.8&nbsp;Gya, changes in the orbits of the [[giant planet]]s may have caused a [[Late Heavy Bombardment|heavy bombardment]] by asteroids and [[comet]]s<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gomes |first1=Rodney |last2=Levison |first2=Hal F. |author-link2=Harold F.

This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time.<ref name="Follmann2009" /> Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have been far more active than at any other time in its history. Studies of [[meteorite]]s suggests that [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] such as [[aluminium-26]] with a [[half-life]] of 7.17&nbsp;ky, and [[potassium-40]] with a half-life of 1.25&nbsp;Gy, isotopes mainly produced in [[supernova]]e, were much more common.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2007|pp=61–73}}</ref> Internal heating as a result of [[Convection#Gravitational or buoyant convection|gravitational sorting]] between the [[Earth core|core]] and the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] would have caused a great deal of [[mantle convection]], with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.

The time periods between such devastating environmental events give time windows for the possible origin of life in the early environments. If the deep marine hydrothermal setting was the site for the origin of life, then abiogenesis could have happened as early as 4.0-4.2&nbsp;Gya. If the site was at the surface of the Earth, abiogenesis could only have occurred between 3.7-4.0 Gya.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maher |first1=Kevin A. |last2=Stevenson |first2=David J. |date=18 February 1988 |title=Impact frustration of the origin of life |journal=Nature |volume=331 |issue=6157 |pages=612–614 |bibcode=1988Natur.331..612M |doi=10.1038/331612a0 |pmid=11536595|s2cid=4284492 }}</ref>

Estimates of the production of organics from these sources suggest that the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] before 3.5&nbsp;Ga within the early atmosphere made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by terrestrial sources.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chyba |first1=Christopher |author-link=Christopher Chyba |last2=Sagan |first2=Carl |author-link2=Carl Sagan |date=9 January 1992 |title=Endogenous production, exogenous delivery and impact-shock synthesis of organic molecules: an inventory for the origins of life |journal=Nature |volume=355 |issue=6356 |pages=125–132 |bibcode=1992Natur.355..125C |doi=10.1038/355125a0 |pmid=11538392|s2cid=4346044 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Furukawa |first1=Yoshihiro |last2=Sekine |first2=Toshimori |last3=Oba |first3=Masahiro |last4=Kakegawa |first4=Takeshi |last5=Nakazawa |first5=Hiromoto |display-authors=3 |date=January 2009 |title=Biomolecule formation by oceanic impacts on early Earth |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=62–66 |bibcode=2009NatGe...2...62F |doi=10.1038/NGEO383}}</ref>

It has been estimated that the Late Heavy Bombardment may also have effectively sterilized the Earth's surface to a depth of tens of meters. If life evolved deeper than this, it would have also been shielded from the early high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the T Tauri stage of the Sun's evolution. Simulations of geothermically heated oceanic crust yield far more organics than those found in the Miller–Urey experiments. In the deep [[hydrothermal vent]]s, Everett Shock has found "there is an enormous thermodynamic drive to form organic compounds, as [[seawater]] and hydrothermal fluids, which are far from equilibrium, mix and move towards a more stable state."<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=155}}</ref> Shock has found that the available energy is maximized at around 100–150 C, precisely the temperatures at which the [[Hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] bacteria and [[Thermoacidophile|thermoacidophilic]] [[archaea]] have been found, at the base of the [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic tree of life]] closest to the [[Last universal ancestor|Last Universal Common Ancestor]] (LUCA).<ref>{{harvnb|Bock|Goode|1996}}</ref>

The panspermia hypothesis does not attempt to explain how life first originated but merely shifts the origin to another planet or a comet. The advantage of an extraterrestrial origin of primitive life is that life is not required to have formed on each planet it occurs on, but rather in a single location, and then spread about the [[galaxy]] to other star systems via cometary and/or meteorite impact.<ref name="NYT-20160912">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Visions of Life on Mars in Earth's Depths |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |date=12 September 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=12 September 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912225220/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/south-african-mine-life-on-mars.html |archive-date=12 September 2016}}</ref>

=== Spontaneous generation ===
====General acceptance of spontaneous generation until the 19th century====
{{Main|Spontaneous generation}}
Traditional religion attributed the origin of life to supernatural deities who created the natural world. ''Spontaneous generation,'' the first naturalistic theory of life arising from non-life, goes back to [[Aristotle]] and [[ancient Greek philosophy]], and continued to have support in Western scholarship until the 19th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Sheldon|2005}}</ref> Classical notions of spontaneous generation held that certain "lower" or "vermin" animals are generated by decaying organic substances. According to Aristotle, it was readily observable that [[aphid]]s arise from dew on plants, [[fly|flies]] from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from rotting sunken logs, and so on.<ref>{{harvnb|Lennox|2001|pp=229–258}}</ref> A related theory was ''heterogenesis'': that some forms of life could arise from different forms (e.g. bees from flowers).<ref>{{harvnb|Vartanian|1973|pp=307–312}}</ref> The modern scientist [[John Desmond Bernal|John Bernal]] said that the basic idea of such theories was that life was continuously created as a result of chance events.<ref name="Bernal 1967">{{harvnb|Bernal|1967}}</ref>

In the 17th century, people began to question such assumptions. In 1646, [[Sir Thomas Browne|Thomas Browne]] published his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' (subtitled ''Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths''), which was an attack on false beliefs and "vulgar errors." His contemporary, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]], erroneously refuted him, stating:<blockquote> To question this [spontaneous generation], is to question Reason, Sense, and Experience: If he doubts of this, let him go to ''[[Egypt|Ægypt]]'', and there he will find the fields swarming with mice begot of the mud of ''[[Nile|Nylus]]'', to the great calamity of the Inhabitants.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Balme |first=D.M. |author-link=David Mowbray Balme |year=1962 |title=Development of Biology in Aristotle and Theophrastus: Theory of Spontaneous Generation |journal=[[Phronesis (journal)|Phronesis]] |volume=7 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1163/156852862X00052}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ross|1652}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Anton van Leeuwenhoek.png|thumb|upright|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]
In 1665, [[Robert Hooke]] published the first drawings of a [[microorganism]]. Hooke was followed in 1676 by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], who drew and described microorganisms that are now thought to have been [[protozoa]] and [[bacteria]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dobell|1960}}</ref> Many felt the existence of microorganisms was evidence in support of spontaneous generation, since microorganisms seemed too simplistic for [[sexual reproduction]], and [[asexual reproduction]] through [[mitosis|cell division]] had not yet been observed. Van Leeuwenhoek took issue with the ideas common at the time that fleas and lice could spontaneously result from [[putrefaction]], and that frogs could likewise arise from slime. Using a broad range of experiments ranging from sealed and open meat incubation and the close study of insect reproduction he became, by the 1680s, convinced that spontaneous generation was incorrect.<ref>{{harvnb|Bondeson|1999}}</ref>

The first experimental evidence against spontaneous generation came in 1668 when [[Francesco Redi]] showed that no [[maggot]]s appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. It was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative hypothesis was ''[[biogenesis]]'': that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (''omne vivum ex ovo'', Latin for "every living thing from an egg").<ref name=lev>{{cite web |vauthors=Levine R, Evers C |title=The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859) |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php |access-date=18 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426191204/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/Spontaneous_Generation.php |archive-date=26 April 2008 }}</ref> In 1768, [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] demonstrated that [[microorganism|microbes]] were present in the air, and could be killed by boiling. In 1861, [[Louis Pasteur]] performed a series of experiments that demonstrated that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not spontaneously appear in sterile, nutrient-rich media, but could only appear by invasion from without.

By the middle of the 19th century, biogenesis had accumulated so much evidence in support that the alternative theory of spontaneous generation had been effectively disproven. [[Louis Pasteur|Pasteur]] remarked, about a finding of his in 1864 which he considered definitive, <blockquote>Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Oparin|1953|p=196}}</ref><ref name="Tyndall Fragments2">{{harvnb|Tyndall|1905|loc=IV, XII (1876), XIII (1878)}}</ref> </blockquote>gave a mechanism by which life diversified from a few simple organisms to a variety of to complex forms. Today, scientists agree that all current life descends from earlier life, which has become progressively more complex and diverse through [[Charles Darwin]]'s mechanism of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].

Darwin wrote to Hooker in 1863 stating that, <blockquote>It is mere rubbish, thinking at present of the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter.</blockquote> In ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', he had referred to life having been "created", by which he "really meant 'appeared' by some wholly unknown process", but had soon regretted using the Old Testament term "creation".{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

====Etymology of biogenesis and abiogenesis====
{{Main|Biogenesis}}
The term ''biogenesis'' is usually credited to either [[Henry Charlton Bastian|Henry Bastian]] or to [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]].<ref name="eohtBiogenesis">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Hmolpedia |title=Biogenesis |url=http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |access-date=2014-05-19 |publisher=WikiFoundry, Inc. |location=Ancaster, Ontario, Canada |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520001148/http://www.eoht.info/page/Biogenesis |archive-date=20 May 2014}}</ref> Bastian used the term around 1869 in an unpublished exchange with [[John Tyndall]] to mean "life-origination or commencement". In 1870, Huxley, as new president of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], delivered an address entitled ''Biogenesis and Abiogenesis''.<ref name="Huxley 1968">{{harvnb|Huxley|1968}}</ref> In it he introduced the term ''biogenesis'' (with an opposite meaning to Bastian's) as well as ''abiogenesis'':

:And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter, took definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of living matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It will be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of ''Biogenesis''; and I shall term the contrary doctrine—that living matter may be produced by not living matter—the hypothesis of ''Abiogenesis''.<ref name="Huxley 1968" />

Subsequently, in the preface to Bastian's 1871 book, ''The Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms'',<ref>{{harvnb|Bastian|1871}}</ref> Bastian referred to the possible confusion with Huxley's usage and explicitly renounced his own meaning:

:A word of explanation seems necessary with regard to the introduction of the new term ''Archebiosis''. I had originally, in unpublished writings, adopted the word ''Biogenesis'' to express the same meaning—viz., life-origination or commencement. But in the meantime, the word ''Biogenesis'' has been made use of, quite independently, by a distinguished biologist [Huxley], who wished to make it bear a totally different meaning. He also introduced the word ''Abiogenesis''. I have been informed, however, on the best authority, that neither of these words can—with any regard to the language from which they are derived—be supposed to bear the meanings which have of late been publicly assigned to them. Wishing to avoid all needless confusion, I therefore renounced the use of the word ''Biogenesis'', and being, for the reason just given, unable to adopt the other term, I was compelled to introduce a new word, in order to designate the process by which living matter is supposed to come into being, independently of pre-existing living matter.<ref>{{harvnb|Bastian|1871|p=[https://ia902701.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?zip=/23/items/modesoforiginofl00bast/modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2.zip&file=modesoforiginofl00bast_jp2/modesoforiginofl00bast_0015.jp2&scale=4&rotate=0 xi–xii]}}</ref>

Since the end of the nineteenth century, 'evolutive abiogenesis' means increasing complexity and evolution of matter from inert to living states.<ref>[https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-27833-4_2-4 Abiogenesis – Definition]. 20 April 2015.

=== Oparin: Primordial soup hypothesis ===
{{anchor | Haldane and Oparin: The Primordial Soup Theory}}<!--This section is linked from [[The Selfish Gene]]-->
{{Main|Primordial soup}}
{{further|Miller–Urey experiment}}

There is no single generally accepted model for the origin of life. Scientists have proposed several plausible hypotheses which share some common elements. While differing in details, these hypotheses are based on the framework laid out by [[Alexander Oparin]] (in 1924) and [[J. B. S. Haldane|John Haldane]] (in 1925), that the first molecules constituting the earliest cells <blockquote>. . . were synthesized under natural conditions by a slow process of molecular evolution, and these molecules then organized into the first molecular system with properties with biological order".<ref name="bah2">{{cite journal|last=Bahadur|first=Krishna|year=1973|title=Photochemical Formation of Self–sustaining Coacervates|url=http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Proceedings of the Indian National Science Academy|volume=39B|issue=4|pages=455–467|doi=10.1016/S0044-4057(75)80076-1|pmid=1242552|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019172800/http://www.dli.gov.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b73_455.pdf|archive-date=19 October 2013}}

According to later models, the atmosphere in the late Hadean period consisted largely of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide, with smaller amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), and sulfur compounds;<ref>{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=922}}</ref> while it did lack molecular oxygen and ozone,<ref>{{harvnb|Kasting|1993|p=920}}</ref> it was not as chemically reducing as Oparin and Haldane supposed.
No new notable research or hypothesis on the subject appeared until 1924, when Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevents the synthesis of certain organic compounds that are necessary building blocks for life. In his book ''The Origin of Life'',<ref>{{harvnb|Bernal|1967|loc=[http://www.valencia.edu/~orilife/textos/The%20Origin%20of%20Life.pdf ''The Origin of Life'' (A.I. Oparin, 1924), pp. 199–234]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Oparin|1953}}</ref> he proposed (echoing Darwin) that the "spontaneous generation of life" that had been attacked by Pasteur did, in fact, occur once, but was now impossible because the conditions found on the early Earth had changed, and preexisting organisms would immediately consume any spontaneously generated organism. Oparin argued that a "primeval soup" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygenless atmosphere through the action of [[sunlight]]. These would combine in ever more complex ways until they formed [[coacervate]] droplets. These droplets would "[[cell growth|grow]]" by fusion with other droplets, and "[[reproduction|reproduce]]" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive [[metabolism]] in which factors that promote "cell integrity" survive, and those that do not become [[Extinction|extinct]]. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.

About this time, Haldane suggested that the Earth's prebiotic oceans (quite different from their modern counterparts) would have formed a "hot dilute soup" in which organic compounds could have formed. Bernal called this idea ''biopoiesis'' or ''biopoesis'', the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but non-living molecules,<ref name="Bernal 1967" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bryson|2004|pp=300–302}}</ref> and proposed that biopoiesis passes through a number of intermediate stages.

[[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] has summarized the "primordial soup" theory of Oparin and Haldane in its "mature form" as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|1987|p=110}}</ref>
# The early Earth had a chemically [[reducing atmosphere]].
# This atmosphere, exposed to [[energy]] in various forms, produced simple organic compounds ("[[monomer]]s").
# These compounds accumulated in a "soup" that may have concentrated at various locations (shorelines, [[Hydrothermal vent|oceanic vents]] etc.).
# By further transformation, more complex organic [[polymer]]s—and ultimately life—developed in the soup.

===John Bernal===
John Bernal showed that based upon this and subsequent work there is no difficulty in principle in forming most of the molecules we recognize as the necessary molecules for life from their inorganic precursors. The underlying hypothesis held by Oparin, Haldane, Bernal, Miller and Urey, for instance, was that multiple conditions on the primeval Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized the same set of complex organic compounds from such simple precursors.
Bernal coined the term ''biopoiesis'' in 1949 to refer to the origin of life.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernal|1951}}</ref> In 1967, he suggested that it occurred in three "stages":

# the origin of biological monomers
# the origin of biological polymers
# the evolution from molecules to cells

Bernal suggested that evolution commenced between stages 1 and 2. Bernal regarded the third stage, in which biological reactions were incorporated behind a cell's boundary, as the most difficult. Modern work on the way that [[cell membrane]]s self-assemble, and the work on micropores in various substrates, may be a key step towards understanding the development of independent free-living cells.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Martin |first= William F. |author-link= William F.

===Miller–Urey experiment===
[[File:Miller1999.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stanley Miller]]
[[File:Miller-Urey.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Miller–Urey experiment JP]] One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the "soup" theory came in 1952. [[Stanley L. Miller|Stanley Miller]] and [[Harold C. Urey|Harold Urey]] performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors under conditions like those posited by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous [[Miller–Urey experiment]] used a highly reducing mixture of gases—[[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen gas|hydrogen]], as well as [[water vapor]]—to form simple organic monomers such as amino acids.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stanley L. |author-link=Stanley Miller |date=15 May 1953 |title=A Production of Amino Acids Under Possible Primitive Earth Conditions |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=117 |issue=3046 |pages=528–529 |bibcode=1953Sci...117..528M |doi=10.1126/science.117.3046.528 |pmid=13056598}}</ref> The mixture of gases was cycled through an apparatus that delivered electrical sparks to the mixture. After one week, it was found that about 10% to 15% of the carbon in the system was then in the form of a [[racemic mixture]] of organic compounds, including amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]s. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the "soup" theory, and it is around the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centers.
A 2011 reanalysis of the saved vials containing the original extracts that resulted from the Miller and Urey experiments, using current and more advanced analytical equipment and technology, has uncovered more biochemicals than originally discovered in the 1950s. One of the more important findings was 23 amino acids, far more than the five originally found.<ref name="pmid21422282">{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Eric T. |last2=Cleaves |first2=Henderson J. |last3=Dworkin |first3=Jason P. |last4=Glavin |first4=Daniel P. |last5=Callahan |first5=Michael |last6=Aubrey |first6=Andrew |last7=Lazcano |first7=Antonio |last8=Bada |first8=Jeffrey L. |display-authors=3 |date=5 April 2011 |title=Primordial synthesis of amines and amino acids in a 1958 Miller H<sub>2</sub>S-rich spark discharge experiment |journal=Proc.

Several mechanisms of organic molecule synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides.

A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble [[calcium phosphate]] ([[apatite]]), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate.

===Chemical synthesis in the laboratory===
As early as the 1860s, experiments have demonstrated that biologically relevant molecules can be produced from interaction of simple carbon sources with abundant inorganic catalysts.

====Fox proteinoids====
{{Main|Proteinoid}}
In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis mentioned by Bernal, [[Sidney W. Fox|Sidney Fox]] in the 1950s and 1960s studied the spontaneous formation of [[peptide]] structures (small chains of amino acids) under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth's history. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions: In an experiment to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a [[cinder cone]] in [[Hawaii]]. He discovered that the temperature was over 100 C just {{convert|4|in}} beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface, and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water, a thick, brown liquid leached out. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like, submicroscopic [[Peptide|polypeptide]] molecules.<ref name="foxexp"/>

====Sugars====
In particular, experiments by [[Alexander Butlerov|Butlerov]] (the [[formose reaction]]) showed that tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses are produced when formaldehyde is heated under basic conditions with divalent metal ions like calcium.  The reaction was scrutinized and subsequently proposed to be autocatalytic by Breslow in 1959.

====Nucleobases====
Similar experiments (see below) demonstrate that nucleobases like guanine and adenine could be synthesized from simple carbon and nitrogen sources like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia.

[[Formamide]] produces all four ribonucleotides and other biological molecules when warmed in the presence of various terrestrial minerals. Formamide is ubiquitous in the Universe, produced by the reaction of water and [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN). It has several advantages as a biotic precursor, including the ability to easily become concentrated through the evaporation of water.<ref name="Saladino2012">{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Crestini |first2=Claudia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=March 2012 |title=Formamide and the origin of life. |journal=[[Physics of Life Reviews]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=84–104 |bibcode=2012PhLRv...9...84S |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2011.12.002 |pmid=22196896|hdl=2108/85168 |url=https://art.torvergata.it/bitstream/2108/85168/1/PoLRev%202012.pdf }}</ref><ref name="Saladino2012b">{{cite journal |last1=Saladino |first1=Raffaele |last2=Botta |first2=Giorgia |last3=Pino |first3=Samanta |last4=Costanzo |first4=Giovanna |last5=Di Mauro |first5=Ernesto |display-authors=3 |date=July 2012 |title=From the one-carbon amide formamide to RNA all the steps are prebiotically possible |journal=[[Biochimie]] |volume=94 |issue=7 |pages=1451–1456 |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2012.02.018 |pmid=22738728}}</ref> Although HCN is poisonous, it only affects [[aerobic organism]]s ([[eukaryote]]s and aerobic bacteria), which did not yet exist.

In March 2015, NASA scientists reported that, for the first time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and [[thymine]], have been formed in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites.

====Use of less-reducing gas in Miller–Urey experiment====

=== Autocatalysis ===
{{Main|Autocatalysis}}
[[Autocatalysis|Autocatalysts]] are substances that catalyze the production of themselves and therefore are "molecular replicators." The simplest self-replicating chemical systems are autocatalytic, and typically contain three components: a product molecule and two precursor molecules. The product molecule joins together the precursor molecules, which in turn produce more product molecules from more precursor molecules. The product molecule catalyzes the reaction by providing a complementary template that binds to the precursors, thus bringing them together. Such systems have been demonstrated both in biological [[macromolecule]]s and in small organic molecules.<ref name="Paul2004">{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Natasha |last2=Joyce |first2=Gerald F. |date=December 2004 |title=Minimal self-replicating systems |journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=634–639 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.09.005|pmid=15556408}}</ref><ref name="Bissette2013">{{cite journal |last1=Bissette |first1=Andrew J. |last2=Fletcher |first2=Stephen P. |date=2 December 2013 |title=Mechanisms of Autocatalysis |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=52 |issue=49 |pages=12800–12826 |doi=10.1002/anie.201303822 |pmid=24127341}}</ref> Systems that do not proceed by template mechanisms, such as the self-reproduction of [[micelle]]s and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]], have also been observed.<ref name="Bissette2013" />

Additionally, the droplets have scaffolding ability, by allowing lipids to assemble around them that may have prevented leakage of genetic materials.

=== Proteinoid microspheres ===
Fox observed in the 1960s that the proteinoids that he had synthesized could form cell-like structures that have been named "[[Proteinoid|proteinoid microspheres]]".<ref name="foxexp">{{cite web |url=http://nitro.biosci.arizona.edu/courses/EEB105/lectures/Origins_of_Life/origins.html |title=Part 4: Experimental studies of the origins of life |last=Walsh |first=J.

The amino acids had combined to form [[proteinoid]]s, and the proteinoids had combined to form small globules that Fox called "microspheres". His proteinoids were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of [[cyanobacteria]], but they contained no functional [[nucleic acid]]s or any encoded information. Based upon such experiments, [[Colin Pittendrigh]] stated in 1967 that "laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years," a remark that reflected the typical contemporary naivety about the complexity of cell structures.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|1969|p=287}}</ref>

These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other [[Amphiphile|amphiphilic]] long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves the same size and composition of lipids in the two [[Offspring|progenies]]. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.<ref name="Chen 2010" />
Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Eigen |first1=Manfred |author-link1=Manfred Eigen |last2=Schuster |first2=Peter |author-link2=Peter Schuster |date=November 1977 |title=The Hypercycle.

Another approach to the notion of a protocell concerns the term "[[chemoton]]" (short for 'chemical [[automaton]]') which refers to an abstract model for the fundamental unit of life introduced by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[theoretical biologist]] [[Tibor Gánti]].<ref name="NG-20201214">{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Michael |title=He may have found the key to the origins of life.

=== Lipid vesicles formation in fresh water ===
[[Bruce Damer]] and [[David Deamer]] have come to the conclusion that [[cell membrane]]s cannot be formed in salty [[seawater]], and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a [[superorganism]] rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Damer |first1=Bruce |last2=Deamer |first2=David |date=13 March 2015 |title=Coupled Phases and Combinatorial Selection in Fluctuating Hydrothermal Pools: A Scenario to Guide Experimental Approaches to the Origin of Cellular Life |journal=Life |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=872–887 |doi=10.3390/life5010872 |pmc=4390883 |pmid=25780958}}</ref>

The naturally arising, three-dimensional compartmentation observed within fossilized seepage-site metal sulphide precipitates indicates that these inorganic compartments were the precursors of cell walls and membranes found in free-living prokaryotes. The known capability of FeS and NiS to catalyze the synthesis of the acetyl-methylsulphide from carbon monoxide and methylsulphide, constituents of hydrothermal fluid, indicates that pre-biotic syntheses occurred at the inner surfaces of these metal-sulphide-walled compartments,...<ref name="Martin2003" /></blockquote> These form where hydrogen-rich fluids emerge from below the sea floor, as a result of [[Serpentinite|serpentinization]] of ultra-[[mafic]] [[olivine]] with seawater and a pH interface with carbon dioxide-rich ocean water. The vents form a sustained chemical energy source derived from redox reactions, in which electron donors (molecular hydrogen) react with electron acceptors (carbon dioxide); see [[Iron–sulfur world theory]]. These are highly [[exothermic reaction]]s.<ref name=":1" />{{efn|The reactions are:<br />

Reaction 3 describes the hydration of olivine with water only to yield [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] and Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> ([[brucite]]).

Russell demonstrated that alkaline vents created an abiogenic [[Proton electromotive force|proton motive force]] (PMF) [[Chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] gradient,<ref name="Martin2003" /> in which conditions are ideal for an abiogenic hatchery for life. Their microscopic compartments "provide a natural means of concentrating organic molecules," composed of iron-sulfur minerals such as [[mackinawite]], endowed these mineral cells with the catalytic properties envisaged by [[Günter Wächtershäuser]].<ref name="Lane 2009" /> This movement of ions across the membrane depends on a combination of two factors:
# [[Diffusion]] force caused by concentration gradient—all particles including ions tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower.
# Electrostatic force caused by electrical potential gradient—[[cations]] like [[proton]]s H<sup>+</sup> tend to diffuse down the electrical potential, [[anions]] in the opposite direction.
These two gradients taken together can be expressed as an [[electrochemical gradient]], providing energy for abiogenic synthesis. The proton motive force can be described as the measure of the potential energy stored as a combination of proton and voltage gradients across a membrane (differences in proton concentration and electrical potential).

[[Jack W. Szostak | Szostak]] suggested that geothermal activity provides greater opportunities for the origination of life in open lakes where there is a buildup of minerals. In 2010, based on spectral analysis of sea and hot mineral water, Ignat Ignatov and Oleg Mosin demonstrated that life may have predominantly originated in hot mineral water. The hot mineral water that contains [[bicarbonate]] and [[calcium]] ions has the most optimal range.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ignatov |first1=Ignat |last2=Mosin |first2=Oleg V. |year=2013 |title=Possible Processes for Origin of Life and Living Matter with modeling of Physiological Processes of Bacterium ''Bacillus Subtilis'' in Heavy Water as Model System |journal=Journal of Natural Sciences Research |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=65–76}}</ref> This case is similar to the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, but with bicarbonate and calcium ions in hot water.

=== Fluctuating hydrothermal pools on volcanic islands or proto-continents ===
Mulkidjanian and co-authors think that the marine environments did not provide the ionic balance and composition universally found in cells, as well as of ions required by essential proteins and ribozymes found in virtually all living organisms, especially with respect to K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate concentrations. The only known environments that mimic the needed conditions on Earth are found in terrestrial hydrothermal pools fed by steam vents.<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, mineral deposits in these environments under an anoxic atmosphere would have suitable pH (as opposed to current pools in an oxygenated atmosphere), contain precipitates of sulfide minerals that block harmful UV radiation, have wetting/drying cycles that concentrate substrate solutions to concentrations amenable to spontaneous formation of polymers of nucleic acids, polyesters<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chandru |first1=Kuhan |last2=Guttenberg |first2=Nicholas |last3=Giri |first3=Chaitanya |last4=Hongo |first4=Yayoi |last5=Butch |first5=Christopher |last6=Mamajanov |first6=Irena |last7=Cleaves |first7=H.

Colín-García ''et al.'' (2016) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hydrothermal vents as primitive environments.<ref name=":1"/> They mention the exergonic reactions in such systems could have been a source of free energy that promoted chemical reactions, additional to their high mineralogical diversity which implies the induction of important chemical gradients, thus favoring the interaction between electron donors and acceptors.

===Volcanic ash in the ocean===
[[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]] has argued that a complex nucleation event as the origin of life involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Geoffrey William|title=A network theory of the origin of life|date=24 December 2016|biorxiv=10.1101/096701}}</ref> Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex nucleation event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.

=== Gold's deep-hot biosphere ===
In the 1970s, [[Thomas Gold]] proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. It is claimed that the discovery of microbial life below the surface of another body in our Solar System would lend significant credence to this theory. Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms [[Microbial metabolism#Hydrogen oxidation|subsist on hydrogen]] released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.

=== Radioactive beach hypothesis ===
Zachary Adam claims that tidal processes that occurred during a time when the Moon was much closer may have concentrated grains of [[uranium]] and other radioactive elements at the high-water mark on primordial beaches, where they may have been responsible for generating life's building blocks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dartnell |first=Lewis |date=12 January 2008 |title=Did life begin on a radioactive beach? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |journal=New Scientist |issue=2638 |page=8 |access-date=2015-06-26 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627101858/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726384.000-did-life-begin-on-a-radioactive-beach.html |archive-date=27 June 2015}}</ref> According to computer models,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adam |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=Actinides and Life's Origins |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=852–872 |bibcode=2007AsBio...7..852A |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0066|pmid=18163867}}</ref> a deposit of such radioactive materials could show the same [[Natural nuclear fission reactor|self-sustaining nuclear reaction]] as that found in the [[Oklo]] uranium ore seam in [[Gabon]]. Such radioactive beach sand might have provided sufficient energy to generate organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars from [[acetonitrile]] in water. Radioactive [[monazite]] material also has released soluble phosphate into the regions between sand-grains, making it biologically "accessible." Thus amino acids, sugars, and soluble phosphates might have been produced simultaneously, according to Adam. Radioactive [[actinide]]s, left behind in some concentration by the reaction, might have formed part of [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic complexes]]. These complexes could have been important early catalysts to living processes.

John Parnell has suggested that such a process could provide part of the "crucible of life" in the early stages of any early wet rocky planet, so long as the planet is large enough to have generated a system of plate tectonics which brings radioactive minerals to the surface. As the early Earth is thought to have had many smaller plates, it might have provided a suitable environment for such processes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Parnell |first=John |date=December 2004 |title=Mineral Radioactivity in Sands as a Mechanism for Fixation of Organic Carbon on the Early Earth |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=533–547 |bibcode=2004OLEB...34..533P |doi=10.1023/B:ORIG.0000043132.23966.a1 |pmid=15570707|citeseerx=10.1.1.456.8955 |s2cid=6067448 }}</ref>

<blockquote>The first organisms were self-replicating iron-rich clays which fixed carbon dioxide into oxalic and other [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then evolved into the sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore, the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hartman |first=Hyman |date=1998 |title=Photosynthesis and the Origin of Life |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=28 |issue=4–6 |pages=515–521 |bibcode=1998OLEB...28..515H |doi=10.1023/A:1006548904157 |pmid=11536891|s2cid=2464 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 2007, Bart Kahr from the [[University of Washington]] and colleagues reported their experiments that tested the idea that crystals can act as a source of transferable information, using crystals of [[potassium hydrogen phthalate]]. "Mother" crystals with imperfections were cleaved and used as seeds to grow "daughter" crystals from solution. They then examined the distribution of imperfections in the new crystals and found that the imperfections in the mother crystals were reproduced in the daughters, but the daughter crystals also had many additional imperfections. For gene-like behavior to be observed, the quantity of inheritance of these imperfections should have exceeded that of the mutations in the successive generations, but it did not. Thus Kahr concluded that the crystals "were not faithful enough to store and transfer information from one generation to the next."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Caroline |date=16 July 2007 |title=Crystals as genes? |url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |journal=Highlights in Chemical Science |access-date=2015-06-21 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714094855/http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2007/08/Crystals_as_genes.asp |archive-date=14 July 2015}}

It systematically traces today's biochemistry to primordial reactions which provide alternative pathways to the synthesis of organic building blocks from simple gaseous compounds.

In contrast to the classical Miller experiments, which depend on external sources of energy (simulated lightning, ultraviolet [[irradiation]]), "Wächtershäuser systems" come with a built-in source of energy: [[sulfide]]s of iron (iron [[pyrite]]) and other minerals. The energy released from [[redox]] reactions of these metal sulfides is available for the synthesis of organic molecules, and such systems may have evolved into autocatalytic sets constituting self-replicating, metabolically active entities predating the life forms known today.<ref name="Ralser 2014" /><ref name="Metabolism 2014" /> Experiments with such sulfides in an aqueous environment at 100&nbsp;°C produced a relatively small yield of [[dipeptide]]s (0.4% to 12.4%) and a smaller yield of [[tripeptide]]s (0.10%) although under the same conditions, dipeptides were quickly broken down.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huber |first1=Claudia |last2=Wächtershäuser |first2=Günter |author-link2=Günter Wächtershäuser |date=31 July 1998 |title=Peptides by Activation of Amino Acids with CO on (Ni,Fe)S Surfaces: Implications for the Origin of Life |journal=Science |volume=281 |issue=5377 |pages=670–672 |bibcode=1998Sci...281..670H |doi=10.1126/science.281.5377.670 |pmid=9685253}}</ref>

Several models reject the self-replication of a "naked-gene", postulating instead the emergence of a primitive metabolism providing a safe environment for the later emergence of RNA replication. The centrality of the [[Citric acid cycle|Krebs cycle]] (citric acid cycle) to energy production in aerobic organisms, and in drawing in carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions in biosynthesis of complex organic chemicals, suggests that it was one of the first parts of the metabolism to evolve.<ref name="Lane 2009">{{harvnb|Lane|2009}}</ref> Concordantly, [[Geochemistry|geochemists]]

One of the earliest incarnations of this idea was put forward in 1924 with Oparin's notion of primitive self-replicating vesicles which predated the discovery of the structure of DNA. Variants in the 1980s and 1990s include Wächtershäuser's iron–sulfur world theory and models introduced by [[Christian de Duve]] based on the chemistry of [[thioester]]s. More abstract and theoretical arguments for the plausibility of the emergence of metabolism without the presence of genes include a mathematical model introduced by [[Freeman Dyson]] in the early 1980s and [[Stuart Kauffman]]'s notion of collectively autocatalytic sets, discussed later that decade.

Orgel summarized his analysis by stating, <blockquote>There is at present no reason to expect that multistep cycles such as the reductive citric acid cycle will self-organize on the surface of FeS/FeS<sub>2</sub> or some other mineral."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Orgel |first=Leslie E. |date=7 November 2000 |title=Self-organizing biochemical cycles |journal=Proc.

For example, instead of the reductive citric acid cycle, the "open" [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway (another one of the five recognized ways of carbon dioxide fixation in nature today) would be compatible with the idea of self-organization on a metal sulfide surface. The key enzyme of this pathway, [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]/[[CO-methylating acetyl-CoA synthase|acetyl-CoA synthase]], harbors mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centers and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. There are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic [[Thioacetic acid|thiolated]] and [[thioester]] compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chandru|first1=Kuhan|last2=Gilbert|first2=Alexis|last3=Butch|first3=Christopher|last4=Aono|first4=Masashi|last5=Cleaves|first5=Henderson James II|title=The Abiotic Chemistry of Thiolated Acetate Derivatives and the Origin of Life|journal=Scientific Reports|date=21 July 2016|volume=6|issue=29883|pages=29883|doi=10.1038/srep29883|pmid=27443234|pmc=4956751|bibcode=2016NatSR...629883C}}</ref> It has also been proposed that [[cysteine]] and [[homocysteine]] may have reacted with [[nitrile]]s resulting from the [[Strecker amino acid synthesis|Stecker reaction]], readily forming catalytic thiol-reach poplypeptides.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vallee|first1=Yannick|last2=Shalayel|first2=Ibrahim|last3=Ly|first3=Kieu-Dung|last4=Rao|first4=K.

Oceanic [[Hydrothermal vent|vent systems]] and other hydrothermal systems have a zonal structure reflected in ancient [[Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit|volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits]] (VMS) of hydrothermal origin. They reach many kilometers in diameter and date back to the [[Archean]] Eon. Most abundant are pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>), [[chalcopyrite]] (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), and [[sphalerite]] (ZnS), with additions of [[galena]] (PbS) and [[alabandite]] (MnS). ZnS and MnS have a unique ability to store radiation energy, e.g. from UV light. During the relevant time window of the origins of replicating molecules, the primordial atmospheric pressure was high enough (>100&nbsp;bar, about 100 atmospheres) to precipitate near the Earth's surface, and UV irradiation was 10 to 100 times more intense than now; hence the unique photosynthetic properties mediated by ZnS provided just the right energy conditions to energize the synthesis of informational and metabolic molecules and the selection of photostable nucleobases.

The Zn-world theory has been further filled out with experimental and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of the interior of the first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and [[Origin of eukaryotes|proto-eukaryotes]] evolved.

Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapor-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO<sub>2</sub>-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells.

===The hypercycle===
In the early 1970s, Manfred Eigen and [[Peter Schuster]] examined the transient stages between the molecular chaos and a self-replicating [[Hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]] in a prebiotic soup.<ref>{{harvnb|Eigen|Schuster|1979}}</ref> In a hypercycle, the [[information]] storing system (possibly RNA) produces an [[enzyme]], which catalyzes the formation of another information system, in sequence until the product of the last aids in the formation of the first information system. Mathematically treated, hypercycles could create [[Quasispecies model|quasispecies]], which through natural selection entered into a form of Darwinian evolution. A boost to hypercycle theory was the discovery of [[ribozyme]]s capable of catalyzing their own chemical reactions. The hypercycle theory requires the existence of complex biochemicals, such as nucleotides, which do not form under the conditions proposed by the Miller–Urey experiment.

=== Fluctuating salinity: dilute and dry-down ===
Theories of abiogenesis seldom address the caveat raised by Harold Blum:<ref>Blum, H.F. (1957). On the origin of self-replicating systems. In Rhythmic and Synthetic Processes in Growth, ed. Rudnick, D., pp. 155–170. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.</ref> if the key informational elements of life – proto-nucleic acid chains – spontaneously form duplex structures, then there is no way to dissociate them. <blockquote>Somewhere in this cycle work must be done, which means that free energy must be expended. If the parts assemble themselves on a template spontaneously, work has to be done to take the replica off; or, if the replica comes off the template of its own accord, work must be done to put the parts on in the first place.</blockquote>

The Oparin–Haldane conjecture addresses the formation, but not the dissociation, of nucleic acid polymers and duplexes. However, nucleic acids are unusual because, in the absence of counterions (low salt) to neutralize the high charges on opposing phosphate groups, the nucleic acid duplex dissociates into single chains.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018|title = Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life|year = 2004|last1 = Lathe|first1 = Richard|journal = Icarus|volume = 168|issue = 1|pages = 18–22|bibcode = 2004Icar..168...18L}}</ref> Early tides, driven by a close moon, could have generated rapid cycles of dilution (high tide, low salt) and concentration (dry-down at low tide, high salt) that exclusively promoted the replication of nucleic acids<ref name="ReferenceB"/> through a process dubbed tidal chain reaction (TCR).<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1017/S1473550405002314|title = Tidal chain reaction and the origin of replicating biopolymers|year = 2005|last1 = Lathe|first1 = Richard|journal = International Journal of Astrobiology|volume = 4|issue = 1|pages = 19–31|bibcode = 2005IJAsB...4...19L}}</ref> This theory has been criticized on the grounds that early tides may not have been so rapid,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.04.022|title = Comment on the paper "Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life" by Richard Lathe|year = 2006|last1 = Varga|first1 = P.|last2 = Rybicki|first2 = K.|last3 = Denis|first3 = C.|journal = Icarus|volume = 180|issue = 1|pages = 274–276|bibcode = 2006Icar..180..274V}}</ref> although regression from current values requires an Earth–Moon juxtaposition at around two Ga, for which there is no evidence, and early tides may have been approximately every seven hours.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.08.019|title = Early tides: Response to Varga et al|year = 2006|last1 = Lathe|first1 = R.|journal = Icarus|volume = 180|issue = 1|pages = 277–280|bibcode = 2006Icar..180..277L}}</ref> Another critique is that only 2–3% of the Earth's crust may have been exposed above the sea until late in terrestrial evolution.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.08.029| title=A case for late-Archaean continental emergence from thermal evolution models and hypsometry| year=2008| last1=Flament| first1=Nicolas| last2=Coltice| first2=Nicolas| last3=Rey| first3=Patrice F.| journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume=275| issue=3–4| pages=326–336| bibcode=2008E&PSL.275..326F}}</ref>

The TCR (tidal chain reaction) theory has mechanistic advantages over thermal association/dissociation at deep-sea vents because TCR requires that chain assembly (template-driven polymerization) takes place during the dry-down phase, when precursors are most concentrated, whereas thermal cycling needs polymerization to take place during the cold phase, when the rate of chain assembly is lowest and precursors are likely to be more dilute.

===A first protein that condenses substrates during thermal cycling: thermosynthesis===
[[File:ConvectionCells.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Convection cells in fluid placed in a gravity field are selforganizing and enable thermal cycling of the suspended contents in the fluid such as protocells containing protoenzymes that work on thermal cycling.]]
'''Emergence of chemiosmotic machinery''' Today's bioenergetic process of [[fermentation]] is carried out by either the aforementioned citric acid cycle or the Acetyl-CoA pathway, both of which have been connected to the primordial Iron–sulfur world.

In a different approach, the thermosynthesis hypothesis considers the bioenergetic process of [[chemiosmosis]], which plays an essential role in [[cellular respiration]] and photosynthesis, more basal than fermentation: the [[ATP synthase]] enzyme, which sustains chemiosmosis, is proposed as the currently extant enzyme most closely related to the first metabolic process.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W. J. |date=7 August 1985 |pages=429–453 |title=Thermosynthesis by biomembranes: Energy gain from cyclic temperature changes |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=115 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(85)80202-2 |pmid=3162066}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=Anthonie W.

First life needed an energy source to bring about the condensation reaction that yielded the peptide bonds of proteins and the [[phosphodiester bond]]s of RNA. In a generalization and thermal variation of the [[ATP synthase#Binding model|binding change mechanism]] of today's ATP synthase, the "first protein" would have bound substrates (peptides, phosphate, nucleosides, RNA 'monomers') and condensed them to a reaction product that remained bound until it was released after a temperature change by a thermal unfolding. The primordial '''first protein''' would therefore have strongly resembled the beta subunits of the [[ATP synthase alpha/beta subunits]] of today's F<sub>1</sub> moiety in the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> [[ATP synthase]]. Note however that today's enzymes function during isothermal conditions, whereas the hypothetical first protein worked on and during thermal cycling.

The energy source under the thermosynthesis hypothesis was thermal cycling, the result of suspension of protocells in a [[convection]] current, as is plausible in a volcanic hot spring; the convection accounts for the self-organization and [[Dissipative system|dissipative structure]] required in any origin of life model. The still ubiquitous role of thermal cycling in germination and cell division is considered a relic of primordial thermosynthesis.

By [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylating]] cell membrane lipids, this '''first protein''' gave a selective advantage to the lipid protocell that contained the protein. This protein also synthesized a library of many proteins, of which only a minute fraction had thermosynthesis capabilities. As proposed by Dyson,<ref name="Dyson 1999" /> it propagated functionally: it made daughters with similar capabilities, but it did not copy itself. Functioning daughters consisted of different amino acid sequences.

Whereas the iron–sulfur world identifies a circular pathway as the most simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis does not even invoke a pathway: [[ATP synthase#Binding model|ATP synthase's binding change mechanism]] resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Anthonie W.

The described first protein may be simple in the sense that is requires only a short sequence of conserved amino acid residues,  a sequent sufficient for the appropriate catalytic cleft. In contrast, it has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts such as required by fermentation is implausible because of the length of many required sequences.<ref>{{harvnb|Orgel|1987|pp=9–16}}</ref>

Pyrimidine ribonucleosides and their respective nucleotides have been prebiotically synthesized by a sequence of reactions which by-pass the free sugars, and are assembled in a stepwise fashion by using nitrogenous or oxygenous chemistries. Sutherland has demonstrated high yielding routes to cytidine and uridine ribonucleotides built from small 2 and 3 carbon fragments such as [[glycolaldehyde]], [[glyceraldehyde]] or [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]], [[cyanamide]] and [[cyanoacetylene]].

These are seen to form micro-spheres which are observed to behave similarly to membrane-enclosed compartments. Other possible means of producing more complicated organic molecules include chemical reactions that take place on [[clay]] substrates or on the surface of the mineral [[pyrite]].

Factors supporting an important role for RNA in early life include its ability to act both to store information and to catalyze chemical reactions (as a ribozyme); its many important roles as an intermediate in the expression of and maintenance of the genetic information (in the form of DNA) in modern organisms; and the ease of chemical synthesis of at least the components of the RNA molecule under the conditions that approximated the early Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Camprubí |first1=E. |last2=de Leeuw|first2=J.W. |last3=House |first3=C.H. |last4=Raulin |first4=F. |last5=Russell |first5=M.J. |last6=Spang|first6=A. | last7=Tirumalai|first7=M.R. |last8=Westall|first8=F. |date=12 December 2019|title=Emergence of Life |journal=Space Sci.

Depending on the definition, life started when RNA chains began to self-replicate, initiating the three mechanisms of Darwinian selection: [[heritability]], variation of type, and differential reproductive output. The fitness of an RNA replicator (its per capita rate of increase) would likely be a function of its intrinsic adaptive capacities, determined by its nucleotide sequence, and the availability of resources.<ref name="Bernstein">{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Byerly |first2=Henry C. |last3=Hopf |first3=Frederick A. |last4=Michod |first4=Richard A. |last5=Vemulapalli |first5=G.

Spiegelman took advantage of natural selection to synthesize the [[Spiegelman Monster]], which had a genome with just 218 [[nucleotide]] bases, having deconstructively evolved from a 4500-base bacterial RNA.
