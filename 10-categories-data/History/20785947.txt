{{short description|Central philosophical concept, related to reality and truth}}

In [[philosophy]], '''objectivity''' is the concept of [[truth]] independent from individual [[subjectivity]] ([[bias]] caused by one's [[perception]], [[emotion]]s, or [[imagination]]). A proposition is considered to have '''objective truth''' when its [[truth condition]]s are met without bias caused by a [[sentience|sentient]] subject. [[Objectivity (science)|Scientific objectivity]] refers to the ability to judge without [[Impartiality|partiality]] or external influence. Objectivity in the moral framework calls for moral codes to be assessed based on the well-being of the people in the society that follow it.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Rescher|first=Nicholas|date=January 2008|title=MORAL OBJECTIVITY|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0265052508080151/type/journal_article|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=393–409|doi=10.1017/S0265052508080151|issn=0265-0525}}</ref> Moral objectivity also calls for moral codes to be compared to one another through a set of universal facts and not through [[Subjectivity]].<ref name=":0"/>

==Objectivity of knowledge==
<!-- 'Rhetorical situation' points here -->
[[Plato]] considered [[geometry]] a condition of [[Platonic idealism|idealism]] concerned with [[universal (metaphysics)|universal]] truth.{{clarify|date=July 2020}} His contrasting between objectivity and [[doxa|opinion]] became the basis for philosophies intent on resolving the questions of [[reality]], [[truth]], and [[existence]]. He saw opinions as belonging to the shifting sphere of [[sensibility|sensibilities]], as opposed to a fixed, eternal and knowable [[incorporeality]]. Where Plato distinguished between [[epistemology|how we know things]] and their [[ontology|ontological]] status, [[subjectivism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s depends on [[perception]].<ref name=ejournals>{{cite journal|author=E. Douka Kabîtoglou|url=https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/sygkrisi/article/viewFile/2803/2561.pdf|title=Shelley and Berkeley: The Platonic Connection|year=1991|pages=20–35}}</ref> In [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms, a criticism of subjectivism is that it is difficult to distinguish between knowledge, opinions, and [[Subjectivity|subjective]] knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/11/2/88.full.pdf|author=Mary Margaret Mackenzie|title=Plato's moral theory|journal=[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]|year=1985|volume=11|issue=2|pages=88–91|doi=10.1136/jme.11.2.88|pmid=4009640|pmc=1375153}}</ref>

Platonic idealism is a form of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] objectivism, holding that the [[idealism|ideas exist independently]] from the individual. Berkeley's [[empiricism|empirical]] idealism, on the other hand, holds that [[subjectivism|things only exist as they are perceived]]. Both approaches boast an attempt at objectivity. Plato's definition of objectivity can be found in [[Platonic epistemology|his epistemology]], which is based on [[mathematics]], and [[Universal (metaphysics)#Platonic realism|his metaphysics]], where knowledge of the ontological status of objects and ideas is resistant to change.<ref name=ejournals/>

In opposition to philosopher [[René Descartes]]' method of [[Cogito, ergo sum|personal deduction]], natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] applied the relatively objective [[scientific method]] to look for [[scientific evidence|evidence]] before forming a hypothesis.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147573560.pdf|author=Suzuki, Fumitaka|title=The Cogito Proposition of Descartes and Characteristics of His Ego Theory|journal=Bulletin of Aichi University of Education|date=March 2012|volume=61|pages=73–80}}</ref> Partially in response to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[rationalism]], logician [[Gottlob Frege]] applied objectivity to his epistemological and metaphysical philosophies. If reality exists independently of [[consciousness]], then it would logically include a plurality of [[intension|indescribable]] forms. Objectivity requires a definition of [[truth]] formed by propositions with [[truth value]]. An attempt of forming an objective [[world view|construct]] incorporates [[ontological commitment]]s to the reality of objects.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/ctolley/publications/tolley-KGL-ms-2010.pdf|author=Clinton Tolley|title=Kant on the Generality of Logic|publisher=University of California, San Diego}}</ref>

The importance of perception in evaluating and understanding objective reality is debated in the [[Observer effect (physics)#Quantum mechanics|observer effect]] of quantum mechanics. [[Direct and indirect realism|Direct]] or [[Naïve realism|naïve realist]]s rely on perception as key in observing objective reality, while [[instrumentalism|instrumentalists]] hold that observations are useful in predicting objective reality. The concepts that encompass these ideas are important in the [[philosophy of science]]. [[philosophy of mind|Philosophies of mind]] explore whether objectivity relies on [[Consensus reality|perceptual constancy]].<ref>[[Tyler Burge]], ''Origins of Objectivity'', Oxford University Press, 2010.</ref>

==Objectivity in ethics==

===Ethical subjectivism===
{{See also|David Hume|Non-cognitivism|Subjectivism}}
The term "ethical subjectivism" covers two distinct theories in ethics. According to cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, the truth of moral statements depends upon people's values, attitudes, feelings, or beliefs. Some forms of cognitivist ethical subjectivism can be counted as forms of realism, others are forms of anti-realism.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thomas Pölzler|title=How to Measure Moral Realism|journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=647–670|year=2018|doi=10.1007/s13164-018-0401-8|pmid=30220945|pmc=6132410}}</ref> [[David Hume]] is a foundational figure for cognitive ethical subjectivism. On a standard interpretation of his theory, a trait of character counts as a moral virtue when it evokes a sentiment of approbation in a sympathetic, informed, and rational human observer.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rayner, Sam|year=2005|journal=Macalester Journal of Philosophy|url=https://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=philo|title=Hume's Moral Philosophy|volume=14|issue=1|pages=6–21}}</ref> Similarly, [[Roderick Firth]]'s [[ideal observer theory]] held that right acts are those that an impartial, rational observer would approve of.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Substantive Revision to Firth's Ideal Observer Theory|url=https://lib.bsu.edu/beneficencepress/stance/2010_spring/idealobservertheory.pdf|journal=Stance|publisher=[[Ball State University]]|volume=3|pages=55–61|date=April 2010}}</ref> [[William James]], another ethical subjectivist, held that an end is good (to or for a person) just in the case it is desired by that person (see also [[ethical egoism]]). According to non-cognitive versions of ethical subjectivism, such as emotivism, prescriptivism, and expressivism, ethical statements cannot be true or false, at all: rather, they are expressions of personal feelings or commands.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sarin Marchetti|title=William James on Truth and Invention in Morality|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|issue=2|year=2010|doi=10.4000/ejpap.910|issn=2036-4091|oclc=664682806|doi-access=free}}</ref> For example, on [[A. J. Ayer]]'s emotivism, the statement, "Murder is wrong" is equivalent in meaning to the emotive, "Murder, Boo!"<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/linguistics-and-philosophy/24-231-ethics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT24_231F09_lec04.pdf|title=24.231 Ethics – Handout 3 Ayer's Emotivism|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}</ref>

===Ethical objectivism===
{{Main|Moral realism}}
According to the ethical objectivist, the [[truth]] or falsehood of typical moral judgments does not depend upon the beliefs or feelings of any person or group of persons. This view holds that moral propositions are analogous to propositions about [[chemistry]], [[biology]], or [[history]], in so much as they are true despite what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels. When they fail to describe this mind-independent moral reality, they are false—no matter what anyone believes, hopes, wishes, or feels.

There are many versions of ethical objectivism, including various religious views of morality, Platonistic intuitionism, [[Kantianism]], [[utilitarianism]], and certain forms of [[ethical egoism]] and [[contractualism]]. Note that Platonists define ethical objectivism in an even more narrow way, so that it requires the existence of intrinsic value. Consequently, they reject the idea that contractualists or egoists could be ethical objectivists. Objectivism, in turn, places primacy on the origin of the frame of reference—and, as such, considers any arbitrary frame of reference ultimately a form of ethical subjectivism by a transitive property, even when the frame incidentally coincides with reality and can be used for measurements.

==Moral objectivism and relativism==
Moral objectivism is the view that what is right or wrong doesn't depend on what anyone thinks is right or wrong.<ref name=":0"/> Moral objectivism depends on how the moral code affects the well-being of the people of the society. Moral objectivism allows for moral codes to be compared to each other through a set of universal facts than ''mores'' of a society. Nicholas Reschar defines ''mores'' as customs within every society (i.e. what women can wear) and states that moral codes cannot be compared to one's personal moral compass.<ref name=":0" /> An example is the [[categorical imperative]] of  [[Immanuel Kant]] which says: "Act only according to that maxim [i.e., rule] whereby you can at the same time will that it become a universal law." [[John Stuart Mill]] was a consequential thinker and therefore proposed [[utilitarianism]] which asserts that in any situation, the right thing to do is whatever is likely to produce the most happiness overall. Moral relativism is the view where a moral code is relative to an agent in their specific moral context.<ref name=":2">Wreen, Michael. “What Is Moral Relativism?” ''Philosophy: The Journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy'', vol. 93, no. 365, July 2018, pp. 337–354. ''EBSCOhost'', search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=pif&AN=PHL2371955&site=ehost-live</ref> The rules within moral codes are equal to each other and are only deemed "right" or "wrong" within their specific moral codes.<ref name=":2" /> Relativism is opposite to [[Universalism]] because there is not a single moral code for every agent to follow.<ref name=":2" /> Relativism differs from [[Nihilism]] because it validates every moral code that exists whereas nihilism does not.<ref name=":2" /> When it comes to relativism, Russian philosopher and writer, [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], coined the phrase "If God doesn't exist, everything is permissible". That phrase was his view of the consequences for rejecting theism as a basis of ethics. American anthropologist [[Ruth Benedict]] argued that there is no single objective morality and that morality varies with culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~alatus/phil1200/RelativismObjectivism.html|title=Moral Relativism and Objectivism|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>

== Critique of Moral Objectivity ==
Morals are created when the social norms in a society will influence an agent to perform an action.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=David B.|date=January 2008|title=CONSTRUCTING NORMATIVE OBJECTIVITY IN ETHICS|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0265052508080096/type/journal_article|journal=Social Philosophy and Policy|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=237–266|doi=10.1017/S0265052508080096|issn=0265-0525}}</ref> Over time, agents will become attached to the approved behavior and will be rewarded in society for upholding the desired actions.<ref name=":3" /> These norms force agents to think about what it takes to satisfy these norms.<ref name=":3" /> From the reinforcement of the social norms, an agent can have the reasons for the norms ingrained in their decision-making process.<ref name=":3" /> All of this can mean nothing to an agent if they do not consider what their future version of themselves will become.<ref name=":3" />  Once that inconsideration of the future takes place, an agent might only care about the present and make decisions based on the advancement of themselves rather than being considerate of social norms.
