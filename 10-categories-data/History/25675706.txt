'''Joseph Friedrich Abert''' (11 June 1879 – 25 October 1959, [[Würzburg]]) was a [[Germany|German]] historian and archivist.

==Life==
Abert was born in 1879 in Würzburg. His uncle was the [[Roman Catholic]] Archbishop of [[Bamberg]], [[Friedrich Philipp von Abert]]. In 1898 he passed his final exams, and studied history in Würzburg and [[Munich]]. In 1904 he received a Ph.D. in history. His thesis was published in 1905 as ''Die Wahlkapitulationen der Würzburger Bischöfe bis zum Ende des XVII. Jahrhunderts, 1225-1698''.<ref>Open Library: [https://openlibrary.org/b/OL21851863M/Wahlkapitulationen_der_Wu%CC%88rzburger_Bischo%CC%88fe_bis_zum_Ende_des_XVII._Jahrhunderts_1225-1698 ''Die Wahlkapitulationen...'' (Würzburg University Press, 1905)]</ref> His career as an archivist began as an intern at the General State Archives in Munich in 1904. From 1908 to 1910 he was employed by the Archive of the noble family of Schönborn.

Abert served as a lieutenant in [[World War I]]. As a member of the [[Freikorps]] "[[Franz Xaver Ritter von Epp]]" he was involved in the suppression of the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. From 1919 to 1926 he was head of the archives of the city of Würzburg and appointed afterwards Head of the State Archives in Würzburg. In 1928 he became an honorary professor.

Joseph Friedrich Abert lived together with [[Albrecht Becker]] (1906-2002) a production designer, photographer, and actor.

During the Nazi era, they were arrested for violating [[Paragraph 175|Section 175]], the legal ban on [[homosexuality]] and imprisoned. Abert lost his membership in the SA and Nazi Party and the privileges as a public servant. Later, he lived for a while in [[Rome]], where he worked at the [[German Historical Institute]] of the [[Repertorium Germanicum]]. In 1945 he returned to Würzburg, where he died on 25 October 1959.

In the exhibition of the [[Imperial War Museum]] in [[London]] on the [[Holocaust]] the fate of Joseph Friedrich Abert and his friend Albrecht Becker is shown as an example of Nazi-persecution of homosexuals.
