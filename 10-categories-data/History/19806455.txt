Founded in 1981, the '''American Journalism Historians Association''' ('''AJHA''') seeks to advance education and research in [[mass communication]] history. Through its annual meeting, regional conferences, committees, awards, speakers and publications, members work to raise historical standards and ensure that all scholars and students recognize the vast importance of [[media history]] and apply this knowledge to the advancement of society.

==Meetings and conferences==

===AJHA Annual Meeting===

The organization sponsors an annual fall meeting. Approximately 120 [[historian]]s attend and participate in discussions surrounding teaching and research in media history. Throughout the meeting, scholars present [[peer-review]]ed research, participate in topical panel discussions and generate ideas for articles and books. At the annual meeting, scholars also participate vigorously in a [[silent auction]] that generates thousands of dollars for [[graduate student]] aid.

===AJHA Southeast Symposium===

Media history scholars from across the Southeast gather each February for the annual AJHA Southeast Symposium. The conference is designed to promote graduate and undergraduate research and provides a scholarly forum for student research presentations and discussions.

===AJHA-AEJMC Joint Conference===

The AJHA partners with the History Division of [[AEJMC]] to sponsor a spring conference in New York City. This [[interdisciplinary]] gathering accepts submissions in all areas of journalism and communication history from all time periods and welcomes scholars from all academic disciplines and stages of their academic careers.

==Task Force on History in the Curriculum==

This AJHA committee works to encourage the study of history in graduate and undergraduate mass communication programs. Some of its actions include:
*Encouraging all schools to offer an [[undergraduate]] history course and require it of their majors
*Encouraging graduate schools to recognize that history is as important as theory, [[social science]] research or any other area of graduate study
*Evaluating the history curricula in [[doctorate|doctoral programs]].

==Speakers Bureau==

The AJHA Speakers Bureau features members who share their expertise and knowledge with the media and local and national organizations. The diversity of the organization's membership enables its bureau to provide a wealth of educational resources on a wide variety of topics related to mass communication history.

==Publications==

''American Journalism'' ({{ISSN|0882-1127}}), the AJHA's [[quarterly]] peer-reviewed journal, publishes articles, research notes, book reviews, and correspondence dealing with media history. Recent editions of ''American Journalism'' are available via the EBSCO database. Contributions may focus on social, economic, intellectual, political or legal issues. ''American Journalism'' also welcomes articles that treat the history of communication in general; the history of broadcasting, advertising, and public relations; the history of media outside the United States; and theoretical issues in the literature or methods of media history.

''The Intelligencer'' is the quarterly newsletter of the AJHA. It includes news about the organization and its members as well as research and conference updates.
