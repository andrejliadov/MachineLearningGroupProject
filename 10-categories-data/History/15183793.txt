==Legacy plans==

Since the [[London 2012]] Paralympic Games finished on 9 September 2012 the UK Government has unveiled an updated Legacy Plan.<ref>{{cite news

| title = London 2012 legacy plan published
|  accessdate =26 December 2012

}}</ref> Its main points include:
* funding for elite sport until [[Rio 2016]]
* investment to turn the Olympic site into the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]]
* 20 major sporting events to UK by 2019, with more bids in progress
* £1bn investment over the next five years in the Youth Sport Strategy, linking schools with sports clubs and encouraging sporting habits for life
* introduction of the School Games programme to boost schools sport and county sport festivals
* continued funding for International Inspiration, the UK's international sports development programme, to 2014.

There have been several previous legacy plans. These include:

===Legacy Plan 2010===
In December 2010, the Government published a new Legacy plan, which set out the legacy vision for the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, and the detailed plans underpinning it. It identified four areas to focus on:
harnessing the UK's passion for sport to increase grassroots participation, particularly by young people, and to encourage the whole population to be more physically active;
exploiting to the full the opportunities for economic growth offered by hosting the Games;
promoting community engagement and achieving participation across all groups in society through the Games; and
ensuring that the Olympic Park can be developed after the Games as one of the principal drivers of regeneration in East London.<ref>{{cite news

===Six borough plans 2009===
The six London boroughs hosting the Games – [[London Borough of Barking and Dagenham|Barking and Dagenham]], [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] and [[London Borough of Waltham Forest|Waltham Forest]] – published plans for legacy in 2009.  This was outlined in the Strategic Regeneration Framework which included the objective that by 2030, the communities hosting the Games would have the same social and economic life chances as at least the London average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/srf.htm|title=Hackney Council&nbsp;&ndash; 2012 Games&nbsp;&ndash; The Host Boroughs and the Strategic Regeneration Framework|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163036/http://www.hackney.gov.uk/srf.htm|archivedate=6 October 2011}}</ref> This is the principle of Convergence and guides its joint working on legacy.

===Legacy Action Plan 2008===
A Legacy Action Plan to implement legacy promises was published on 6 June 2008.<ref>{{cite web

===Legacy Plan 2007===
The government published its legacy plans via the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]'s Legacy Promises document, published in 2007.  The five promises were:<ref>{{cite web

* Inspire a generation of young people to take part in local volunteering, cultural, and physical activity
* Make the Olympic Park a blueprint for sustainable living
* Demonstrate the UK is a creative, inclusive, and welcoming place to live in, visit, and for business

===Strategic Regeneration Framework===

The Strategic Regeneration Framework and Convergence make real the promise in the original bid document that "By staging the Games in this part of the city, the most enduring legacy of the Olympics will be the regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/candidate-files/theme-1-olympic-games-concept-and-legacy.pdf|title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications - Downloads - International Olympic Committee|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227113307/https://www.london2012.com/documents/candidate-files/theme-1-olympic-games-concept-and-legacy.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2012}}</ref> The principle of Convergence is included in the Mayor of London's spatial development strategy, known as The London Plan 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/The%20London%20Plan%202011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030131849/http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/The%20London%20Plan%202011.pdf |archive-date=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
