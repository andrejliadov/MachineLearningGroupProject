He has given talks in recent years in the U.S., Britain, France, Nicaragua, and China on coffee and consumption patterns.  He has been interviewed regularly on coffee, for example for BBC 4, the Food Network, and Dr. Oz ''The Good Life''.  His trips to coffee "origin," the industry term for coffee farms, have taken him to ten countries.  He has been interviewed several times on WVXU, Cincinnati's NPR station, on several topics ranging from populism to coffee to the history of land preservation in the U.S. Podcasts with him are discussions of lynching and the witch hunts and film.

He has written occasionally on current issues in Ukraine and on how people get their history from romance novels.

His current writing project is The Body in the Anglo-Saxon World, 1885-1920:  Reshaping Race, Sexuality, and Civilization, book.  This study examines presentations of the body in the circus, photography, ads, sports, and the new field of anthropology, and how treatment of images of the body affected discussion of what human beings were and how they behaved.
