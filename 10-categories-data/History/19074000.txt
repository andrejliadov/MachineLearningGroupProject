{{short description|Materials with high condensation temperatures, contrasted with volatiles}}
In [[planetary science]], any material that has a relatively high [[equilibrium (thermodynamics)|equilibrium]] condensation temperature is called '''refractory'''.<ref name=Ross>{{cite book

The refractory group includes elements and compounds like metals and [[silicates]] (commonly termed rocks) which make up the bulk of the mass of the [[terrestrial planet]]s and asteroids in the inner belt. A fraction of the mass of other [[asteroids]], giant planets, their moons and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s is also made of refractory materials.<ref name=Beatty>{{cite book

The condensation temperatures are the temperatures at which 50% of the element will be in the form of a solid (rock) under a pressure of 10<sup>−4</sup> [[bar (unit)|bar]]. However, slightly different groups and temperature ranges are used sometimes. Refractory material are also often divided into refractory [[Goldschmidt classification#Lithophile elements|lithophile elements]] and refractory [[Goldschmidt classification#Siderophile elements|siderophile elements]].<ref name=Davis>{{cite book
