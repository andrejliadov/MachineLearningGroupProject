The '''''Affiche Rouge''''' (Red Poster) is a famous [[propaganda]] poster, distributed by [[Vichy France]] and German authorities in the spring of 1944 in [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied Paris]], to discredit 23 immigrant [[French Resistance]] fighters, members of the '''[[FTP-MOI#Structure of the FTP-MOI|Manouchian Group]]'''. The term '''Affiche Rouge''' also refers more broadly to the circumstances surrounding the poster's creation and distribution, the capture, trial and execution of these members of the Manouchian Group.

== Background ==
In mid-November 1943, the French police arrested 23 members of the [[Communist]] [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans de la Main d'Oeuvre Immigrée]] (FTP-MOI), who were part of the [[French Resistance]].<ref>[[Stéphane Courtois]], Denis Peschanski and Adam Rayski: ''Le Sang de l'étranger. Les Immigrés de la MOI dans la Résistance'', Fayard, Paris 1989</ref> They were called the "Manouchian Group" after the commander, [[Missak Manouchian]]. The group was part of a network of about 100 fighters, who committed nearly all acts of armed resistance in the Paris metropolitan region between March and November 1943.<ref>[[Arsène Tchakarian]]: ''Les franc-tireurs de l'affiche rouge'', Messidor/[[Éditions sociales]], 1986</ref>

Its membership included men of different  backgrounds. 22 of them were  [[Poles]], five [[Italians]], three [[Hungarians]], two [[Armenians]], three [[Spaniard|Spaniards]], 1 [[French people|French]] man and a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman; eleven members were [[Jews|Jewish]].<ref>[http://lmsi.net/spip.php?article502 Laurent Lévy, "Mémoire du groupe des étrangers: À propos d’une chanson célèbre"], ''Les mots sont important'', Septembre 2009, accessed 3 Sep 2010</ref>

After having been tortured and interrogated for three months, the 23 were tried by a German military court. To discredit the Resistance, the authorities invited French celebrities (from the world of the cinema and other arts) to attend the trial and encourage the media to give it the widest coverage  possible. All but one of the Manouchian Group's members were executed before a firing squad in [[Mont-Valérien|Fort Mont-Valérien]] on 21 February 1944. [[Olga Bancic]], who had served the group as a messenger, was taken to [[Stuttgart]], where she was beheaded with an axe on 10 May 1944.

In the spring of 1944, the Vichy authorities launched a propaganda campaign, designed to discredit the Manouchian Group and defuse public anger over their execution. They created a poster, which became known as {{lang|fr|Affiche Rouge}}, due to its red background. It featured ten men of the group, with nationality, surnames, photos and descriptions of their crimes; the Germans distributed an estimated 15,000 copies of the poster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/des-dossiers-thematiques-sur-l-histoire-de-l-immigration/l-affiche-rouge |title=L'affiche rouge |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Musee de L'histoire de L'immigration |publisher= |access-date=6 February 2016 |quote=}}</ref> Along with these posters, the Germans handed out flyers that claimed the Resistance was headed by foreigners, Jews, unemployed people, and criminals; the campaign characterized the Resistance as a "foreigners' conspiracy against French life and the sovereignty of France":

<blockquote>"''Si des Français pillent, volent, sabotent et tuent...
Ce sont toujours des étrangers qui les commandent.

Ce sont toujours des chômeurs et des criminels professionnels qui exécutent.

Ce sont toujours des juifs qui les inspirent.

C’est l’armée du crime contre la France.

Le banditisme n’est pas l’expression du Patriotisme blessé, c’est le complot étranger contre la vie des Français et contre la souveraineté de la France."''<ref name=Cite/></blockquote>

Although the poster attempted to depict the group as "terrorists", the campaign seems to have had the effect of highlighting the feats of people whom the general public considered to be  [[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]].<ref name=Cite>[http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&nav=20&flash=0 Film documentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128001311/http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&nav=20&flash=0 |date=2016-01-28 }} on the website of the ''[[Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]]'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Legend has it that supporters scribbled the words ''MORTS POUR LA FRANCE'' across the posters ("They died for France" - the phrase used on official monuments to soldiers of France who died in combat) and put flowers beneath some of the posters. In 1975, historian Philippe Ganier Raymond claimed that there was no historical record of such activity.<ref>Philippe Ganier Raymond, ''L'Affiche rouge: La vérité sur les partisans sacrifiés'', Fayard, 1975</ref> But more recent research has in fact confirmed that such additions by residents took place.<ref name=Cite/>

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Mémorial de l'affiche rouge.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to the Manouchian Group]]In 1955, [[Louis Aragon]] wrote a poem memorializing the Manouchian Group, "[[L'affiche rouge (Poem)|Strophes pour se souvenir]]". The poem was published in 1956 in ''[[Le roman inachevé]]''. In 1959 [[Léo Ferré]] set it to music and recorded it as {{lang|fr|"L'Affiche rouge"}}. [[Rouben Melik]] and [[Paul Éluard]] also wrote poems in honour of the Manouchian Group.<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-21_Politique_Resistance-l-Affiche-rouge-Fusilles Résistance. Rouben Melik, "l’Affiche rouge Fusillés"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122017/http://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-21_Politique_Resistance-l-Affiche-rouge-Fusilles |date=September 29, 2007 }}, reprinted, ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 21 February 2004 {{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref>[[Paul Éluard]], [https://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-21_Politique_Resistance-l-Affiche-rouge-Legion "Légion" (poem)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133528/http://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-21_Politique_Resistance-l-Affiche-rouge-Legion |date=September 29, 2007 }}, in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 21 February 2004 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

In 1997, at the prompting of [[Robert Badinter]], a French senator and former Minister of Justice, the French Parliament authorized a monument to commemorate the execution at Mont-Valérien of 1,006 citizens and members of the French Resistance, including the Manouchian Group, between 1940 and 1944. The sculptor [[Pascal Convert]] was commissioned to create the monument and Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] dedicated it on 20 September 2003.

== Controversy ==
In the 1980s, some French political factions suggested that, because of political infighting, some members of the Resistance had been complicit in the capture of many of the members of the Manouchian Group. A film documentary by [[Stéphane Courtois]] and Mosco Boucault, ''Des terroristes à la retraite'', broadcast by [[Antenne 2]] in 1983, included interviews of surviving FTP-MOI members and families of the victims. Bouscault accused the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) of having deliberately sacrificed the fighters in the power struggle with the [[Gaullists]] for control over the [[National Council of Resistance]] (CNR). He suggested this was done because the fighters' foreign origins undermined French depictions of the Resistance as a native [[patriotism|patriotic]] movement. The film was rebroadcast in 2001, minus 12 minutes deleted to reflect more recent historical research.<ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-18_Medias_-Avec-ou-sans-guillemets "Avec ou sans guillemets"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124252/http://www.humanite.fr/2004-02-18_Medias_-Avec-ou-sans-guillemets |date=September 29, 2007 }}, ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 18 February 2004 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

''La traque de l'Affiche rouge'', a documentary produced by {{ill|Denis Peschanski|fr}} and {{ill|Jorge Amat|fr}}, broadcast by [[France 2]] on 15 March 2007, refuted Courtois and Boucault's allegations.<ref>{{ill|Denis Peschanski|fr}} – {{ill|Jorge Amat|fr}}, ''La traque de l’Affiche rouge'', 72 minutes, compagnie des Phares et Balises en collaboration avec la Fondation Gabriel Péri et ''[[L’Humanité]]'', 2006.

The French [[Milice]] arrested and dismantled the Manouchian Group after the attack, aided by information given by some members under [[torture]].

In September 2009, the dramatic film ''[[The Army of Crime|L'Armée du crime]]'' opened in France, featuring the story of the Manouchian Group. Directed by [[Robert Guédiguian]], a [[Marseille]]-based filmmaker of German and Armenian parentage, it was adapted from a story by Serge Le Péron. It reflects some of the divisions among the Résistance.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/movies/20army.html?pagewanted=2 STEPHEN HOLDEN, "'The Army of Crime': Outsiders in French Society, Battling Occupiers and Collaborators"], ''New York Times'', 19 Aug 2010, accessed 17 Nov 2010</ref> In association with the film's release, reporters interviewed the last surviving member of the FTP-MOI group, Arsène Tchakarian. He decisively refuted the allegation that the PCF had betrayed the Manouchian Group and said that 35 members of the 40 in the group were communists.<ref name="humanité">[http://www.humaniteinenglish.com/spip.php?article1332 " 'L’Armée du crime': An Interview with Arsène Tchakarian.
