This '''list of museums''' is defined for this context as institutions (including [[nonprofit organization]]s, government entities, and private [[business]]es) that collect and care for objects of cultural, artistic, scientific, or historical interest and make their collections or related exhibits available for public viewing. Museums that exist only in cyberspace (''i.e.'', [[virtual museum]]s) are not included.

For individual topics, see [[list of science museums]], [[list of natural history museums]], [[list of transport museums]], and articles on [[Art museum|art galleries]], [[print room]]s, [[national museum]]s and [[art museum]]s in general.

According to the ''Museums of the World'', there are about 55,000 museums in 202 countries.<ref name="Amazon">{{cite book |first1=Ruth |last1=Lochar |first2=Alexandra |last2=Meinhold |first3=Hildegard |last3=Toma |url=https://www.amazon.com/Museums-World-De-Gruyter-Saur/dp/3110234858#ps-content |title=Museums of the World |location=München |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter|De Gruyter Saur]] |isbn=9783110234855 |oclc=747007027 |edition=18th |date=May 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref>
