The '''Atomic Age''', also known as the '''Atomic Era''', is the period of history following the detonation of the first [[nuclear weapon]], [[The Gadget]] at the ''[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]'' test in New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, during [[World War II]]. Although [[nuclear chain reaction]]s had been hypothesized in 1933 and the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction ([[Chicago Pile-1]]) had taken place in December 1942,<ref name="Holl">{{cite book |last=Holl |first=Jack |year=1997 |title=Argonne National Laboratory, 1946–96 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=978-0-252-02341-5}}</ref> the Trinity test and the ensuing [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] that ended World War II represented the first large-scale use of [[nuclear technology]] and ushered in profound changes in [[sociopolitical]] thinking and the course of technology development.

While [[Nuclear power|atomic power]] was promoted for a time as the epitome of progress and modernity,<ref name=bks2011/> entering into the nuclear power era also entailed frightful implications of [[nuclear warfare]], the [[Cold War]], [[mutual assured destruction]], [[nuclear proliferation]], the risk of [[nuclear disaster]] (potentially as extreme as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] global [[nuclear winter]]), as well as beneficial civilian applications in [[nuclear medicine]]. It is no easy matter to fully segregate peaceful uses of nuclear technology from military or terrorist uses (such as the fabrication of [[dirty bomb]]s from [[radioactive waste]]), which complicated the development of a global nuclear-power export industry right from the outset.

In 1973, concerning a flourishing nuclear power industry, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century, one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the U.S. However, the "nuclear dream" fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology produced a range of social problems, from the [[nuclear arms race]] to [[nuclear meltdown]]s, and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning.<ref>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 99.</ref> Since 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose.

''[[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]'', Black Inc., p. 283.</ref>

By the late 1970s, nuclear power had suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread [[anti-nuclear movement|public opposition]], coming to a head with the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for many decades.<ref>"Nuclear Follies", February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes magazine]]''.</ref>

== Early years ==
In 1901, [[Frederick Soddy]] and [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that [[radioactivity]] was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another, involving the release of energy. Soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially "inexhaustible" source of energy, and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to "transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen poles, and make the whole earth one smiling [[Garden of Eden]]." The promise of an "atomic age," with nuclear energy as the global, utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs, has been a recurring theme ever since. But "Soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~aglaser/2006aglaser_nuclearcrowd.pdf |title=Life in a Nuclear Powered Crowd |author1=Zia Mian |author2=Alexander Glaser |name-list-style=amp|date=June 2006 |work=INESAP Information Bulletin No.26 }}</ref><ref>The two words atomic and nuclear are synonymous in the context of atomic power and weapons. The atom consists of a nucleus and one or more electrons. All atomic reactions involve changing one atom into another by changing the nucleus. Historically atomic power is an older term, and nuclear power is newer.[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Deterrence/Atomsforpeace.shtml President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" Speech]</ref>

The concept of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] was hypothesized in 1933, shortly after [[James Chadwick|Chadwick]]'s [[discovery of the neutron]]. Only a few years later, in December 1938 [[nuclear fission]] was [[Discovery of nuclear fission|discovered]] by [[Otto Hahn]] and his assistant [[Fritz Strassmann]], and explained, proved and explained by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]]. The first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction ([[Chicago Pile-1]], or CP-1) took place in December 1942 under the leadership of [[Enrico Fermi]].<ref name="Holl"/>

In 1945, the pocketbook ''The Atomic Age'' heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. One science writer, David Dietz, wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week, you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill. [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], who chaired the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], wrote "there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles, nuclear powered artificial hearts, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".<ref>Benjamin K. Sovacool, ''The National Politics of Nuclear Power'', Routledge, p. 68.</ref>

== World War II ==

The phrase "Atomic Age" was coined by [[William L. Laurence]], a [[journalist]] with ''[[The New York Times]]'', who became the official journalist for the [[Manhattan Project]] which developed the first nuclear weapons.<ref name="laurence19450926">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fpLSlthuEMC&pg=PA10 | title=Drama of the Atomic Bomb Found Climax in July 16 Test | work=The New York Times | date=1945-09-26 | author=Laurence, William L.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ATOMIC TRUTHS PLAGUE PRIZE COVERUP |last=Gonzalez |first=Juan |work=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2005/08/09/2005-08-09_atomic_truths_plague_prize_c.html |date=9 August 2005 |quote=Laurence, the only journalist the U.S. government permitted to witness the bombing of Nagasaki, is also the reporter who first coined the term "Atomic Age." ...

His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union.<ref>On this incident, see David Holloway, ''Stalin and the Bomb: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939–1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994): 59–60.</ref> The Soviet Union would go on to test [[RDS-1|its first nuclear weapon]] in 1949.

In 1949, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, [[David Lilienthal]] stated that "atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy, but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man's whole life".<ref>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 85.</ref>

The phrase gained popularity as a feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] would render all conventional explosives obsolete and [[nuclear power]] plants would do the same for power sources such as [[coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from [[Food irradiation|irradiating food]] to preserve it, to the development of [[nuclear medicine]]. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would "provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space".<ref name=bks2011>[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 259.</ref> This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in [[technological progress]] as the first smelting of [[Bronze Age|bronze]], of [[Iron Age|iron]], or the commencement of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

This included even [[car]]s, leading [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] to display the [[Ford Nucleon]] [[concept car]] to the public in 1958. There was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and [[nuclear-powered aircraft]], which the U.S. federal government even spent US$1.5 billion researching.<ref name=bks2011/> Nuclear policymaking became almost a collective technocratic fantasy, or at least was driven by fantasy:<ref name=sh96>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 50–51.</ref>
<blockquote>
The very idea of splitting the atom had an almost magical grip on the imaginations of inventors and policymakers. As soon as someone said—in an even mildly credible way—that these things ''could'' be done, then people quickly convinced themselves ... that they ''would'' be done.<ref name=sh96/>
</blockquote>

In the US, military planners "believed that demonstrating the civilian applications of the atom would also affirm the American system of private enterprise, showcase the expertise of scientists, increase personal living standards, and defend the democratic lifestyle against communism".<ref>[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 266.</ref>

Some media reports predicted that thanks to the giant nuclear power stations of the near future [[electricity]] would soon become much cheaper and that [[electricity meter]]s would be removed, because power would be "[[too cheap to meter]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html |title=Too Cheap to Meter? |access-date=2007-06-17 |date=2007-03-30 |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Society]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204122504/http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html |archive-date=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

When the [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station|Shippingport reactor]] went online in 1957 it produced electricity at a cost roughly ten times that of coal-fired generation. Scientists at the AEC's own Brookhaven Laboratory "wrote a 1958 report describing accident scenarios in which 3,000 people would die immediately, with another 40,000 injured".<ref>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 55.</ref>

However Shippingport was an experimental reactor using highly enriched uranium (unlike most power reactors) and originally intended for a (cancelled) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. [[Kenneth Nichols]] was a consultant for the [[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant|Connecticut Yankee]] and [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station|Yankee Rowe]] nuclear power stations wrote that while considered "experimental" and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, they "became competitive because of inflation... and the large increase in price of coal and oil." He wrote that for nuclear power stations the capital cost is the major cost factor over the life of the plant, hence "antinukes" try to increase costs and building time with changing regulations and lengthy hearings, so that "it takes almost twice as long to build a (U.S.-designed boiling-water or pressurised water) atomic power plant in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea." French pressurised-water nuclear plants produce 60% of their electric power, and have proven to be much cheaper than oil or coal.<ref>{{cite book |last= Nichols |first= Kenneth David |title= The Road to Trinity: A Personal Account of How America's Nuclear Policies Were Made |url= https://archive.org/details/roadtotrinity0000nich |url-access= registration |year=  1987|publisher= William Morrow and Company |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-688-06910-0 |oclc= 15223648 |page= [https://archive.org/details/roadtotrinity0000nich/page/344 344] }}</ref>

Fear of possible atomic attack from the Soviet Union caused U.S. school children to participate in "duck and cover" civil defense drills.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/remember-duck-and-cover-w_b_774134|title=Remember Duck and Cover?

=== Atomic City ===
During the 1950s, Las Vegas, Nevada, earned the nickname "Atomic City" for becoming a hotspot where tourists would gather to watch above-ground nuclear weapons tests taking place at [[Nevada Test Site]]. Following the detonation of Able, one of the first atomic bombs dropped at the Nevada Test Site, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce began advertising the tests as an entertainment spectacle to tourists.

The detonations proved popular and casinos throughout the city capitalised on the tests by advertising hotel rooms or rooftops which offered views of the testing site or by planning "Dawn Bomb Parties" where people would come together to celebrate the detonations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic Tourism in Nevada |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/atomic-tourism-nevada/ |website=pbs.org |access-date=23 July 2020}}</ref> Most parties started at midnight and musicians would perform at the venues until 4:00&nbsp;a.m. when the party would briefly stop so guests could silently watch the detonation. Some casinos capitalised on the tests further by creating so called "atomic cocktails", a mixture of vodka, cognac, sherry and champagne.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bosker |first1=Gideon |title=Atomic Cocktails |date=1998 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco |page=8}}</ref>

Meanwhile, groups of tourists would drive out into the desert with family or friends to watch the detonations.

Despite the health risks associated with nuclear fallout, tourists and viewers were told to simply "shower". Later on, however, anyone who had worked at the testing site or lived in areas exposed to nuclear fallout fell ill and had higher chances of developing cancer or suffering pre-mature deaths.<ref name="BI">{{cite news |last1=Loria |first1=Kevin |title=Nuclear explosions from the past are still causing cancer and health problems today |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-explosion-fallout-cancer-health-effects-2017-8 |access-date=24 October 2018 |publisher=Business Insider |date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>

== 1960s ==

By exploiting the peaceful uses of the "friendly atom" in medical applications, earth removal and, subsequently, in nuclear power plants, the nuclear industry and government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of [[nuclear weapon]]s. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the United States government initiated [[Operation Plowshare]], involving "peaceful nuclear explosions". The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman announced that the Plowshares project was intended to "highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/69/5/56.full |title=Nuclear denial: From Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=Charles Perrow |date=September–October 2013 |volume=69 |issue=5 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}</ref>

[[Project Plowshare]] "was named directly from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another".<ref name=bks171/> Proposed uses included widening the [[Panama Canal]], constructing a new sea-level waterway through [[Nicaragua]] nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to [[shale oil extraction|extract shale oil]] in eastern [[Utah]] and western [[Colorado]]. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground [[aquifer]]s in [[Arizona]]. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of [[California]]'s [[Sacramento Valley]] for a water transport project.<ref name=bks171/> However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare's 27 nuclear explosions.<ref name=bks171/> Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.<ref name=bks171>[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], pp. 171–172.</ref>

In the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' TV series, a set of vehicles was presented that were imagined to be completely nuclear, as shown in cutaways presented in their comic-books.

The term "atomic age" was initially used in a positive, futuristic sense, but by the 1960s the threats posed by [[nuclear weapon]]s had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom.

French advocates of nuclear power developed an aesthetic vision of nuclear technology as art to bolster support for the technology. Leclerq compares the nuclear cooling tower to some of the grandest architectural monuments of western culture:<ref name=jbsh/>
<blockquote>
The age in which we live has, for the public, been marked by the nuclear engineer and the gigantic edifices he has created. For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.<ref name=jbsh>John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 20–21.</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1973, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century, one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the USA. But after 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.<ref name="Mortal Hands p. 283"/>

Nuclear power has proved controversial since the 1970s. [[High-level radioactive waste management|Highly radioactive materials]] may overheat and escape from the reactor building. Nuclear waste ([[spent nuclear fuel]]) needs to be regularly removed from the reactors and disposed of safely for up to a million years, so that it does not pollute the environment. Recycling of [[nuclear waste]] has been discussed, but it creates [[plutonium]] which can be used in weapons, and in any case still leaves much unwanted waste to be stored and disposed of. Large, [[geologic repository|purpose-built facilities]] for long-term disposal of nuclear waste have been difficult to site, and have not yet reached fruition.<ref>Congressional Research report, [https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42853.pdf Nuclear Energy: Overview of Congressional Issues], CRS Report, 2015.</ref>

By the late 1970s, nuclear power suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread [[anti-nuclear movement|public opposition]], coming to a head with the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for decades thereafter. A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine commented on the overall management of the nuclear power program in the United States:
<blockquote>
The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale ... only the blind, or the biased, can now think that the money has been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.<ref>"Nuclear Follies", a February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine.</ref>
</blockquote>

So, in a period just over 30 years, the early dramatic rise of nuclear power went into equally meteoric reverse. With no other energy technology has there been a conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence, followed so quickly by equally transformative demise.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Transforming power |volume=1 |pages=83–95 |author=Andy Stirling |date=2014 |journal=Energy Research and Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001|author-link=Andy Stirling |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In the 21st century, the label of the "Atomic Age" connotes either a sense of [[nostalgia]] or [[naïve]]té, and is considered by many to have ended with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, though the term continues to be used by many historians to describe the era following the conclusion of the [[Second World War]]. Atomic energy and weapons continue to have a strong effect on world politics in the 21st century. The term is used by some [[science fiction fan]]s to describe not only the era following the conclusion of the Second World War but also [[contemporary history]] up to the present day.
