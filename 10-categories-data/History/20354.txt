{{short description|Unit of time}}
A '''month''' is a unit of [[time]], used with [[calendar]]s, which is approximately as long as a natural [[Orbital period|period]] related to the motion of the [[Moon]]; ''month'' and ''Moon'' are [[cognate]]s. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of [[Moon phase]]s; such months ([[lunation]]s) are [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic months]] and last approximately 29.53 [[day]]s. From excavated [[tally stick]]s, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's [[orbital period]] with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the [[year]]. 

== Types of months in astronomy==
{{main|Lunar month}}
The following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy, most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) first recognized in [[Lunar theory#Babylon|Babylonian lunar astronomy]].

# The '''sidereal month''' is defined as the Moon's [[orbital period]] in a non-rotating frame of reference (which on average is equal to its [[rotation period]] in the same frame). It is about 27.32166 days (27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds). It is closely equal to the time it takes the Moon to pass twice a "fixed" [[star]] (different stars give different results because all have a very small [[proper motion]] and are not really fixed in position).
# A '''synodic month''' is the most familiar lunar cycle, defined as the time interval between two consecutive occurrences of a particular phase (such as new moon or full moon) as seen by an observer on Earth. The mean length of the synodic month is 29.53059 days (29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 2.8 seconds). Due to the eccentricity of the lunar orbit around Earth (and to a lesser degree, the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun), the length of a synodic month can vary by up to seven hours.
# The '''tropical month''' is the average time for the Moon to pass twice through the same [[equinox]] point of the sky. It is '''27.32158''' days, very slightly shorter than the sidereal month (27.32166) days, because of [[precession of the equinoxes]].
# An '''anomalistic month''' is the average time the Moon takes to go from [[perigee]] to perigee—the point in the Moon's orbit when it is closest to Earth. An anomalistic month is about 27.55455 days on average.
# The '''draconic month''', draconitic month, or nodal month is the period in which the Moon returns to the same [[lunar node|node]] of its orbit; the nodes are the two points where the Moon's orbit crosses the plane of the Earth's orbit. Its duration is about 27.21222 days on average.

A synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth. The Sun moves eastward with respect to the stars (as does the Moon) and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun.

An anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.

A draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star.

== Calendrical consequences ==
{{Details|lunar calendar|lunisolar calendar}}

At the simplest level, most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day '''full month''' followed by a 29-day '''hollow month'''—but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of [[leap day]]s. Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the [[Metonic cycle]], which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 [[tropical year]]s (which add up to not quite 6,940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about one day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the [[Antikythera Mechanism]] about 2,000 years ago, and the [[Hebrew calendar]].

The complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why [[solar calendar]]s (which have months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, but are based only on the motion of the Sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices) have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies.

== Months in various calendars ==
{{split section|Calendar month|date=October 2019}}

=== Beginning of the lunar month ===
The [[Hellenic calendars]], the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew Lunisolar calendar]] and the [[Islamic calendar|Islamic Lunar calendar]] started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the [[new moon]].

However, the motion of the Moon in its [[orbit]] is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.

While some like the Jewish [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]] still rely on actual moon observations, most people use the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian solar calendar]].

[[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]], a language from [[Micronesia]], also uses a lunar calendar. There are 12 months associated with their calendar. The moon first appears in March, they name this month ''Kahlek''. This system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations. This calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the moon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pingelap Non-Sacred Knowledge|last=Solomon|first=Stenson|publisher=Historic Preservation Fund Grant Department of Land and Natural Resources|year=2009}}</ref>

=== Julian and Gregorian calendars ===
The [[Gregorian calendar]], like the [[Julian calendar]] before it, has twelve months:

[[File:Month - Knuckles (en).svg|thumb|300px|On top of the knuckles (yellow): 31 days<br/>Between the knuckles (blue): 30 days<br/>February (red) has 28 or 29 days.]]
[[File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|thumb|300px|The white keys of the musical keyboard correlate to months with 31 days. ('F' corresponds to January.)]]
The mean month length of the Gregorian calendar is 30.436875 days.

Months of the historical [[Roman calendar]] included:
* [[Intercalaris|the ''mensis intercalaris'']], an occasional month after February to realign the calendar.
* [[Quintilis]], renamed to July in honour of [[Julius Caesar]].
* [[Sextilis]], renamed to August in honour of [[Augustus]].

The famous [[mnemonic]] ''[[Thirty days hath September]]'' is a common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world.
Any five consecutive months (not including February) contain 153 days.
The knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first knuckle (or over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eudesign.com/mnems/dayspcm.htm |title=Days in each Month |work=Mnemonics to Improve Memory |year=1997 |access-date=8 August 2018 |publisher=EUdesign}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Boy-Mechanic-Volume-17.html |title=The Boy Mechanic: A Handy Calendar |year=1913 |work=[[Project Gutenberg]] |volume=1 |via=Full Books}}</ref>

This cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the [[musical keyboard]] alternation of white and black keys (with the note 'F' correlating to the month of January).

==== Calends, nones, and ides ====
The '''[[ides (calendar)|ides]]''' occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they occur on the fifteenth. The '''[[Roman calendar#Months|nones]]''' always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The '''[[calends]]''' are always the first day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the intercalary month).

==== Relations between dates, weekdays, and months in the Gregorian calendar ====

Within a month, the following dates fall on the same weekday:

* '''01, 08, 15, 22, and 29''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Tuesday)
* '''02, 09, 16, 23, and 30''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Wednesday)
* '''03, 10, 17, 24, and 31''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Thursday)
* '''04, 11, 18, and 25''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Friday)
* '''05, 12, 19, and 26''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Saturday)
* '''06, 13, 20, and 27''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Sunday)
* '''07, 14, 21, and 28''' (e.g., in January 2019, all these dates fell on a Monday)

Some months have the same date/weekday structure.

In a non-leap year:

* '''January/October''' (e.g., in 2019, they began/begin on a Tuesday)
* '''February/March/November''' (e.g., in 2019, they began/begin on a Friday)
* '''April/July''' (e.g., in 2019, they began/begin on a Monday) 
* '''September/December''' (e.g., in 2019, they begin on a Sunday)
*  '''January 1 and December 31''' fall on the same weekday (e.g. in 2019 on a Tuesday)

In a leap year:

* '''February/August''' (e.g. in 2020, they begin on a Saturday)
* '''March/November''' (e.g., in 2020, they begin on a Sunday)
* '''January/April/July''' (e.g., in 2020, they begin on a Wednesday)
* '''September/December''' (e.g., in 2020, they begin on a Tuesday)
* '''February 29 (the leap day)''' falls on the same weekday like February 1, 08, 15, 22, and August 1 (see above; e.g. in 2020 on a Saturday)

=== Hebrew calendar ===

These are also the names used in the [[Indian national calendar]] for the newly redefined months. Purushottam Maas or Adhik Maas ([[Romanisation of Hindi|translit.]] ''{{lang|hi-Latn|adhika}}'' = 'extra', ''{{lang|hi-Latn|māsa}}'' = 'month') is an extra month in the [[Hindu calendar]] that is inserted to keep the [[Lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s aligned. "Purushottam" is an epithet of [[Vishnu]], to whom the month is dedicated.

The names in the solar calendar are just the names of the [[zodiac]] sign in which the sun travels. They are

=== Germanic calendar ===
{{main|Germanic calendar}}
The old Icelandic calendar is not in official use anymore, but some Icelandic holidays and annual feasts are still calculated from it. It has 12 months, broken down into two groups of six often termed "winter months" and "summer months". The calendar is peculiar in that the months always start on the same [[weekday]] rather than on the same [[calendar date|date]]. Hence Þorri always starts on a Friday sometime between January 22 and January 28 ''<small>([[Julian calendar|Old style]]: January 9 to January 15)</small>'', Góa always starts on a Sunday between February 21 and February 27 ''<small>([[Julian calendar|Old style]]: February 8 to February 14)</small>''.

# Þorri (mid-January – mid-February, "frozen snow month")
# Góa (mid-February – mid-March, "Góa's month, see [[Nór]]")
# Einmánuður (mid-March – mid-April, "lone" or "single month")

* Náttleysi ("Nightless days")
# Harpa (mid-April – mid-May, Harpa is a female name, probably a forgotten goddess, first day of Harpa is celebrated as [[Sumardagurinn fyrsti]] – first day of summer)
# Skerpla (mid-May – mid-June, another forgotten goddess)

=== Old English calendar ===
Like the Old Norse calendar, the [[Anglo-Saxons]] had their own calendar before they were [[Christianized]] which reflected native traditions and deities. These months were attested by [[Bede]] in his works ''On Chronology'' and ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' written in the 8th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wuffings.co.uk/OECalendar.htm |title=The Old English Calendar |year=2000 |access-date=8 August 2018 |first=Dr Sam |last=Newton |work=Wuffings}}</ref> His months are probably those as written in the [[Northumbrian dialect]] of [[Old English]] with which he was familiar. The months were so named after the moon; the new moon marking the end of an old month and start of a new month; the [[full moon]] occurring in the middle of the month, after which the month was named.

=== Old Egyptian calendar ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
The ancient civil Egyptian calendar had a year that was 365 days long and was divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus 5 extra days (epagomenes) at the end of the year. The months were divided into 3 "weeks" of ten days each. Because the ancient Egyptian year was almost a quarter of a day shorter than the solar year and stellar events "wandered" through the calendar, it is referred to as Annus Vagus or "Wandering Year".

=== French Republican calendar ===
{{main|French Republican calendar}}
This calendar was proposed during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793. There were twelve months of 30 days each, grouped into three ten-day weeks called ''décades''. The five or six extra days needed to approximate the tropical year were placed after the months at the end of each year. A period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a ''Franciade''. It began at the autumn equinox:
* Autumn:
#[[Vendémiaire]]
#[[Brumaire]]
#[[Frimaire]]
* Winter:
#[[Nivôse]]
#[[Pluviôse]]
#[[Ventôse]]
* Spring:
#[[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]]
#[[Floréal]]
#[[Prairial]]
* Summer:
#[[Messidor]]
#[[Thermidor]]
#[[Fructidor]]

=== Eastern Ojibwe calendar ===
[[Ojibwe]] month names are based on the key feature of the month. Consequently, months between various regions have different names based on the key feature of each month in their particular region. In the Eastern Ojibwe, this can be seen in when the [[Catostomidae|sucker]] makes its run, which allows the Ojibwe to fish for them. Additionally, in the Eastern Ojibwa-Chippewa-Ottawa Dictionary, Dr. Richard Rhodes also informs of not only the variability in the month names but how in the Eastern Ojibwe, these names were originally applied to the [[lunar month]]s the Ojibwe originally used, which was a [[lunisolar calendar]] marked by the moon, fixed to ''Akiinaaniwan'' (typically December 27) that marks when sunrise is the latest in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to Eastern Ojibwe is a [[vowel]] [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] dialect, the elided vowels (and the occasionally elided consonants) have been added back in the table below, shown in brackets.
