==History==
The effort to establish the alliance began in [[Tübingen]], Germany, at the ALLC/ACH conference in 2002: a steering committee was appointed at the ALLC/ACH meeting in 2004, in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, and the executive committees of the ACH and [[Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing]]  (ALLC) approved the governance and conference protocols at the 2005 meeting in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], Canada. 
The [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] was also included.<ref name="Unsworth" />
In 2007, the Alliance Steering Committee voted to enfranchise [[Society for Digital Humanities|The Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs]] (SDH/SEMI) of Canada.
In 2012,  centerNet, a network of digital humanities centers, became a "constituent organization" affiliated with ADHO,<ref>{{Cite web |title= centerNet to join ADHO |date= August 17, 2011 |work= ADHO centerNet blog |url= http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/2011/08/centernet-to-join-adho |accessdate = October 20, 2013 }}</ref> followed by the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities in 2013, the French-speaking Association for Digital Humanities, Humanistica,<ref>{{Cite web |title= Humanistica rejoint officiellement ADHO |date= July 15, 2016 |work= Humanistica website |url= http://www.humanisti.ca/humanistica-adho/ |accessdate = July 15, 2016 }}</ref> in 2016, and the Taiwanese Association for Digital Humanities<ref>[http://www.tadh.org.tw Taiwanese Association for Digital Humanities]</ref> in 2017. ADHO gained legal status as the Stichting ADHO Foundation (Netherlands) in 2013.<ref>[http://bedrijfnederland.nl/zuid-holland/den-haag/stichting-adho-foundation Stichting ADHO Foundation]</ref>
