'''''Ages in Chaos''''' is a book by the controversial writer [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], first published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Israel]] are five centuries out of step.  He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the ''Ages in Chaos'' series.

Velikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.

==Summary==
Velikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in ''Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History'' in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of [[Alexander the Great]] is garbled, but ''Ages in Chaos'' was his first full-length work on the subject.

His starting point for the first volume of the series was that [[the Exodus]] took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian [[New Kingdom]], but at the fall of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].<ref>Velikovsky ''Ages in Chaos''</ref>  In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of "ghost doubles" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.

First he claimed that the [[Ipuwer Papyrus]] came from the beginning of Egypt's [[Second Intermediate Period]], and that this was an Egyptian account of the [[Plagues of Egypt]].  He then identified [[Dudimose|Tutimaios]] as the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]] (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the [[Hyksos]] with the biblical [[Amalek]]ites, the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] with the Biblical [[Queen of Sheba]], the [[land of Punt]] with [[Solomon]]'s kingdom, and Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] with the Biblical King [[Shishak]].  He claimed that the Egyptian [[Amarna letters]] from the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], from roughly the time of King [[Ahab]].

[[File:GD-EG-Caire-Musée061.JPG|right|thumb|Akhnaton]]
A second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed.  Instead it was followed in 1960 by ''Oedipus and Akhnaton'', where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] was the origin of the Greek legend of [[Oedipus]], and that [[Amenophis III]] was [[Laius]], and [[Tutankhamun]] was [[Eteocles]].<ref>Velikovsky ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''</ref>

In the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series.  In ''Peoples of the Sea'' he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt.  [[Manetho]]'s [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]] here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and [[Nectanebo I]] is a ghost double of [[Rameses III]].<ref>Velikovsky ''Peoples of the Sea''</ref>  Rameses III fought invasions by the [[Sea Peoples]], including the "Peleset", conventionally identified with the [[Philistines]].  According to Velikovsky, the "Peleset" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries.  The [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st dynasty]] then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the [[oasis|oases]] simultaneously with the Persians.

[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|Ramses II]]
In ''Ramses II and His Time'' Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th dynasty]].  Thus, [[Ramses I]] was an alter-ego of [[Necho I]], [[Seti I]] of [[Psamtik I]], [[Ramses II]] of [[Necho II]], and [[Merneptah]] of [[Apries]].  In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern [[Turkey]] were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-[[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]].  The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]] is identical to Necho's fight against [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] at [[Battle of Carchemish|Carchemish]], [[Nabopolassar]] is [[Mursili II]], [[Neriglissar]] is [[Muwatalli II|Muwatalli]], [[Labashi-Marduk]] is [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]], and Nebuchadrezzar II is [[Hattusili III]].<ref>Velikovsky ''Ramses II and His Time''</ref>

At the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: ''The Assyrian Conquest'' and ''The Dark Age of Greece''; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive.<ref>[http://www.varchive.org/ The Immanuel Velikovsky Archive]</ref>  In the former work, Velikovsky separated the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th]] and [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasties]], specifically arguing that over a century separated [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], conventionally regarded as his successor.  Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE.  The "great king" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.

The books have remained popular.  The British publisher [[Sidgwick & Jackson]] reprinted ''Ages in Chaos'' ten times between 1953 and 1977,<ref>{{harvnb |Velikovsky |1977 |p=iv (publisher's summary)}}</ref> and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.

==Controversy and criticism==
The revised chronology proposed by ''Ages in Chaos'' has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]]. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective.<ref>[[William F. Albright|Albright, William]] 1952. ''New York Herald Tribune Book Review'' April 20. Retelling the Near East's Ancient History. p. 6.</ref><ref>[[Waldemar Kaempffert|Kaempffert, Waldemar]] 1952. ''New York Times Book Review'' April 20. Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, and the Egypt of Exodus. p. 23.</ref><ref>Stiebing, Jr., William H. 1984. Cosmic Catastrophism, Chap. III, in ''Ancient Astronauts, Cosmic Collisions'' Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-260-2}}. pp. 57-80.</ref>  In 1965 the leading cuneiformist [[Abraham Sachs]], in a forum at [[Brown University]], discredited Velikovsky's use of [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sources.<ref>see transcript in ''Aeon'' 1992, Vol.3 No.1, pp.103-5, and also http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/vsachs.html</ref> Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.<ref>[[C. Leroy Ellenberger|Ellenberger, Leroy]] 1992. ''Aeon'' '''3''' (1), section "Bonanza from Brown" in "Of Lessons, Legacies, and Litmus Tests: A Velikovsky Potpourri (Part One)", pp. 88-90. "Velikovsky confronted a panel of four professors [at Brown University on March 15, 1965]: [[Leon Cooper|Leon N. Cooper]] (physics), Bruno J Giletti (geology), Charles Smiley (astronomy) and Abraham J. Sachs (history of mathematics) [who was substituting for [[Otto Neugebauer]] ], moderated by [[Henry Kučera]] (linguistics). In the event, Velikovsky debated the first three handily. He was stunned by Sachs whose address was both a rhetorical and substantive ''tour de force''. Velikovsky's rebuttal began: 'Dr. Sachs threw so many accusations in that [[Philippic]] of his that I am at a difficulty to answer; but I invite Dr. Sachs to spend the hour and a half tomorrow at the meeting [at Diman House], and every one of you too, and point by point each of his statements will be proven wrong.' Unfortunately, Sachs did not show up the next day and Velikovsky did not even mention Sachs [according to the tape recording of the proceedings in the possession of [http://www.velikovsky.info/Warner_B._Sizemore Warner B. Sizemore] who loaned it to Ellenberger March 31, 1979]. Curiously, Velikovsky's file for the Brown trip contains typed rebuttals to all the panelists ''except'' Sachs, for whom only partial, penciled notes exist&mdash;but later that year Velikovsky would reply to Kim J. Masters, a Princeton sophomore, within a week in ''The Daily Princetonian'' (Nov. 15, 1965) over a criticism of ''Oedipus and Akhnaton''. Velikovsky's rebuttal to Masters was scathing, running the gamut from haggling over details to ''ad hominems''."</ref>

In 1984 [[fringe science]] expert [[Henry H. Bauer]] wrote ''Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy'', which ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' described as "the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky".<ref name="time">{{cite web | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1064461-2,00.html | title = Science on the Fringe | publisher = [[Time magazine]] | author = Michael D. Lemonick/Gainesville | date = 2005-05-24 | accessdate = 2008-06-02 }}</ref>  Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from ''Ages in Chaos''.<ref>{{harvnb |Bauer |1999 |pp=158–160}}</ref>

In 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of ''Ages in Chaos'', which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes that he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/hatshepsut.html |title=Lorton, David ''Hatshepsut, the Queen of Sheba, and Immanuel Velikovsky'' |access-date=10 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926234659/http://reocities.com/Athens/academy/1326/hatshepsut.html |archive-date=26 September 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's ''Ages in Chaos'' series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in [[Glasgow]] specifically to debate the revised chronology.<ref>"Ages in Chaos?'-Proceedings of the Residential Weekend Conference, Glasgow, 7th-9th April 1978" ''Society for Interdisciplinary Studies Review'' Vol. VI, issue 1/2/3 84pp (1982)</ref> The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]], John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and [[David Rohl]], was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable,<ref>Bimson, "Finding the Limits of Chronological Revision" in "Proceedings of the SIS Conference: Ages Still in Chaos" ''Chronology & Catastrophism Review'' 2003</ref> although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.<ref name=James>{{harvnb |James |1991 |p=xxi}}</ref>

David Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the [[Pharaoh of the Exodus]],<ref name=rohl283>{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=283}}</ref> there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.<ref name=rohl402>{{harvnb |Rohl |1995 |p=402}}</ref>

James, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the [[Bronze Age collapse|end of the Bronze Age]], credited Velikovsky with "point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as "disastrously extreme", producing "a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve" and noted that "Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy".<ref name=James/>

One important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the [[Assyria]]ns in the 7th century BCE.  Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in the 4th century BCE.  They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties.  Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.

==Legacy== 
In spite of the hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University at Buffalo|Buffalo]].<ref>{{cite book

Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal ''The Velikovskian''. He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title ''Pillars of the Past''. Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled ''Ages in Alignment''.

These scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in 331 BC.<ref>{{cite book

Little if any of these authors' work has been endorsed by mainstream historians.
