'''Annals''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:annales|annāles]]}}, from {{lang|la|annus}}, "year"){{sfnp|EB|1878}}{{sfnp|OED|1884}} are a concise [[history|historical]] record in which events are arranged [[chronology|chronologically]], year by year,{{sfnp|EB|1878}} although the term is also used loosely for any [[historical record]].{{sfnp|OED|1884}}

==Scope==
The nature of the distinction between annals and history is a subject that has received more attention from critics than its intrinsic importance deserves{{according to whom?|date=November 2020}}, based on divisions established by the ancient Romans.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} [[Verrius Flaccus]] is quoted by [[Aulus Gellius]]{{sfnp|Gellius|177}} as stating that the etymology of ''history'' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ιστορειν}}, ''historein'', equated with [[Latin]] {{lang|la|inspicere}}, "to inquire in person") properly restricts it to primary sources such as [[Thucydides]]'s which have come from the author's own observations, while annals record the events of earlier times arranged according to years.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} [[Hayden White|White]] distinguishes annals from [[chronicle]]s, which organize their events by topics such as the reigns of kings,{{sfnp|White|1987|p=16}} and from histories, which aim to present and conclude a narrative implying the moral importance of the events recorded.{{sfnp|White|1987|p=7}}{{sfnp|White|1987|p=11}}{{sfnp|White|1987|p=16}} Generally speaking, annalists record events drily, leaving the entries unexplained and equally weighted.{{sfnp|White|1987|p=7}}

The chief sources of information in regard to the annals of ancient [[Rome]] are two passages in [[Cicero]]<ref name=chickpea>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Oratore]]'', ii.12.52.</ref>{{sfnp|EB|1878}} and in [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]<ref name=server>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''ad Aen''. i.373.</ref>{{sfnp|EB|1911}} which have been the subject of much discussion. Cicero states that, from the [[Roman Republic|founding of the Republic]] down to the pontificate of [[Publius Mucius Scaevola]] ({{circa|lk=no|132}}&nbsp;BC), it was usual for the [[pontifex maximus]] to record the name of the magistrates and the noteworthy events of each year on a white tablet (an {{lang|la|album}}), which was exhibited in an open place at his house so that the people might read it.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Servius states the events were written for each day.{{refn|group=n|{{lang-la|per singulos dies}}.<ref name=server/>}} In the late Republic, these were known as the {{lang|la|[[Annales Maximi]]}}.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} After the pontificate of Publius, annals were compiled by various unofficial writers, of whom Cicero names [[Cato the elder|Cato]], [[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Pictor]], and [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Piso]].{{sfnp|EB|1878}} These annals have been generally regarded as the same with the {{lang|la|[[Commentarii Pontificum]]}} cited by [[Livy]], but there seems reason to believe that the two were distinct, with the {{lang|la|Commentarii}} being fuller and more circumstantial.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Verrius Flaccus's division of genres is borne out in the common division of Tacitus's works into ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} although he did not use those titles to refer to his own works.

Among the early Christians, it was common to establish the date of [[Easter]] by asking local Jews for the date of [[Passover]] ([[Nisan]] 14 in the [[Jewish calendar]]) and either using that date or the nearest Sunday to it.{{sfnp|Schwartz|1905|pp=104&nbsp;ff}}{{sfnp|Gibson|1903|p=100}} By the end of the 3rd century, this date sometimes occurred before the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]] and frequently varied from city to city.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Hist. Eccl.]]'', 7.</ref> Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|325 Council of Nicaea]], [[Easter tables]] began to be drawn up according to [[computus|various methods of computing Easter]], often running from the [[Passion of Christ|Passion]] until decades or centuries into the future. Beginning in [[Irish monasticism|Ireland]], Wales, and England in the 7th century, monks began to briefly note important events of the year as [[marginalia]] in these tables.{{sfnp|EB|1911}} Thereafter the compilation of annals became by and large a monastic activity, with the earliest recorded monastic annals being compiled in Ireland and known as the ''[[Chronicle of Ireland]]''.{{sfnp|Flechner|2013|pp=422&nbsp;ff}}  Not all early annalistic texts, however, were monastic, and some in fact were made under royal patronage. For example, what is now called the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a text concerned mainly with the activities of kings, was written in annalistic form. Other examples of insular annals, written under various kinds of patronage, include the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'', the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'', the ''[[Annals of Innisfallen]]'', and the ''[[Annals of Wales]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Cambriae}}).

Introduced by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|insular missionaries]] to the continent, these texts were recopied, augmented, and continued, especially in [[Austrasia]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}} During the 9th-century [[Carolingian Renaissance]], they became the usual form of contemporary history: major examples include the ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'', the ''[[Annales Fuldenses|Annals of Fulda]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Fuldenses}}), the ''[[Annales Bertiniani|Annals of St&nbsp;Bertin]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Bertiniani}}), and the ''[[Annales Laureschamenses|Annals of Lorsch]]'' ({{lang|la|Annales Laureschamenses}}).{{sfnp|EB|1911}} As the annals developed into fuller and more descriptive entries, they became more indistinguishable from [[chronicle]]s, although the term was still used for various works, such as the [[Annals of Waverley]].{{sfnp|EB|1911}}

===Modern===
In modern literature, the term "annals" is similarly loosely applied to works which more or less strictly adhere to the order of years,{{sfnp|EB|1911}} both in western contexts (English ''Annual Registers'', French {{lang|fr|Annuaires de la Revue}}, German {{lang|de|Jahrbücher}}) and to equivalent styles in other cultures (such as the Chinese [[Spring and Autumn Annals]]).

It is also applied to various [[periodicals]], particularly [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the [[sciences]], after the model of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]]'s ''[[Annales de chimie et de physique]]''.
