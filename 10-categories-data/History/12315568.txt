The '''International Association for Media and History''' (IAMHIST) is a scholarly organization which brings together [[media historian]]s and professionals with an interest in [[media history]].  Founded in the summer of 1977 it organizes biennial conferences, which have typically rotated between venues in the UK, US and the continent of Europe.  The association has been especially associated with the study of the role of film, radio and television in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s and the [[Cold War]], and the advancement of the systematic use of audiovisual materials as historical sources.  The organization produces the quarterly journal ''[[The Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television]].''
