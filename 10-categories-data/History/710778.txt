A '''cradle of civilization''' is a location where [[civilization]] is understood to have independently emerged. According to current thinking, there was no single "cradle" of civilization; instead, several cradles of civilization developed independently. The [[Fertile Crescent]] ([[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]]) and [[Ancient India]] are believed to be the earliest. [[Ancient China]] emerged somewhat later.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WOPkmChaFsC&q=Anatolia+cradle+of+civilization&pg=PP8|title=The Near East: Archaeology in the "Cradle of Civilization|author=Charles Keith Maisels|publisher=Routledge|date=1993|isbn=978-0-415-04742-5}}</ref><ref name="Singh2008">{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131711200|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC}}</ref><ref>''Cradles of Civilization-China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land'', Robert E.

==History of the idea==
<!---Please insert English-language references that are related to this topic to illustrate the relationship between this article-->
The concept "cradle of civilization" is the subject of much debate. The figurative use of ''cradle'' to mean "the place or region in which anything is nurtured or sheltered in its earlier stage" is traced by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] (1590). [[Charles Rollin]]'s ''Ancient History'' (1734) has "Egypt that served at first as the cradle of the holy nation".

The phrase "cradle of civilization" plays a certain role in [[national mysticism]]. It has been used in Eastern as well as Western cultures, for instance, in [[Indian nationalism]] (''[[In Search of the Cradle of Civilization]]'' 1995) and [[Taiwanese nationalism]] (''Taiwan;— The Cradle of Civilization''<ref name="Taiwan2001">{{cite book

''Ancient Britain: The Cradle of Civilization'' 1921).

==Rise of civilization==
{{further|Neolithic Revolution|Urban revolution|Chalcolithic}}

The earliest signs of a process leading to [[sedentism|sedentary]] culture can be seen in the [[Levant]] to as early as 12,000 BC, when the [[Natufian culture]] became sedentary; it evolved into an agricultural society by 10,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/anthropology/v1007/baryo.pdf |title=The Natufian Culture in the Levant, Threshold to the Origins of Agriculture |author=Ofer Bar-Yosef |website=Columbia.edu |access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref> The importance of water to safeguard an abundant and stable food supply, due to favourable conditions for hunting, fishing and gathering resources including cereals, provided an initial ''[[Broad spectrum revolution|wide spectrum economy]]'' that triggered the creation of permanent villages.<ref>''La protohistoire de l'Europe'', Jan Lichardus et al., Presses Universitaires de France, Paris. {{ISBN|84-335-9366-8}}, 1987, chapter II.2.</ref>

The earliest proto-urban settlements with several thousand inhabitants emerged in the [[Neolithic]].  The first cities to house several tens of thousands were [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and [[Uruk]], by the [[31st century BCE|31st century]] BC (see [[Historical urban community sizes]]).

[[Historic]] times are marked apart from [[prehistoric]] times when "records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations"<ref>Carr, Edward H. (1961). ''What is History?'', p. 108, {{ISBN|0-14-020652-3}}.</ref>—in written or oral form. If the rise of civilization is taken to coincide with the development of writing out of [[proto-writing]], the Near Eastern [[Chalcolithic]], the transitional period between the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]] during the [[4th millennium BCE|4th millennium]] BC, and the development of proto-writing in [[Harappa]] in the [[Indus Valley]] of South Asia around 3300 BC are the earliest incidences, followed by Chinese [[Neolithic signs in China|proto-writing]] evolving into the [[oracle bone script]], and again by the emergence of [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] from about 900 BC.

In the absence of written documents, most aspects of the rise of early civilizations are contained in archaeological assessments that document the development of formal institutions and the material culture. A "civilized" way of life is ultimately linked to conditions coming almost exclusively from intensive agriculture. [[Gordon Childe]] defined the development of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]], which enhanced tendencies towards dense settlements, specialized occupational groups, social classes, exploitation of surpluses, monumental public buildings and writing. Few of those conditions, however, are unchallenged by the records: dense settlements were not attested in Egypt's Old Kingdom and were absent in the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] area;{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} the [[Incas]] lacked writing altogether (although they could keep records with [[Quipu]]s); and often monumental architecture preceded any indication of village settlement. For instance, in present-day Louisiana, researchers have determined that cultures that were primarily nomadic organized over generations to build earthwork mounds at seasonal settlements as early as 3400 BC. Rather than a succession of events and preconditions, the rise of civilization could equally be hypothesized as an accelerated process that started with incipient agriculture and culminated in the Oriental Bronze Age.<ref name=Brit26>''Britannica'' 15th edition, 26:62–63.</ref>

==Single or multiple cradles==
A traditional [[theory]] of the spread of civilization is that it began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread out from there by influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history-world.org/rise_of_civilization_in_the_midd.htm |title=The Rise Of Civilization In The Middle East And Africa |publisher=History-world.org |access-date=18 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307020558/http://history-world.org/rise_of_civilization_in_the_midd.htm |archive-date=7 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Scholars more generally now believe that civilizations arose independently at several locations in both hemispheres. They have observed that sociocultural developments occurred along different timeframes. "Sedentary" and "[[nomadic]]" communities continued to interact considerably; they were not strictly divided among widely different cultural groups. The concept of a cradle of civilization has a focus where the inhabitants came to build [[cities]], to create writing systems, to experiment in techniques for making [[pottery]] and [[metalworking|using metals]], to [[domestication|domesticate animals]], and to develop complex [[social structure]]s involving [[class system]]s.<ref name=1491Book/>

By the time of the Jemdet Nasr Period, the script had already undergone a number of significant changes.

The center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia, even though rulers soon began expanding into neighboring areas, and neighboring Semitic groups adopted much of Sumerian culture for their own.

The developed [[Neolithic]] cultures belonging to the phases [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (10,200 BC) and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (7600 to 6000 BC) appeared in the [[fertile crescent]] and from there spread eastwards and westwards.<ref name="Bellwood1"/> Contemporaneously, a grain-grinding culture using the earliest type of sickle blades had replaced the culture of hunters, fishers, and gathering people using stone tools along the Nile. Geological evidence and computer climate modeling studies also suggest that natural climate changes around 8000 BC began to desiccate the extensive pastoral lands of northern Africa, eventually forming the [[Sahara]]. Continued desiccation forced the early ancestors of the Egyptians to settle around the Nile more permanently and to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle.<ref>Barich et al.

By about 5500 BC, small tribes living in the Nile valley had developed into a series of inter-related cultures as far south as Sudan, demonstrating firm control of agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper Southern Egypt was the [[Badari]], which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, [[stone tool]]s, and use of copper.<ref>Hayes, W.

Along with the rising importance of a central administration there arose a new class of educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration.<ref name="Shaw1" /> As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called [[nomarch]]s began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh.

The people of the Indus Civilisation achieved great accuracy in measuring length, mass, and time. They were among the first to develop a system of uniform weights and measures. A comparison of available objects indicates large scale variation across the Indus territories. Their smallest division, which is marked on an ivory scale found in [[Lothal]] in Gujarat, was approximately 1.704&nbsp;mm, the smallest division ever recorded on a scale of the [[Bronze Age]]. Harappan engineers followed the decimal division of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their [[hexahedron]] weights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Search of the Cradle of Civilization:New Light on Ancient India|last1=Feuerstein|first1=Georg|last2=Kak|first2=Subhash|last3=Frawley|first3=David|publisher=Quest Books|year=2001|page=73|isbn=978-0-8356-0741-4}}</ref> These [[chert]] weights were in a ratio of 5:2:1 with weights of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 units, with each unit weighing approximately 28&nbsp;grams, similar to the English [[Imperial units#Mass|Imperial ounce]] or Greek uncia, and smaller objects were weighed in similar ratios with the units of 0.871.

It would seem that the bountiful monsoon rainfall of the Early to Mid-Holocene had forged a condition of plenty for all, and that competitive energies were channeled into commerce rather than conflict. Scholars have long argued that these rains shaped the origins of the urban Harappan societies, which emerged from Neolithic villages around 2600 BC. It now appears that this rainfall began to slowly taper off in the third millennium, at just the point that the Harappan cities began to develop. Thus it seems that this "first urbanisation" in South Asia was the initial response of the Indus Valley peoples to the beginning of Late Holocene aridification.

[[History of China|Chinese civilization]] begins during the second phase of the [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou period]] (1900 to 1500 BC), with Erlitou considered the first state level society of [[East Asia]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Erlitou-culture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621221649/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Erlitou-culture|date=21 June 2015}}</ref> There is considerable debate whether Erlitou sites correlate to the semi-legendary [[Xia dynasty]]. The Xia dynasty (2070 to 1600 BC) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient Chinese historical records such as the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', first published more than a millennium later during the Western Zhou period. Although Xia is an important element in Chinese historiography, there is to date no contemporary written evidence to corroborate the dynasty. Erlitou saw an increase in bronze [[metallurgy]] and [[urbanization]] and was a rapidly growing regional center with palatial complexes that provide evidence for social stratification.<ref>Liu, L. & Xiu, H., "Rethinking Erlitou: legend, history and Chinese archaeology", ''Antiquity'', 81:314 (2007)</ref> The Erlitou civilization is divided into four phases, each of roughly 50 years. During Phase I, covering {{convert|100|ha|acre|abbr=off}}, Erlitou was a rapidly growing regional center with estimated population of several thousand{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=184}} but not yet an urban civilization or capital.{{sfn|Liu|2004|p=229}} Urbanization began in Phase II, expanding to {{convert|abbr=on|300|ha|acre}} with a population around 11,000.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=184}}  A palace area of {{convert|abbr=on|12|ha|acre}} was demarcated by four roads. It contained the 150x50&nbsp;m Palace&nbsp;3, composed of three courtyards along a 150-meter axis, and Palace&nbsp;5.{{sfn|Li|2003}}  A bronze foundry was established to the south of the palatial complex that was controlled by the elite who lived in palaces.{{sfn|Liu|2004|pp=230–231}} The city reached its peak in Phase III, and may have had a population of around 24,000.{{sfn|Liu|2004|p=229}} The palatial complex was surrounded by a two-meter-thick rammed-earth wall, and Palaces 1, 7, 8, 9 were built.  The earthwork volume of rammed earth for the base of largest Palace 1 is 20,000 m³ at least.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=二里头：华夏王朝文明的开端|journal=寻根|volume=3}}</ref> Palaces 3 and 5 were abandoned and replaced by {{Convert|4200|km2|sqft|sp=us|adj=mid}} Palace 2 and Palace 4.{{sfn|Liu|Xu|2007}} In Phase IV, the population decreased to around 20,000, but building continued. Palace 6 was built as an extension of Palace 2, and Palaces 10 and 11 were built.  Phase IV overlaps with the Lower phase of the [[Erligang culture]] (1600–1450 &thinsp;BC).  Around 1600 to 1560 BC, about 6&nbsp;km northeast of Erlitou, Eligang cultural walled city was built at [[Yanshi]],{{sfn|Liu|Xu|2007}} which coincides with an increase in production of arrowheads at Erlitou.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=184}} This situation might indicate that the Yanshi City was competing for power and dominance with Erlitou.{{sfn|Liu|2006|p=184}} Production of bronzes and other elite goods ceased at the end of Phase IV, at the same time as the Erligang city of Zhengzhou was established {{convert|abbr=on|85|km|mi}} to the east.  There is no evidence of destruction by fire or war, but, during the Upper Erligang phase (1450–1300 &thinsp;BC), all the palaces were abandoned, and Erlitou was reduced to a village of {{convert|abbr=on|30|ha|acre}}.{{sfn|Liu|Xu|2007}}

The earliest traditional Chinese dynasty for which there is both archeological and written evidence is the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600 to 1046 BC). Shang sites have yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], the [[oracle bone script]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on bones. These inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of Chinese civilization.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Howells | first1 = William | chapter = Origins of the Chinese People: Interpretations of recent evidence | title = The Origins of Chinese Civilization | editor-last = Keightley | editor-first = David N. | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-520-04229-2 | pages = 297–319}}</ref> Some historians argue that Erlitou should be considered an early phase of the Shang dynasty.

Construction areas show possible evidence of feasting, which would have included music and likely alcohol, suggesting an elite able to both mobilize and reward the population.<ref name=1491Book /> The degree of centralized authority is difficult to ascertain, but architectural construction patterns are indicative of an elite that, at least in certain places at certain times, wielded considerable power: while some of the monumental architecture was constructed incrementally, other buildings, such as the two main platform mounds at Caral, appear to have been constructed in one or two intense construction phases.<ref name=Polities /> As further evidence of centralized control, Haas points to remains of large stone [[warehouse]]s found at Upaca, on the Pativilca, as emblematic of authorities able to control vital resources such as cotton.<ref name=1491Book /> Economic authority would have rested on the control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that the scope of this [[economic power]] base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were at the center of a broad regional trade network centered on these resources.<ref name=Polities />

''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, citing Shady, suggests a rich and varied trade life: "[Caral] exported its own products and those of Aspero to distant communities in exchange for exotic imports: ''[[Spondylus]]'' shells from the coast of [[Ecuador]], rich [[dye]]s from the [[Andes|Andean highlands]], [[hallucinogen]]ic [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] from the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]]."<ref name=Discover>{{cite journal | last = Miller| first = Kenneth | url = http://discovermagazine.com/2005/sep/showdown-at-caral |date=September 2005 | title = Showdown at the O.K.

Leaders' ideological power was based on apparent access to [[deities]] and the [[supernatural]].<ref name=Polities /> Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: an image of the [[Staff God]], a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a [[gourd]] dated to 2250 BC.

The figure may have been carved by a later civilization onto an ancient gourd, as it was found in [[stratum|strata]] dating between 900 and 1300 AD.</ref> The act of architectural construction and maintenance may also have been a spiritual or religious experience: a process of communal exaltation and ceremony.<ref name=Oldest /> Shady has called Caral "the sacred city" (''la ciudad sagrada''): socio-economic and political focus was on the temples, which were periodically remodeled, with major burnt offerings associated with the remodeling.<ref>From [http://sisbib.unmsm.edu.pe/Bibvirtual/Libros/Arqueologia/ciudad_sagrada/la%20sociedad%20de%20caral%20supe.htm summary three], Shady (1997)</ref>

The discovery of [[quipu]], string-based recording devices, at Caral can be understood as a form of "proto-writing" at Norte Chico.<ref name=Quipu>{{cite journal | last = Mann | first = Charles C. | date = 12 August 2005 | title = Unraveling Khipu's Secrets | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5737 | pages = 1008–1009 | doi = 10.1126/science.309.5737.1008 | pmid = 16099962| s2cid = 161448364 }}</ref> However, the exact use of quipu in this and later Andean cultures has been widely debated.<ref name=1491Book/> Additionally, the image of the [[Staff God]] has been found on a [[gourd]] dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures. The presence of quipu and the commonality of religious symbols suggests a cultural link between Norte Chico and later Andean cultures.<ref name="Religion"/><ref name="icon"/>

Circa 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization began to decline, with more powerful centers appearing to the south and north along the coast and to the east inside the belt of the Andes.<ref name=NewLight>{{cite press release |title=Archaeologists shed new light on Americas' earliest known civilization |publisher=Northern Illinois University |date= 22 December 2004 |url= http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2004/dec/peru.shtml | access-date= 1 February 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070209015324/http://www.niu.edu/PubAffairs/RELEASES/2004/dec/peru.shtml |archive-date = 9 February 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Pottery eventually developed in the [[Amazon Basin]] and spread to the Andean culture region around 2000 BC. The next major civilization to arise in the Andes would be the Chavín culture at [[Chavín de Huantar]], located in the Andean highlands of the present-day [[Ancash Region]].

The emergence of the [[Olmec civilization]] has traditionally been dated to around 1600 to 1500 BC. Olmec features first emerged in the city of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]], fully coalescing around 1400 BC. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] basin.<ref name="OlmecA"/> This environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an [[elite]] class and an associated demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | author2 = Linda Black, Larry S.

The aspect of Olmec culture perhaps most familiar today is their artwork, particularly the [[Olmec colossal heads]].<ref name="Pool">Pool, Christopher A. (2007). Olmec Archaeology and Early Mesoamerica. Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.</ref> San Lorenzo was situated in the midst of a large agricultural area.<ref>Coe, p. 44.</ref> San Lorenzo seems to have been largely a ceremonial site, a town without city walls, centered in the midst of a widespread medium-to-large agricultural population. The ceremonial center and attendant buildings could have housed 5,500 while the entire area, including hinterlands, could have reached 13,000.<ref>Lawler, p. 23</ref> It is thought that while San Lorenzo controlled much or all of the Coatzacoalcos basin, areas to the east (such as the area where La Venta would rise to prominence) and north-northwest (such as the [[Tuxtla Mountains]]) were home to independent polities.<ref>Pool, p. 193.</ref> San Lorenzo was all but abandoned around 900 BC at about the same time that [[La Venta]] rose to prominence. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred [[circa]] 950&nbsp;BC, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion.<ref>Coe (1967), p. 72. Alternatively, the mutilation of these monuments may be unrelated to the decline and abandonment of San Lorenzo. Some researchers believe that the mutilation had ritualistic aspects, particularly since most mutilated monuments were reburied in a row.</ref> The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.<ref>Pool, p. 135.  Diehl, pp. 58–59, 82.</ref>

La Venta became the cultural capital of the Olmec concentration in the region until its abandonment around 400 BC; constructing monumental architectural achievements such as the [[La Venta#Complex C (The Great Pyramid)|Great Pyramid of La Venta]].<ref name="OlmecA"/><ref name="Pool"/> It contained a “concentration of power,” as reflected by the sheer enormity of the architecture and the extreme value of the artifacts uncovered.<ref>Gonzalez Lauck 1996, p. 80</ref> La Venta is perhaps the largest Olmec city and it was controlled and expanded by an extremely complex hierarchical system with a king, as the ruler and the elites below him. Priests had power and influence over life and death and likely great political sway as well. Unfortunately, not much is known about the political or social structure of the Olmec, though new dating techniques might, at some point, reveal more information about this elusive culture. It is possible that the signs of status exist in the artifacts recovered at the site such as depictions of feathered headdresses or of individuals wearing a mirror on their chest or forehead.<ref name="Colman 2010">Colman 2010</ref> “High-status objects were a significant source of power in the La Venta polity political power, economic power, and ideological power. They were tools used by the elite to enhance and maintain rights to rulership.”<ref>Pohl 2005, p. 10</ref> It has been estimated that La Venta would need to be supported by a population of at least 18,000 people during its principal occupation.<ref>Heizer 1968</ref> To add to the mystique of La Venta, the alluvial soil did not preserve skeletal remains, so it is difficult to observe differences in burials. However, colossal heads provide proof that the elite had some control over the lower classes, as their construction would have been extremely labor-intensive. “Other features similarly indicate that many laborers were involved.”<ref>Drucker 1961, p. 1</ref> In addition, excavations over the years have discovered that different parts of the site were likely reserved for elites and other parts for non-elites. This segregation of the city indicates that there must have been social classes and therefore social inequality.<ref name="Colman 2010"/>
The exact cause of the decline of the Olmec culture is uncertain. Between 400 and 350 BC, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously.<ref>Nagy, Christopher (1997). "The Geoarchaeology of Settlement in the Grijalva Delta". In Barbara L. Stark; Philip J. Arnold III. Olmec to Aztec: Settlement Patterns in the Ancient Gulf Lowlands. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. pp. 253–277</ref> This depopulation was probably the result of serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers, in particular changes to the [[river]]ine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by [[tectonic]] upheavals or subsidence, or the [[Siltation|silting]] up of rivers due to agricultural practices.<ref name="OlmecA"/><ref name="Pool"/> Within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The [[Tres Zapotes]] site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BC, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]], has features similar to those found at [[Izapa]], some 550&nbsp;km (330&nbsp;miles) to the southeast.<ref>Coe, Michael D. (1968). America's First Civilization: Discovering the Olmec. New York: The Smithsonian Library.</ref>

The Olmecs are sometimes referred to as the mother culture of Mesoamerica, as they were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed.<ref name="Coe1">Coe, Michael D.; Rex Koontz (2002). Mexico: from the Olmecs to the Aztecs (5th edition, revised and enlarged ed.). London and New York: Thames & Hudson.</ref> However, the causes and degree of Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures has been a subject of debate over many decades.<ref>Wilford, John Noble; “Mother Culture, or Only a Sister?”, The New York Times, 15 March 2005.</ref> Practices introduced by the Olmec include [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]] and the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]; hallmarks of subsequent Mesoamerican societies such as the [[Maya people|Maya]] and [[Aztec]].<ref name="Coe1"/> Although the [[Mesoamerican writing system]] would fully develop later, early Olmec ceramics show representations that may be interpreted as codices.<ref name="OlmecA"/>
