'''Web browsing history''' refers to the list of [[Web page|web pages]] a user has visited, as well as associated data such as page title and time of visit. It is usually stored locally by [[Web browser|web browsers]]<ref name=ffhist>{{cite web |title=Wiederherstellen wichtiger Daten aus einem alten Profil {{!}} Hilfe zu Firefox |url=https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/wiederherstellen-wichtiger-daten-aus-altem-profil |website=support.mozilla.org |language=de}}</ref><ref name=chrome-history>{{cite web |title=Google Chrome History Location {{!}} Chrome History Viewer |url=https://www.foxtonforensics.com/browser-history-examiner/chrome-history-location |website=www.foxtonforensics.com}}</ref> in order to provide the user with a history list to go back to previously visited pages. It can reflect the user's interests, needs, and browsing habits.<ref name=":8">Du, Weidan, Zhenyu Cheryl Qian, Paul Parsons, Yingjie Victor Chen. 2018. “Personal Web Library: organizing and visualizing Web browsing history”.  ''International Journal of Web Information Systems'' 14(2): 212-232.</ref> Web browsing history could also be collected by third-party organizations and used to provide services such as targeted advertising and carry out research. The provision of these services could cause privacy harder to protect.

== Applications ==
=== Local history ===
Locally stored browsing history can facilitate rediscovering lost previously visited web pages of which one only has a vague memory in mind, or pages difficult to find due to being located within [[deep web]]. Browsers also utilize it to enable [[autocompletion]] in their [[address bar]] for quicker and more convenient navigation to frequently visited pages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Autocompletion in Chrome's omnibox is getting smarter |url=https://mspoweruser.com/autocompletion-chrome-omnibox-getting-smarter/ |website=MSPoweruser |date=24 August 2020}}</ref>

The retention span of browsing history varies per internet browser. [[Mozilla Firefox]] (desktop version) records history indefinitely by default inside a file named <code>places.sqlite</code>, but automatically erases the earliest history upon exhausted disk space<ref name=ffhist />, while [[Google Chrome]] (desktop version) stores history for ten weeks by default, automatically pruning earlier entries. An indefinite history file named <code>Archived History</code> was once recorded, but has been removed and automatically deleted in version 37, released in September 2014.<ref name="obsidian">{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Ryan|title=Archived History files removed from Chrome v37|url=http://www.obsidianforensics.com/blog/archived-history-files-removed-from-chrome-v37/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010125418/http://www.obsidianforensics.com/blog/archived-history-files-removed-from-chrome-v37/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-10-10|publisher=Obsidian Forensics|ref=obsidian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=[chrome] Revision 275159 |url=https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?revision=275159&view=revision |website=src.chromium.org}}</ref>

[[Browser extension]]s such as ''History Trends Unlimited'' for Google Chrome (desktop version) allow the indefinite local storage of browsing history, [[import and export of data|exporting]] into a [[data portability|portable file]], and self-analysis of browsing habits and statistics.<ref>{{cite web |title=3 Simple Yet Useful Extensions to Enhance Chrome's History |url=https://www.maketecheasier.com/enhance-chrome-history-extensions/ |website=Make Tech Easier |date=7 October 2018}}</ref>

Browsing history is not recorded in browsers' so-called ''[[incognito mode]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Browse in private - Computer - Google Chrome Help |url=https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464 |website=support.google.com}}</ref>

=== Targeted advertising ===
{{Main|Targeted advertising}}
Targeted advertising means presenting the user with advertisements that are more relevant to one based on one's browsing history.<ref name=":4">Hennig, Nicole. 2018. “Privacy and security online: best practices for cybersecurity”. ''Library Technology Reports'' 54(3): 1-37.</ref> A typical example is a user receiving advertisements on shoes when browsing other websites after searching for shoes on shopping websites. One research shows that targeted advertising doubles the [[conversion rate]] of classical online advertising.<ref name=":20">{{Cite journal|last=Beales|first=Howard|date=2010|title=The Value of Behavioral Targeting|journal=Network Advertising Initiative}}</ref>

[[Real-time bidding]](RTB) is the method used behind targeted advertising. It is a system that automatically bids up the price for presenting advertisements on certain websites.<ref name=":19" /> Advertisers decide how much they are willing to pay based on the target audience of the websites. Therefore, more information about the users could encourage advertisers to pay higher prices.<ref name=":19" /> The information of users, such as browsing history, is provided to all firms that are involved in the bidding.<ref name=":5">Aguirre, Elizabeth, Dominik Mahr, Dhruv Grewal, Ko de Ruyter, Martin Wetzels. 2015. “Unraveling the Personalization Paradox: The Effect of Information Collection and Trust-Building Strategies on Online Advertisement Effectiveness”. ''Journal of Retailing'' 91(1): 34-49.</ref> Since it is a real-time process, information is usually collected without consent of the user and transferred in unencrypted form.<ref name=":16">Estrada-Jimenez, Jose, Javier Parra-Arnau, Ana Rodriguez-Hoyos, Jordi Forne. 2017. “Online advertising: Analysis of privacy threats and protection approaches”. Computer Communications 100(1): 32-51.</ref> The user has very limited knowledge on how their information is collected, stored, and used.<ref name=":17">Evans, David S. 2009. "The Online Advertising Industry: Economics, Evolution, and Privacy". ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'' 23 (3): 37-60.</ref><ref name=":02">Estrada-Jimenez, Jose, Javier Parra-Arnau, Ana Rodríguez-Hoyos, Jordi Forne. 2019. “On the regulation of personal data distribution in online advertising platforms”. ''Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence'' 82(1): 13-29.</ref>

The response of the user towards targeted advertising depends on whether one knows the information is being collected. If the user already knows that the information is being collected ahead of time, targeted advertisement could potentially create a positive effect, leading to a higher intention of clicking through the link.<ref name=":5" /> However, if the user is not informed about information collection, one would be more concerned with privacy. This will decrease one's intention of clicking through the link.<ref name=":5" /> Meanwhile, when the user considers the website as reliable, it is more possible for them to click through the link and accept the personalization service.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":1">Chellap, Ramnath K., Raymond G. Sin. 2005. “Personalization versus Privacy: An Empirical Examination yes of the Online Consumer’s Dilemma”. ''Information Technology Management'' 6(1): 181-202.  </ref>

To solve the conflicts between privacy and profits, one newly proposed system is pay-per-tracking. A broker exists between users and advertisers. Users could decide whether to provide their personal information to the broker, and then the broker would send the personal information offered by users to advertisers. Meanwhile, users could receive monetary rewards for sharing their personal information. This could help protect privacy and tracking efficiency, but would lead to extra cost.<ref name=":6">Parra-Arnau, Javier. 2017. “Pay-per-tracking: A collaborative masking model for web browsing”. ''Information Sciences'' 385-386(1): 96-124.</ref>

=== Personalized pricing ===
{{Main|Personalized pricing}}
Personalized pricing is based on the idea that if a user purchases a certain product frequently or pays a higher price for that product, the user could be charged a higher price for this product. Web browsing history could give reliable predictions on the purchasing behaviors of users. When using personalized pricing, profit of firms could increase 12.99% compared to [[status quo]] cases.<ref name=":7">Shiller, Benjamin Reed. 2020. “Approximating purchase propensities and reservation prices from broad consumer tracking”. ''International Economic Review'' 61(2): 847-870.</ref>

=== Research ===

Web browsing history could be used to facilitate research, such as revealing the browsing behavior of people. When a user browses extensively on one site, the probability of requesting an additional page decreases. When a user visits more sites, the likelihood of requesting extra pages reduces.<ref name=":18">Bucklin, Randolph E., Catarina Sismeiro. 2003. “A Model of Web Site Browsing Behavior Estimated on Clickstream Data”. ''Journal of Marketing Research'' 40(3): 249-267.</ref>

Web browsing history could also be used to create personal web libraries. Personal web library is created by collecting and analyzing the web browsing history of the user. It could help the user to notice browsing trends, time distribution, and most frequently used websites. Some users regard this function as helpful.<ref name=":8" />

== Privacy ==

=== Concerns ===
Web browsing history stored locally is not published anywhere publicly by default. However, almost all the websites are tracked by [[Adware|adwares]] and [[Potentially unwanted program|potentially unwanted programs]] (PUPs) which collect users' information without their consents.<ref name=":9">Urban, Tobias, Dennis Tatang, Thorsten Holz, Norbert Pohlmann. 2019. “Analyzing leakage of personal information by malware”. ''Journal of Computer Security'' 27(4): 459-481.</ref> These tracking methods are usually allowed by platforms by default.<ref name=":16" /> Web browsing history is also collected by cookies on websites, which could be divided into two kinds, [[First-party cookie|first-party cookies]] and [[third-party cookies]]. Third-party cookies are usually embedded on first-party websites and collect information from them.<ref name=":19">Binns, Reuben, and Elettra Bietti. 2020. “Dissolving Privacy, One Merger at a Time: Competition, Data and Third Party Tracking”. ''Computer Law & Security Review: The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice'' 16(1): 1-19.</ref> Third-party cookies have higher efficiency and data aggregation ability over first-party cookies. While first-party cookies only have access to user's data on one website, third-party cookies could combine data collected from different websites to make the image of the user more complete.<ref name=":19" /> Meanwhile, several third-party cookies could exist on the same website.<ref name=":19" />

With enough information available, users could be identified without log into their account.<ref name=":10">Puglisi, Silvia, David Rebollo-Monedero, Jordi Forne. 2017. “On web user tracking of browsing patterns for personalised advertising”. ''International Journal of Parallel, Emergent & Distributed Systems'' 32(5): 502-521.</ref>

When third-party cookies collect web browsing history of users from multiple websites, more information leads to more privacy concerns. For example, a user browses news on one website and searches for medical information on the other website. When the web browsing history from these two websites are combined, the user may be considered as interested in news related to medical topics.<ref name=":19" /> When browsing history from different websites are combined, it could reflect a more complete image of the person. 

=== Scandals ===
[[File:Avast_Software_logo_2016.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Avast_Software_logo_2016.svg|thumb|Logo of Avast]]
In 2006, [[AOL search data leak|AOL]] released a large amount of data of its users, including search history. Although no user IDs or names was included, users could be identified based on the browsing history released.<ref name=":21">{{Cite news|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|date=Aug 9, 2006|title=AOL apologizes for release of user search data|work=CNET|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/aol-apologizes-for-release-of-user-search-data/|access-date=Nov 27, 2020}}</ref> For example, user No. 4417749 was identified with her search history over three months.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|last=Barbaro|first=Michael|last2=Zeller Jr.|first2=Tom|date=Aug 9, 2006|title=A Face Is Exposed for AOL Searcher No. 4417749|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/technology/09aol.html|access-date=Nov 27, 2020}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Avast]], a popular antivirus software, has been accused of selling browsing history to third parties. It is under preliminary investigation of this accusation by officials of Czech Republic. The report shows that Avast sold users' data through Jumpshot, a marketing analytics tool. Avast claimed that users' personal information was not included in the leak. However, browsing history could be used to identify users. Avast shot down Jumpshot as a reply to this issue.<ref name=":23">{{Cite news|last=Morris|first=Chris|date=Feb 13, 2020|title=Popular antivirus software Avast under investigation for selling user browsing histories|work=Fortune|url=https://fortune.com/2020/02/12/free-antivirus-software-avast-selling-user-browsing-histories/|access-date=Nov 27, 2020}}</ref>

=== Protection ===
When the user feels there is a risk in privacy, one's intention of disclosing personal information will be lower, but the actions are not affected.<ref name=":11">Norberg, Patricia A., Daniel R.Horne, and David A. Horne. 2007. “The Privacy Paradox: Personal Information Disclosure Intentions versus Behaviors”. ''The Journal of Consumer Affairs'' 41(1): 100-126.</ref> However, some studies finds that there is no significant difference between the intention and the actions of disclosing privacy information, meaning the user will reduce actions of sharing personal information and take more protection measures when feeling concerned about privacy.<ref name=":3">Baruh, Lemi, Ekin Secinti, Zeynep Cemalcilar. 2017. “Online Privacy Concerns and Privacy Management: A Meta-Analytical Review”. ''Journal of Communication'' 67(1): 26-53.</ref> When users have privacy concerns, they would make fewer use of online services.<ref name=":3" /> They would also make more protection measurements such as refusing to offer their information, offering false information, removing their information online, and complaining to people around them or to relevant organizations.<ref name=":12">Son, Jai-Yeol, Sung S. Kim. 2008. “Internet Users' Information Privacy-Protective Responses: A Taxonomy and a Nomological Model”. ''MIS Quarterly'' 32(3): 503-529.</ref>

However, it is hard for users to protect their privacy due to multiple reasons. First, users do not have enough privacy awareness. They are not concerned about being tracked unless there are substantial impacts on them. They are also not aware of how their personal data contains commercial values.<ref name=":16" /> It is generally difficult for users to notice privacy policy links on all kinds of websites, with female users and older users are more likely to ignore these notices. Even when users notice privacy links, their information disclosure may not be affected.<ref name=":13">Rodríguez-Priego, Nuria, Rene van Bavel, Shara Monteleone. 2016. “The disconnection between privacy notices and information disclosure: an online experiment”. ''Economia Politica: Journal of Analytical and Institutional Economics'' 33(3): 433-461.</ref> In addition, users are also not equipped with enough technical knowledge to protect themselves even when they notice privacy leakage. They are placed on the passive side with little room to change the situation.<ref name=":16" />

Most users make use of [[Ad blocking|ad blockers]], delete cookies, avoid websites that collect personal information to try to protect their web browsing history from being collected.<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":2">Wills, Craig H., Mihajlo Zeljkovic. 2011. “A personalized approach to web privacy: awareness, attitudes and actions”. ''Information Management & Computer Security'' 19(1) 53-73.</ref> However, most ad blockers do not offer enough guidance to users to help them improve their privacy awareness. More importantly, they rely on standard [[Blacklisting|black]] and [[Whitelisting|white list]].<ref name=":14">Malandrino, Delfina, Vittorio Scarano. 2013. “Privacy leakage on the Web: Diffusion and countermeasures”. ''Computer Networks'' 57(14): 2833-2855.</ref> These lists do not usually include the websites that are tracking users. Ad blockers could only be effective if these tracking domains are blocked.<ref name=":15">Ahmad, Bashir Muhammad, Wilson Christo. 2018. “Diffusion of User Tracking Data in the Online Advertising Ecosystem”. ''Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies'' 2018(4): 85-103.</ref>
