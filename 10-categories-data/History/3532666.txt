==Biography==
Yuval Aviof (later Juval Aviv) was born in [[Kfar Menachem]] on February 24, 1947 as Yuval Aviof.<ref name=Melman/> He received his master's degree from [[Tel Aviv University]]. Aviof served as a major in [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel's Defence Force]] and [[Mossad]] from 1968 to 1979. According to the Herald Sun, he participated in Mossad secret service operations in many countries.<ref>Wesley, Johnson. "Black `Hiding Millions'," ''Herald Sun'' (Melbourne) (n.d.): Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 2 Dec. 2011.</ref>

==Business career==
Aviv is president and CEO of Interfor, an international investigative and intelligence firm, according to the ''[[ABA Banking Journal]]''.<ref>"A Look Ahead At The ABA Banking Leaders Forum And Annual Convention," ''ABA Banking Journal'' 99.8 (2007): 15. Business Source Elite. Web. 2 Dec. 2011.</ref> He has investigated cases such as the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] for clients [[Gen Re|US Aviation]] and [[Pan American World Airways]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Taking a Hard Line Amid The Wreckage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/06/business/taking-a-hard-line-amid-the-wreckage.html?scp=7&sq=Juval%20Aviv&st=cse&pagewanted=2|work=[[The New York Times]]|first1=Adam|last1=Bryant|first2=Barry|last2=Meier|date= October 6, 1996|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

Aviv was employed by [[Pan Am]] in 1989 to investigate who had bombed [[Pan Am Flight 103]]. He says that he received the information from people who were involved directly and indirectly. In his report, he claimed that US agents had been monitoring a [[heroin]]-smuggling route operating from the Middle East to the United States, which was run by a Syrian criminal.

Aviv said that the Syrians had ties to [[Hezbollah]] militants who were holding Westerners hostage in Beirut. According to Aviv, US agents agreed to allow the heroin smuggling to continue in return for help in freeing the hostages. At some point Turkish extremists, who worked at [[Frankfurt Airport]] as [[baggage handler]]s, swapped a suitcase of heroin for a bomb.

The [[Pan Am Flight 103#Epilogue from PCAST|President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism]] examined these  allegations in 1989 and found "no foundation for speculation in press accounts that U.S. government officials had participated tacitly or otherwise in any supposed operation at Frankurt Airport having anything to do with the sabotage of Flight 103."<ref name=Emerson>[[Steven Emerson]]. [http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1314 "PanAm Scam"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230035013/http://ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1314 |date=2007-12-30 }}, ''American Journalism Review'', September 1992.</ref>

After the Interfor report was released, Aviv was described by diplomatic and intelligence officials as "a fabricator who had lied about his entire background." Later, Aviv stated, "I was never told directly that [my report] was wrong, I was always attacked as the messenger, as somebody who was a fabricator, a lunatic, whatever." [[American RadioWorks]], the national documentary unit of [[American Public Media]], looked into allegations that Aviv had never been employed by the [[FBI]] or Mossad. They found  several documents, including a memo from the FBI from 1982 and an informant agreement between Aviv and the [[US Justice Department]], which refer to a past association with Israeli intelligence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shadow Over Lockerbie |publisher=American Radio Works|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/lockerbie/resources/story_aviv.html}}</ref>
He has been used as a source by publications such as the ''[[New York Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|title=Business Travel; The nation's airline security system continues to come up short in its basic responsibility|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/07/business/business-travel-nation-s-airline-security-system-continues-come-up-short-its.html?scp=3&sq=Juval%20Aviv&st=cse|work=The New York Times|first=Joe|last=Sharkey|date=November 7, 2001|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref> and by news networks [[Fox News Channel]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWpKBD3nLEU}}</ref> and [[ABC News]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8ZLG7c4Aso}}</ref>

==Involvement in ''Vengeance''==
In 1981, Canadian writer [[George Jonas]] was approached by Collins Canada about meeting with Aviv, who claimed to have been involved in [[Operation Wrath of God]], an operation to assassinate the Palestinian militants who carried out the 1972 [[Munich massacre]], in which they took hostage and killed 11 Israeli athletes.<ref name=Jonas>[[George Jonas]] [http://www.georgejonas.ca/recent_writing.cfm?id=382 "The Spielberg Massacre"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928014642/http://www.georgejonas.ca/recent_writing.cfm?id=382 |date=2011-09-28 }}, ''Macleans'', January 7, 2006.</ref> In a joint deal, two Toronto-based publishing houses, [[Lester & Orpen Dennys]] and [[Collins Canada]] Ltd, commissioned Jonas to research and write Aviv's account.<ref name="Jonas"/>

''Vengeance'' (1984) depicted Aviv's character as "Avner", though that is in dispute.<ref>[http://www.georgejonas.ca/book.cfm?id=16 Description of ''Vengeance'' on Jonas's website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124051015/http://www.georgejonas.ca/book.cfm?id=16 |date=2011-11-24 }}.</ref><ref name="Village">{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2007/10/16/secret-agent-schmuck/ |title=Secret Agent Schmuck |last=Thompson |first1=Chris |newspaper=Village Voice |date=October 16, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629234711/https://www.villagevoice.com/2007/10/16/secret-agent-schmuck/ |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to ''Maclean's'', which put together an 11-person investigative team to find out whether Aviv's story was true, the book generated $500,000 in advance foreign sales.<ref name=Miller/> After his book was published, Jonas told a journalist for ''[[Maclean's]]'' that he had spent two years and $30,000 of the publishers' money conducting research  in Europe and Israel.<ref name=Miller>Robert Miller. "The 'Vengeance' Affair," ''Macleans'', May 7, 1984.</ref> American RadioWorks, the national documentary unit of [[American Public Media]], looked into the allegations as well and noted several court documents, including a memo from the FBI from 1982 and an informant agreement between Aviv and the US Justice Department, both of which refer to a past association with Israeli intelligence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shadow Over Lockerbie|url=http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/lockerbie/resources/story_aviv.html}}</ref>

In 1984, Jonas, Louise Dennys, and the president of Collins Canada, Nicholas Harris, told ''Maclean's'' they were satisfied that the story was genuine.<ref name=Miller/> Jonas told Maclean's: "To my mind, if he [Aviv] is not legit, then he can only be a disgruntled ex-employee of Mossad with sufficient knowledge of what has gone down in this area. As far as I am concerned, if he is not who he says he is, then that is what he is."<ref name=Miller/>

In 1986, the book was adapted as a made-for-television movie, ''[[Sword of Gideon]]'', starring [[Steven Bauer]] and [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092038/ "Sword of Gideon"], IMDb.</ref> The book was also turned into a 2005 feature film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Eric Bana]], [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]].<ref>Schickel, Richard, and Desa Philadelphia. "SPIELBERG TAKES ON TERROR. (Cover Story)," ''TIME Magazine'', 166.24 (2005): 64-68. Academic Search Premier. Web. 2 Dec. 2011.</ref><ref name=Melman>[[Yossi Melman]]. [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=596350 "Spielberg could be on the wrong track"], ''Haaretz'', July 6, 2005.</ref>

The book ''The Men Who Would Be King: An Almost Epic Tale of Moguls, Movies, and a Company Called DreamWorks'' claims that  [[Steven Spielberg]] vetted Aviv during pre-production on the movie, ''Munich'' (2005). Spielberg assembled a brain trust of researchers and, through his connections at the White House and a Middle East diplomat, determined that, "His real name was Juval Aviv. Furthermore, Spielberg's brain trust discovered FBI files proving that he and his team were not fictitious."<ref name=Laporte>{{cite book|first=Nicole|last=Laporte|title=The Men Who Would Be King: An Almost Epic Tale of Moguls, Movies, and a Company Called DreamWorks|url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/catalog/titledetail.cfm?titleNumber=1048891&searchString=The%20Men%20Who%20Would%20Be%20King}}</ref>
