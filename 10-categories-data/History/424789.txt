'''Cultural history''' combines the approaches of [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to look at [[popular culture|popular cultural]] traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. It examines the records and [[narrative]] descriptions of past matter, encompassing the continuum of events (occurring in succession and leading from the past to the present and even into the future) pertaining to a culture.

Cultural history records and interprets past events involving human beings through the [[social]], [[cultural]], and [[political]] [[Social environment|milieu]] of or relating to [[the arts]] and manners that a group favors. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897) helped found cultural history as a discipline. Cultural history studies and interprets the record of [[human societies]] by denoting the various distinctive ways of living built up by a group of people under consideration. Cultural history involves the aggregate of past cultural activity, such as [[ceremony]], class in practices, and the interaction with locales.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Description==
Many current cultural historians claim it to be a new approach, but cultural history was referred to by nineteenth-century historians such as the Swiss scholar of Renaissance history Jacob Burckhardt.<ref>[https://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/516/889 "Historicising Historical Theory’s History of Cultural Historiography"]. Alison M. Moore, ''Cosmos & History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy'', 12 (1), February 2016, 257-291.</ref>
 
Cultural history overlaps in its approaches with the French movements of ''[[histoire des mentalités]]'' (Philippe Poirrier, 2004) and the so-called new history, and in the U.S. it is closely associated with the field of [[American studies]]. As originally conceived and practiced by 19th Century Swiss historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]] with regard to the [[Italian Renaissance]], cultural history was oriented to the study of a particular historical period in its entirety, with regard not only for its painting, sculpture and architecture, but for the economic basis underpinning society, and the social institutions of its daily life as well.<ref>[[Siegfried Giedion]], ''Space, Time and Architecture'' (6th ed.), p 3.</ref> Echoes of Burkhardt's approach in the 20th century can be seen in [[Johan Huizinga]]'s ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919).<ref>See {{cite journal |first=Sean Farrell |last=Moran |title=Johan Huizinga, ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'', and the Writing of History |journal=Michigan Academician |volume=42 |year=2016 |issue=3 |pages=410–22 |doi=10.7245/0026-2005-43.3.410 }}</ref>

Most often the focus is on phenomena shared by non-elite groups in a society, such as: [[carnival]], [[festival]], and public [[ritual]]s; [[performance]] traditions of [[Narrative|tale]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and other verbal forms; cultural evolutions in human relations (ideas, sciences, arts, techniques); and cultural expressions of social movements such as [[nationalism]]. Also examines main historical concepts as [[power (sociology)|power]], [[ideology]], [[Social class|class]], [[culture]], [[cultural identity]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[perception]] and new historical methods as narration of body. Many studies consider adaptations of traditional culture to [[mass media]] (television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.), from [[Printing|print]] to [[film]] and, now, to the [[Internet]] (culture of [[capitalism]]). Its modern approaches come from [[art history]], [[Annales School|Annales]], [[Marxist]] school, [[microhistory]] and new cultural history.<ref>What Became of Cultural Historicism in the French Reclamation of Strasbourg After World War One? French History and Civilization 5, 2014, 1-15</ref>

Common theoretical [[touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]]s for recent cultural history have included: [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s formulation of the [[public sphere]] in ''The Structural Transformation of the Bourgeois Public Sphere''; [[Clifford Geertz]]'s notion of '[[thick description]]' (expounded in, for example, ''The Interpretation of Cultures''); and the idea of [[memory]] as a cultural-historical category, as discussed in [[Paul Connerton]]'s ''How Societies Remember''.

===Historiography and the French Revolution===
The area where new-style cultural history is often pointed to as being almost a [[paradigm]] is the '[[Historical revisionism|revisionist]]' history of the [[French Revolution]], dated somewhere since [[François Furet]]'s massively influential 1978 essay ''Interpreting the French Revolution''. The 'revisionist interpretation' is often characterised as replacing the allegedly dominant, allegedly [[Marxist]], 'social interpretation' which locates the causes of the Revolution in class dynamics. The revisionist approach has tended to put more emphasis on '[[political culture]]'. Reading ideas of political culture through Habermas' conception of the public sphere, historians of the Revolution in the past few decades have looked at the role and position of cultural themes such as [[gender]], [[ritual]], and [[ideology]] in the context of pre-revolutionary French political culture.

Historians who might be grouped under this umbrella are [[Roger Chartier]], [[Robert Darnton]], [[Patrice Higonnet]], [[Lynn Hunt]], Keith Baker, Joan Landes, Mona Ozouf and [[Sarah Maza]]. Of course, these scholars all pursue fairly diverse interests, and perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the paradigmatic nature of the new history of the French Revolution. Colin Jones, for example, is no stranger to cultural history, [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], or Marxism, and has persistently argued that the Marxist interpretation is not dead, but can be revivified; after all, Habermas' logic was heavily indebted to a Marxist understanding. Meanwhile, Rebecca Spang has also recently argued that for all its emphasis on difference and newness, the 'revisionist' approach retains the idea of the French Revolution as a watershed in the history of (so-called) [[modernity]], and that the problematic notion of 'modernity' has itself attracted scant attention.

==Cultural studies==
''[[Cultural studies]]'' is an academic discipline popular among a diverse group of scholars.  It combines [[political economy]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], and [[art history]]/[[art criticism|criticism]] to study [[culture|cultural]] phenomena in various societies.  Cultural studies researchers often concentrate on how a particular phenomenon relates to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].  The term was coined by [[Richard Hoggart]] in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]. It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who succeeded Hoggart as Director.

== Cultural history in popular culture ==

The [[BBC]] has produced and broadcast a number of educational television programmes on different aspects of human cultural history: in 1969 ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'', in 1973 ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'', in 1985 ''[[The Triumph of the West]]'' and in 2012 ''[[Andrew Marr's History of the World]]''.
