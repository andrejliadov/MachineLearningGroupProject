Hawaiian islands undergo a systematic pattern of submarine and subaerial growth that is followed by erosion. An island's stage of development reflects its distance from the [[Hawaii hotspot]].

==Background==
[[File:Hawaii hotspot.jpg|500px|right|The characteristic "V" shape, a separation between the older Emperor and newer Hawaiian sections, is easily visible in this image|thumb]]
The Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain is remarkable for its length and its number of volcanoes. The chain is split into two subsections across a break, separating the older Emperor Seamount Chain from the younger Hawaiian Ridge; the V-shaped bend of the chain is easily noticeable on maps.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> The volcanoes are progressively younger to the southeast; the oldest dated volcano, located at the northern end, is 81 million years old. The break between the two subchains is 43 million years; in comparison, the oldest of the principal islands, [[Kauai|Kauaʻi]], is little more than 5 million years.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

The "assembly line" that forms the volcanoes is driven by a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], a plume of [[magma]] deep within the Earth producing [[lava]] at the surface. As the [[Pacific Plate]] moves in a west-northwest direction, each volcano moves with it away from its place of origin above the hotspot. The age and location of the volcanoes are a record of the direction, rate of movement, and orientation of the [[Pacific Plate]]. The pronounced 43-million-year-old break separating the Hawaiian Ridge from the Emperor Chain marks a dramatic change in direction of plate movement.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> Initial, deeper-water volcanic eruptions are characterized by [[pillow lava]], so named for their shape, while shallow-water eruptions tend to be composed mainly of [[volcanic ash]]. Once the volcano is high enough so as to eliminate interference from water, its lava flows become those of ropey [[Lava#Pāhoehoe|pāhoehoe]] and blocky [[Lava#ʻAʻā|ʻAʻā]] lava.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

Our current understanding of the process of evolution originates from the first half of the 20th century. The understanding of the process was advanced by frequent observation of volcanic eruptions, study of contrasting rock types, and reconnaissance mapping. More recently our understanding has been aided by geophysical studies, offshore submersible studies, the advent of radioactive dating, advances in petrology and geochemistry, advanced surveillance and monitoring, and detailed geological studies.<ref name="USGS-149">''USGS'', pg. 149 (digital pg. 167)</ref> The ratio of [[magnesium]] to [[silica]] in the lava is a sign of what stage the volcano is in, as over time the volcano's lavas shift from [[Alkali basalt|alkalic]] to [[Tholeiitic basalt|tholeiitic]] lava, and then back to alkalic.<ref name="USGS-149" />

Although volcanism and erosion are the chief factors in the growth and erosion of a volcano, other factors are also involved. Subsidence is known to occur. Changes in sea level, occurring mostly during the [[Pleistocene]], have caused drastic changes; an example is the breakup of [[Maui Nui]], initially a seven-volcano island, which was transformed into five islands as a result of subsidence. High rainfall due to the [[trade wind]] effect impacts on the severity of erosion on many of the major volcanoes. Coastline collapses, a notable part of the history of many of the Hawaiian volcanoes, are often devastating and destroy large parts of the volcanoes.<ref name="USGS-149" />

==Submarine preshield stage==

When a volcano is created near the Hawaiian hotspot, it begins its growth in the submarine preshield stage, characterized by infrequent, typically low volume eruptions. The volcano is steep-sided, and it usually has a defined [[caldera]] and has two or more [[rift zone]]s radiating from the summit. The type of lava erupted in this stage of activity is [[alkali]] [[basalt]].<ref name="Book">{{Cite book

}}</ref> Due to stretching forces, the development of two or more [[rift zone]]s is common. The lava accumulates in a shallow magma storage reservoir.<ref name="USGS-Poster">{{cite web|url=http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/i-map/i2809/i2809.pdf|title=Hawaii's Volcanoes Revealed|work=USGS Poster|publisher=[[USGS]]|accessdate=2009-03-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026010925/http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/I-map/i2809/i2809.pdf|archivedate=2004-10-26}}</ref>

Because the eruptions occur with the volcano underwater, the form of lava typically erupted is [[pillow lava]]. Pillow lava is rounded balls of lava that was given very little time to cool due to immediate exposure to water. Water pressure prevents the lava from exploding upon contact with the cold ocean water, forcing it to simmer and solidify quickly. This stage is thought to last about 200,000 years, but lavas erupted during this stage make up only a tiny fraction of the final volume of the volcano.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> As time progresses, eruptions become stronger and more frequent.

The only example of a Hawaiian volcano in this stage is [[Loihi Seamount|Lō]][[Oahu|{{okina}}]]<nowiki/>ihi Seamount, which is thought to be transitioning from the submarine preshield stage into the submarine phase of the shield stage.  All older volcanoes have had their preshield stage lavas buried by younger lavas, so everything that is known about this stage comes from research done on Lō[[Oahu|{{okina}}]]<nowiki/>ihi Seamount.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

==Shield stages==
The shield stage of the volcano is subdivided into three phases: the submarine, explosive, and subaerial. During this stage of growth, the volcano accumulates about 95 percent of its mass and it takes on the "shield" shape that [[shield volcano]]es are named for. It is also the stage at which the volcano's eruptive frequency reaches its peak.<ref name="Book" />

===Submarine phase===
As eruptions become more and more frequent at the end of the preshield stage, the composition of the lava erupted from the Hawaiian volcano changes from alkalic basalt to [[tholeiitic basalt]] and the volcano enters the submarine phase of the shield stage. In this phase, the volcano continues to erupt pillow lava. Calderas form, fill, and reform at the volcano's summit and the rift zones remain prominent. The volcano builds its way up to sea level. The submarine phase ends when the volcano is only shallowly submerged.<ref name="Book" />

The only example of a volcano in this stage is Lō[[Oahu|{{okina}}]]<nowiki/>ihi Seamount, which is now transitioning into this phase from the preshield stage.

===Explosive phase===
[[File:Limu o Pele.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Lava bubbles explosively as it hits the cold water.]]
This volcanic phase, so named for the explosive reactions with lava that take place, begins when the volcano just breaches the surface. The pressure and instantaneous cooling of being underwater stops, replaced instead by contact with air. Lava and seawater make intermittent contact, resulting in a lot of steam.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> The change in environment also engenders a change in lava type, and the lava from this stage is mostly fragmented into volcanic ash. These explosive eruptions continue intermittently for several hundred thousand years.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> Calderas continually develop and fill, and rift zones remain prominent. The phase ends when the volcano has sufficient mass and height (about {{convert|1000|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above sea level) that the interaction between sea water and erupting lava fades away.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

===Subaerial phase===
Once a volcano has added enough mass and height to end frequent contact with water, the [[subaerial]] substage begins. During this stage of activity, the explosive eruptions become much less frequent and the nature of the eruptions become much more gentle. Lava flows are a combination of pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> It is during this stage, that the low-profile "[[shield]]" shape of Hawaiian volcanoes is formed, named for the shape of a warrior's shield.<ref name="Book" /> Eruption rates and frequencies peak, and about 95% of the volcano's eventual volume forms during a period of roughly 500,000 years.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

The lava erupted in this stage form flows of pāhoehoe or ʻaʻā. During this subaerial stage, the flanks of the growing volcanoes are unstable and as a result, large [[landslide]]s may occur. At least 17 major landslides have occurred around the major Hawaiian islands. This stage is arguably the most well-studied, as all eruptions that occurred in the 20th century on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]] were produced by volcanoes in this phase.<ref name="Book" />

[[Mauna Loa]] and [[Kilauea|Kīlauea]] volcanoes are in this phase of activity.

==Postshield stage==

[[File:Hualalai from north.jpg|right|260px|The dark outline of [[Hualālai]], showing the worn and weathered shape of a volcano in the Post-shield stage.|thumb]]

As the volcano reaches the end of the shield stage, the volcano goes through another series of changes as it enters the postshield stage. The type of lava erupted changes from tholeiitic basalt back to alkalic basalt and eruptions become slightly more explosive.<ref name="Book" /> Results from the [[Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project]] confirm that the eruption rates of the postshield stage volcanoes started decreasing between 600 and 400 thousand years (ka) ago.<ref name="PowerPoint Prez">{{cite web|url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Chapman/ChapmanPresentations/rhodes_chapman.ppt|title=Geochemical Arguments Favoring a Hawaiian Plume|first=J.

Eruptions in the postshield stage cap the volcano with a carapace of lava, containing low silica and high alkali contents, the reverse of the stage before it. Some Hawaiian volcanoes diverge from this, however. Lava is erupted as stocky, pasty {{okina}}a{{okina}}ā flows along with a lot of [[cinder]].<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> Caldera development stops, and the rift zones become more inactive. The new lava flows increase the slope grade, as the {{okina}}a{{okina}}ā never reaches the base of the volcano. These lavas commonly fill and overflow the [[caldera]].<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> Eruption rate gradually decreases over a period of about 250,000 years, eventually stopping altogether as the volcano becomes [[dormant volcano|dormant]].<ref name="USGS - Evolution" />

[[Mauna Kea]], [[Hualālai]], and [[Haleakalā]] volcanoes are in this stage of activity.

==Erosional stage==
After the volcano becomes dormant, the forces of [[erosion]] gain control of the mountain. The volcano subsides into the oceanic [[Crust (geology)|crust]] due to its immense weight and loses elevation. Meanwhile, rain also erodes the volcano, creating deeply incised valleys. [[Coral reef]]s grow along the shoreline. The volcano becomes a skeleton of its former self.<ref name="Book" />

[[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]], [[Māhukona]], [[Lanai|Lānaʻi]], and [[Waianae Range|Waiʻanae]] volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development.

==Rejuvenated stage==
After a long period of dormancy and erosion of the surface, the volcano may become active again, entering a final stage of activity called the rejuvenated stage. During this stage, the volcano erupts small volumes of lava very infrequently. These eruptions are often spread out over several millions of years.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> The composition of the lavas erupted in this stage is usually alkalic. The stage commonly occurs between 0.6 and 2 million years after it has entered the weathering cycle.<ref name="Garcia-2005">{{cite paper| first =  Michael O.| last = Garcia |first2=Jackie|last2=Caplan-Auerbanch|first3=Eric H.|last3=De Carlo|first4=M.D.|last4=Kurz|first5=N.|last5=Becker| title = Geology, geochemistry and earthquake history of Lōihi Seamount, Hawaii| journal = Geochemistry | volume = 66 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–108 | version = This is the author's personal version of a paper that was published on 2006-05-16 as "Geochemistry, and Earthquake History of Lōʻihi Seamount, Hawaii's youngest volcano", in ''Chemie der Erde – Geochemistry'' (66) 2:81–108 | publisher = [[SOEST]] | date = 2005-09-20 | doi = 10.1016/j.chemer.2005.09.002 }}</ref>

[[Koʻolau Range]], [[West Maui Mountains|West Maui]], and [[Kahoolawe|Kahoʻolawe]] volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development. Note, however, that because in this stage eruptions are very infrequent (occurring thousands or even tens of thousands of years apart), erosion is still the primary factor controlling the volcano's development.

==Extinct stage==
After the rejuvenated stage, the volcano is too far away from the hotspot to receive new magma, and therefore will never erupt again. The volcano continues to sink into the ocean and become deeply eroded, leading to infrequent but large collapses in its original structure. The volcano has no remaining magma in its chambers, and is truly dead.

[[West Molokai Volcano|West Molokaʻi]], [[Mount Waialeale|Waiʻaleʻale]], and [[Niihau|Niʻihau]] volcanoes are in this stage of development.

==Coral atoll stage==
[[File:Coral atoll formation animation.gif|400px|thumb|right|An animated sequence showing the erosion and subsidence of a volcano, and the formation of a [[coral reef]] around it – eventually resulting in an [[atoll]].]]
Eventually, erosion and subsidence break the volcano down to sea level. At this point, the volcano becomes an atoll, with a ring of [[coral]] and sand islands surrounding a [[lagoon]]. All the Hawaiian islands west of the [[Gardner Pinnacles]] in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] are in this stage.

==Guyot stage==
Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical [[marine organism]]s, so this island type is only found in warm [[Tropical|tropical waters]]. Eventually, the [[Pacific Plate]] carries the volcanic atoll into waters too cold for these marine organisms to maintain a [[coral reef]] by growth.<ref name="USGS - Evolution" /> Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of reef-building organisms become seamounts as they subside and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean water temperatures are just sufficiently warm for upward reef growth to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the Darwin point.<ref name="Book" /> Islands in more northerly [[latitude]]s evolve towards seamounts or guyots; islands closer to the [[equator]] evolve towards [[Atoll|atolls]] (see [[Kure Atoll]]).

After the reef dies, the volcano subsides or erodes below sea level and becomes a coral-capped seamount. These flat-topped seamounts are called [[guyot]]s. Most, if not all, the volcanoes west of Kure Atoll as well as most, if not all, the volcanoes in the [[Emperor Seamount]] chain are guyots or [[seamount]]s.<ref name="Book" />

==Other patterns==
Not all Hawaiian volcanoes go through all of these stages of activity. An example is Koʻolau Range on [[Oahu|Oʻahu]], which was prehistorically devastated by a cataclysmic [[landslide]], never underwent the postshield stage and went dormant for hundreds of thousands of years after the shield stage before coming back to life. Some volcanoes never made it above sea level; there is no evidence to suggest that [[West Molokai]] went through the rejuvenated stage, while its younger neighbors, [[East Molokai]] and [[West Maui]], have evidently done so. It is currently unknown what stage of development the submerged volcano of [[Penguin Bank]] is in.<ref name="Book" />

==Application to other groups==
In recent years research at other seamounts, for instance [[Jasper Seamount]], has confirmed that the Hawaiian model applies to other seamounts as well.<ref name="ocea-jasper">{{cite journal|first1=Jasper G.|last1=Konter|first2=Hubert|last2=Staudigel|first3=Jeffry|last3=Gee|title=Spotlight 2: Jasper Seamount|journal=[[Oceanography (journal)|Oceanography]]|volume=23|series=Seamounts Special Issue|issue=1|url=http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/23_1/23-1_konter.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2010|publisher=[[Oceanography Society]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613134055/http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/issue_pdfs/23_1/23-1_konter.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2010}}</ref>
