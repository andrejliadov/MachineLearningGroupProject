== Bronze Age and Early Iron Age ==

{{for|earlier events|Timeline of human prehistory}}
The [[Bronze Age]] was the period in human cultural development when the most advanced metalworking (at least in systematic and widespread use) included techniques for [[smelting]] [[copper]] and [[tin]] from naturally-occurring outcroppings of copper ores, and then combining those ores to cast bronze. These naturally-occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before 3000 BC. In some parts of the world, a [[Copper Age]] follows the [[Neolithic]] and precedes the Bronze Age.

The [[Iron Age]] was the stage in the development of any people in which tools and weapons whose main ingredient was iron were prominent. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in some past societies often including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, although this was not always the case.

==End of ancient history in Europe==
The date used as the end of the ancient era is arbitrary. The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the [[Early Middle Ages]] is known as [[Late Antiquity]]. Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages, in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. AD 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]]. The [[Early Middle Ages]] are a period in the history of [[Europe]] following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] spanning roughly five centuries from AD 500 to 1000. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. [[Western culture|Western]] scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in AD 476, the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in AD 565, or the [[coming of Islam]] in AD 632 as the end of [[Classical Antiquity|ancient European history]].
