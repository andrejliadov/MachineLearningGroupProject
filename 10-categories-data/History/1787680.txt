{{Jesus}}
The '''Christ myth theory''' (also known as the '''Jesus myth theory''', '''Jesus mythicism''', or the '''Jesus ahistoricity theory'''){{sfn|Lataster|2015a|ps=none}} is the view that the story of [[Jesus]] is largely fictitious, and has little basis in historical fact.{{sfn|Bromiley|1982|p=1034}} Alternatively, in terms given by [[Bart D. Ehrman|Bart Ehrman]] paraphrasing [[Earl Doherty]], "the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity."{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman_def"}} It is a [[fringe theory]], supported by few [[Academic tenure|academically tenured]] experts in [[biblical studies]] and ancient history.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2003|pp=658, 660}}{{sfn|Burridge|Gould|2004|p=34}}<ref name="Ehrman Blog"/>{{refn|group=q|name="fringe"}} This theory is criticised for its reliance on comparisons between mythologies,{{sfn|Casey|2014|p=284}} and deviates from mainstream views on the [[historicity of Jesus]].

There are three strands of mythicism, including the view that there may have been a historical Jesus, who lived in a dimly remembered past, and was fused with the mythological Christ of Paul. A second stance is that there was never a historical Jesus, only a mythological character, later historicized in the Gospels. A third view is that no conclusion can be made about a historical Jesus, and if there was one, nothing can be known about him.

Most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument:{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=9}} they question the reliability of the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[Gospel]]s to establish the historicity of Jesus; they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second centuries; and they argue that early Christianity had [[Religious syncretism|syncretistic]] and mythological origins, as reflected in both the Pauline epistles and the gospels, with Jesus being a celestial being who was concretized in the Gospels. Therefore, Christianity was not founded on the shared memories of a man, but rather a shared [[mytheme]].

{{Main|Jesus in Christianity|Christology|Origins of Christianity|History of Christianity}}

The [[origins of Christianity|origins]] and rapid rise of Christianity, as well as the historical Jesus and the [[historicity of Jesus]], are a matter of longstanding debate in theological and historical research. While Christianity may have started with an early nucleus of followers of Jesus,{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=174ff}} within a few years after the presumed death of Jesus in {{circa|AD 33}}, at the time [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] started preaching, a number of "Jesus-movements" seem to have been in existence, which propagated divergent interpretations of Jesus' teachings.{{sfn|Mack|1995|ps=none}}{{sfnmp|1a1=King|1y=2008|1p=70|2a1=Behr|2y=2013|2pp=5–6}} A central question is how these communities developed and what their original convictions were,{{sfn|Mack|1995|ps=none}}{{sfn|King|2011|ps=none}} as a wide range of beliefs and ideas can be found in [[early Christianity]], including [[adoptionism]] and [[docetism]],{{refn|group=web|name="Ehrman.2015"}} and also [[gnosticism|Gnostic traditions]] which used Christian imagery,{{sfn|Pagels|1979|pp=1, 196}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=125, 225}} which were all deemed [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] by [[proto-orthodox Christianity]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|ps=none}}{{sfn|Green|2008|p=239}}

=== Quest for the historical Jesus ===
{{Main|Quest for the historical Jesus|Textual criticism|Historical criticism}}

A [[Quest for the historical Jesus#First quest|first quest]] for the historical Jesus took place in the 19th century, when hundreds of ''Lives of Jesus'' were being written. [[David Strauss]] (1808–1874) pioneered the search for the "Historical Jesus" by rejecting all [[supernatural]] events as [[mythical]] elaborations. His 1835 work, ''Life of Jesus'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=David Friedrich|author-link=David Strauss|title=Das leben Jesu: Kritisch bearbeitet|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_vn4sAAAAYAAJ|year=1835|publisher=C.F.

Porter, Brill 2010 {{ISBN|9004163727}} pp. 1170–1172</ref><ref name=Zahl23/>

This first quest ended with [[Albert Schweitzer]]'s 1906 critical review of the history of the search for Jesus's life in ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus – From Reimarus to Wrede''. Already in the 19th and early 20th century, this quest was challenged by authors who denied the historicity of Jesus, notably Bauer and Drews.

The [[Quest for the historical Jesus#Second quest|second quest]] started in 1953, in a departure from Bultmann.<ref name=Edwin1170/><ref name=Zahl23>''The First Christian'' by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 {{ISBN|0802821103}} pp. 23–25</ref> Several criteria, the [[criterion of dissimilarity]] and the [[criterion of embarrassment]], were introduced to analyze and evaluate New Testament narratives. This second quest faded away in the 1970s,<ref name=BenQ9/>{{sfn|Arnal|2005|pp=41–43}} due to the diminishing influence of Bultmann,<ref name=BenQ9/> and coinciding with the first publications of Wells, which marks the onset of the revival of Christ myth theories. According to Paul Zahl, while the second quest made significant contributions at the time, its results are now mostly forgotten, although not disproven.<ref name=Zahl12>''The First Christian: Universal Truth in the Teachings of Jesus'' by Paul F. M. Zahl, Eerdmans 2003 {{ISBN|0802821103}} p. 12</ref>

The [[Quest for the historical Jesus#Third quest|third quest]] started in the 1980s, and introduced new criteria.<ref name=criteria100>''Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research'' by Stanley E. Porter, Bloomsbury 2004 {{ISBN|0567043606}} pp. 100–120</ref><ref name=whois35 /> Primary among these are<ref name=whois35 >''Who Is Jesus?'' by Thomas P.

The third quest yielded new insights into Jesus' Palestinian and Jewish context, and not so much on the person of Jesus himself.{{sfn|Hagner|2011|p=1063}}{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=163}}{{sfn|Bernier|2016|pp=2–3}} It also has made clear that all material on Jesus has been handed down by the emerging Church, raising questions about the criterion of dissimilarity, and the possibility of ascribing material solely to Jesus, and not to the emerging Church.{{sfn|Bernier|2016|p=4}}

=== A historical Jesus existed ===
{{Main|Historicity of Jesus|Historical Jesus|Sources for the historicity of Jesus}}

These critical methods have led to a [[demythologization]] of Jesus. The mainstream scholarly view is that the Pauline epistles and the gospels describe the Christ of faith, presenting a religious narrative which replaced the historical Jesus who did live in 1st-century [[Roman Palestine]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=13}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2014}}{{sfn|Stanton|2002|pp=143ff}}{{sfn|Vermes|2001|pp=ch.8}}{{refn|group=note|Vermes: "By the end of the first century Christianity had lost sight of the real Jesus and of the original meaning of his message. Paul, John and their churches replaced him by the otherworldy Christ of faith."{{sfn|Vermes|2011|pp=ch.8}}}} Yet, that there was a historical Jesus is not in doubt. New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] states that Jesus "certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees".{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=248}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2011|p=285}}

Following the criteria of authenticity-approach, scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus,{{sfn|Powell|2013|p=168}} but the baptism and the crucifixion are two events in the life of Jesus which are subject to "almost universal assent".{{refn|group=note|name="Jesus.Biography"}} According to historian [[Alanna Nobbs]],
{{quote|While historical and theological debates remain about the actions and significance of this figure, his fame as a teacher, and his crucifixion under the Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]], may be described as historically certain.<ref>[[Alanna Nobbs]] and Edwin Judge ap. {{cite web |last=Dickson |first=John|author-link=John Dickson (author)|title=Best of 2012: The irreligious assault on the historicity of Jesus |url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/12/24/3660194.htm |website=ABC Religion and Ethics|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=2 May 2018|date=24 December 2012}}</ref>}}

The [[Portraits of the historical Jesus|portraits of Jesus]] have often differed from each other and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.{{sfn|Ehrman|2011|p=285}}{{sfn|Theissen|Winter|2002|p=5}}{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|ps=none}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lataster, a Christ mythicist, "the only thing New Testament scholars seem to agree on is Jesus' historical existence".{{refn|group=web|name="Lataster2014"}}}} The primary portraits of Jesus [[Portraits of the historical Jesus#Portraits of the Third Quest|resulting from the Third Quest]] are: apocalyptic prophet; charismatic healer; cynic philosopher; Jewish Messiah; and prophet of social change.<ref name=Cradel124>''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by Andreas J.

According to [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], it is not possible "to construct (from the available data) a Jesus who will be the real Jesus".<ref>James D. G. Dunn (2003), ''Jesus Remembered'', Volume 1, {{ISBN|0-8028-3931-2}} pp. 125–126: "the historical Jesus is properly speaking a nineteenth- and twentieth-century construction using the data supplied by the [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptic]] tradition, ''not'' Jesus back then", (the Jesus of Nazareth who walked the hills of Galilee), "and ''not'' a figure in history whom we can realistically use to critique the portrayal of Jesus in the Synoptic tradition".</ref><ref name=Merrigan77>T.

''Jesus research: New methodologies and perceptions: the second Princeton–Prague Symposium on Jesus Research, Princeton 2007'', pp. 77–78: "Dunn points out as well that 'the Enlightenment Ideal of historical objectivity also projected a false goal onto the quest for the historical Jesus', which implied that there was a 'historical Jesus', objectively verifiable, 'who will be different from the dogmatic Christ and the Jesus of the Gospels and who will enable us to criticize the dogmatic Christ and the Jesus of the Gospels' (''Jesus Remembered'', p. 125)."</ref> According to [[Philip R.

=== Demise of authenticity and call for memory studies ===
{{See also|Historical Jesus#Criticism|l1=Criticism of Historical Jesus research|Historiography#Memory studies|l2=Memory studies}}

Since the late 2000s, concerns have been growing about the usefulness of the criteria of authenticity.{{sfn|Keith|Le Donne|2012}}{{sfn|Licona|2016}}{{sfn|Bernier|2016|p=1}}<ref group=web>April DeConinck (2007), [http://aprildeconick.com/forbiddengospels/2007/04/fourth-quest-for-historical-jesus.html ''The Fourth Quest for the Historical Jesus?'']</ref><ref group=web name="Tarico_Fitzgerald_2017">Valerie Tarico & David Fitzgerald (2017), [https://www.rawstory.com/2017/04/evidence-for-jesus-is-weaker-than-you-might-think/ ''Evidence for Jesus is weaker than you might think''], RawStory</ref> According to Keith, the criteria are literary tools, indebted to [[form criticism]], not [[Historiography|historiographic]] tools.{{sfn|Keith|Le Donne|2012|pp=chapter 1}} They were meant to discern pre-Gospel traditions, not to identify historical facts,{{sfn|Keith|Le Donne|2012|pp=chapter 1}} but have "substituted the pre-literary tradition with that of the historical Jesus".{{sfn|Van Eck|2015}} According to Le Donne, the usage of such criteria is a form of "positivist historiography".<ref>Thinkapologtics.com, [https://chab123.wordpress.com/2015/01/08/book-review-jesus-criteria-and-the-demise-of-authenticity-chris-keith-and-anthony-le-donne/ ''Book Review: Jesus, Criteria, and the Demise of Authenticity, by Chris Keith and Anthony Le Donne'']</ref>

Chris Keith, Le Donne, and others{{refn|group=note|Crook 2013; Foster 2012, 2013; Keith 2011; 2012a, 2012b; Rodríguez 2012, 2013); Le Donne (2011; 2012a; 2012b); Schröter (1996; 2012; 2013){{sfn|Van Eck|2015}}}} argue for a "social memory" approach, which states that memories are shaped by the needs of the present. Instead of searching for a historical Jesus, scholarship should investigate how the memories of Jesus were shaped, and how they were reshaped "with the aim of cohesion and the self-understanding (identity) of groups".{{sfn|Van Eck|2015}}

[[James D. G. Dunn]]'s 2003 study, ''Jesus Remembered'', was the onset for this "increased ... interest in memory theory and eyewitness testimony".<ref group=web name="Simpson">Benjamin I. Simpson, review of [https://voice.dts.edu/review/historiographical-jesus-le-donne/ ''The Historiographical Jesus. Memory, Typology, and the Son of David'']</ref><ref group=web>Anthony le Donne (2012), [http://historicaljesusresearch.blogspot.com/2012/11/so-what-is-all-of-this-business-about.html ''So What is All of This Business about “Memory” in Jesus Research?'']</ref> Dunn argues that "[t]he only realistic objective for any 'quest of the historical Jesus' is Jesus ''remembered''."{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=882}} Dunn argues that Christianity started with the impact Jesus himself had on his followers, who passed on and shaped their memories of him in an [[Oral gospel traditions|oral gospel tradition]]. According to Dunn, to understand who Jesus was, and what his impact was, scholars have to look at "the broad picture, focusing on the characteristic motifs and emphases of the Jesus tradition, rather than making findings overly dependent on individual items of the tradition".{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=882}}

Anthony le Donne elaborated on Dunn's thesis, basing "his historiography squarely on Dunn’s thesis that the historical Jesus is the memory of Jesus recalled by the earliest disciples".<ref group=web name="Simpson"/> According to Le Donne, memories are refactored, and not an exact recalling of the past.<ref group=web name="Simpson"/> Le Donne argues that the remembrance of events is facilitated by relating it to a common story or "type". The type shapes the way the memories are retained, c.q. narrated. This means that the Jesus-tradition is not a theological invention of the early Church, but is shaped and refracted by the restraints that the type puts on the narrated memories, due to the mold of the type.<ref group=web name="Simpson"/>

According to Chris Keith, an alternative to the search for a historical Jesus "posits a historical Jesus who is ultimately unattainable, but can be hypothesized on the basis of the interpretations of the early Christians, and as part of a larger process of accounting for how and why early Christians came to view Jesus in the ways that they did". According to Keith, "these two models are methodologically and epistemologically incompatible",  calling into question the methods and aim of the first model.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0142064X16637777|title = The Narratives of the Gospels and the Historical Jesus: Current Debates, Prior Debates and the Goal of Historical Jesus Research| journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament| volume=38| issue=4| pages=426–455|year = 2016|last1 = Keith|first1 = Chris|s2cid = 148040373|url = https://research.stmarys.ac.uk/3459/3/Keith-Narratives-of-the-Gospels-Historical-Jesus.pdf}}</ref>

=== Christ myth theorists ===
Mythicists argue that the accounts of Jesus are to a large extent, or completely, of a mythical nature, questioning the mainstream [[paradigm]] of a historical Jesus in the beginning of the 1st century who was deified. Most mythicists, like mainstream scholarship, note that Christianity developed within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], which was influenced by [[Hellenization#Hellenistic period|Hellenism]]. Early Christianity, and the accounts of Jesus are to be understood in this context. Yet, where contemporary New Testament scholarship has introduced several criteria to evaluate the historicity of New Testament passages and sayings, most Christ myth theorists have relied on [[Comparative mythology|comparisons]] of Christian [[mytheme]]s with contemporary religious traditions, emphasizing the mythological nature of the Bible accounts.{{sfn|Casey|2014}}{{refn|group=note|A notable exception is Robert Price, who has used those same criteria to dissect the Jesus to the "vanishing point".{{sfn|Price|2003}}}}
	 
Some moderate authors, most notably Wells, have argued that there may have been a historical Jesus, but that this historical Jesus was fused with another Jesus-tradition, namely the mythological Christ of Paul.{{sfn|Price|1999|ps=none}}{{sfn|Thompson|Verenna|2012|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="mix.Wells.1999.1999.2009"}} Others, most notably the early Wells and [[Alvar Ellegård]], have argued that Paul's Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past.{{sfn|Price|2009|p=65}}{{sfn|Price|2011|pp=387–388}}{{sfn|Doherty|2012}}
	 
The most radical mythicists hold, in terms given by Price, the "Jesus [[atheism]]" viewpoint, that is, there never was a historical Jesus, only a mythological character, and the [[mytheme]] of his incarnation, death, and exaltation. This character developed out of a [[Religious syncretism|syncretistic fusion]] of Jewish, Hellenistic and Middle Eastern religious thought; was put forward by Paul; and historicised in the Gospels, which are also syncretistic. Notable "atheists" are Paul-Louis Couchoud, Earl Doherty,{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman_def"}} Thomas L. Brodie, and Richard Carrier.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.OHJ"}}{{refn|group=q|name="Doherty.2009.mythical.figure"}}

Some other authors argue for the Jesus [[agnosticism]] viewpoint. That is, whether there was a historical Jesus is unknowable and if he did exist, close to nothing can be known about him.{{sfn|Price|2000|p=17}} Notable "agnosticists" are Robert Price and Thomas L. Thompson.{{sfn|Thompson|2007}}{{sfn|Thompson|2012}} According to Thompson, the question of the historicity of Jesus also is not relevant for the understanding of the meaning and function of the Biblical texts in their own times.{{sfn|Thompson|2007}}{{sfn|Thompson|2012}}

== Overview of main mythicist arguments ==

According to New Testament scholar [[Robert E. Van Voorst|Robert Van Voorst]], most Christ mythicists follow a threefold argument first set forward by German historian [[Bruno Bauer]] in the 1800s: they question the reliability of the Pauline epistles and the Gospels to postulate a historically existing Jesus; they note the lack of information on Jesus in non-Christian sources from the first and early second century; and they argue that early Christianity had syncretistic and mythological origins.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pp=8-9}} More specifically,
* <!-- PAUL --> '''Paul's epistles lack detailed biographical information''' – most mythicists argue that the Pauline epistles are older than the gospels but, aside from a few passages which may have been [[Christian interpolation|interpolations]], there is a complete absence of any detailed biographical information such as might be expected if Jesus had been a contemporary of Paul,{{sfn|Lataster|2016|p=191}} nor do they cite any sayings from Jesus, the so-called argument from silence.{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=22}}{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pp=202-203}}{{refn|group=q|name="argument.from.silence"}} Some mythicists have argued that the Pauline epistles are from a later date than usually assumed, and therefore not a reliable source on the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Detering|1995|p=11}}{{sfn|Price|2011|pages=354ff|ps=&nbsp;[reproduced 2012 {{sfn|Thompson|Verenna|2012|loc=§.

==Mainstream and mythicist views on the arguments ==

===Lack of detailed biographical information in Pauline epistles===

====Dating and attribution====

=====Mainstream view=====
The mainstream view is that the seven undisputed Pauline epistles considered by scholarly consensus to be [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|genuine epistles]] are generally dated to AD 50–60 and are the earliest surviving Christian texts that include information about Jesus.{{sfn|Tuckett|2001|ps=none}}{{refn|group=q|name="Johnson.2010.241"}} Most scholars view the Pauline letters as essential elements in the study of the historical Jesus,{{sfn|Tuckett|2001|ps=none}}<ref name=JRDunn143>''Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making'' by James D. G. Dunn (2003) {{ISBN|0802839312}} p. 143</ref><ref name=McK38>''Jesus Christ in History and Scripture'' by Edgar V.

Wedderburn 2004 (Academic Paperback) {{ISBN|0567083969}} pp. 43–44</ref> and the development of early Christianity.{{sfn|Mack|1995|ps=none}} Yet, scholars have also argued that Paul was a "mythmaker",{{sfn|Maccoby|1986}} who gave his own [[Council of Jerusalem|divergent interpretation]] of the meaning of Jesus,{{sfn|Mack|1995|ps=none}} building a bridge between the Jewish and Hellenistic world,{{sfn|Mack|1995|ps=none}} thereby creating the faith that became Christianity.{{sfn|Maccoby|1986}}

=====Mythicist view=====
Mythicists agree on the importance of the Pauline epistles, some agreeing with this early dating, and taking the Pauline epistles as their point of departure from mainstream scholarship.{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}} They argue that those letters actually point solely into the direction of a celestial or mythical being, or contain no definitive information on an historical Jesus. Some mythicists, though, have questioned the early dating of the epistles, raising the possibility that they represent a later, more developed strand of early Christian thought.

Theologian [[Willem Christiaan van Manen]] of the Dutch school of [[radical criticism]] noted various anachronisms in the Pauline epistles. Van Manen claimed that they could not have been written in their final form earlier than the 2nd century. He also noted that the [[Marcionism|Marcionite school]] was the first to publish the epistles, and that [[Marcion]] ({{circa|85}} – {{circa|160}}) used them as justification for his gnostic and docetic views that Jesus' incarnation was not in a physical body. Van Manen also studied Marcion's version of [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in contrast to the canonical version, and argued that the canonical version was a later revision which de-emphasized the Gnostic aspects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Detering|first1=Hermann|date=1996|title=The Dutch Radical Approach to the Pauline Epistles|url=https://depts.drew.edu/jhc/detering.html|journal=Journal of Higher Criticism|volume=3|issue=2|pages=163–193|access-date=September 2, 2016}}</ref>

Price also argues for a later dating of the epistles, and sees them as a compilation of fragments (possibly with a Gnostic core),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Amazing Colossal Apostle|last1=Price|first1=Robert M.|date=2012|publisher=Signature Books|isbn=978-1-56085-216-2|location=Salt Lake City|page=viii}}</ref> contending that Marcion was responsible for much of the Pauline corpus or even wrote the letters himself. Price criticizes his fellow Christ myth theorists for holding the mid-first-century dating of the epistles for their own apologetical reasons.{{sfn|Price|2011|pages=353ff|ps=&nbsp;[reproduced 2012 {{sfn|Thompson|Verenna|2012|loc=§.

====Lack of biographical information====

=====Mainstream view=====
According to Eddy and Boyd, modern biblical scholarship notes that "Paul has relatively little to say on the biographical information of Jesus", viewing Jesus as "a recent contemporary".{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=202}}{{sfn|Stout|2011|p=64}} Yet, according to Christopher Tuckett, "[e]ven if we had no other sources, we could still infer some things about Jesus from Paul's letters."{{sfn|Tuckett|2001|pp=121–137, esp. 125}}{{refn|group=note|name="Jesus.Biography"}}

=====Mythicist view=====
Wells, a "minimal mythicist", criticized the infrequency of the reference to Jesus in the Pauline letters and has said there is no information in them about Jesus' parents, place of birth, teachings, trial nor crucifixion.<ref name=WellsT49/> Robert Price says that Paul does not refer to Jesus' earthly life, also not when that life might have provided convenient examples and justifications for Paul's teachings. Instead, revelation seems to have been a prominent source for Paul's knowledge about Jesus.{{sfn|Price|2003}}

Wells says that the Pauline epistles do not make reference to [[Oral gospel traditions|Jesus' sayings]], or only in a vague and general sense. According to Wells, as referred to by Price in his own words, the writers of the New Testament "must surely have cited them when the same subjects came up in the situations they addressed".{{sfn|Price|2011}}

===The Gospels are not historical records===
{{Main|The Gospels}}

==== Mainstream view ====
Among contemporary scholars, there is consensus that the gospels are a type of [[ancient biography]],<ref>Stanton, G. H. (2004). ''Jesus and Gospel''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 192.</ref><ref>Burridge, R. A. (2006). Gospels. In J. W. Rogerson & Judith M. Lieu (Eds) ''The Oxford Handbook of Biblical Studies''.

Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans.</ref>{{refn|group=note|See Tekton Apologetics, [http://www.tektonics.org/ntdocdef/gospelbioi.php ''The Gospels as ancient biography''] for an explanation of the genre.}} a genre which was concerned with providing examples for readers to emulate while preserving and promoting the subject's reputation and memory, as well as including [[propaganda]] and ''[[kerygma]]'' (preaching) in their works.{{sfn|Dunn|2005|p=174}}{{refn|group=note|Michael Vines notes that the gospel of Mark may have aspects similar to a Jewish novel,<ref>{{cite book |last=Vines |first=M. E. |year=2002 |title=The Problem of the Markan Genre: The Gospel of Mark and the Jewish Novel |location=Atlanta |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |pages=161–162 |isbn=978-1-5898-3030-1}}</ref> while some scholars have argued that the Gospels are symbolical representations of the Torah, which were written in response to the Roman occupation and the suppression of Jewish religiosity.<ref>Peter J. Tomson (2001), ''If This be from Heaven... Jesus and the New Testament Authors in Their Relationship to Judaism'', Bloomsbury</ref><ref>Dan Lioy (2007), ''Jesus as Torah in John 1–12'', Wipf and Stock Publishers</ref>}}

Biblical scholarship regards the Gospels to be the literary manifestation of oral traditions which originated during the life of a historical Jesus, who according to Dunn had a profound impact on his followers.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|pp=883-884}}

==== Mythicist view ====
Mythicists argue that in the gospels "a fictitious historical narrative" was imposed on the "mythical cosmic savior figure" created by Paul.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=163}} According to Robert Price, the Gospels "smack of fictional composition",{{refn|group=web|name="Price2009"}} arguing that the Gospels are a type of legendary fiction{{sfn|Price|2003|p=21}} and that the story of Jesus portrayed in the Gospels fits the [[Rank-Raglan mythotype|mythic hero archetype]].{{sfn|Price|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pp=137-138}} The mythic hero archetype is present in many cultures who often have miraculous conceptions or virgin births heralded by wise men and marked by a star, are tempted by or fight evil forces, die on a hill, appear after death and then ascend to heaven.{{sfn|Price|2011|p=425}} Some myth proponents suggest that some parts of the New Testament were meant to appeal to [[Gentiles]] as familiar allegories rather than history.{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=97}} According to Earl Doherty, the gospels are "essentially allegory and fiction".{{sfn|Doherty|2009|pp=vii–viii}}

According to Wells, a minimally historical Jesus existed, whose teachings were preserved in the [[Q document]].{{sfn|Wells|1999}} According to Wells, the Gospels weave together two Jesus narratives, namely this Galilean preacher of the Q document, and Paul's mythical Jesus.{{sfn|Wells|1999}} Doherty disagrees with Wells regarding this teacher of the Q-document, arguing that he was an allegorical character who [[Wisdom (personification)|personified Wisdom]] and came to be regarded as the founder of the Q-community.{{sfn|Doherty|1995d}}{{sfn|Doherty|1997}} According to Doherty, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the [[Gospel of Mark]] by a predominantly Gentile community.{{sfn|Doherty|1995d}}

====Mainstream criticism====
Ehrman notes that the gospels are based on oral sources, which played a decisive role in attracting new converts.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=261}}

Christian theologians have cited the mythic hero archetype as a defense of Christian teaching while completely affirming a historical Jesus.<ref name="Ramshaw">''What Is Christianity?: An Introduction to the Christian Religion'', by Gail Ramshaw, Fortress Press, 2013. pp. 52–54</ref><ref name="Benson">''God and Caesar: Troeltsch's Social Teaching as Legitimation'', by Constance L. Benson, Transaction Publishers. p. 55</ref> Secular academics Kendrick and McFarland have also pointed out that the teachings of Jesus marked "a radical departure from all the conventions by which heroes had been defined".<ref>''The Heroic Ideal: Western Archetypes from the Greeks to the Present'', by M. Gregory Kendrick, McFarland, 2010. p. 43</ref>

===No independent eyewitness accounts===

====Lack of surviving historic records====

=====Mythicist view=====
Myth proponents claim there is significance in the lack of surviving historic records about Jesus of Nazareth from any non-Jewish author until the second century,<ref>[[Bart D. Ehrman]].

=====Mainstream criticism=====
Mainstream biblical scholars point out that much of the writings of antiquity have been lost<ref>{{cite book|last=Allan|first=William|title=Classical Literature: A Very Short Introduction|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199665457|page=15}}</ref> and that there was little written about any Jew or Christian in this period.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=44}}<ref>Timothy Barnes ''Pagan Perceptions of Christianity" in Early Christianity: Origins and Evolution to AD 600''. 1991, p. 232 {{ISBN|0687114446}}</ref> Ehrman points out that we do not have archaeological or textual evidence for the existence of most people in the ancient world, even famous people like Pontius Pilate, whom the myth theorists agree to have existed.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=44}} [[Robert Hutchinson (author)|Robert Hutchinson]] notes that this is also true of Josephus, despite the fact that he was "a personal favorite of the Roman Emperor [[Vespasian]]".<ref name="Hutchinson2015_p9">{{Cite book|title = Searching for Jesus|last = Hutchinson|first = Robert|publisher = Nelson Books|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-7180-1830-6|location = Nashville|page = 9}}</ref> Hutchinson quotes Ehrman, who notes that Josephus is never mentioned in 1st century Greek and Roman sources, despite being "a personal friend of the emperor".<ref name="Hutchinson2015_p9"/> According to [[Classicist|Classical]] historian and popular author [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], if the same criterion is applied to others: "We can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned."{{sfn|Grant|1995}}

====Josephus and Tacitus====
{{Main|Josephus on Jesus|Tacitus on Christ}}
There are three non-Christian sources which are typically used to study and establish the historicity of Jesus, namely two mentions in Josephus, and one mention in the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] source [[Tacitus]].<ref name="Camber121">''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus'' by Markus N.

Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'', written around 93–94&nbsp;AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus in Books [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|18]] and [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XX#Chapter 9|20]]. The general scholarly view is that while the longer passage in book 18, known as the ''Testimonium Flavianum'', is most likely not authentic in its entirety, it originally consisted of an authentic nucleus, which was then subject to Christian interpolation or forgery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schreckenberg|first=Heinz|title=Jewish Traditions in Early Christian Literature|year=1992|isbn=978-90-232-2653-6|author2=Kurt Schubert}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kostenberger|first=Andreas J.|title=The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8054-4365-3|author2=L.

[[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] Tacitus referred to "Christus" and his execution by Pontius Pilate in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' (written {{circa|AD 116}}), [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 15#44|book 15, chapter 44]]<ref name="P.E.

=====Mythicist view=====
Christ myth theory supporters such as G. A. Wells and Carrier contend that sources such as Tacitus and others, which were written decades after the supposed events, include no independent traditions that relate to Jesus, and hence can provide no confirmation of historical facts about him.{{sfn|Wells|2011}}{{sfn|Wells|2012}}{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=13}}{{sfn|Carrier|2015|p=418}}

====Other sources====

=====Mainstream view=====
In ''Jesus Outside the New Testament'' (2000), mainstream scholar Van Voorst considers references to Jesus in classical writings, Jewish writings, hypothetical sources of the canonical Gospels, and extant Christian writings outside the New Testament. Van Voorst concludes that non-Christian sources provide "a small but certain corroboration of certain New Testament historical traditions on the family background, time of life, ministry, and death of Jesus", as well as "evidence of the content of Christian preaching that is independent of the New Testament", while extra-biblical Christian sources give access to "some important information about the earliest traditions on Jesus". However, New Testament sources remain central for "both the main lines and the details about Jesus' life and teaching".{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=217}}

===Jesus was a mythical being===
{{See also|Origins of Christianity|Gnosticism}}

====Syncretism and diversity====

=====Mainstream view=====
Most historians agree that Jesus or his followers established a new [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish sect]], one that attracted both Jewish and gentile converts. Out of this Jewish sect developed Early Christianity, which was very diverse, with proto-orthodoxy and "[[Heresy|heretical]]" views like gnosticism alongside each other, {{sfn|Pagels|1979}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|ps=none}} According to New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]], a number of early Christianities existed in the first century CE, from which developed various Christian traditions and denominations, including [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodoxy]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} According to [[theologian]] [[James Dunn (theologian)|James D. G. Dunn]], four types of early Christianity can be discerned: Jewish Christianity, [[Greek Orthodox Church|Hellenistic Christianity]], [[Apocalypticism|Apocalyptic Christianity]], and [[History of the Catholic Church|early Catholicism]].{{sfn|Dunn|2006|p=253-255}}

=====Mythicist view=====
In ''Christ and the Caesars'' (1877), philosopher [[Bruno Bauer]] suggested that Christianity was a [[Religious syncretism|synthesis]] of the [[Stoicism]] of [[Seneca the Younger]], Greek [[Neoplatonism]], and the Jewish theology of Philo as developed by pro-Roman Jews such as [[Josephus]]. This new religion was in need of a founder and created its Christ.<ref>Moggach, Douglas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mEQd5VP1lBIC&pg=PA184 ''The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer''].

According to Doherty, the rapid growth of early Christian communities and the great variety of ideas cannot be explained by a single missionary effort, but points to parallel developments, which arose at various places and competed for support. Paul's arguments against rival apostles also point to this diversity.{{sfn|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}} Doherty further notes that [[Yeshua]] (Jesus) is a generic name, meaning "Yahweh saves" and refers to the concept of divine salvation, which could apply to any kind of saving entity or Wisdom.{{sfn|Doherty|1995c|ps=none}}

=====Mythicist view=====
According to Wells, Doherty, and Carrier, the mythical Jesus was derived from Wisdom traditions, the personification of an eternal aspect of God, who came to visit human beings.{{sfn|Wells|1996|p=xxv}}{{sfn|Wells|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=349, n.20}}{{refn|group=web|name="Carrier.2016"}} Wells "regard[s] this Jewish Wisdom literature as of great importance for the earliest Christian ideas about Jesus".{{sfn|Wells|1996|p=xxv}} Doherty notes that the concept of a spiritual Christ was the result of common philosophical and religious ideas of the first and second century AD, in which the idea of an intermediary force between God and the world were common.{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}}

According to Doherty, the Christ of Paul shares similarities with the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery cults]].{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}} Authors Timothy Freke and [[Peter Gandy (author)|Peter Gandy]] explicitly argue that Jesus was a deity, akin to the mystery cults,{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|1999}} while [[Acharya S|Dorothy Murdock]] argues that the Christ myth draws heavily on the Egyptian story of [[Osiris]] and [[Horus]].<ref name="Christ in Egypt">{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Robert M. |title=Book review of D.

According to Price, the ''Toledot Yeshu'' places Jesus "about 100 BCE", while [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] and the Talmud make references to "Jewish and Jewish-Christian belief" that Jesus lived about a century earlier than usually assumed. According to Price, this implies that "perhaps the Jesus figure was at first an ahistorical myth and various attempts were made to place him in a plausible historical context, just as Herodotus and others tried to figure out when Hercules 'must have' lived".{{sfn|Price|2006|p=240}}{{refn|group=note|According to Epiphanius in his ''Panarion'',{{refn|group=note|Panarion 29.5.6}} the 4th century Jewish-Christian [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]] (Ναζωραιοι) were originally Jewish converts of the [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Carrier|2009|p=293, n.10}} Richard Carrier contends that "Epiphanius, in ''Panarion'' 29, says there was a sect of still-Torah-observant Christians who taught that Jesus lived and died in the time of Jannaeus, and all the Jewish sources on Christianity that we have (from the [[Talmud]] to the Toledot Yeshu) report no other view than that Jesus lived during the time of Jannaeus".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carrier |first1=Richard |author-link1=Richard Carrier|title=Ehrman on Jesus: A Failure of Facts and Logic |url=http://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/1026|website=Richard Carrier Blog|access-date=August 27, 2017|date=April 19, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Carrier|2014|pp=284ff}}}}

=====Mainstream criticism=====
Mainstream scholarship disagrees with these interpretations, and regards them as outdated applications of ideas and methodologies from the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule''. According to Philip Davies, the Jesus of the New Testament is indeed "composed of stock motifs (and mythic types) drawn from all over the Mediterranean and Near Eastern world". Yet, this does not mean that Jesus was "invented"; according to Davies, "the existence of a guru of some kind is more plausible and economical than any other explanation".<ref group=web name="Davies2012"/> Ehrman states that mythicists make too much of the perceived parallels with pagan religions and mythologies. According to Ehrman, critical-historical research has clearly shown the Jewish roots and influences of Christianity.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012}}

Many mainstream biblical scholars respond that most of the perceived parallels with mystery religions are either coincidences or without historical basis and/or that these parallels do not prove that a Jesus figure did not live.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=208}}<!-- **START OF NOTE** -->{{refn|group=note|In particular, the transformations faced by deities have distinct differences from the resurrection of Jesus.

[[File:Constantin François Volney 1.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|alt=a sketch of a bust of Constantin-François Chassebœuf|French historian [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin-François Volney]], one of the earliest myth theorists]]

According to Van Voorst, "The argument that Jesus never existed, but was invented by the Christian movement around the year 100, goes back to Enlightenment times, when the historical-critical study of the past was born", and may have originated with [[Lord Bolingbroke]], an English deist.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=568}}

According to Weaver and Schneider, the beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of Jesus can be traced to late 18th-century France with the works of [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney]] and [[Charles-François Dupuis]].{{sfn|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&pg=PA45#v=onepage&f=false 45–50]}}{{sfn|Schweitzer|2001|pp=355ff}} Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a totally mythical character.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&pg=PA45#v=onepage&f=false 45–50]}}{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=8}} Dupuis argued that ancient rituals in Syria, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and India had influenced the Christian story which was [[allegory|allegorized]] as the histories of [[solar deity|solar deities]], such as [[Sol Invictus]].{{sfn|Wells|1969|p=}} Dupuis also said that the resurrection of Jesus was an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring [[equinox]].{{sfn|Wells|1969|p=}} Volney argued that [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]] were derived from [[Brahma]] and his wife [[Saraswati]], whereas Christ was related to [[Krishna]].<ref name=Leask104>''British Romantic Writers and the East'' by Nigel Leask (2004) {{ISBN|0521604443}} Cambridge Univ Press pp. 104–105</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-link=Tristram Stuart |first=Tristram |last=Stuart |title=The Bloodless Revolution |publisher=W.

In 1835, German theologian [[David Strauss|David Friedrich Strauss]] published his extremely controversial ''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'' (''Das Leben Jesu''). While not denying that Jesus existed, he did argue that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical additions with little basis in actual fact.<ref name="Strauss">David Friedrich Strauss (2010), ''The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined'', {{ISBN|1-61640-309-8}} pp. 39–43, 87–91</ref><ref name="Herrick">James A.

This perspective was in opposition to the prevailing views of Strauss' time: [[rationalism]], which explained the miracles as misinterpretations of non-supernatural events, and the [[supernaturalism|supernaturalist]] view that the biblical accounts were entirely accurate. Strauss's third way, in which the miracles are explained as myths developed by early Christians to support their evolving conception of Jesus, heralded a new epoch in the textual and historical treatment of the rise of Christianity.<ref name="Strauss"/><ref name="Herrick"/><ref name=Fami81/>

Then in his ''Criticism of the Pauline Epistles'' (1850–1852) and in ''A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin'' (1850–1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed.{{sfn|Schweitzer|2001|pp=124–128, 139–141}} Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time, as in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn and his work did not have much impact on future myth theorists.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pp=7–11}}{{sfn|Bennett|2001|p=204}}

In his two-volume, 867-page book ''[[Anacalypsis]]'' (1836), English gentleman [[Godfrey Higgins]] said that "the mythos of the Hindus, the mythos of the Jews and the mythos of the Greeks are all at bottom the same; and are contrivances under the appearance of histories to perpetuate doctrines"{{sfn|Harpur|2004|p=30}} and that Christian editors "either from roguery or folly, corrupted them all".{{sfn|Harpur|2004|p=59}} In his 1875 book ''[[The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors]]'', American [[Kersey Graves]] said that many demigods from different countries shared similar stories, traits or quotes as Jesus and he used Higgins as the main source for his arguments.

Starting in the 1870s, English poet and author [[Gerald Massey]] became interested in Egyptology and reportedly taught himself Egyptian hieroglyphics at the British Museum.{{sfn|Harpur|2004}} In 1883, Massey published ''The Natural Genesis'' where he asserted parallels between Jesus and the Egyptian god [[Horus]].

In the 1870s and 1880s, a group of scholars associated with the [[University of Amsterdam]], known in German scholarship as the Radical Dutch school, rejected the authenticity of the Pauline epistles and took a generally negative view of the Bible's historical value.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=10}} [[Abraham Dirk Loman]] argued in 1881 that all New Testament writings belonged to the 2nd century and doubted that Jesus was a historical figure, but later said the core of the gospels was genuine.{{sfn|Schweitzer|2001|pp=356–361, 527 n. 4}}

During the early 20th century, several writers published arguments against Jesus' historicity, often drawing on the work of liberal theologians, who tended to deny any value to sources for Jesus outside the New Testament and limited their attention to Mark and the hypothetical [[Q source]].{{sfn|Schweitzer|2001|pp=356–361, 527 n. 4}} They also made use of the growing field of [[History of religions|religious history]] which found sources for Christian ideas in Greek and Oriental mystery cults, rather than Judaism.{{sfn|Arvidsson|2006|pp=116–117}}{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Klausner]] wrote that biblical scholars "tried their hardest to find in the historic Jesus something which is not Judaism; but in his actual history they have found nothing of this whatever, since this history is reduced almost to zero.

== Revival (1970s–present)==
Beginning in the 1970s, in the aftermath of the second quest for the historical Jesus, interest in the Christ myth theory was revived by George Albert Wells, whose ideas were elaborated by Earl Doherty. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, their ideas gained popular interest, giving way to a multitude of publications and websites aimed at a popular audience, most notably Richard Carrier, often taking a polemical stance toward Christianity. Their ideas are supported by Robert Price, an academic theologian, while somewhat different stances on the mythological origins are offered by Thomas L. Thompson and Thomas L. Brodie, both also accomplished scholars in theology.

===Revival of the Christ myth theory===

==== Paul-Louis Couchoud ====
The French philosopher [[Paul-Louis Couchoud]],{{sfn|Weaver|1999|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CZbuFBdAMUC&pg=PA300 300–303]}} published in the 1920s and 1930s, was a predecessor for contemporary mythicists. According to Couchoud, Christianity started not with a biography of Jesus but "a collective mystical experience, sustaining a divine history mystically revealed".{{sfn|Couchoud|1926|p=23}} Couchaud's Jesus is not a "myth", but a "religious conception".<ref name="Hibbert1939">''Hibbert Journal'' Volume 37 (1938–39), pp. 193–214</ref>

Robert Price mentions Couchoud's comment on the Christ Hymn, one of the relics of the Christ cults to which Paul converted. Couchoud noted that in this hymn the name Jesus was given to the Christ after his torturous death, implying that there cannot have been a ministry by a teacher called Jesus.

==== George Albert Wells ====
[[George Albert Wells]] (1926–2017), a professor of German, revived the interest in the Christ myth theory. In his early work,<ref>{{harv|Wells|1971}}, {{harv|Wells|1975}}, {{harv|Wells|1982}}</ref> including ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Wells)|Did Jesus Exist?]]'' (1975), Wells argued that because the Gospels were written decades after Jesus's death by Christians who were theologically motivated but had no personal knowledge of him, a rational person should believe the gospels only if they are independently confirmed.<ref name="Martin.1993.p38">{{cite book|last=Martin |first=Michael |title=The Case Against Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWkC4dTmK0AC&pg=PA38 |date=1993 |publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-081-1|page=38}}</ref> In ''The Jesus Myth'' (1999) and later works, Wells argues that two Jesus narratives fused into one, namely Paul's mythical Jesus, and a minimally historical Jesus from a Galilean preaching tradition, whose teachings were preserved in the [[Q document]], a hypothetical common source for the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] [[Gospel of Luke|and Luke]].{{sfn|Wells|1999}}{{sfn|Wells|2009}} According to Wells, both figures owe much of their substance to ideas from the Jewish wisdom literature.{{sfn|Wells|2013|p=16}}

In 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the "Nonexistence Hypothesis" and their arguments, presenting eight arguments against this hypothesis as put forward by Wells and his predecessors.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pp=14–15}}{{sfn|Van Voorst|2003|pp=659–660}} According to Maurice Casey, Wells' work repeated the main points of the ''[[History of religions school|Religionsgeschichtliche Schule]]'', which are deemed outdated by mainstream scholarship. His works were not discussed by New Testament scholars, because it was "not considered to be original, and all his main points were thought to have been refuted long time ago, for reasons which were very well known".{{sfn|Casey|2014}}

In his later writings, G.A Wells changed his mind and came to view Jesus as a minimally historical figure.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=George Albert |title=Cutting Jesus Down To Size : What Higher Criticism has Achieved and Where it leaves Christianity |date=2009 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago, Ill. |isbn=978-0812696561 |quote=When I first addressed these problems, more than thirty years ago, it seemed to me that, because the earliest Christian references to Jesus are so vague, the gospel Jesus could be no more than a mythical expansion and elaboration of this obscure figure. But from the mid-1990s I became persuaded that many of the gospel traditions are too specific in their references to time, place, and circumstances to have developed in such a short time from no other basis, and are better understood as traceable to the activity of a Galilean preacher of the early first century, the personage represented in Q (the inferred non-Markan source, not extant, common to Matthew and Luke; cf. above, p. 2), which may be even earlier than the Paulines. This is the position I have argued in my books of 1996, 1999, and 2004, although the titles of the first two of these-The Jesus Legend and The Jesus Myth-may mislead potential readers into supposing that I still denied the historicity of the gospel Jesus.}}</ref>

====Earl Doherty====
Canadian writer [[Earl Doherty]] (born 1941) was introduced to the Christ myth theme by a lecture by Wells in the 1970s.{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}} Doherty follows the lead of Wells, but disagrees on the historicity of Jesus, arguing that "everything in Paul points to a belief in an entirely divine Son who 'lived' and acted in the spiritual realm, in the same mythical setting in which all the other savior deities of the day were seen to operate".{{sfn|Doherty|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|According to Doherty, it was Paul's view that Jesus' death took place in the spiritual not the earthly realm.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=258}} According to Ehrman, not only is there "no evidence to support Doherty's assertion of what Paul's view of Jesus was", but there are also "a host of reasons for calling Doherty's view into serious question".{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pp=254, 258}}}} According to Doherty, Paul's Christ originated as a myth derived from [[middle Platonism]] with some influence from [[Merkabah mysticism|Jewish mysticism]] and belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century.{{sfn|Doherty|2009|pp=vii–viii}} Doherty agrees with Bauckham that the earliest [[Christology]] was already a "high Christology", that is, Jesus was an incarnation of the pre-existent Christ, but deems it "hardly credible" that such a belief could develop in such a short time among Jews.<ref>Doherty (2009). ''Jesus: Neither God Nor Man – The Case for a Mythical Jesus''. Ottawa: Age of Reason Publications. p. 716, n. 12. {{ISBN|978-0-9689259-2-8}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|name="High.Christology"}} Therefore, Doherty concludes that Christianity started with the myth of this incarnated Christ, who was subsequently historicised. According to Doherty, the nucleus of this historicised Jesus of the Gospels can be found in the Jesus-movement which wrote the Q source.{{sfn|Doherty|1995d}} Eventually, Q's Jesus and Paul's Christ were combined in the Gospel of Mark by a predominantly gentile community.{{sfn|Doherty|1995d}} In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Doherty|1997}}

Eddy and Boyd characterize Doherty's work as appealing to the "History of Religions School".{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=30, n. 35}} In a book criticizing the Christ myth theory, New Testament scholar [[Maurice Casey]] describes Doherty as "perhaps the most influential of all the mythicists",{{sfn|Casey|2014|p=2}} but one who is unable to understand the ancient texts he uses in his arguments.{{sfn|Casey|2014|p=16}}

====Richard Carrier====
[[File:RichardCarrierSM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Richard Carrier]]]]
American independent scholar{{sfn|Gullotta|2017}} [[Richard Carrier]] (born 1969) reviewed Doherty's work on the origination of Jesus{{sfn|Carrier|2002}} and eventually concluded that the evidence favored the core of Doherty's thesis.{{sfn|Lataster|2014b|pp=614–616}} According to Carrier, following Couchoud and Doherty, Christianity started with the belief in a new deity called Jesus,{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.OHJ"}} "a spiritual, mythical figure".{{refn|group=q|name="Doherty.2009.mythical.figure"}} According to Carrier, this new deity was fleshed out in the Gospels, which added a narrative framework and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]-like teachings, and eventually came to be perceived as a historical biography.{{refn|group=q|name="Carrier.OHJ"}} Carrier argues in his book ''On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt'' that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century.{{sfn|Carrier|2014}}

===Biblical Scholars===

====Robert M. Price====
[[File:Robert M. Price 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=Robert Price at a microphone|American New Testament scholar [[Robert M. Price]]]]
American New Testament scholar and former [[Baptist]] pastor [[Robert M. Price]] (born 1954) has questioned the historicity of Jesus in a series of books, including ''Deconstructing Jesus'' (2000), ''The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man'' (2003), ''Jesus Is Dead'' (2007) and ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'' (2011). Price uses critical-historical methods,{{sfn|Price|2003|pp=9-24}} but also uses "history-of-religions parallel[s]",{{sfn|Price|2003|p=125}} or the "Principle of Analogy",{{sfn|Price|2011|p=25}} to show similarities between Gospel narratives and non-Christian Middle Eastern myths.{{sfn|Price|2003|pp=121, 125–128, 331}} Price criticises some of the criteria of critical Bible research, such as the criterion of dissimilarity{{sfn|Price|2003|pp=16–19}} and the criterion of embarrassment.{{sfn|Price|2003|p=121}} Price further notes that "consensus is no criterion" for the historicity of Jesus.{{sfn|Price|2009|p=61}} According to Price, if critical methodology is applied with ruthless consistency, one is left in complete [[agnosticism]] regarding Jesus's historicity.{{sfn|Price|2003|p=351}}{{refn|group=note|Price: "One wonders if all these scholars came to a certain point and stopped, their assumption being "If Jesus was a historical figure, he must have done and said ''something''!" But their own criteria and critical tools, which we have sought to apply here with ruthless consistency, ought to have left them with complete agnosticism.{{sfn|Price|2003|p=351}}}}

In ''Deconstructing Jesus'', Price claims that "the Jesus Christ of the New Testament is a composite figure", out of which a broad variety of historical Jesuses can be reconstructed, any one of which may have been the real Jesus, but not all of them together.{{sfn|Price|2000|pp=15–16}} According to Price, various Jesus images flowed together at the origin of Christianity, some of them possibly based on myth, some of them possibly based on "a historical Jesus the Nazorean".{{sfn|Price|2000|p=86}} Price admits uncertainty in this regard, writing in conclusion: "There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer any way of being sure".{{sfn|Price|2000|pp=85, 261}} In contributions to ''The Historical Jesus: Five Views'' (2009), he acknowledges that he stands against the majority view of scholars, but cautions against attempting to settle the issue by appeal to the majority.{{sfn|Price|2009|pp=61ff}}

==== Thomas L. Thompson ====
[[Thomas L. Thompson]] (born 1939), Professor emeritus of theology at the [[University of Copenhagen]], is a leading [[Biblical minimalism|biblical minimalist]] of the Old Testament, and supports a mythicist position, according to Ehrman{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman.2012.p11_15"}} and Casey.{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} According to Thompson, "questions of understanding and interpreting biblical texts" are more relevant than "questions about the historical existence of individuals such as ... Jesus".{{sfn|Thompson|2007}} In his 2007 book ''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David'', Thompson argues that the Biblical accounts of both King David and Jesus of Nazareth are not historical accounts, but are mythical in nature and based on Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Greek and Roman literature.{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=8}} Those accounts are based on the Messiah mytheme, a king anointed by God to restore the Divine order at Earth.{{sfn|Thompson|2012}} Thompson also argues that the resurrection of Jesus is taken directly from the story of the dying and rising god, [[Dionysus]].{{sfn|Thompson|2009|p=8}} Thompson does not draw a final conclusion on the historicity or ahistoricity of Jesus, but states that "A negative statement, however, that such a figure did not exist, cannot be reached: only that we have no warrant for making such a figure part of our history."{{sfn|Thompson|2012}}
	 
Thompson coedited the contributions from a diverse range of scholars in the 2012 book ''Is This Not the Carpenter?: The Question of the Historicity of the Figure of Jesus''.{{sfn|Thompson|Verenna|2012|ps=none}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Is This Not the Carpenter?

Neither establishing the historicity of a historical Jesus nor possessing an adequate warrant for dismissing it, our purpose is to clarify our engagement with critical historical and exegetical methods."{{sfn|Thompson|Verenna|2012|loc=Introduction}}
	 
Ehrman has criticised Thompson, questioning his qualifications and expertise regarding New Testament research.{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman.2012.p11_15"}} In a 2012 online article, Thompson defended his qualifications to address New Testament issues, and objected to Ehrman's statement that "[a] different sort of support for a mythicist position comes in the work of Thomas L. Thompson."{{refn|group=note|Ehrman (2012), ''Did Jesus Exist?'' 336–37{{sfn|Thompson|2012}}}} According to Thompson, "Bart Ehrman has attributed to my book arguments and principles which I had never presented, certainly not that Jesus had never existed", and reiterated his position that the issue of Jesus' existence cannot be determined one way or the other.{{sfn|Thompson|2012}} Thompson further states that Jesus is not to be regarded as "the notoriously stereotypical figure of ... (mistaken) [[Eschatology|eschatological]] prophet", as Ehrman does, but is modelled on "the royal figure of a [[Messiah in Judaism|conquering messiah]]", derived from Jewish writings.{{sfn|Thompson|2012}}

==== Thomas L. Brodie ====
In 2012, the Irish Dominican priest and theologian [[Thomas L. Brodie]] (born 1943), holding a PhD from the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas]] in [[Rome]] and a co-founder and former director of the [[Dominican Biblical Institute]] in [[Limerick]], published ''Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery''. In this book, Brodie, who previously had published academic works on the Hebrew prophets, argued that the Gospels are essentially a rewriting of the stories of Elijah and Elisha when viewed as a unified account in the [[Books of Kings]]. This view lead Brodie to the conclusion that Jesus is mythical.<ref name="brodie2012">{{cite book |last=Brodie|first=Thomas L.|year=2012|title=Beyond the Quest for the Historical Jesus: Memoir of a Discovery|publisher=Sheffield Phoenix Press|isbn=978-1-9075-3458-4}}</ref> Brodie's argument builds on his previous work, in which he stated that rather than being separate and fragmented, the stories of Elijah and Elisha are united and that 1 Kings 16:29 – 2 Kings 13:25 is a natural extension of 1 Kings 17 – 2 Kings 8 which have a coherence not generally observed by other biblical scholars.<ref name=brodie2000>{{cite book|last=Brodie|first=Thomas L.|year=2000|title=The crucial bridge: the Elijah–Elisha narrative as an interpretive synthesis of Genesis–Kings and a literary model of the Gospels|location=Collegeville, Minnesota|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814659427|pages=1–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ittqkiibm0C&pg=PA1}}</ref> Brodie then views the Elijah–Elisha story as the underlying model for the gospel narratives.<ref name="brodie2000" />

In his books ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]'' (1979), the British archaeologist and philologist [[John M. Allegro]] advanced the theory that stories of early Christianity originated in a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] [[Essene]] clandestine cult centered around the use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]].{{sfn|Allegro|1970}}{{sfn|Allegro|1979}}<ref name=Meaning323/><ref name=Taylor305>''The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea'' by Joan E.

[[Alvar Ellegård]], in ''The Myth of Jesus'' (1992), and ''Jesus: One Hundred Years Before Christ. A Study in Creative Mythology'' (1999), argued that Jesus lived 100 years before the accepted dates, and was a teacher of the Essenes. According to Ellegård, Paul was connected with the Essenes, and had a vision of this Jesus.

Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, in their 1999 publication ''The Jesus Mysteries: Was the "Original Jesus" a Pagan God?'' propose that Jesus did not literally exist as an historically identifiable individual, but was instead a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] re-interpretation of the fundamental pagan "godman" by the [[Gnostic]]s, who were the original sect of Christianity.

Influenced by Massey and Higgins, [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] (1880–1963), an American [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]], argued an Egyptian etymology to the Bible that the gospels were symbolic rather than historic and that church leaders started to misinterpret the New Testament in the third century.<ref>"[http://members.tripod.com/~pc93/abbskcth.htm Alvin Boyd Kuhn, Ph.D. A Biographical Sketch of his life and work]", by Richard Alvin Sattelberg, B.A., M.S.., 2005</ref> Building on Kuhn's work, author and ordained priest [[Tom Harpur]] in his 2004 book ''[[The Pagan Christ]]'' listed similarities among the stories of Jesus, Horus, Mithras, Buddha and others.

====Lack of support for mythicism====
In modern scholarship, the Christ myth theory is a [[fringe theory]], which finds virtually no support from scholars,{{sfn|Van Voorst|2003|pp=658, 660}}{{sfn|Fox|2005|p=48}}{{sfn|Burridge|Gould|2004|p=34}}<ref name="Ehrman Blog">{{cite web|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|author-link=Bart D.

[[Philip Jenkins]], Distinguished Professor of History at [[Baylor University]], has written "What you can’t do, though, without venturing into the far swamps of extreme crankery, is to argue that Jesus never existed. The “Christ-Myth Hypothesis” is not scholarship, and is not taken seriously in respectable academic debate. The grounds advanced for the “hypothesis” are worthless. The authors proposing such opinions might be competent, decent, honest individuals, but the views they present are demonstrably wrong....Jesus is better documented and recorded than pretty much any non-elite figure of antiquity."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jenkins|first1=Phillip|title=The Myth of the Mythical Jesus|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/04/the-myth-of-the-mythical-jesus/#IGPQmrQ3pSPteW5M.99|website=patheos.com|access-date=April 9, 2018|date=2016-04-18}}</ref>

====Questioning the competence of proponents====
Critics of the Christ myth theory question the competence of its supporters.{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} According to Ehrman:

{{quote|Few of these mythicists are actually scholars trained in ancient history, religion, biblical studies or any cognate field, let alone in the ancient languages generally thought to matter for those who want to say something with any degree of authority about a Jewish teacher who (allegedly) lived in first-century Palestine.<ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/>}}

Maurice Casey has criticized the mythicists, pointing out their complete ignorance of how modern critical scholarship actually works. He also criticizes mythicists for their frequent assumption that all modern scholars of religion are Protestant fundamentalists of the American variety, insisting that this assumption is not only totally inaccurate, but also exemplary of the mythicists' misconceptions about the ideas and attitudes of mainstream scholars.{{sfn|Casey|2014|pp=1–41}}

Questioning the mainstream view appears to have consequences for one's job perspectives.<ref>Thomas Verenna, [https://tomverenna.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/goodbye-for-now/ ''Goodbye for now?'']</ref> According to Casey, Thompson's early work, which "successfully refuted the attempts of Albright and others to defend the historicity of the most ancient parts of biblical literature history", has "negatively affected his future job prospects".{{refn|group=q|name="Casey2014"}} Ehrman also notes that mythicist views would prevent one from getting employment in a religious studies department: {{quote|These views are so extreme and so unconvincing to 99.99 percent of the real experts that anyone holding them is as likely to get a teaching job in an established department of religion as a six-day creationist is likely to land on in a bona fide department of biology.<ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/>}}

====Other criticisms====
Robert Van Voorst has written "Contemporary New Testament scholars have typically viewed (Christ myth) arguments as so weak or bizarre that they relegate them to footnotes, or often ignore them completely [...] The theory of Jesus' nonexistence is now effectively dead as a scholarly question."{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|p=6}} [[Paul L. Maier]], former Professor of Ancient History at Western Michigan University and current  professor emeritus in the Department of History there has stated "Anyone who uses the argument that Jesus never existed is simply flaunting his ignorance."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Grace |first1=John Patrick |title=Questioning Jesus' existence is sheer madness |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/opinion/john-patrick-grace-questioning-jesus-existence-is-sheer-madness/article_2223a091-477e-5f55-a8a8-ee50b372fe9e.html |access-date=August 7, 2018 |publisher=The Herald-Dispatch |date=July 21, 2015}}</ref> Among notable scholars who have directly addressed the Christ myth are Bart Ehrman, Maurice Casey and Philip Jenkins.

In 2000 Van Voorst gave an overview of proponents of the "Nonexistence Hypothesis" and their arguments, presenting eight arguments against this hypothesis as put forward by Wells and his predecessors.{{sfn|Van Voorst|2000|pp=14-15}}{{sfn|Van Voorst|2003|pp=659–660}}
# The "argument of silence" is to be rejected, because "it is wrong to suppose that what is unmentioned or undetailed did not exist." Van Voorst further argues that the early Christian literature was not written for historical purposes.
# Dating the "invention" of Jesus around 100 CE is too late; Mark was written earlier, and contains abundant historical details which are correct.
# The argument that the development of the Gospel traditions shows that there was no historical Jesus is incorrect; "development does not prove wholesale invention, and difficulties do not prove invention."
# Wells cannot explain why "no pagans and Jews who opposed Christianity denied Jesus' historicity or even questioned it."
# The rejection of Tacitus and Josephus ignores the scholarly consensus.
# Proponents of the "Nonexistence Hypothesis" are not driven by scholarly interests, but by anti-Christian sentiments.
# Wells and others do not offer alternative "other, credible hypotheses" for the origins of Christianity.
# Wells himself accepted the existence of a minimal historical Jesus, thereby effectively leaving the "Nonexistence Hypothesis."

In his book ''[[Did Jesus Exist? (Ehrman)|Did Jesus Exist?]]'', [[Bart Ehrman]] surveys the arguments "mythicists" have made against the existence of Jesus since the idea was first mooted at the end of the 18th century. As for the lack of contemporaneous records for Jesus, Ehrman notes no comparable Jewish figure is mentioned in contemporary records either and there are mentions of Christ in several Roman works of history from only decades after the [[death of Jesus]].<ref name=Ehrman>{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D|title=Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth|date=2012|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0062206442}}</ref> The author states that the authentic letters of the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in the New Testament were likely written within a few years of Jesus' death and that Paul likely personally knew [[James the Just|James]], the brother of Jesus. Although the [[gospel]] accounts of Jesus' life may be biased and unreliable in many respects, Ehrman writes, they and the sources behind them which scholars have discerned still contain some accurate historical information.<ref name=Ehrman /> So many independent attestations of Jesus' existence, Ehrman says, are actually "astounding for an ancient figure of any kind".<ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/> Ehrman dismisses the idea that the story of Jesus is an invention based on [[Paganism|pagan myths]] of dying-and-rising gods, maintaining that the early Christians were primarily influenced by [[Judaism|Jewish ideas]], not Greek or Roman ones,<ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/><ref name=Ehrman /> and repeatedly insisting that the idea that there was never such a person as Jesus is not seriously considered by historians or experts in the field at all.<ref name=Ehrman />

Alexander Lucie-Smith, Catholic priest and doctor of moral theology, states that "People who think Jesus didn’t exist are seriously confused," but also notes that "the Church needs to reflect on its failure. If 40 per cent believe in the Jesus myth, this is a sign that the Church has failed to communicate with the general public."<ref name=Lucie-Smith>Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith, [http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/11/02/people-who-think-jesus-didnt-exist-are-seriously-confused/ ''People who think Jesus didn’t exist are seriously confused''], Catholic Herald</ref>

According to Derek Murphy, the documentaries ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]'' (2005) and ''[[Zeitgeist (film series)#Zeitgeist: The Movie|Zeitgeist]]'' (2007) raised interest for the Christ myth theory with a larger audience and gave the topic a large coverage on the Internet.{{sfn|Murphy|2011|p=65}} Daniel Gullotta notes the relationship between the organization "Atheists United" and Carrier's work related to Mythicism, which has increased "the attention of the public".{{refn|group=q|name="Gullotta.2015"}}

According to Ehrman, mythicism has a growing appeal "because these deniers of Jesus are at the same time denouncers of religion".<ref name="Ehrman_Huffington"/>{{refn|group=q|name="Ehrman.2012.337"}} According to Casey, mythicism has a growing appeal because of an aversion toward Christian fundamentalism among American atheists.{{sfn|Casey|2014}}

== Documentaries ==
Since 2005, several English-language documentaries have focused—at least in part—on the Christ myth theory:

* According to Herzog, Jesus was [[Baptism of Jesus|baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]], preached about the coming [[Kingdom of God]], attracted numerous followers including the [[apostles|twelve disciples]], and was subsequently [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] by the order of the [[Roman governor|Roman prefect]] [[Pontius Pilate]], which eventually led to his immediate followers continuing his movement which soon became known as [[Christianity]].<ref>''Prophet and Teacher: An Introduction to the Historical Jesus'' by William R. Herzog (2005) {{ISBN|0664225284}} pp. 1–6.</ref>
* [[E. P. Sanders]], in "Jesus and Judaism" (1985), says there are eight facts that can be discerned about the historical Jesus: his Baptism, that he was a Galilean itinerant preacher who was reputed to do healings and other 'miracles', he called disciples and spoke of there being 12, that he confined his activity to Israel, that he engaged in controversy over the Temple, that he was crucified outside of Jerusalem by the Romans, that those disciples continued as a movement after his death. In his 1993 work, "The Historical figure of Jesus" he added six more: that Jesus was likely born in 4–6 BC under Herod the Great (the Gregorian calendar is wrong), Jesus grew up in Nazareth, Jesus taught in small villages and towns and seemed to avoid cities, Jesus ate a final meal with his disciples, he was arrested and interrogated by Jewish authorities apparently at the instigation of the high priest, his disciples abandoned him at his death, later believed they saw him and thereafter believed Jesus would return.
* Christopher Tuckett summarizes the view of mainstream historians regarding what Paul records regarding the historical Jesus: "Even if we had no other sources, we could still infer some things about Jesus from Paul’s letters. Paul clearly implies that Jesus existed as a human being (‘born of a woman’ Gal 4.4), was born a Jew (‘born under the Law’ Gal 4.4; cf. Rom 1.3) and had brothers (1 Cor 9.5; Gal 1.19). Paul also claims possible character traits for Jesus (cf. ‘meekness and gentleness’ 2 Cor 10.1; Jesus ‘did not please himself’ Rom 15.3) and he refers to the tradition of the institution of the Eucharist at the Last Supper (1 Cor 11.23–25), taking place ‘at night’ (1 Cor 11.23). Above all, he refers very frequently to the fact that Jesus was crucified (1 Cor 1.23; 2.2; Gal 3.1 etc.), and at one point ascribes prime responsibility for Jesus’ death to (some) Jews (1 Thess 2.15). He also occasionally explicitly refers to Jesus’ teaching, e.g. on divorce (1 Cor 7.10–11) and on Christian preachers or missionaries claiming support (1 Cor 9.14)."<ref>Tucket, Christopher.

This is surely surprising given the fact that Jesus was supposed to be a well-known person in the area of the world ruled by Rome. One would surely have supposed that there would have been ''some'' surviving records of Jesus if he did exist. Their absence, combined with the absence of Jewish records, suggests that NEP [Negative Evidence Principle] applies and that we are justified in disbelieving that Jesus existed.}}</ref>

Most of the Dutch Radical scholars, following Bruno Bauer, argued that all of the gospel tradition was fabricated to historicize an originally bare datum of a savior, perhaps derived from the Mystery Religions or Gnosticism or even further afield. The basic argument offered for this position, it seems to me, is that of analogy, the resemblances between Jesus and Gnostic and Mystery Religion saviors being just too numerous and close to dismiss."</ref>
