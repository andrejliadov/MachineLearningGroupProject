{{distinguish|Anthropogenic (disambiguation){{!}}Anthropogenic|Anthropization|Anthropology}}
'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides natural selection were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

==History of usage==
{{Life timeline}}
The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hooper |first1=Robert |title=Lexicon Medicum; or Medical Dictionary … |date=1839 |publisher=Longman, etc. |location=London, England |page=[https://archive.org/details/b29304945/page/135 135] |edition=7th |url=https://archive.org/details/b29304945}}</ref> and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''<ref>Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company</ref> (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''<ref>Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company</ref> (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|author-link=Otis T.

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].<ref name="gregory" /> There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 1993. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 1993 <ref>{{cite book|last1=Boaz|first1=Noel T|year=1993|title=Quarry: closing in on the missing link|url=https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Quarry-Closing-In-On-the-Missing-Link/Noel-T-Boaz/9780684863788|pages=247–250|isbn13=9780684863788}}</ref> and in

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".<ref name="gregory">{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|issue=1985|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}</ref> According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].
