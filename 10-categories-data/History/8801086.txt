A '''tactical event''' (Also known as a "Private Battle" in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere) is a type of [[historical reenactment]], not usually open to the public,<ref>Hadden p 224 "Sometimes they are closed events, in which the public is not invited to observe."</ref> which is fought like a real battle with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). Tactical events have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees,<ref>Hadden. p 23</ref> and so could be considered a form of [[live action role-playing game]]. Tactical battles might also be considered a form of [[experimental archaeology]].<ref>Hadden. p 23 "By living like the soldiers did, even for just a short time, the reenactors gain better understanding of how to wear the uniform and use the equipment."</ref>
