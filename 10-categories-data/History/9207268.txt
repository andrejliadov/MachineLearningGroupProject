'''National History Day''' is  a non-profit organization based in [[College Park, Maryland]] that operates an annual project-based contest for students in grades 6-12. It has affiliates in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], South Korea, China, South Asia, and Central America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/affiliates|title=Affiliates {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> It started as a local program in Cleveland, Ohio, headed by Dr. David Van Tassell, a history professor at [[Case Western Reserve University]].<ref>Gorn, 2001</ref> It grew from 129 students in 1974 to over 500,000 students in 48 states in 1991, and 700,000 students and 40,000 teachers in 2001.<ref>Page (1992)</ref><ref>Gorn (2001)</ref> Today more than half a million students enter through local contests.

==History of the National History Day Contest==
The contest started in Cleveland in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nhd.org/about|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> Members of the History Department at [[Case Western Reserve University]] developed the initial idea for a history contest akin to Science Fair. In 1978, they incorporated the project and hired [[Lois Scharf]] as executive director. She worked to raise grant funds and recruit state historical organizations to join in the program. She served until 1992.<ref>{{cite thesis |last1=Page |first1=Marilyn L. |title=National History Day: An Ethnohistorical Case Study |url=https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5914&context=dissertations_1 |type=PhD |date=September 1992 |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts]] |location=Amherst, Massachusetts |oclc=27261357 |pages=101-103}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=National History Day, Inc. |url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/n/national-history-day-inc |website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |access-date=18 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818025740/https://case.edu/ech/articles/n/national-history-day-inc |archive-date=18 August 2019 |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>  Students gathered on campus to devote one day to history calling it "National History Day." Over the next few years, the contest expanded throughout Ohio and into surrounding Midwestern states. By 1980, with the help of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], National History Day had grown into a national non-profit organization and in 1992 National History Day moved its headquarters from Cleveland to the Washington, D.C., area. National History Day now runs multiple educational programs but the National Contest is still the largest of these. The national finals take place each June during a week-long event held at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].<ref>Byers, David. "Four score and seven years ago... Costumed history buffs hit campus in national competition." The Diamondback Online 15 June 2006: 1-1.</ref>

==National History Day Contest Annual Theme==
The annual theme is usually a phrase ending with "in history" and is often an alliteration, such as, "Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History." The theme frames students’ research within a historical theme. The theme is chosen for the broad application to world, national, or state history and its relevance to ancient history or to the more recent past. The 2019 theme was ''Triumph and Tragedy in History,'' and the 2020 theme is ''Breaking Barriers in History''. "The intentional selection of the theme for the National History Day Contest is to provide an opportunity for students to push past the antiquated view of history as mere facts and dates and drill down into historical content to develop perspective and understanding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nhd.org/node/542|title=Taking A Stand in History {{!}} National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>" Themes are rotated each year and prior themes are often used after approximately twelve years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/previous-annual-themes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>

==Competition==
===Submissions===
Students, either individually or as a group, can submit a project from one of the following categories: paper, exhibit, performance, documentary, or website. After reviewing the year's theme, the submission handbook, and choosing a topic, the student(s) should gather primary and secondary sources pertaining to their research. All sources need to be clearly cited in the annotated bibliography that is required for all projects.<ref>https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography</ref> Additionally, a title page and a process paper must be submitted with each project. <ref>https://www.nhd.org/annotated-bibliography</ref> The process paper should include how the project's topic was chosen, how research was conducted, how the actual project was created, the historical significance of the research, and the historical argument made in the project. <ref>https://www.nhd.org/sites/default/files/NHDRuleBook2021Digital.pdf</ref> 

To ensure submissions are properly formatted and received, students should refer to their [https://www.nhd.org/affiliate NHD affiliate] as different regions may have special rules or guidelines.

===Judging===
National History Day projects are judged using an evaluation form with two categories: Historical Quality (accounting for 80% of the score) and Clarity of Presentation (20% of the score).<ref>https://www.nhd.org/how-enter-contest</ref> The Historical Quality category includes judging based on strengths of your historical argument, research, and relationship to the theme for all projects. <ref>https://www.nhd.org/how-enter-contest</ref>

===State and Regional Competitions===
In some regions, students who reach enough points in their judging advance to states, and any number of students at regional competitions can advance to states. In other states, such as California, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, the top three projects at the regional competition advance to the state competition. Regions can be divided by geographic area, population, or by county.

At the state/affiliate level contests, students compete for a variety of prizes. The top two entries in each category and division are invited to the National Contest held each June at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

===National Competition===
====Preliminaries====
In the preliminary rounds, each entry presents their project before a panel of three judges. In the case of the paper and website categories, the projects have been reviewed by the judges prior to the presentations. Performances, documentaries, and exhibits are presented for the judges for the first time at the contest. The top 2 entries in both, the senior, and junior division advance to the national contest.

====Finals====
Those in the performance and documentary categories are notified they advanced to the final round and then present their work to a panel of three new judges. Those in the paper, website, and exhibit categories are not informed if they have made it into the final round. Their projects are judged by a panel of three new judges, but the students are not interviewed in this round. Their project then has to stand alone for the final judging.

[[File:National History Day 2006 medal.jpg|thumb|National History Day Medal: 2005-2006|200px|right|Example of a National History Day Medal]] The awards for first, second, and third place at the national level are $1000, $500, and $250, respectively. "Outstanding Entry" awards are also given to two projects from each state: one junior entry and one senior entry. There are also more than a dozen special prizes awarded worth between $250 and $2,500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhd.org/special-prizes|title=National History Day {{!}} NHD|website=www.nhd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>

==== Impact on students ====
An independent study conducted in 2011 demonstrated that students who participate in the National History Day Contest outperform their non-participating peers and score higher on standardized tests, although this might be a reflection on the type of students who choose to participate in National History Day - those who seek to challenge themselves.<ref>"[http://www.navyhistory.org/2012/07/alaska-students-awarded-nhf-national-history-day-prize/ Three Alaska Students Awarded NHF National History Day Prize]." ''Naval Historical Foundation,'' 17 July 2012. Accessed 10 Feb. 2013.</ref>

===Impact on historians===
Arnita Jones, executive director of the [[American Historical Association]], wrote in 2001:
:Perhaps the greatest impact of National History Day...was on the historical profession itself. I truly believe that never have so many historians enjoyed engaging in the pursuit of history outside their offices, their regular classrooms, and their academic research as have the thousands who have participated in National History Day as teachers, mentors, consultants and judges over more than two decades.<ref>Quoted in Gorn (2001)</ref>
