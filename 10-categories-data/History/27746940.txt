{{Deepwater Horizon oil spill series}}
This article covers the effect of the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|''Deepwater Horizon'' disaster]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|resulting oil spill]] on global and national economies and the energy industry.

Weeks after the event, and while it was still in progress, the 2010 ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill was being discussed as a disaster with far reaching consequences sufficient to impact global economies, marketplaces and policies. It took place on 20 April 2010. These potentially included structural shifts to [[energy policy]], insurance marketplaces and [[risk assessment]], and potential liabilities of the order of tens of billions of US dollars for one or more large and well known companies - principally [[BP]].

==Impact to the global industry==
===Oil industry impact===
{{Main|United States offshore drilling debate|2010 United States deepwater drilling moratorium}}
{{See also|Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar}}
As a response to the disaster, on 30 April President [[Barack Obama]] ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases until a review determined whether more safety systems were needed<ref name="bloomberg010510"/> and authorized teams to investigate 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster.<ref name="CBS/AP"/> Later a six-month offshore drilling (below {{convert|500|ft}} of water) moratorium was enforced by the [[United States Department of the Interior]].<ref name=upstream240610/> Secretary of the Interior [[Ken Salazar]] ordered immediate inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. An Outer Continental Shelf safety review board within the Department of the Interior is to provide recommendations for conducting drilling activities in the Gulf.<ref name="CITEREFupstream2010a"/> The moratorium suspended work on 33&nbsp;rigs.<ref name=upstream240610/> It was challenged by several drilling and oil services companies. On 22 June, a [[United States federal judge]] on the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]] [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman]] when ruling in the case [[Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar]], lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified.<ref name=upstream240610/> The Department of Justice appealed to the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]], which granted the request for an expedited hearing. A three judge panel is scheduled to hear oral arguments on 8 July.<ref name="AutoBB-240"/><ref name="AutoBB-241"/>

[[File:US Crude Oil Production and Imports.svg|thumb|250px|U.S. Oil Production and Imports 1920 to 2012]]
On 30 June, Salazar said that "he is working very hard to finalize a new offshore drilling moratorium".<ref name=upstream300610a/> [[Michael Bromwich]], the head of the newly created [[Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement]], said that a record of "bad performance, deadly performance" by an oil company should be considered "a relevant factor" for the government when it decides if that company should be awarded future drilling leases.<ref name=upstream300610a/> Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] plans to introduce to the energy reform bill under consideration in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that a company's safety record should factor into leasing decisions. By this amendment he wants to ban BP from leasing any additional offshore area for seven years because of "extensive record of serious worker safety and environmental violations".<ref name=upstream300610b/>

On 28 April, the [[National Energy Board]] of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the [[Canadian Arctic]] and along the [[British Columbia Coast]], issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells.<ref name="canadian regulator response"/> Five days later, the Canadian [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] [[Jim Prentice]] said the government would not approve a decision to relax safety or environment regulations for large energy projects.<ref name="prentice"/> On 3 May California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded [[Offshore oil and gas in California|offshore drilling projects in California]].<ref name="CSM20100503"/><ref name="BBC20100503"/> On 8 July, Florida Governor [[Charlie Crist]] called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July.<ref name="AutoBB-242"/><ref name="AutoBB-243"/>

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that in 2010, 23.5% of [[Oil producing countries|U.S. oil production]] came from offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico<ref name="AutoBB-244"/> The chief argument in the U.S. offshore drilling debate has been to make the United States less dependent on [[List of countries by oil imports|imported oil]].<ref name="AutoBB-245"/><ref name="AutoBB-246"/> American dependence on imports grew from 24% in 1970<ref name="AutoBB-247"/> to 66% in 2008.<ref name="AutoBB-248"/>

Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry employs about 58,000 Louisiana residents and has created another 260,000 oil-related jobs, accounting for about 17% of all Louisiana jobs.<ref name="CSM Sasser"/>

===Global insurance and reinsurance market impact===
At the time of the disaster it was said that there were only 4 companies able to insure risks of such size.<ref name="portfolio.com1"/> The impact of ''Deepwater Horizon'' on [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]] and other global markets due to the shift in [[systemic risk]] is as yet unknown. Until this incident loss of an entire semi-submersible rig in this way was considered "an unprecedented tragedy"<ref name="portfolio.com1" /> with an underwriter at Pritchard Capital commenting "It's never happened that a semi could burn into the sea and completely sink. Now underwriters have to include that as a risk. That’s probably $10,000 to $15,000 more per day in rig insurance. They’ll make it up by charging more on a per-rig basis."<ref name="portfolio.com1" />

==Impact on the UK economy==
The [[Organization for International Investment]], a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based advocate for overseas investment into the U.S., warned in early July that the political rhetoric surrounding the disaster is potentially damaging the reputation of all British companies with operations in the U.S.<ref name=guardian140710/> and sparked a wave of U.S. protectionism that has restricted British firms from; winning government contracts, making political donations, and lobbying.<ref name="AutoBB-286"/>

==Impact on the US economy==
===Fisheries===
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-21.png|thumb|As of 21 June 2010, the area closed to fishing encompassed {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or about 36% of Gulf of Mexico federal waters.|alt=21 June 2010 NOAA map of the Gulf of Mexico showing the areas closed to fishing.]]
In BP's Initial Exploration Plan, dated 10 March 2009, it said that "it is unlikely that an accidental spill would occur" and "no adverse activities are anticipated" to fisheries or fish habitat.<ref name="Initial Exploration Plan Mississippi Canyon"/> On 29 April 2010, [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in the state after weather forecasts predicted the oil slick would reach the Louisiana coast.<ref name="state of emergency"/> An emergency shrimping season was opened on 29 April so that a catch could be brought in before the oil advanced too far.<ref name=CITEREFbbc2010a/> By 30 April, the USCG received reports that oil had begun washing up to wildlife refuges and seafood grounds on the Louisiana [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].<ref name=fishing1/> On 22 May 2010, the Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board stated said 60 to 70% of [[oyster]] and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crab]] harvesting areas and 70 to 80% of fin-fisheries remained open.<ref name="AutoBB-198"/> The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals closed an additional ten oyster beds on 23 May, just south of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], citing confirmed reports of oil along the state's western coast.<ref name="AutoBB-199"/>

On 2 May 2010, NOAA closed commercial and recreational fishing in affected federal waters between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Pensacola Bay. The closure initially incorporated {{convert|6814|sqmi}}.<ref name="AutoBB-200"/><ref name="AutoBB-201"/> By 21 June, NOAA had increased the area under closure over a dozen times, encompassing by that date {{convert|86985|sqmi}}, or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and extending along the coast from [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya Bay]], Louisiana to [[Panama City, Florida]].<ref name="AutoBB-202"/><ref name="AutoBB-203"/> On 24 May, the federal government declared a fisheries disaster for the states of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.<ref name="AutoBB-204"/> Initial cost estimates to the fishing industry were $2.5&nbsp;billion.<ref name="fishing1" />

On 23 June, NOAA ended its fishing ban in {{convert|8000|sqmi}}, leaving {{convert|78597|sqmi}} with no fishing allowed,<ref name="AutoBB-205"/> or about one-third of the Gulf. The continued fishing ban was meant to assure the safety of seafood, and NOAA inspectors announced that as of 9 July, Kevin Griffis of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] said, only one seafood sample out of 400 tested did not pass, and even that one did not include "concerning levels of contaminants".<ref name=Skoloff/> On 10 August, Jane Lubchenco of NOAA said no one had seen oil in a {{convert|8000|sqmi}} area east of Pensacola since 3 July, so the fishing ban in that area was being lifted.<ref name="AutoBB-206"/>

On 31 August, a Boston lab hired by the United Commercial Fishermen's Association to analyze coastal fishing waters said it found dispersant in a seafood sample taken near Biloxi, Miss., almost a month after BP said it had stopped using the chemical.<ref name="AutoBB-207"/>

According to the [[European Space Agency]], the agency's satellite data was used by the Ocean Foundation to conclude that 20% of the juvenile [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|bluefin tuna]] were killed by oil in the gulf's most important spawning area. The foundation combined satellite data showing the oil spill extent each week with data on weekly tuna spawning to make their conclusion. The agency also said that the loss of juvenile tuna was significant due to the 82% decline of the tuna's spawning stock in the western Atlantic during the 30 years before the oil spill.<ref name="AutoBB-208"/>

The waters had been reopened to fishing on 15 November 2010,<ref name="AutoBB-209"/> but on 24 November NOAA re-closed {{convert|4200|sqmi}} area to shrimping.<ref name="AutoBB-210"/> A Florida TV station sent frozen Gulf shrimp to be tested for petroleum by-products after recent reports showed scientists disagreed on whether it is safe to eat after the oil spill.<ref name="AutoBB-211">[http://www.abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/local_news/gulf-seafood-safe%3F-experts-disagree-wptv1290203315314 Gulf seafood safe?

In July 2011 BP released a report<ref name="AutoBB-216">{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515155758/http://gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/BP_7_7_11_Supplemental_Comment.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2012 }}</ref> claiming that the economy had recovered and there was no reason to believe that anyone would suffer future losses from the spill, with the limited exception of oyster harvesters. However, Bruce Guerra, a crab fisherman in Louisiana for 25 years, said that since the BP oil spill crabbers are trapping 75 percent fewer crabs and that "crabs have been coming up dead, discolored, or riddled with holes since last year's spill".  Others in the fishing industry say it could take years to fully realize the spill's effects. "The problem is right when they used the dispersants, that's when the tuna came to the Gulf to spawn," said Cheril Carey, a national sales representative for a Louisiana company specializing in yellow fin tuna. "It takes a tuna five to 15 years to mature. So although we may have fish now, we may not have them in five to 15 years."<ref name="AutoBB-217">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |title=Fishermen angry as BP pushes to end payments for future losses &#124; wwltv.com New Orleans |publisher=Wwltv.com |accessdate=2011-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920150119/http://www.wwltv.com/news/BP-wants-to-end-payments-for-future-losses-Fisherman-react-125252384.html |archivedate=20 September 2011}}</ref>

In late 2012 local fishermen report that crab, shrimp, and oyster fishing operations have not yet recovered from the oil spill and many fear that the Gulf seafood industry will never recover.  One Mississippi shrimper who was interviewed said he used to get 8,000 pounds of shrimp in four days, but this year he got only 800 pounds a week.  Mississippi's oyster reefs have been closed since the spill started. A Louisiana fisherman said the local oyster industry might do 35 per cent this year, "If we're very lucky."  Dr Ed Cake, a biological oceanographer and a marine and oyster biologist, said that many of the Gulf fisheries have collapsed and "If it takes too long for them to come back, the fishing industry won't survive".<ref name="AutoBB-218">[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/03/20123571723894800.html Gulf fisheries in decline after oil disaster - Features - Al Jazeera English]</ref> In 2010, [[SBP (nonprofit organization)]] began to provide assistance to fishermen affected by what came to be known as the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].<ref name="climatechange">{{cite book|last1=Sandberg|first1=L.

===Tourism===
[[File:Orange Beach Do Not Swim sign walkway.JPG|thumb|right|Sign in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]] advising against swimming due to the oil spill]]
Although many people cancelled their vacations due to the spill, hotels close to the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported dramatic increases in business during the first half of May 2010. However, the increase was likely due to the influx of people who had come to work with oil removal efforts. "They're certainly not coming here as tourists. People aren't sport fishing, they aren't buying fuel at the marinas, they aren't staying at the little hotels on the coast and eating at the restaurants."<ref name="thesunnews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|title=Spill hasn't yet emptied hotels on Gulf Coast|last=Reed|first=Travis|work=The Sun News|agency=Associated Press|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=2010-05-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530120501/http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/05/27/1497705/spill-hasnt-yet-emptied-hotels.html|archivedate=30 May 2010}}</ref>

On 25 May 2010, BP gave Florida $25&nbsp;million to promote the beaches where the oil had not reached, and the company planned $15&nbsp;million each for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Bay Area Tourist Development Council bought [[digital billboard]]s showing recent photos from the gulf coast beaches as far north as [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]]. Along with assurances that the beaches were so far unaffected, hotels cut rates and offered deals such as free golf. Also, cancellation policies were changed, and refunds were promised to those where oil may have arrived. However, revenues remained below 2009 levels.<ref name="thesunnews1"/><ref name=Anderson>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/04/1511778/oil-could-hit-strand-by-july.html|title=Oil could hit Myrtle Beach area by July|last=Anderson|first=Lorena|work=The Sun News |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}</ref> On 1 November 2010, BP announced plans to spend $78&nbsp;million to help Louisiana tourism, and test and advertise seafood.<ref name="newsobserver.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/02/AR2010110200474.html |title=BP's oil spill costs grow, Gulf residents react |last1=Skoloff|first1=Brian|last2=Wardell|first2=Jane|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=Associated Press |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref>

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23&nbsp;billion, in a region that supports over 400,000&nbsp;travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually.<ref name="AutoBB-219">{{cite news|url=http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |title=Big price tag for recovery of Gulf Coast |last=Proctor |first=Carleton |work=Pensacola News Journal |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427044922/http://www.nivac.info/?p=824 |archivedate=27 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="AutoBB-220">{{cite news|url=http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |title=Potential Impact of the Gulf Oil Spill on Tourism |author=Oxford Economics |date=21 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507030043/http://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/page/2009/11/Gulf_Oil_Spill_Analysis_Oxford_Economics_710.pdf |archivedate=7 May 2012 }}</ref> A 2013 study in the ''Journal of Travel Research'' found that the hotel industry weathered the spill better than the vacation rental industry, and that the overall impact was complex and difficult to determine.<ref name="Journal of Travel Research">{{cite journal | url=http://jtr.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/04/01/0047287513482775.full.pdf+html?ijkey=ExJpUfn6XvJhs&keytype=ref&siteid=spjtr | title=Understanding the Effects of a Tourism Crisis: The Impact of the BP Oil Spill on Regional Lodging Demand |author1=Ritchie, Brent W. |author2=Crotts, John C. |author3=Zehrer, Anita |author4=Volsky, George T. | journal=Journal of Travel Research |date=January 2014  | volume=53 | issue=1 | pages=12–25 | doi=10.1177/0047287513482775}}</ref>

===Real estate prices===
The real estate prices and a number of transactions in the Gulf of Mexico area decreased significantly during the period of the oil spill. As a result, area officials wanted the state legislature to allow [[property tax]] to be paid based on current market value, which according to Florida [[Florida Legislature|State Rep.]] [[Dave Murzin]] could mean millions of dollars in losses for each county affected.<ref name="AutoBB-225">{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |title=Gulf property sales slide further on oil fears |last=Farrington |first=Brendan |work=The Sun News |agency=Associated Press |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702154922/https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=10988208 |archivedate=2 July 2010 }}</ref>

BP announced that it was setting up a new unit to oversee management of the oil spill and its aftermath, to be headed by former [[TNK-BP]] chief executive [[Bob Dudley|Robert Dudley]],<ref name=upstream080610>{{cite news|url = http://www.upstreamonline.com/live/article217033.ece |title= BP calls in FPSO for Macondo |last1=Brenner |first1=Noah |last2=Pitt |first2=Anthea|newspaper=Upstream Online|publisher=NHST Media Group |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}</ref> who a month later was named CEO of BP.<ref name=Wardell/>

On 1 October, BP's [[London Stock Exchange]] price reached 439.75 pence, the highest point since 28 May.<ref name=abc011010>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100101380.html |title=BP says oil spill costs rise to $11.2 billion |last=Wardell|first=Jane|agency=Associated Press| newspaper = The Washington Post |date=1 October 2010|accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref>

By 2013, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-bp-results-urgent-idUSBRE91409C20130205?irpc=932 | work=Reuters | title=Smaller BP's profits down as oil spill trial looms | date=5 February 2013}}</ref>

On 4 September 2014, when BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which could see it liable for up to $18 billion in additional fines, the company's shares lost 6 percent of their value.<ref name="BPverdict">{{cite news|title=BP found "grossly negligent' in Gulf of Mexico oil sp|url=http://www.neworleanssun.com/index.php/sid/225407625|date=4 September 2014|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=New Orleans Sun}}</ref>

=== Decline in sales ===
BP gas stations in the United States, the majority of which the company does not own, reported sales off between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Some BP station owners that lost sales said the name should change back to [[Amoco]], while others said after all the effort that went into promoting BP, such a move would be a gamble, and the company should work to restore its image.<ref name="AutoBB-224">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38493212|title=Time to scrap BP brand?
