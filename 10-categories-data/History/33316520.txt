The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].<ref name=press_release>{{cite web | title = WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2010 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES | author = Holly Evarts | date = 6 October 2009 | publisher = World Monuments Fund | url =

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.<ref name=press_release /> An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.<ref name=press_release /> For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.<ref>{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}</ref>
