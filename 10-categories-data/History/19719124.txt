'''Selim Aga''' (born around 1826 in [[Taqali]] area of [[Sudan]], died December 1875 in [[Liberia]]), a native of [[Sudan]] who was abducted by [[Arab slave trade]]rs when he was eight years of age, was brought to [[Scotland]] in 1836, and raised and educated as a free man. Selim wrote an autobiography of his life as a slave, accompanied by his poetic ''Ode to Britain'' and printed in [[Aberdeen]] in 1846.<ref>Selim Aga</ref> He regularly lectured in Great Britain on the African topics, and in 1857 left with [[William Balfour Baikie]] for an [[:wikt:expedition|expedition]] of the [[Niger River]]. Later he accompanied [[John Hawley Glover]] and [[Richard Francis Burton]] on their African expeditions. In late 1860s Selim relocated to [[Liberia]], probably aspiring for presidency;<ref name="M6"/> he was killed by [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] [[insurgents]] in 1875.

==Childhood==

Selim Aga, according to his own account, was born in Taqali valley controlled by a chief whose main possessions were the ''three'' wells.<ref>Selim Aga, p. 14</ref> The people of Taqali practised primitive agriculture and sheepherding, their faith combined [[Islam]] with pagan Sun worship. Selim, the oldest boy in the family, was prepared by the father to plow his own farmland; he was abducted by slaveholders when herding the livestock. He and his fellow prisoners were forced to march away from Taqali, relayed between numerous Sudanese, Arab and Turkish gangs of slaveholders. After six months' service to one exceptionally vicious slaveholder, Selim was taken over by a new owner (his seventh) who set up a caravan heading to [[Dongola]].<ref>Selim Aga, p. 27</ref> After a brief stay there, Selim was sold again; he ended up on a slave market in [[Cairo]]. His ninth master was a European (identified as ''Mr. P'' in Selim's book); his tenth was [[Robert Thurburn]] (''Mr. R. T.''), British consul in [[Alexandria]].<ref>Selim Aga, p. 34</ref><ref name=M1/> The new owners taught Selim basic English, took him on a tour of the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], and then prepared for the journey to Britain via [[Malta]], [[Messina]], [[Naples]] and the land route to [[Dover Strait]].

== Scotland and London ==

Selim was placed in the custody of consul Thurburn's brother John in [[Peterculter]] near [[Aberdeen]], [[baptism|baptised]],<ref name=M4>MacCarthy, 2007:4</ref> educated at home and in a local school. In 1846 he published autobiographical ''Incidents Connected with the Life of Selim Aga'', written in "faultless idiomatic English";<ref name=M1>McCarthy, 2007:1</ref> it was reissued in 1850. In 1875, the year of Selim's death, his memoirs were published in the [[Geographical Magazine]]. The memoirs became the centre of a controversy, with many refusing to believe that the book was written by an African. British explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] came to his former steward's defence, confirming that Selim was, in fact, an African educated in Scotland, and capable of "... briefly anything... he took all the trouble of life off my hands."<ref name=M2>McCarthy, 2007:2</ref>

His life between 1846 and 1857 remains scarcely documented, but it is known that he fathered at least one son with a local woman. Selim's living descendants from this affair have been traced in Scotland and the United States, one of his descendants has been traced with the name Ben Ferry (16 years old)<ref name=M1/> After leaving the Peterculter home in 1846 Selim resurfaced as a lecturer on the ''Panorama of the Nile'' at [[the Great Exhibition]] of 1851; he petitioned [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] for ''Amelioration of Africa'', promoted an idea of a trans-African east-west [[railroad]] to facilitate commerce, and was given an audience at the [[Foreign Office]].<ref name=M2/>

== African expeditions ==

In 1857 Selim Aga sailed with [[William Balfour Baikie]] on an expedition up the [[Niger River]]; he was placed under command of lieutenant [[John Hawley Glover]] and accompanied the latter on a dangerous journey to [[Lagos]] to help the survivors of a shipwreck. He attempted to lead a search-and-rescue for the vanished expedition led by [[Eduard Vogel]], but was superseded by Baikie.<ref name=M5>McCarthy, 2007:5</ref> Since 1860 Selim Aga was in the service of [[Richard Francis Burton]], who regularly praised Selim's assistance and experience.

== Death ==

Selim Aga spent at least nine last years of his life, 1866â€“1875, in [[Liberia]]. He was engaged in searching for mineral resources, surveying the previously unknown [[Cavallo River]] valley.<ref name=M6>McCarthy, 2007:6</ref> Selim's arrival in Liberia coincided with the beginning of clashes between inland native Africans and the [[African Americans|African American]] [[Americo-Liberians|immigrants]] from the [[United States]]. In 1871 secretary of state, [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], was forced into exile; president, [[Edward James Roye]], was deposed by the mob. Selim was murdered four years later, at a time when he served as an assistant surgeon and was not involved in active politics. According to an obituary published in ''[[Liberian Independent]]'' December 23, 1875, the [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] mob leader allowed him time for a Christian prayer, then "chopped his body all over, cut off his head, which he took to his town, and threw the body with a gift [of a Bible] into the field."<ref name=M6/><ref>Despite this account, biographers of Burton present Selim Aga as a Muslim, e.g. Dane Kennedy (2003) ''The Highly Civilized Man: Richard Burton and the Victorian World''.
