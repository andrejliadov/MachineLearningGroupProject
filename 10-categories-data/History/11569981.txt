Most human civilizations - [[History of India|India]], [[History of China|China]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca Empire|Inca]], among others - based their culture on complex systems of [[astrology]], which provided a link between the cosmos with the conditions and events on earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ayurvedic Astrology: Self-healing Through the Stars|last=Frawley|first=David|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2005|isbn=8120831349|location=Twin Lakes, Wisconsin|pages=3}}</ref> For these, the astrological practice was not mere divination because it also served as the foundation for their spiritual culture and knowledge-systems used for practical purposes such as the calendar (see [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] calendrical shamans<ref>{{Cite book|title=Astrology through History: Interpreting the Stars from Ancient Mesopotamia to the Present|last=Burns|first=William|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2018|isbn=9781440851421|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=225}}</ref>) and medicine (e.g. ''[[I Ching]]''). Astrological tradition even contributed to the development of [[astronomy]] as the study of the skies provided invaluable insights about celestial bodies. For instance, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] astrological tradition has already listed some of the planets in the [[Solar System|solar system]] and their movements.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sefer á¸¤akhmoni|url=https://archive.org/details/shabbataidonnolo00manc|url-access=limited|last=Mancuso|first=Piergabriele|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn=9789004167629|location=Leiden|pages=[https://archive.org/details/shabbataidonnolo00manc/page/n333 321]}}</ref>
