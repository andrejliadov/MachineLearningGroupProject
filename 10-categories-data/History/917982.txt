{{short description|The problems in reconstructing a historical and philosophical image of Socrates}}
{{Platonism}}
{{Socrates}}
In historical scholarship, the '''Socratic problem''' (or '''Socratic question''')<ref>A Rubel, M Vickers, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SmJ_BAAAQBAJ ''Fear and Loathing in Ancient Athens: Religion and Politics During the Peloponnesian War''], Routledge, 2014, p. 147.</ref> concerns attempts at reconstructing a historical and philosophical image of [[Socrates]] based on the variable, and sometimes contradictory, nature of the existing sources on his life. Scholars rely upon the extant sources, such as those of contemporaries like Aristophanes or disciples of Socrates like Plato and Xenophon, for knowing anything about Socrates. However, these sources contain contradictory details of his life, words, and beliefs when taken together. This complicates the attempts at reconstructing the beliefs and philosophical views held by the historical Socrates. It is apparent to scholarship that this problem is now deemed a task seeming impossible to clarify and thus perhaps now classified as unsolvable.<ref>Prior, W. J., "The Socratic Problem" in Benson, H. H.

Socrates was the main character in most of [[Plato]]'s dialogues and was a genuine historical figure. It is widely understood that in later dialogues Plato used the character Socrates to give voice to views that were his own. Besides Plato, three other important sources exist for the study of Socrates: [[Aristophanes]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Xenophon]]. Since no extensive writings of Socrates himself survive to the modern era, his actual views must be discerned from the sometimes contradictory reports of these four sources. The main sources for the historical Socrates are the ''Sokratikoi logoi'', or [[Socratic dialogues]], which are reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates.<ref>J Ambury.

== Plato ==

Socrates — who is often credited with turning [[Western philosophy]] in a more ethical and political direction and who was put to death by the [[democracy]] of [[Athens]] in May 399 BC — was Plato's mentor. Plato, like some of his contemporaries, wrote [[dialogue]]s about his teacher. Much of what is known about Socrates comes from Plato's writings; however, it is widely believed that very few, if any, of Plato's dialogues can be verbatim accounts of conversations between them or unmediated representations of Socrates' thought. Many of the dialogues seem to use Socrates as a device for Plato's thought, and inconsistencies occasionally crop up between Plato and the other accounts of Socrates; for instance, Plato has Socrates denying that he would ever accept money for teaching, while [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'' clearly has Socrates stating that he is paid by students to teach wisdom and that this is what he does for a living.

[[Stylometric]] analysis of the Plato corpus has led to the formation of a consensually agreed chronology classifying dialogues as falling approximately into three groups, Early, Middle and Late.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=946xAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |author=M Cormack |title=Plato's Stepping Stones: Degrees of Moral Virtue |page=8 |publisher=A&C Black |accessdate=17 April 2015 |isbn=9781847144416 |date=15 October 2006}}</ref> On the assumption that there is an evolution of philosophical thought in Plato's dialogues from his early years to his middle and later years,<ref>Krämer (1990) ascribes this view to [[Eduard Zeller]] (Hans Joachim Krämer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T2k6edyBklwC&dq= ''Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics''], SUNY Press, 1990, pp. 93–4).</ref> the most common modern view is that Plato's dialogues contain a development of thought from closer to that of Socrates' to a doctrine more distinctly Plato's own.<ref>Penner, T. "Socrates and the early dialogues" in Kraut, R. (ed.) ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato'' (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 121. See also [[Terence Irwin|Irwin, T. H.]], "The Platonic Corpus" in Fine, G. (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Plato'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 77–85.</ref> However, the question of exactly what aspects of Plato's dialogues are representative of Socrates and what are not, is far from agreed upon. Although the view that Plato's dialogues are ''developmental'' in their doctrines (with regard to the historical Socrates or not) is standard, the view is not without objectors who propose a ''unitarian'' view or other alternative interpretations of the chronology of the corpus.<ref>Rowe, C.

== Aeschines ==
Two relevant works pertain to periods in Socrates' life, of which [[Aeschines of Sphettus|Aeschines]] could not have had any personal first-hand experiential knowledge. However, substantial amounts are extant of his works ''Alcibiades'' and ''Aspasia''.<ref>C.H. Kahn - [https://books.google.com/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&pg=PA87 Aeschines on Socratic Eros] in PA.

== Issues relating to  the sources ==

=== Ages of sources relative to Socrates ===
Aristophanes (c. 450–386&nbsp;BCE) was alive during the early years of Socrates.

=== Issues resulting from translation ===
Apart from the existing identified issue of conflicting elements present in accounts and writings, there is the additional inherent concern of the veracity of transfer of meaning by translation from [[Ancient Greek language|classic Greek]] to modern language, whether that be English or any other.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=R.C. |editor-last=Bartlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHW4W92VLREC&pg=PA6 |via=Google Books |title=The Shorter Socratic Writings: "Apology of Socrates to the Jury", "Oeconomicus", and "Symposium" |pages=6–7 |series=Agora Editions |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0801472989 |access-date=2015-04-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== History of the problem ==
Efforts have been made by writers for centuries to address the problem. According to one scholar (Patzer) the number of works with any significance in this issue, prior to the nineteenth century, are few indeed.<ref>J Bussanich, ND Smith - [https://books.google.com/books?id=A9ZLAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA329 The Bloomsbury Companion to Socrates (please see - Note 14 & 16)] A&C Black, 3 Jan 2013 {{ISBN|1441112847}} [Retrieved 2015-04-17]</ref> [[G.E.

An essay written by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] in 1815, published 1818 (English translation 1833)  is considered the most significant and influential toward developing an understanding of the problem.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KBex4rtlXMC&pg=PR14 |author=Louis-André Dorion |title=The Cambridge Companion to Socrates |page=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2015-04-16 |isbn=9780521833424 |year=2011}}</ref><ref>M Trapp - [http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Socrates_from_Antiquity_to_the_Enlightenment_Intro.pdf Introduction: Questions of Socrates] [Retrieved 3 May 2015] (p.xvi)</ref>

Throughout the 20th century, two strains of interpretation arose: the literary contextualists, who tended to interpret Socratic dialogues based on literary criticism, and the analysts, who focus much more heavily on the actual arguments contained within the different texts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#ConIntStr |title=Socrates |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |last=Nails |first=Debra |date=February 8, 2018 |access-date=May 23, 2018}}</ref>

Early in the 21st century, most of the scholars concerned have settled to agreement instead of argument about the nature of the  significance of ancient textual sources in relation to this problem.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KBex4rtlXMC&pg=PR14 |author1=G Klosko, Henry L. |author2=Grace Doherty  |name-list-style=amp |title=History of Political Theory: An Introduction: Volume I: Ancient and Medieval |page=40 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199695423 |accessdate=16 April 2015 |year=2011}}</ref>

The German classical scholar [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] addressed the "Socratic problem" in his essay ''The worth of Socrates as a philosopher''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MXnzAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA538 The Philological museum, Volume 2] (edited by J.C. Hare) Printed by J. Smith for Deightons, 1833 [Retrieved 2015-05-03] (sourced firstly at [https://books.google.com/books?id=_KBex4rtlXMC&pg=PA2 L-A Dorion in D.R. Morrison - The Cambridge Companion to Socrates])</ref> Schleiermacher maintained that the two dialogues ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and ''[[Crito]]'' are purely Socratic. They were, therefore, accurate historical portrayals of the real man, and hence history and not Platonic philosophy at all. All of the other dialogues that Schleiermacher accepted as genuine he considered to be integrally bound together and consistent in their Platonism. Their consistency is related to the three phases of Plato's development:
#Foundation works, culminating in ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'';
#Transitional works, culminating in two so-called families of dialogues, the first consisting of ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', and the second of ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[Philebus]]''; and finally
#Constructive works: ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''.

Schleiermacher's views on the chronology of Plato's work are rather controversial. In Schleiermacher's view, the character of Socrates evolves over time into the "Stranger" in Plato's work, and fulfills a critical function in Plato's development, as he appears in the first family above as the "Eleatic Stranger" in ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'' and ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'', and as the "Mantitenean Stranger" in the ''[[Symposium]]''. The "Athenian Stranger" is the main character of Plato's ''[[Laws]].'' Further, the ''Sophist–Statesman–Philosopher'' family makes particularly good sense in this order, as Schleiermacher also maintains that the two dialogues, ''[[Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]],'' show Socrates as the quintessential philosopher in life (guided by [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]]) and into death, the realm of otherness. Thus the triad announced both in the Sophist and in the Statesman is completed, though the Philosopher, being divided dialectically into a "Stranger" portion and a "Socrates" portion, isn't called "The Philosopher"; this philosophical crux is left to the reader to determine. Schleiermacher thus takes the position that the real Socratic problem is understanding the dialectic between the figures of the "Stranger" and "Socrates".

# Socrates is the individual whose qualities exhibited in Plato’s writings are corroborated by Aristophanes and Xenophon.
# Socrates is he who claims “to possess no wisdom” but still participates in exercises with the aim of gaining understanding.
# Socrates is the [individual named] Socrates who appears in Plato’s earliest dialogues.
# The real Socrates is the one who turns from a ''pre-Socratic'' interest in nature to ethics, instead.
