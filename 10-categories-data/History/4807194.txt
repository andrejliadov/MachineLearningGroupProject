The '''consequences of the Black Death''' have had both immediate and long-term effects on human population across the world. These include a series of biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which had profound effects on the course of [[world history]], especially the [[History of Europe]]. Often simply referred to as "The Plague", the Black Death was one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, peaking in Europe between 1348 and 1350 with an estimated one-third of the continent's population ultimately succumbing to the disease. Historians estimate that it reduced the total [[world population]] from 475 million to between 350 and 375 million. In most parts of Europe, it took nearly 80 years for population sizes to recover, and in some areas more than 150 years.

From the perspective of many of the survivors, the effect of the plague may have been ultimately favorable, as the massive reduction of the workforce meant their labour was suddenly in higher demand. [[R. H. Hilton]] has argued that those English peasants who survived found their situation to be much improved. For many Europeans, the 15th century was a [[golden age]] of prosperity and new opportunities. The land was plentiful, wages high, and [[serfdom]] had all but disappeared. A century later, as [[population growth]] resumed, the lower classes again faced deprivation and famine.<ref>Barbara A.

==Death toll==
{{See also|Medieval demography}}

Figures for the [[infectious disease#Historic pandemics|death toll]] vary widely by area and from source to source, and estimates are frequently revised as historical research brings new discoveries to light. Most scholars estimate that the Black Death killed up to 75 million people<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/01/29/2149185.htm |title=Black death 'discriminated' between victims |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |first=Will |last=Dunham |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> in the 14th century, at a time when the entire world population was still less than 500 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1576875.stm |title=De-coding the Black Death |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Kristen |last=Philipkoski |url=https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2001/10/47288 |title=Black Death's Gene Code Cracked |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=3 October 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Even where the historical record is considered reliable, only rough estimates of the total number of deaths from the plague are possible.

===Europe===

Europe suffered an especially significant death toll from the plague. Modern estimates range between roughly one-third and one-half of the total European population in the five-year period of 1347 to 1351 died, during which the most severely affected areas may have lost up to 80 percent of the population.<ref>"The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45% to 50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe and Italy, the South of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75% to 80% of the population. In Germany and England, it was probably closer to 20%." [[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-59803-345-8}}.
Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n° 310, June 2006, pp. 45–46, say "between one-third and two-thirds"; Robert Gottfried (1983). "Black Death" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume 2, pp. 257–67, says "between 25 and 45&nbsp;percent".

The Black Death hit the culture of towns and cities disproportionately hard, although rural areas (where most of the population lived at the time) were also significantly affected. Larger cities were the worst off, as population densities and close living quarters made disease transmission easier. Cities were also strikingly filthy, infested with [[Louse|lice]], [[flea]]s, and [[rat]]s, and subject to diseases caused by malnutrition and poor [[hygiene]].<ref>According to Kelly (2005), "[w]oefully inadequate sanitation made medieval urban Europe so disease-ridden, no city of any size could maintain its population without a constant influx of immigrants from the countryside". The influx of new citizens facilitated the movement of the plague between communities and contributed to the longevity of the plague within larger communities. Kelly, John.

Between 60 and 70 per cent of [[Hamburg]]'s and [[Bremen]]'s populations died. In [[Provence]], [[Dauphiné]], and [[Normandy]], historians observe a decrease of 60 percent of fiscal hearths. In some regions, two-thirds of the population was annihilated. In the town of [[Givry, Saône-et-Loire|Givry]], in the [[Bourgogne]] region of France, the local friar, who used to note 28 to 29 funerals a year, recorded 649 deaths in 1348, half of them in September. About half of [[Perpignan]]'s population died over the course of several months (only two of the eight physicians survived the plague). Over 60 percent of Norway's population died between 1348 and 1350.<ref name = "Forskning">{{cite web |url=http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/juli/1090833676.68 |title=Svartedauden Enda verre enn antatt |publisher=Forskning.no |author=Harald Aastorp |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331003935/http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/juli/1090833676.68 |archive-date=31 March 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[London]] may have lost two-thirds of its population during the 1348–49 outbreak;<ref name=guardian811>{{cite news | URL = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/black-death-rats-off-hook | title = Black Death study lets rats off the hook | last = Kennedy | first = Maev |date = 17 August 2011 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 18 August 2011 }}</ref> England as a whole may have lost 70 percent of its population, which declined from 7&nbsp;million before the plague to 2&nbsp;million in 1400.<ref>Barry and Gualde 2006.</ref>

Some places, including the Kingdom of Poland, parts of [[the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] region, [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]], and [[Limbourg]] (in modern Belgium), as well as [[Santiago de Compostela]], were unaffected for unknown reasons. Some historians<ref>Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, "The Smallest Thing of History" (''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'', in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°310, June 2006, pp. 45–46</ref> have assumed that the presence of resistant [[blood group]]s in the local population helped them resist infection, although these regions were touched by the second plague outbreak in 1360–63 (the "little mortality") and later during the numerous resurgences of the plague (in 1366–69, 1374–75, 1400, 1407, etc.). Other areas which escaped the plague were isolated in mountainous regions (e.g. the [[Pyrenees]]).

All social classes were affected, although the lower classes, living together in unhealthy places, were most vulnerable. [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] and [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan of Navarre]] (daughter of [[Louis X of France|Louis X ''le Hutin'']] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]]) were the only European monarchs to die of the plague, but [[Peter IV of Aragon]] lost [[Eleanor of Portugal, Queen of Aragon|his wife]], his daughter, and a niece in six months. [[Joan of England (1335–1348)|Joan of England]], daughter of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], died in [[Bordeaux]] on her way to Castile to marry Alfonso's son, [[Peter of Castile|Pedro]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] lost his son, while in the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]], [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne of Luxembourg]], the wife of the future [[John II of France]], died of the plague.

===Asia===

Estimates of the demographic effect of the plague in Asia are based on population figures during this time and estimates of the disease's toll on population centers. The most severe outbreak of plague, in the [[China|Chinese]] province of [[Hubei]] in 1334, claimed up to 80 percent of the population.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} China had several [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] and [[famine]]s from 1200 to the 1350s and its population decreased from an estimated 125&nbsp;million to 65&nbsp;million in the late 14th century.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Joseph J. |last=Spengler |jstor=177771 |title=Review (''Studies on the Population of China, 1368–1953'' by Ping-Ti Ho) |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |date=October 1962 |volume=5 |pages=112–14 |issue=1 |doi=10.1017/s0010417500001547}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1999-02/919734037.Mi.r.html |title=Re: How many people recovered from Black Death (Bubonic Plague) |publisher=MadSci Network |date=22 February 1999 |first=Michael |last=Maguire |at=ID: 918741314.Mi |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Worlds-long-dance-with-death/2005/01/07/1104832310525.html |title=World's long dance with death |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |first=Jonathan |last=King |date= 2005-01-08|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>

The precise demographic effect of the disease in the [[Middle East]] is very difficult to calculate. Mortality was particularly high in rural areas, including significant areas of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and [[Syria]]. Many rural people fled, leaving their fields and crops, and entire rural provinces are recorded as being totally depopulated. Surviving records in some cities reveal a devastating number of deaths. The 1348 outbreak in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] left an estimated 10,000 people dead, while [[Aleppo]] recorded a death rate of 500 per day during the same year. In [[Damascus]], at the disease's peak in September and October 1348, a thousand deaths were recorded every day, with overall mortality estimated at between 25 and 38 percent. [[Syria]] lost a total of 400,000 people by the time the epidemic subsided in March 1349. In contrast to some higher mortality estimates in Asia and Europe, scholars such as John Fields of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in Dublin believe the mortality rate in the Middle East was less than one-third of the total population, with higher rates in selected areas.

==Social, environmental, and economic effects==

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.<ref name=Bennett-329>{{cite book|title=Medieval Europe: A Short History |author1 =Judith M. Bennett |author2 =C. Warren Hollister |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |page=329 |isbn=0-07-295515-5 |oclc=56615921}}</ref> No one in the 14th century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays of suffering and death. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an Italian writer and poet of the era, questioned whether it was sent by God for their correction, or that it came through the influence of the heavenly bodies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.vt.edu/Burr/Sources.html|title=Boccaccio on the Plague|last=Boccaccio|first=Giovanni|website=Virginia Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206174129/http://www.history.vt.edu/Burr/Sources.html|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Christians accused Jews of poisoning public water supplies in an effort to ruin European civilization. The spreading of this rumor led to complete destruction of entire Jewish towns. In February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in [[Strasbourg]]. In August of the same year, the Jewish communities of [[Mainz]] and [[Cologne]] were murdered.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, 329–30.</ref>

Where government authorities were concerned, most [[monarchy|monarchs]] instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned [[underground economy|black market]] [[speculators]], set [[price controls]] on grain, and outlawed large-scale fishing. At best, they proved mostly unenforceable. At worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral. The hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour. Any grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by [[piracy|pirates]] or [[looters]] to be sold on the black market. Meanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their [[treasury]] and exacerbating [[inflation]]. In 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Malnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.

Europe had been [[Human overpopulation|overpopulated]] before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yahoo.com/|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo}}</ref> Historian [[Walter Scheidel]] contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered [[economic inequality]] by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers. He states that "the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations." This leveling effect was reversed by a "demographic recovery that resulted in renewed [[population pressure]]."<ref>{{cite book | last =  Scheidel| first = Walter | author-link =Walter Scheidel| title =The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year =2017  | isbn =978-0691165028|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html|pages=292–93, 304}}</ref> On the other hand, in the quarter century after the Black Death, it is clear that in England many labourers, artisans, and craftsmen, those living from money-wages alone,  did  suffer  a  reduction  in  real  incomes owing to rampant inflation.{{sfn|Munro|2004|p=352}} In 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348–49.<ref name=guardian811/> However, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity. See [[Medieval demography]] for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve.

===Effect on the peasantry===

The great population loss brought favourable results to the surviving peasants in England and Western Europe. There was increased social mobility, as depopulation further eroded the peasants' already weakened obligations to remain on their traditional holdings. [[Seigneurialism]] never recovered. Land was plentiful, wages high, and serfdom had all but disappeared. It was possible to move about and rise higher in life. Younger sons and women especially benefited.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jay O'Brien|author2=William Roseberry|title=Golden Ages, Dark Ages: Imagining the Past in Anthropology and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Is3mtuIZ9cC&pg=PA25|year=1991|publisher=U. of California Press|page=25|isbn=978-0-520-07018-9}}</ref> As population growth resumed, however, the peasants again faced deprivation and famine.<ref name="reference" /><ref>Barbara A. Hanawalt, "centuries of Transition: England in the Later Middle Ages," in Richard Schlatter, ed., ''Recent Views on British History: Essays on Historical Writing since 1966'' (Rutgers UP, 1984), pp. 43–44, 58</ref>

In [[Eastern Europe]], by contrast, renewed stringency of laws tied the remaining peasant population more tightly to the land than ever before through [[serfdom]]. 

Furthermore, the plague's great population reduction brought cheaper land prices, more food for the average peasant, and a relatively large increase in per capita income among the peasantry, if not immediately, in the coming century. Since the plague left vast areas of farmland untended, they were made available for pasture and put more meat on the market; the consumption of meat and dairy products went up, as did the export of beef and butter from the Low Countries, Scandinavia and northern Germany. However, the upper class often attempted to stop these changes, initially in Western Europe, and more forcefully and successfully in Eastern Europe, by instituting [[sumptuary law]]s. These regulated what people (particularly of the peasant class) could wear, so that nobles could ensure that peasants did not begin to dress and act as a higher class member with their increased wealth. Another tactic was to fix prices and wages so that peasants could not demand more with increasing value. In England, the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] was enforced, meaning no peasant could ask for more wages than in 1346.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/YALDstatute.htm|title=Statute of Labourers Act|website=Spartacus Educational}}</ref> This was met with varying success depending on the amount of rebellion it inspired; such a law was one of the causes of the 1381 [[Peasants' Revolt]] in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]].

The rapid development of the [[Use (law)|use]] was probably one of the consequences of the Black Death, during which many landowning nobility died, leaving their realty to their widows and minor orphans.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Effect on urban workers===

In the wake of the drastic population decline brought on by the plague, wages shot up and labourers could move to new localities in response to wage offers. Local and royal authorities in Western Europe instituted wage controls.<ref name=penn-356-357>{{cite journal|last1=Penn|first1=Simon A. C.|last2=Dyer|first2=Christopher|title=Wages and Earnings in Late Medieval England: Evidence from the Enforcement of the Labour Laws|journal=The Economic History Review|volume=43|issue=3|pages=356–57|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1990.tb00535.x|year=1990}}</ref> These governmental controls sought to freeze wages at the old levels before the Black Death.<ref name=penn-356-357/> Within England, for example, the [[Ordinance of Labourers]], enacted in 1349, and the [[Statute of Labourers]], enacted in 1351, restricted both wage increases and the relocation of workers.<ref name=penn-356-357/> If workers attempted to leave their current post, employers were given the right to have them imprisoned. The Statute was poorly enforced in most areas, and farm wages in England on average doubled between 1350 and 1450,<ref>Gregory Clark, "The long march of history: Farm wages, population, and economic growth, England 1209–1869," ''Economic History Review''  60.1 (2007): 97–135.

Cohn, comparing numerous countries, argues that these laws were not primarily designed to freeze wages. Instead, he says the energetic local and royal measures to control labor and artisans' prices was a response to elite fears of the greed and possible new powers of lesser classes that had gained new freedom. Cohn says the laws reflect the anxiety that followed the Black Death's new horrors of mass mortality and destruction, and from elite anxiety about manifestations such as the flagellant movement and the persecution of Jews, Catalans (in Sicily), and beggars.<ref>Samuel Cohn, "After the Black Death: Labour Legislation and Attitudes Towards Labour in Late-Medieval Western Europe," ''Economic History Review'' (2007) 60#3 pp. 457–85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4502106 in JSTOR]</ref>

===Labour-saving innovation===
By 1200, virtually all of the Mediterranean basin and most of northern Germany had been deforested and cultivated. Indigenous flora and fauna were replaced by domestic grasses and animals and domestic woodlands were lost. With depopulation, this process was reversed. Much of the primeval vegetation returned, and abandoned fields and pastures were reforested.<ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/>

The Black Death encouraged innovation of labour-saving technologies, leading to higher productivity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plagued by dear labour|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/10/economic-history-1|work=The Economist|accessdate=5 August 2014|location=London|date=21 October 2013}}</ref> There was a shift from grain farming to animal husbandry. Grain farming was very labor-intensive, but animal husbandry needed only a shepherd and a few dogs and pastureland.<ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/>

Plague brought an eventual end of Serfdom in Western Europe. The manorial system was already in trouble, but the Black Death assured its demise throughout much of western and central Europe by 1500. Severe depopulation and migration of the village to cities caused an acute shortage of agricultural labourers. Many villages were abandoned. In England, more than 1300 villages were deserted between 1350 and 1500.<ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe">{{cite book|last=Gottfried|first=Robert S.|title=The black death: natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe|year=1983|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-912630-4 |edition=1. Free Press paperback|chapter=7}}</ref> Wages of labourers were high, but the rise in nominal wages following the Black Death was swamped by post-Plague inflation, so that real wages fell.<ref name=econ/>

Labor was in such a short supply that Lords were forced to give better terms of tenure. This resulted in much lower rents in western Europe. By 1500, a new form of tenure called copyhold became prevalent in Europe. In copyhold, both a Lord and peasant made their best business deal, whereby the peasant got use of the land and the Lord got a fixed annual payment and both possessed a copy of the tenure agreement. Serfdom did not end everywhere. It lingered in parts of Western Europe and was introduced to Eastern Europe after the Black Death.<ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/>

There was change in the inheritance law. Before the plague, only sons and especially the elder son inherited the ancestral property. Post plague all sons as well as daughters started inheriting property.<ref name="The black death : natural and human disaster in Medieval Europe"/>

===Persecutions===
{{See also|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}

Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism came in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims",<ref name=nirenberg>David Nirenberg, ''Communities of Violence'', 1998, {{ISBN|0-691-05889-X}}.</ref> lepers<ref name=nirenberg/><ref>R.I. Moore ''The Formation of a Persecuting Society'', Oxford, 1987 {{ISBN|0-631-17145-2}}</ref> and [[Romani people|Romani]], thinking that they were to blame for the crisis.

Differences in cultural and lifestyle practices also led to persecution. As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating more than half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], in part because better hygiene among Jewish communities and isolation in the ghettos meant that Jews were less affected.<ref>Naomi E. Pasachoff, Robert J. Littman ''A Concise History of the Jewish People'' 2005. p. 154 "However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'. Consequently, when the rat and the flea brought the Black Death, Jews, with better hygiene, suffered less severely ..."</ref><ref>Joseph P Byrne, ''Encyclopedia of the Black Death'' Volume 1 2012. p. 15 "Anti–Semitism and Anti–Jewish Violence before the Black Death ... Their attention to personal hygiene and diet, their forms of worship, and cycles of holidays were off-puttingly different."</ref> Accusations spread that Jews had caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]].<ref>Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe After the Black Death'' 2000 p. 146 "There were several reasons for this, including, it has been suggested, the observance of laws of hygiene tied to ritual practices and a lower incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease"</ref><ref>Richard S. Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 p. 763 "Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt."</ref> European mobs attacked Jewish settlements across Europe; by 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed, and more than 350 separate massacres had occurred.

According to Joseph P. Byrne, women also faced persecution during the Black Death. Muslim women in [[Cairo]] became scapegoats when the plague struck.<ref name=byrne>Joseph P. Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004), 108.</ref> Byrne writes that in 1438, the sultan of Cairo was informed by his religious lawyers that the arrival of the plague was Allah's punishment for the sin of [[fornication]] and that in accordance with this theory, a law was set in place stating that women were not allowed to make public appearances as they may tempt men into sin. Byrne describes that this law was only lifted when "the wealthy complained that their female servants could not shop for food."<ref name=byrne/>

===Religion===

The Black Death hit the [[monastery|monasteries]] very hard because of their proximity with the sick who sought refuge there. This left a severe shortage of clergy after the epidemic cycle. Eventually the losses were replaced by hastily trained and inexperienced clergy members, many of whom knew little of the rigors of their predecessors. New colleges were opened at established universities, and the training process sped up.<ref>Steven A.

[[Flagellants]] practiced self-flogging (whipping of oneself) to atone for sins. The movement became popular after the Black Death. It may be that the flagellants' later involvement in hedonism was an effort to accelerate or absorb God's wrath, to shorten the time with which others suffered. More likely, the focus of attention and popularity of their cause contributed to a sense that the world itself was ending and that their individual actions were of no consequence.

Reformers rarely pointed to failures on the part of the Church in dealing with the catastrophe.<ref>Epstein, p. 182</ref>

==Cultural effect==

The Black Death had a profound effect on art and literature. After 1350, [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] in general turned very morbid. The general mood was one of pessimism, and contemporary art turned dark with representations of death. The widespread image of the "dance of death" showed death (a skeleton) choosing victims at random. Many of the most graphic depictions come from writers such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]].<ref>J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 372.</ref> [[Peire Lunel de Montech]], writing about 1348 in the [[lyric poetry|lyric style]] long out of fashion, composed the following sorrowful ''[[sirventes]]'' "Meravilhar no·s devo pas las gens" during the height of the plague in [[Toulouse]]:

{{quote|They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, [[Agnolo di Tura]] ... buried my five children with my own hands ... And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~afutrell/w%20civ%2002/plaguereadings.html |title=Plague readings |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=3 November 2008}}</ref>}}

Boccaccio wrote:

{{quote|How many valiant men, how many fair ladies, breakfast with their kinfolk and the same night supped with their ancestors in the next world! The condition of the people was pitiable to behold. They sickened by the thousands daily, and died unattended and without help. Many died in the open street, others dying in their houses, made it known by the stench of their rotting bodies. Consecrated churchyards did not suffice for the burial of the vast multitude of bodies, which were heaped by the hundreds in vast trenches, like goods in a ship's hold and covered with a little earth.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spignesi |first1=Stephen |title=Catastrophe!: The 100 Greatest Disasters of All Time |date=2002 |publisher=Kensington Publishing Corp |location=New York |page=1}}</ref>

===Medicine===

Although the Black Death highlighted the shortcomings of medical science in the medieval era, it also led to positive changes in the field of medicine. As described by David Herlihy in ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West,'' more emphasis was placed on "anatomical investigations" following the Black Death.<ref name=herlihy>David Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1997), 72.</ref> How individuals studied the human body notably changed, becoming a process that dealt more directly with the human body in varied states of sickness and health. Further, at this time, the importance of surgeons became more evident.<ref name=herlihy/>

A theory put forth by Stephen O'Brien says the Black Death is likely responsible, through [[natural selection]], for the high frequency of the [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] genetic defect in people of European descent. The gene affects [[T cell]] function and provides protection against [[HIV]], [[smallpox]], and possibly plague,<ref>{{cite journal | last1= Jefferys | first1= Richard | author2= Anne-christine d'Adesky | title = Designer Genes | journal = [[LPI Media#HIV Plus|HIV Plus]] | date=March 1999 | url = http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |issn=1522-3086 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214110211/http://www.aidsinfonyc.org/hivplus/issue3/ahead/genes.html |archivedate=14 February 2008 | issue=3}}</ref> though for the last, no explanation as to how it would do that exists. This, however, is now challenged, given that the CCR5-Δ32 gene has been found to be just as common in [[Bronze Age]] tissue samples.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Ground truth' for selection on CCR5-Δ32 |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |date=June 2006 |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=293–96 |author1=Philip W. Hedrick |author2=Brian C. Verrelli |pmid=16678299 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.04.007}}</ref>

===Architecture===

The Black Death also inspired European architecture to move in two different directions: (1) a revival of Greco-Roman styles, and (2) a further elaboration of the [[Gothic style]].<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 374.</ref> Late medieval churches had impressive structures centred on verticality, where one's eye is drawn up towards the high ceiling. The basic Gothic style was revamped with elaborate decoration in the late medieval period. Sculptors in Italian city-states emulated the work of their Roman forefathers while sculptors in northern Europe, no doubt inspired by the devastation they had witnessed, gave way to a heightened expression of emotion and an emphasis on individual differences.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 375.</ref> A tough realism came forth in architecture as in literature. Images of intense sorrow, decaying corpses, and individuals with faults as well as virtues emerged. North of the Alps, painting reached a pinnacle of precise realism with [[Early Dutch painting]] by artists such as [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390–by 1441). The natural world was reproduced in these works with meticulous detail whose realism was not unlike photography.<ref>Bennett and Hollister, p. 376.</ref>
