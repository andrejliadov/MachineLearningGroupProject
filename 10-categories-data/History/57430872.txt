The '''ʻAilāʻau eruption''' is a prehistoric [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Kīlauea]] [[volcano]] on the island of [[Hawaiʻi (island)|Hawaiʻi]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]].  [[Carbon 14 dating|Carbon 14 dated]] from approximately 1410 to 1470 with an eruptive volume of 5.2 ± 0.8 [[cubic kilometer|km<sup>3</sup>]] and fed by [[lava tubes]] near [[Kīlauea Iki]] [[pit crater|crater]], it was among the last of a series of highly voluminous [[lava]] flows since about 1290 that blanketed vast swaths of what is now [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawaii County]]'s [[Puna District]].  The [[Kazumura Cave]] [[lava tube]]s were also created by this eruption.<ref name="pubs.er.usgs.gov">[https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70021269 Kilauea summit overflows: Their ages and distribution in the Puna District, Hawai'i - USGS]</ref><ref name="hilo.hawaii.edu">[https://hilo.hawaii.edu/~kenhon/GEOL205/kilauea/default.htm GEOL205: Kiluea &#91;sic&#93; eruptive history - Ken Hon, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, University of Hawai'i at Hilo]</ref>  The ʻAilāʻau eruption occurred before written records, but was witnessed by [[Ancient Hawaii]]ans, and through their oral traditions it is thought to have inspired the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian myth]] of [[ʻAilāʻau]], whose name in the [[Hawaiian language]] means "forest-eater" in reference to the many forest lands consumed by lava.<ref name="www.sacred-texts.com">[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pac/hlov/hlov06.htm I.
