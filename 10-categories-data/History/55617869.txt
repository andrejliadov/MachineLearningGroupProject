In the episode ''Living with Many Gods'', MacGregor explained:<blockquote> "Choosing a title for this series turned out to be extremely difficult, because although some societies have many gods there are others that acknowledge only one, and for whom even the idea of  'gods' in the plural is offensive. And then there are some communities that share the world around them with spirits, or shifting supernatural beings, which wouldn't match our understanding of a god. And a few societies like Soviet Russia have tried to live officially with no god at all. In every case the consequences for society are profound."<ref name="Living with Many Gods">{{cite episode| title= Living with Many Gods | series= Living With The Gods| credits= Writer and presenter: [[Neil MacGregor]]; Producer: Paul Kobrak| network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09fxxks| airdate= 20 November 2017| minutes= 0:58| access-date= 20 November 2017 }}</ref></blockquote>

==Reception==
Writing in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', [[Antonia Quirke]] asked, "What makes Neil MacGregor the best presenter on BBC radio? His new 30-part series ''Living With the Gods'', about objects connected to belief, ceremony and ritual, begins on 23 October (BBC Radio 4, 9.45am), and listening to the first few episodes itâ€™s clear that it is every bit the equal of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (television series)| Civilisation]]'' or [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''. None of them could hope to find a place on television now".<ref name="New Statesman 19 October 2017">{{cite news |last= Quirke |first= Antonia | author-link= Antonia Quirke |title= Living with the Gods is 15 minutes of belief, ceremony and ritual| url= https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/10/living-gods-15-minutes-belief-ceremony-and-ritual| date= 19 October 2017|work= [[New Statesman]] |location=London| access-date=24 October 2017 }}</ref>
