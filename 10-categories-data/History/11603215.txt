The '''geological history of Earth''' follows the major events in Earth's past based on the [[geological time scale]], a system of [[Chronological dating|chronological measurement]] based on the study of the planet's rock layers ([[stratigraphy]]). Earth formed [[Age of the Earth|about 4.54 billion years ago]] by accretion from the [[solar nebula]], a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun, which also created the rest of the [[Solar System]].

Earth was initially molten due to extreme [[volcanism]] and frequent collisions with other bodies. Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid [[crust (geology)|crust]] when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The [[Moon]] formed soon afterwards, possibly as a result of the impact of a planetoid with the Earth. [[Outgassing]] and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing [[water vapor]], augmented by ice delivered from [[comet]]s, [[Origin of water on Earth|produced the oceans]]. However, more recently, in August 2020, researchers reported that [[Origin of water on Earth|sufficient water to fill the oceans]] may have always been on the [[Earth]] since the beginning of the [[Earth#Formation|planet's formation]].<ref name="SCI-20200828" /><ref name="SCI-20200827wu" /><ref name="SCI-20200827aa" />

As the surface continually reshaped itself over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They [[Plate tectonics|migrated across the surface]], occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly {{Ma|750}}, the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], {{Ma|600|540}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart {{Ma|200}}.

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}, then intensified at the end of the [[Pliocene]]. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&nbsp;years. The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&nbsp;years ago.

{{Life timeline}}
{{Main|Precambrian}}
The Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 541 [[annum|Ma]]).  It includes three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic.

Major volcanic events altering the Earth's environment and causing extinctions may have occurred 10 times in the past 3 billion years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rsquo-s-lost-history-of-planet-altering-eruptions-revealed/?WT.mc_id=SA_FB_ENGYSUS_NEWS|title=Earth's Lost History of Planet-Altering Eruptions Revealed|last=Witze|first=Alexandra|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}</ref>

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]

During the Hadean the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] occurred (approximately {{Ma|4100|3800}}) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon, and by inference on Earth, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]] as well.

=== Archean Eon ===
{{Main|Archean}}
The Earth of the early Archean ({{Ma|4000|2500}}) may have had a different tectonic style. During this time, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [[Subduction|subduct]] and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [[erosion]] and subsequent [[tectonic]] events.

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high- and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island rocks and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=302&ndash;303}}</ref>

The [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established 3.5 billion years ago. The [[solar wind]] flux was about 100 times the value of the modern [[Sun]], so the presence of the magnetic field helped prevent the planet's atmosphere from being stripped away, which is what probably happened to the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. However, the field strength was lower than at present and the [[magnetosphere]] was about half the modern radius.<ref>{{cite news | author=Staff | title=Oldest measurement of Earth's magnetic field reveals battle between Sun and Earth for our atmosphere | date=March 4, 2010 | work=Physorg.news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news186922627.html | access-date=2010-03-27 }}</ref>

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}
The geologic record of the Proterozoic ({{Ma|2500|541}}) is more complete than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=315}}</ref> Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=315&ndash;318, 329&ndash;332}}</ref> Roughly {{Ma|750}},<ref name="ICS2008">[https://www.webcitation.org/5nDdmUWXk?url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf International Stratigraphic Chart 2008, International Commission on Stratigraphy]</ref> the earliest-known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart.

The first-known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [[Snowball Earth]] of the Varangian glaciation.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=320&ndash;321, 325}}</ref>

== Phanerozoic Eon ==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The '''Phanerozoic''' Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 541&nbsp;million years. During this period continents drifted about, eventually collected into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then split up into the current continental landmasses.

The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras – the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]] and the [[Cenozoic]].

Most of the evolution of multicellular life occurred during this time period.

=== Paleozoic Era ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly {{Ma|542|251}} (Ma)<ref name="ICS2015"/> and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]; from oldest to youngest they are the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian Period|Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]]. Geologically, the [[Paleozoic]] starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [[Pannotia]] and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Paleozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==== Cambrian Period ====
{{Main|Cambrian}}
The '''Cambrian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015"/> [[Cambrian]] continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [[Neoproterozoic]] supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia]] remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [[Gondwana]] started to drift toward the South Pole. [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Iapetus Ocean]] and [[Khanty Ocean]].

==== Ordovician period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian–Ordovician extinction event]] some time about 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015"/>  During the [[Ordovician]] the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [[Baltica]] began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [[Avalonia]] broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The [[Rheic Ocean]] was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise the second-largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that became extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately {{Ma|447|444}} <ref name="ICS2015"/> and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period.

The most-commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [[isotope]]s in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=358}}</ref>  The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it. Evidence of these ice caps have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of North Africa and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

==== Silurian Period ====
{{Main|Silurian}}
The '''Silurian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015"/> During the [[Silurian]], Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]]s, recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. Other [[craton]]s and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]]. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 419 to 359 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />  The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwana drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 358.9 ± 0.4 to about 298.9 ± 0.15 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />

A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwana was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not. These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [[coal]] swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers. A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoid]]s and [[ammonite]]s especially hard. This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [[Mississippian Period]] from the [[Pennsylvanian period]].<ref name="Stanley, 414">{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=414}}</ref>

The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern [[North America]]. This continental collision resulted in the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=414&ndash;416}}</ref> In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]], and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Pangaea separation animation]]

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 298.9 ± 0.15 to 252.17 ± 0.06 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />

During the [[Permian]] all the Earth's major land masses, except portions of East Asia, were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (''[[Panthalassa]]'', the ''universal sea''), and the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

=== Mesozoic Era ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
[[File:249 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|249}}]]
[[File:290 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- {{Ma|290}}]]
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from {{Ma|252|Cenozoic}}.<ref name="ICS2015" />

After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [[Laurasia]], and a southern continent, [[Gondwana]]. This created the [[passive continental margin]] that characterizes most of the [[Atlantic]] coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' Period extends from about 252.17 ± 0.06 to 201.3 ± 0.2 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />  During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land"). This took the form of a giant "[[Pac-Man]]" with an east-facing "mouth"  constituting the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]], a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that existed during the [[Paleozoic]].

The remainder was the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic&mdash;especially late in the period&mdash;but had not yet separated. The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Supergroup]].<ref name=lasdtri>{{cite web

Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare; despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west. Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as ''Estheria'' crustaceans and terrestrial vertebrates.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sereno P.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' Period extends from about 201.3 ± 0.2 to 145.0 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]]. The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.<ref name=panjur2>{{cite web

The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerstätte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].<ref name=lasdjur>{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks – 208 to 146 million years ago |access-date= 2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930212425/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |archive-date=2014-09-30 }}</ref> Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]].

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[File:100 global.png|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma,<ref name="ICS2015" /> [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' Period extends from circa {{Ma|145.0}} to {{Ma|Paleogene}}.<ref name="ICS2015" />

During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]]-early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [[Gondwana]] itself broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide.

To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.<ref>Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.</ref> The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|p=280}}</ref> [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stanley|1999|pp=279&ndash;281}}</ref> These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk|Smoky Hill Chalk Member]] and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] and [[China]]. In the area that is now India, massive [[lava]] beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' Era covers the {{period start|Cenozoic}}&nbsp;million years since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] up to and including the present day. By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [[Laurasia]] became [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], while [[Gondwana]] split into [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], which collided with the Asian plate. This impact gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|Period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began {{period start|Paleogene}} and ended 23.03 Ma<ref name="ICS2015" /> and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] Era. This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] Epochs.

===== Paleocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Paleocene}}
The '''Paleocene''', lasted from {{Ma|Paleocene}} to {{Ma|56.0}}.<ref name="ICS2015" />

In many ways, the [[Paleocene]] continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents. [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected. [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate.<ref name="Hooker">Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. {{ISBN|0-12-636380-3}}</ref> The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward [[Europe]], slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

===== Eocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Eocene}}
During the '''[[Eocene]]''' ({{Ma|56.0}} - {{Ma|33.9}}),<ref name="ICS2015" /> the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [[equator]]ial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 [[annum|Ma]], the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{Ma|40}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart. In western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [[India]] continued its journey away from [[Africa]] and began its collision with [[Asia]], creating the [[Himalaya]]n orogeny.

===== Oligocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Oligocene}}
The '''Oligocene''' Epoch extends from about {{Ma|34}} to {{Ma|23}}.<ref name="ICS2015" /> During the [[Oligocene]] the continents continued to drift toward their present positions.

[[Antarctica]] continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [[ice cap]]. [[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north toward [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
The '''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" /> and ends at 2.588 Ma.  The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period. The Neogene consists of the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] and is followed by the [[Quaternary]] Period.

===== Miocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Miocene}}
The '''Miocene''' extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 Ma.<ref name="ICS2015" />

During the [[Miocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [[South America]] and [[North America]] was absent, the subduction zone along the [[Pacific Ocean]] margin of South America caused the rise of the [[Andes]] and the southward extension of the [[Meso-American]] peninsula. [[India]] continued to collide with [[Asia]]. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [[Africa]] collided with [[Eurasia]] in the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Arabia]]n region between 19 and 12 [[annum|Ma]] ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004). Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea resulting in the [[Messinian salinity crisis]] near the end of the Miocene.

===== Pliocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pliocene}}
The '''Pliocene''' extends from {{Ma|5.333}} to {{Ma|2.588}}.<ref name="ICS2015" />  During the [[Pliocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as {{convert|250|km|mi|0}} from their present locations to positions only 70&nbsp;km from their current locations.

South America became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[Marsupialia|marsupial]] faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Europe]] formed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [[Alaska]] and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about {{Ma|2.58}} (the start of the Quaternary Period), the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] began. The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000&nbsp;years.

==== Quaternary Period ====
{{Main|Quaternary}}

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from {{Ma|2.588}} to 11,700 years before present.<ref name="ICS2015" />  The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

===== Holocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Holocene}}
[[File:Earth dry elevation.stl|thumb|right|Current Earth - without water, elevation greatly exaggerated (click/enlarge to "spin" 3D-globe).]]
The '''Holocene''' Epoch began approximately 11,700 calendar years before present<ref name="ICS2015" /> and continues to the present. During the [[Holocene]], continental motions have been less than a kilometer.

The [[last glacial period]] of the [[Quaternary ice age|current ice age]] ended about 10,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref>{{cite web | author = Staff | url = http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | title = Paleoclimatology - The Study of Ancient Climates | publisher = Page Paleontology Science Center | access-date = 2007-03-02 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/617EaUwHQ?url=http://www.lakepowell.net/sciencecenter/paleoclimate.htm | archive-date = 2011-08-22 }}</ref> Ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|0}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about [[40th parallel north|40 degrees north]] latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]] and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [[Post-glacial rebound]] in [[Scandinavia]] resulted in the emergence of coastal areas around the [[Baltic Sea]], including much of [[Finland]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]]. The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.
