Ben-Menashe was born in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], in 1951, emigrating to Israel as a teenager.<ref name="Hutchinson">Brian Hutchinson, ''[[National Post]]'', 18 November 2011, [http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/11/18/the-unbelievable-life-of-ari-ben-menashe/ The unbelievable life of Ari Ben-Menashe]</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite news |last=Unger |first=Craig |date=October 1991 |title=October Surprise |work=Esquire |url=https://classic.esquire.com/article/1991/10/1/october-surprise |access-date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> His parents were [[Iraqi Jews]] who settled in Tehran in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ben-Menashe |first=Ari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLHxCQAAQBAJ&q=parents |title=Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network |date=2015-10-01 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=9781634240505 |pages=15 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> He claims to have served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in [[signals intelligence]] from 1974 to 1977.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ben-Menashe |first=Ari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLHxCQAAQBAJ&q=signals+intelligence |title=Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network |date=2015-10-01 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=9781634240505 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

==Intelligence career==
In 1977, Ben-Menashe joined Israel's [[Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)|Military Intelligence Directorate]]. He later said, "I happened to be the right guy at the right time. I spoke Persian, Arabic, English. I knew the United States."<ref name=Hutchinson /> In his book ''Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network'' Ben-Menashe said that following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], his Iranian background provided useful connections, with some of his school friends playing roles in the new government. These connections, Ben-Menashe said, led to his playing an intermediary role in the Israeli effort to sell arms to Iran and were close to the Israeli government decision to back the Reagan campaign's "October Surprise" efforts to ensure American hostages held by Iran and its allies were released on a timetable that strengthened [[Ronald Reagan]] and not the incumbent US President, [[Jimmy Carter]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Ben-Menashe served in the Military Intelligence Directorate until 1987, once under Moshe Hebroni, the deputy to the Directorate's Director, General [[Yehoshua Sagi]]. Hebroni told [[Craig Unger]] in 1992, "Ben-Menashe served directly under me.... He had access to very, very sensitive material."<ref name="Hebroni">[[Craig Unger|Unger, Craig]]. "The trouble with Ari" ''[[The Village Voice]]'', July 1992.</ref>

In September 1986, Ben-Menashe gave information to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' correspondent Raji Samghabadi about the weapons shipments to Iran organised by [[Richard Secord]], [[Oliver North]] and [[Albert Hakim]], which later became known as the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. ''Time'' was unable to corroborate the allegations, and Ben-Menashe later passed the information to the Lebanese ''[[Ash-Shiraa]]'',<ref name=playboy /> which published them on 3 November 1986,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Melissa Boyle Mahle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uch7kgvdqX0C&pg=PA29 |title=Denial and Deception: An Insider's View of the CIA |date=20 December 2005 |publisher=Perseus Books Group |isbn=978-0-7867-3759-8 |pages=29 |access-date=25 September 2013}}</ref> and soon led to congressional investigations.

In his book ''Profits of War'' Ben-Menashe said that he had later been Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]]'s foreign intelligence advisor, from 1987 to 1989.<ref name="Profitsxii">Ben-Menashe, Ari. ''Profits of War'', Sheridan Square Press, 1992, p. xii.</ref>

===1989 arrest===
Ben-Menashe first came to public prominence in 1989, when he was arrested in the United States on 3 November for violating the [[Arms Export Control Act]] for trying to sell three [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft to Iran that used false end-user certificates.<ref name="Hutchinson" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=February 2, 1990 |title=National Digest: 3 indicted in plane sales to Iran |page=5A |work=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Ben-Menashe |first=Ari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLHxCQAAQBAJ&q=November+3 |title=Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network |date=2015-10-01 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=9781634240505 |pages=306 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> According to Ben-Menashe, the Israeli government urged him to plead guilty,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ben-Menashe |first=Ari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLHxCQAAQBAJ&q=plead+guilty |title=Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.-Israeli Arms Network |date=2015-10-01 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=9781634240505 |pages=312 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> with officers of [[Shin Bet]] visiting his mother in [[Tel Aviv]] telling her that "it would be in my best interests to plead guilty to all charges before the Federal Superior Court [in New York] if I wished to avoid prosecution in Israel."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parry, Robert. |title=America's stolen narrative : from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |pages=106 |oclc=826027194}}</ref> According to British intelligence writer [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]], while awaiting trial at the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York|Metropolitan Correctional Center]] in New York, Ben-Menashe was visited by Israeli government lawyers, who urged him to plead guilty and, in exchange, offered him a generous financial settlement that would allow him to live comfortably after his release from prison.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Gordon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9bYAgAAQBAJ&q=plead+guilty |title=Gideon's Spies: The Inside Story of Israelâ€™s Legendary Secret Service |date=2013-02-18 |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn=9781907532573 |pages=188 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> After realizing that Israel was not going to support him, Ben-Menashe began to give interviews to journalists from prison on matters including his role in the October Surprise and its links with the [[Iran–Contra affair]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parry, Robert. |title=America's stolen narrative : from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |pages=102–103 |oclc=826027194}}</ref>

Then, Israel sought to discredit him, with efforts including an "authoritative source" telling ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' (27 March 1990) that "the Defence establishment 'never had any contacts with Ari Ben-Menashe and his activities.'"<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 27, 1990 |title=Planes for Hostages' Man Said to be an Impostor |work=Jerusalem Post}}</ref> The claims were dropped after Ben-Menashe provided ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'}}s [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] with employment references from Israeli intelligence sources.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parry |first=Robert |title=America's stolen narrative: from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |chapter=Chapter 5 |oclc=826027194}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Hersh |first=Seymour M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aalRAQAAQBAJ&q=menashe |title=The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy |date=2013-10-30 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=9780804151061 |pages=260 |language=en |url-status=live}}</ref> After almost a year in prison, he was acquitted on 28 November 1990, with a jury accepting that he had acted on behalf of Israel.<ref name=Hutchinson /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Moses |first=Paul |date=November 29, 1990 |title=Israeli Acquitted In Weapons Case |page=31 |work=Newsday}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=2 Acquitted of Trying to Sell Military Cargo Planes to Iran |language=en-US |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/11/29/2-acquitted-of-trying-to-sell-military-cargo-planes-to-iran/2918bfd6-89a7-441a-a124-3b1916e90321/ |access-date=2019-09-15 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> During his trial, Ben-Menashe's passport was presented as another piece of evidence that he was more than just a low-level Persian translator for the Israeli Defense Forces.

Ben-Menashe's lawyer asked  the jury rhetorically, "They need a Persian translator in Chile?" He then stated, "That doesn't make any sense."<ref name=":0" /> Former ''Time'' correspondent Raji Samghabadi, to whom Ben-Menashe had given details on the Iran–Contra affair before they became public, proved a key defense witness. Samghabadi testified that Ben-Menashe had told him about the US and Israeli arms deals, which would become the foundation of the Iran–Contra Affair, several months before the story broke in the Lebanese newspaper ''Ash-Shiraa'', which indicated that he had high-level inside knowledge of Israeli affairs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Moses |first=Paul |date=November 28, 1990 |title=Arms Trader or an Israeli Agent 'Out in the Cold'? |work=Newsday}}</ref><ref name="playboy" />

With Ben-Menashe's claims remaining in the public eye, in early 1991 ''[[The New Republic]]''{{'}}s [[Steven Emerson]] traveled to Israel and, on his return, described Ben-Menashe as merely a "low-level translator"{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} even though the references described Ben-Menashe as working in "key positions" and handling "complex and sensitive assignments."<ref name=":6">{{Cite news |last=Hersh |first=Seymour M. |date=1991-12-08 |title=The Iran Pipeline: A Hidden Chapter/A special report.; U.S. Said to Have Allowed Israel to Sell Arms to Iran |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/08/world/iran-pipeline-hidden-chapter-special-report-us-said-have-allowed-israel-sell.html |access-date=2019-09-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Parry |first=Robert |title=America's stolen narrative : from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |chapter=Chapter 5 |oclc=826027194}}</ref> Parry later wrote that other documents confirmed Ben-Menashe's travels: "Ben-Menashe's passports and other documents revealed that he had traveled extensively with frequent trips to Latin America, Eastern Europe, the United States and elsewhere, not exactly the record of the stay-at-home, low-level translator that Israel was trying to sell to me and other journalists."<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> Emerson also published his claims in other outlets, and ''[[Newsweek]]'' (which Parry had left in June 1990) also attacked Ben-Menashe.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<ref name="Time1991">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974150,00.html?iid=chix-sphere "Spinner of Tangled Yarns"], ''Time'', October 28, 1991.</ref> In 1992, however, Moshe Hebroni, the deputy director of the Military Intelligence Directorate, told [[Craig Unger]] that Ben-Menashe had worked directly with him and had access to sensitive material.<ref name=Hebroni /><ref name="Review">[http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2002/273/mm273.html "Ben-Menashe strikes again"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221195545/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/2002/273/mm273.html |date=2005-02-21}}, ''The Review'', Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, March 2002.</ref> Additionally, in the Israeli daily ''[[Davar]]'', the reporter Pazit Ravina wrote that "in talks with people who worked with Ben-Menashe, the claim that he had access to highly sensitive intelligence information was confirmed again and again."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parry, Robert. |title=America's stolen narrative : from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |pages=133 |oclc=826027194}}</ref>

===Public claims===
In 1990 and 1991, Ben-Menashe said that he had been personally involved in assisting the Republican campaign with its [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|October surprise]] of preventing the American hostages from being released before the 1980 election.<ref name=":1" /> He also gave [[Seymour Hersh]] information about Israel's nuclear program, which was published in Hersh's book ''The Samson Option''.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Ben-Menashe then fled to Australia and, in his application for refugee status, declared himself a victim of persecution of the Israeli and US governments.<ref name=":1" /> For his return to the US in May 1991 to testify to Congress, the journalist [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]] received a tip from an intelligence source that the US was planning to divert Ben-Menashe to Israel, where Ben-Menashe feared that he would be charged for revealing official secrets.<ref name=":1" /> With a delay to Ben-Menashe's flight, congressional investigators were able to extract assurances from the US government.<ref name=":1" />

In December 1991, Ben-Menashe's appeal against a refusal by Australia to grant him refugee status failed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Parry, Robert. |title=America's stolen narrative : from Washington and Madison to Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes to Obama |date=2012 |publisher=The Media Consortium |isbn=9781893517059 |location=Arlington, VA |pages=132 |oclc=826027194}}</ref> He left Australia and eventually settled in Canada in 1993 and gained Canadian citizenship.<ref name=Hutchinson />

In 1992, Ben-Menashe published a book about his involvement in the Iran–Contra Affair and intelligence operations on behalf of Israeli intelligence in  ''Profits of War: Inside the Secret U.S.–Israeli Arms Network''. The Israeli spy [[Rafi Eitan]] told author [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]], who wrote ''Gideon's Spies'', that Eitan had worked with Ben-Menashe on setting up the US–Israeli network for covertly supplying arms to Iran and had collaborated with Ben-Menashe on using [[Prosecutor's Management Information System]] for espionage. Sent a copy of Ben-Menashe's book, Eitan said he had no criticism of it and added that Ben-Menashe "is telling the truth.... That's why they squashed it."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Jeffrey Epstein====
Ben-Menashe claims that [[Jeffrey Epstein]], an American pedophile and child trafficker who died in prison in 2019, recorded politicians and powerful businessmen having sex with children and provided the photos to Israeli military intelligence for use as blackmail material.<ref>[Elizabeth Vos, https://consortiumnews.com/2020/06/18/epstein-case-documentaries-wont-touch-tales-of-intel-ties/, "Epstein Case: Documentaries Won't Touch Tales of Intel Ties"]</ref>

====Robert Maxwell====
Ben-Menashe claimed that [[Robert Maxwell]], the owner of [[Reach plc|Mirror Group newspapers]] in the [[United Kingdom]], was a [[Mossad]] agent and that Maxwell had tipped off the Israeli embassy in 1986 about the Israeli nuclear technician [[Mordechai Vanunu]] after Vanunu and a friend approached the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in London with a story about Israel's [[nuclear weapon|nuclear capability]].<ref>Robert Verkaik [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-6107041.html "The mystery of Maxwell's death"], ''The Independent'', 10 March 2006</ref> Vanunu was subsequently lured by Mossad from London to Rome, kidnapped, returned to Israel, and sentenced to 18 years in jail. According to  Ben-Menashe, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''{{'}}s foreign editor, [[Nicholas Davies (journalist)|Nicholas Davies]], worked for the Mossad and was involved in the Vanunu affair. No British newspaper would publish the Maxwell allegations because of his [[slander and libel|litigiousness]] reputation. However, Ben-Menashe was used as a key source by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''The New York Times'' journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] for his book about Israel's nuclear weapons, ''[[The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy]]'', published in Britain in 1991 by [[Faber and Faber]].<ref name=":2" /> Hersh included the allegations about Maxwell, Davies, and Vanunu in the book.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hersh, Seymour M. |title=The Samson Option : Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy |isbn=0-394-57006-5 |edition=1st |location=New York |pages=312–315 |oclc=24609770}}</ref> Davies's former wife, [[Janet Fielding]], also confirmed in the book that she knew Ben-Menashe was an Israeli intelligence operative and that Menashe and Davies were business partners in an arms company, which was involved in the [[Israel's role in the Iran–Iraq war|sale of arms for Israel to Iran]] during the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hersh, Seymour M. |title=The Samson Option : Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy |isbn=0-394-57006-5 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=24609770}}</ref> When Hersh asked Fielding whether she knew Ben-Menashe was an Israeli intelligence operative, she responded, "It wasn't difficult to put two and two together. Do you think I'm bloody stupid? I shut my ears and walked [out of the marriage with Davies]."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hersh, Seymour M. |title=The Samson Option : Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy |isbn=0-394-57006-5 |edition=1st |location=New York |pages=311 |oclc=24609770}}</ref>

On October 21, 1991, two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[George Galloway]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Rupert Allason]] (who writes spy novels under the pseudonym Nigel West)<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sean O'Neill |date=2001-10-16 |title=Spy writer branded a liar by judge faces prosecution |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1359641/Spy-writer-branded-a-liar-by-judge-faces-prosecution.html |access-date=2009-03-23}}</ref> agreed to raise the issue in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which enabled newspapers to claim [[parliamentary privilege]] and to report the allegations. Davies was subsequently fired from the ''Daily Mirror'' for gross misconduct. Maxwell issued a writ for [[libel]] against Faber and Faber as well as Hersh and allegedly told Davies that the ''Mirror'' editor had threatened to resign if Davies was not fired but that he would get his job back when the dust settled.

Two weeks later, on November 5, 1991, Maxwell fell from his yacht, the ''Lady Ghislaine''. Ben-Menashe claimed that Maxwell had been assassinated by Mossad for trying to [[blackmail]] it.

On November 12, [[Matthew Evans, Baron Evans of Temple Guiting|Matthew Evans]], the chairman of Faber and Faber, called a press conference in London to say he had evidence that Ben-Menashe was telling the truth about Davies. Evans read out a statement from Hersh, who said he had documentation showing meetings between Davies, unnamed Mossad officers, and "Cindy" (Cheryl Bentov), the woman who lured Vanunu to Rome. Evans and Hersh were later shown to have themselves been the subject of a [[sting operation]] by Joe Flynn, [[Fleet Street]]'s most celebrated [[confidence trick|con man]]. Evans had met Flynn in Amsterdam and paid him £1,200 for the forged documents.

====October Surprise====
Ben-Menashe testified in 1991 that he had personally witnessed [[George HW Bush]] attend a meeting with members of the Iranian government in Paris in October 1980, as part of a covert [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] operation to have the 52 U.S hostages held in Iran remain there until President [[Jimmy Carter]], who was negotiating their release, had lost the 1980 presidential election to [[Ronald Reagan]]. ''Time'' called him a "spinner of tangled yarns,"<ref name=Time1991 /> and ABC News claimed he failed a lie-detector test: on a scale of reliability from zero to minus eight, he scored minus eight or minus seven on major questions.<ref name="Davies">Davies, Nick. ''The Unknown Maxwell''. Sidgwick & Jackson, 1992.</ref> In 1992, the American journalist Craig Unger of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote: "Ari has put five or six dozen journalists from all over the world through roughly the same paces. His seduction begins with a display of his mastery of the trade craft of the legendary Israeli intelligence services. A roll of quarters handy for furtive phone calls, he navigates the back channels that tie the spooks at [[Central Intelligence Agency|Langley]] to their counterparts in [[Tel Aviv]]. His astute analysis and mind-boggling revelations can stir even the most jaded old hand of the Middle East.... Listen to him, trust him, print his story verbatim—then sit round and watch your career go up in flames."<ref name="Hebroni" />

In its report published January 3, 1993, the [[House October Surprise Task Force]] investigating the [[October Surprise conspiracy theory|"October surprise" allegations]] stated, "Ben-Menashe's testimony is impeached by documents and is riddled with inconsistencies and factual misstatements which undermine his credibility. Based on the documentary evidence available, the Task Force has determined that Ben-Menashe's account of the October meetings, like his other October Surprise allegations, is a total fabrication."<ref name="October Surprise Task Force">{{Cite book |last=Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 |title=Joint report of the Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980 ("October Surprise Task Force") |date=January 3, 1993 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=148 |hdl=2027/mdp.39015060776773 |oclc=27492534 |id=H.

==Business career==

===Zimbabwe===
Ben-Menashe again came to the attention of the international media in 2002, when he alleged that [[Morgan Tsvangirai]], the leader of [[Zimbabwe]]'s opposition party, the [[Movement for Democratic Change (1999–2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]], had asked him to help "eliminate" President [[Robert Mugabe]]. Ben-Menashe produced a videotape of conversations between himself and Tsvangirai in London, England, and Montreal, where the latter appeared to ask for Ben-Menashe's help as a political consultant. Unknown to Tsvangirai, Ben-Menashe's Montreal consultancy firm at the time, Dickens and Madson, was working for Mugabe, and tapes of the ambiguous conversation were passed to the Zimbabwean authorities, which charged Tsvangirai with [[treason]], which is punishable by death in that country.<ref name="Meldrum">Meldrum, Andrew; MacAskill, Ewan; McGreal, Chris; and Barkham, Patrick. [https://www.theguardian.com/GWeekly/Story/0,,660272,00.html "Tsvangirai accused of treason"], ''The Guardian'', February 28, 2002.</ref>

Tsvangirai was put on trial for [[treason]] before the [[Harare]] High Court but was exonerated in October 2004 after the judge accepted he had not used the word "eliminate" to mean that he wanted Mugabe to be [[assassination|assassinated]].<ref name="CBCOct15">[https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-opposition-leader-cleared-of-treason-charge-1.479610 "Zimbabwe opposition leader cleared of treason charge"], CBC, October 15, 2004.</ref> Judge Paddington Garwe described Ben-Menashe, who was the prosecution's star witness, as "rude, unreliable, and contemptuous."<ref name="Thornycroft">Thornycroft, Peta & Blair, David.

Ben-Menashe was hired by [[Paul Le Roux]], an international [[drug lord]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Montemayor |first=Stephen |date=February 14, 2016 |title=How Minnesota agents helped find Paul Le Roux, and how the mastermind may again find freedom |url=http://www.startribune.com/how-minnesota-agents-helped-find-paul-le-roux-and-how-the-mastermind-may-again-find-freedom/368736611/ |access-date=2 April 2016 |website=StarTribune}}</ref> born in the former Rhodesia to lobby the Zimbabwe government to grant leases to Zimbabwean farmlands.

===Personal and business controversies===
Ben-Menashe moved to Sydney, Australia, in 1992, then to [[Montreal]], Canada, where he married a Canadian woman and became a citizen. He was arrested in 2002 during acrimonious divorce proceedings and charged with assault, following complaints by his wife and mother-in-law, but he was subsequently acquitted. He set up Carlington Sales Canada Corporation, which was accused of taking payments for shipments of grain that allegedly never materialized, according to Canada's ''National Post'' (July 25, 2005). Ben-Menashe's American business partner, Alexander Legault, was arrested in October 2008 while he was being deported back into the United States after a failed refugee claim in Canada. He had been wanted on $10,000,000 bond by the FBI since 1986 on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, organized fraud, mail fraud, and unregulated security in Florida and Louisiana.<ref name="fugitive">{{Cite web |date=2008-10-11 |title=Fugitive nabbed |url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=d201993c-3da2-4821-8221-f375a4429b97&p=3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129133711/http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=d201993c-3da2-4821-8221-f375a4429b97&p=3 |archive-date=2013-01-29 |access-date=2008-12-28 |website=National Post}}</ref>

Documents obtained in 2002 by Canadian journalists under [[feeedoym of information in Canada|Canada's freedom of information legislation]] show that Ben-Menashe had a relationship with the Canadian government: "over 400 pages showing Ben-Menashe was regularly de-briefed by Canadian intelligence officers, plumbed about what he knew of the inner workings of the governments he was involved with."<ref name="cbc disclosure" />

In June 2005, Alexander Vassiliev of Sonox International, a Florida-based food export company, told the ''National Post'' that he had wired a deposit of US$336,000 to Ben-Menashe's former company, Albury Grain Sales, which undertook to ship 12,000 tonnes of soybeans from North America to a Sonox agent in [[Uzbekistan]]. Vassiliev alleged that the soybeans did not arrive. The case went to court and was dismissed and then referred to arbitration, where it was again dismissed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sonox Sia v.
