'''Time immemorial''' ({{lang-fr|temps imm√©morial}}) is a phrase meaning time extending beyond the reach of [[memory]], [[Recorded history|record]], or [[tradition]], [[wikt:indefinitely|indefinitely]] [[ancient]], "ancient beyond memory or record".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary (1971 ed.), Vol. I, p. 63c</ref>

In [[law]], it means that a [[property]] or [[legal benefit|benefit]] has been enjoyed for so long that its owner does not have to prove how they came to own it. In [[English law]] and its derivatives, "time immemorial" means the same as "time out of mind",<ref>Blackstone (1765) ''Commentary'' I viii 281</ref> "a time before legal history and beyond legal memory".<ref>The [[public domain]] Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)</ref> In 1275, by the first [[Statute of Westminster 1275|Statute of Westminster]], the time of memory was limited to the reign of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I]], beginning 6 July 1189, the date of the king's [[accession day|accession]].<ref>[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517436 Statute of Westminster, The First] (3 Edw. I cap. 5)</ref> Since that date, proof of unbroken [[possession_(law)|possession]] or use of any right made it unnecessary to establish the original grant under certain circumstances.

The [[Prescription Act 1832]], which noted that the full expression was "time immemorial, or time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/2-3/71/data.htm|title=Prescription Act 1832|first=Expert|last=Participation|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> replaced the [[common law]] burden of proving "time immemorial" for the enjoyment of particular land rights with statutory fixed time periods of up to 60 years.
