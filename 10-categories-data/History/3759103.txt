'''Anno Lucis''' (“in the Year of Light”) is a dating system used in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian year]] plus 4000. It is similar to ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.

==Description==
For example, a date [[Anno Domini]] (AD) {{CURRENTYEAR}} becomes Anno Lucis (AL) {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+4000}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/# | title = What is the Masonic Calendar? | author =  | accessdate = 2006-07-06 | publisher = Library and Museum Charitable Trust of the United Grand Lodge of England | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160726081821/http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/ | archive-date = 2016-07-26 | url-status = dead }}</ref> This [[calendar era]], which would designate 4001 BC as '[[year zero]]', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the ''Anno Mundi'' era dating system used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the [[Dating creation|year of creation]].

After the [[Masoretic]] text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.<ref>''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.</ref> Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades.<ref name=Jones26>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsITeHwP9K0C&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=%22date+of+creation%22+%22no+dispute%22&f=false |title=Chronology of the Old Testament: Solving the Bible's Most Intriguing Mysteries |author=Floyd Nolen Jones |publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-89051-416-0 |page=26 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref> Notably, [[Isaac Newton]]'s calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC.<ref name=Jones26/> 

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, [[Ussher chronology|Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Protestant Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: October 23, 4004 B.C |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}</ref> The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by [[Hillel II]], dated the creation to 3761 BC,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |title=Definition of Jewish Calendar from |publisher=dictionary.net |accessdate=2012-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119080838/http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |archive-date=2011-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |title=The Jewish Calendar and Biblical Authority |publisher=Askelm.com |accessdate=2012-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074827/http://askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}</ref> in accordance with the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' compiled by [[Jose ben Halafta]] in AD 160, and in agreement with ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', in which the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] identifies ''anno mundi'' as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]], but not with ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'', which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.<ref>Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.</ref>
