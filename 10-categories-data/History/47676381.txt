The '''2015 Bojangles' Southern 500''', the 66th running of the [[Bojangles' Southern 500|event]], was a [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] race held on September 6, 2015, at [[Darlington Raceway]] in [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. Contested over 367 laps on the 1.366 mile (2.198&nbsp;km) egg-shaped speedway, it was the 25th race of the [[2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] season. [[Carl Edwards]] won the race, the 25th of his career. [[Brad Keselowski]] finished second. [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Joey Logano]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] rounded out the top five.

Keselowski won the pole for the race. He led a race high of 196 laps on his way to a runner–up finish. The race had 24 lead changes among 11 different drivers, as well as 18 caution flag periods for 89 laps.

This was the 25th career victory for Carl Edwards, second of the season, first at Darlington Raceway and fifth at the track for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]]. The win moved Edwards up to 12th in the drivers points standings 235 behind Kevin Harvick. Despite being the winning manufacturer, [[Toyota]] left Darlington trailing [[Chevrolet]] by 63–points in the manufacturer standings.

The Bojangles' Southern 500 was carried by [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC Sports]] on the broadcast [[NBC]] network for the American television audience. The radio broadcast for the race was carried by the [[Motor Racing Network]] and [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM]] [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio|NASCAR Radio]].

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of [[Darlington Raceway]], the track where the race was held]]
'''Darlington Raceway''', nicknamed by many NASCAR fans and drivers as "The Lady in Black" or "The Track Too Tough to Tame" and advertised as a "NASCAR tradition", is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that will be effective at both ends.

[[Kevin Harvick]] entered Darlington with a 43–point lead over [[Joey Logano]]. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] entered 89 back. [[Brad Keselowski]] entered 115 back. [[Jimmie Johnson]] entered 116 back.

====Return to Labor Day====
{{quote box|quote="[[Auto Club Speedway]] and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] did their best to maintain the tradition of Sprint Cup Series racing on the final holiday weekend of the summer, but both came up short. Thankfully, the sanctioning body shuffled a handful of races on this year's schedule to put the [[Bojangles' Southern 500]] back where it began in 1950."source=[[Motor Racing Network]] lead writer and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]] Pete Pistone giving his thoughts on the return of the Bojangles' Southern 500 to Labor Day weekend<ref name="Opinion: Back Where It Belongs" >{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Opinion-Bojangles-Southern-500-Back-Where-It-Belongs.aspx|title=Opinion: Back Where It Belongs|last=Pistone|first=Pete|publisher=Motor Racing Network|date=September 2, 2015|website=MRN.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904083550/http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Opinion-Bojangles-Southern-500-Back-Where-It-Belongs.aspx|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>|width=40%|align=right}}
From 1950 to 2003, the Bojangles' Southern 500 was run on [[Labor Day]] weekend in late-August or early-September. For the 2004 season, the race (then known as the '''Mountain Dew Southern 500''') was moved to the penultimate race of the season while a second race at [[Auto Club Speedway]] was added into the Labor Day spot. This lasted for five seasons before it moved to October. [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] moved to the Labor Day spot and remained there from 2009 to 2014. During that time, the Southern 500 moved up to [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]] weekend in May 2005 and remained there for eight years. It then moved to mid-April for 2014. In August of that year, NASCAR announced that the Southern 500 would return to Labor Day weekend for the first time in 12 years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Darlington regains Labor Day event|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/11414383/darlington-raceway-gets-labor-day-weekend-back-next-year|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=ESPN News Services|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=August 26, 2014}}</ref>

Members of the NASCAR media gave their thoughts on the return to Labor Day weekend. Pete Pistone of the [[Motor Racing Network]] said that Labor Day weekend in Auto Club "never felt right," Labor Day weekend in Atlanta "was better but still not quite there," that Darlington Raceway "fits like a glove" and is "back to where you belong, Bojangles' Southern 500. Don't ever go away again."<ref name="Opinion: Back Where It Belongs" />

In ESPN.com's weekly Turn 4 series, NASCAR analysts and writers [[Ricky Craven]], Ryan McGhee, John Oreovicz, and Bob Pockrass answered the week's question "Why did it take so long for NASCAR to move the Labor Day race back to Darlington[.]"<ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" >{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/page/turn420150903/nascar-burning-questions|title=As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger|last1=Craven|last2=McGhee|last3=Oreovicz|last4=Pockrass|first1=Ricky|first2=Ryan|first3=John|first4=Bob|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=September 3, 2015|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> Craven said that he "wasn't sure" but "[f]ew things are more powerful in sports than the power of tradition. This race is synonymous with Labor Day weekend. Moving it to a spring race felt like inviting Santa Claus to Halloween."<ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /> McGhee said that going back meant "admitting a mistake. NASCAR doesn't like that. Otherwise, we would have gone back to the 2014 aero package six months ago."<ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /> Oreovicz said it most likely was because NASCAR "doesn't do anything until [they decide] it's a good idea, no matter how popular the idea might be to the masses. But this is another sign that NASCAR is actually listening to its constituents a bit more these days."<ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" /> Pockrass said that "[s]tubbornness and refusal to admit failure" was his guess and that it was "one of NASCAR's most head-scratching moves in trying to build the sport. NASCAR should have never messed with this tradition in the first place. NASCAR didn't belong in California on Labor Day weekend. It didn't belong in Atlanta. It belongs in Darlington, South Carolina. And it's back. Finally."<ref name="As the Chase looms, Darlington looms larger" />

Jordan Bianchi of ''[[SB Nation]]'' said that there are traditions that are "just too important. They are the institutions that shouldn't be tampered with under almost any circumstance, worthy of being shared from one generation to the next."<ref name="A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend" >{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2014/8/27/6073033/nascar-2015-schedule-darlington-raceway-southern-500-labor-day|title=A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend|last=Bianchi|first=Jordan|publisher=[[Vox Media, Inc.]]|date=September 2, 2015|website=sbnation.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> He also added that by returning "Darlington to Labor Day weekend, NASCAR has righted a wrong; even if it was a tradition that should have never been abandoned in the first place."<ref name="A tradition restored: NASCAR returns to Darlington on Labor Day weekend" />

Mike Hembree of ''[[USA Today]]'' called the initial decision of moving the race from Labor Day weekend "[s]ports blasphemy of the highest order" and its return to Labor Day weekend as being "back where, as people in this farming section of South Carolina will tell you, God meant it to be."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=NASCAR restores beloved tradition with Darlington's move back to Labor Day|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/02/darlington-southern-500-labor-day-weekend-tradition-history/71600684/|accessdate=September 2, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 4, 2015|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}</ref>

====Change to the track====
Since its most recent Sprint Cup Series race in [[2014 Bojangles' Southern 500|April 2014]], Darlington Raceway added {{Convert|4,600|ft|m|abbr=on}} of additional [[SAFER barrier]] to both the front and backstretch walls.<ref name="Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways" >{{cite web|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/04/darlington-raceway-adds-safer-barrier-on-straightaways/|title=Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways|last=Long|first=Dustin|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 4, 2015|website=nascartalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref> This made Darlington the second track on the Sprint Cup schedule, after Bristol, to line the entire circumference of the outside retaining wall with the energy-absorbing barrier.<ref name="Darlington Raceway adds SAFER barrier on straightaways" />

For this race, NASCAR redesigned the restart zone so that it would be more visible and eliminate driver complaints about "jumped restarts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-redesigns-its-restart-zone|title=NASCAR redesigns its restart zone|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 4, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref>

====Aero package====
For this race, teams used the low-downforce aero package that was used at [[2015 Quaker State 400|Kentucky Speedway]].<ref name="New rules coming at several tracks this season" >{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2015/7/7/rules-package-sprint-cup-darlington-low-downforce-kentucky-indianapolis-michigan.html|title=New rules coming at several tracks this season|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|date=July 7, 2015|website=NASCAR.com|accessdate=August 31, 2015}}</ref> This package included a {{Convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} spoiler (reduced from {{Convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}), a {{Convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} radiator pan (reduced from {{Convert|38|in|cm|abbr=on}}) and a quarter inch (.64&nbsp;cm) leading edge splitter.<ref name="New rules coming at several tracks this season" />

====New tire compound====
For this weekend's race, [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] brought a softer tire compound to go with the low-downforce package.<ref name="NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington" >{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-s-low-downforce-aero-package-gets-tires-to-match-at-darlington/|title=NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 1, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}</ref> These changes included different construction and mold shapes for the left-side tires and the right-side tires would provide more grip.<ref name="NASCAR's low-downforce aero package gets tires to match at Darlington" />

====Throwback paint schemes====
In celebration of the event, 32 of the 46 teams entered for this weekend's race unveiled throwback and special paint schemes as part of the return of the Bojangles' Southern 500 to Labor Day weekend.<ref>{{cite news|last=Iacobelli|first=Pete|title=Darlington's iconic Southern 500 to feature throwback paint schemes|url=http://www.timesnews.net/article/9091434/darlingtons-iconic-southern-500-to-feature-throwback-paint-schemes|accessdate=September 4, 2015|work=[[Kingsport Times-News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=Kingsport Publishing Corporation|date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Chip Wile, track president of Darlington Raceway and brainchild of the throwback idea, had initially thought maybe eight or 10 teams could be persuaded to take part in this and get more teams to do it next season.<ref name="Gluck: Throwback paint schemes just what Darlington needed" >{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Gluck: Throwback paint schemes just what Darlington needed|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/03/darlington-southern-500-retro-paint-schemes-throwback-weekend/71670972/|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 3, 2015|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]}}</ref> He told Jeff Gluck of ''USA Today'' that he thought "this is bigger than what people imagined what it would be in [y]ear [one]" and that he thought "the sport needed this.

Each run out you lose so much grip in the tires, it’s a challenge to try to find the right balance and it turns into fun," [[Kurt Busch]] said. Our first run out the car was almost too fast. The car almost drove too good."<ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" /> "We were fairly good in the first two rounds. I felt like I could have pushed harder in those two rounds to go faster; and that last round, we just kind of missed the balance on our Chevrolet," [[Kevin Harvick]] said. I feel a lot better about it in race trim than I did in qualifying trim. We try to concentrate on that the most because there is so much falloff."<ref name="Keselowski Wins Darlington Pole" />

==Race==

===First half===

====Start====
Under overcast [[South Carolina]] evening skies, [[Brad Keselowski]] led the field to the green flag at 7:24&nbsp;p.m. and led the first lap. He pulled to a one-second lead over [[Kevin Harvick]] after five laps. The first caution of the race flew on lap 7 for a three-car spin on the backstretch.<ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" >{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/chase-elliott-darlington-raceway-bojangles-southern-500-goes-around-early-090615|title=Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500|last=Pennell|first=Jay|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|date=September 6, 2015|website=FoxSports.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref> This began when [[Brett Moffitt]] hit the wall while exiting turn 2.<ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" /> In an accordion fashion, [[Cole Whitt]] slammed into the rear of his car and [[Chase Elliott]] slammed into the rear of his car, sending both of them in a spin.<ref name="Chase Elliott goes around early in Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 14. Unlike [[2014 Bojangles' Southern 500|last year's race]], the bottom line appeared to be the preferred restart lane. Unlike the initial start, Keselowski didn't simply pull away as [[Kurt Busch]] reeled him in. Suddenly, [[Matt Kenseth]], running third, got real sideways and slapped the wall exiting turn 2. This gave him an unscheduled stop three laps later. Eventually, Keselowski began to pull away from Busch. The second caution flew on lap 44 when [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] got loose in turn 3, saved it, got loose again, and spun out in turn 4.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" >{{Cite episode|title=2015 Bojangles' Southern 500|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsLEyLJ1vSU|accessdate=September 14, 2015|series=Sprint Cup Series|series-link=Sprint Cup Series|network=NBC Sports|station=NBC|location=Darlington, South Carolina|date=August 22, 2015|season=67|time=7:47 p.m.|language=English}}</ref>

The race restarted on lap 51. Debris on the frontstretch brought out the third caution on lap 61. [[Kasey Kahne]] opted to make just a two-tire pit stop and exited with the lead. [[Carl Edwards]] opted not to pit and assumed that position, putting Kahne in second.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 66. That same lap, Edwards was passed by Kahne for the lead. Three laps later, [[Denny Hamlin]], on four new tires, passed Kahne for the lead. The fourth caution flew on lap 108 when [[Michael Annett]] got loose in turn 2 and spun down the backstretch.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

====Second quarter====
The race restarted on lap 115. Keselowski drove around the outside of Hamlin in turn 2 to take the lead on lap 119. The fifth caution flew on lap 122 when [[Mike Bliss]] cut down his right-front tire on the backstretch and slammed the wall in turn 3. [[Kyle Busch]] opted not to pit and assumed the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 125. The sixth caution flew on that same lap when [[J. J. Yeley]] apparently made contact with Annett in turn 3 and destroyed the protective foam on the driver's side of his car.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 133. The seventh caution of the race flew on lap 134 when [[Jimmie Johnson]] drifted down into the path of [[Joey Logano]] and spun out exiting turn 4.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

It felt like that it was definitely more sudden and something that I wasn’t expecting. It is definitely possible that it just got loose. For a few laps before that I felt like I could pull the yaw pretty easily through (Turns) 3 and 4. The one thing about Darlington is you definitely run a lot of lines here. I was running – I felt better lower than higher, so at times I was a lane or two below the dotted line. Debris is just something that happens here because we are using so much track, but I’m not 100 percent sure could have just got loose. But, it could have been a cut tire too, just not sure.

===Second half===

====Halfway====
The race restarted on lap 195. The 10th caution of the race flew on lap 198 when [[Ricky Stenhouse, Jr.]] got loose, slid down the track, and slammed the inside wall in turn 4. There, [[T. J. Bell]] and [[Alex Bowman]] made contact and both slammed the wall.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 203. Kurt Busch drove past Keselowski exiting turn 2 to take the lead. The 11th caution of the race flew on lap 208 when Kyle Busch apparently made contact with [[Greg Biffle]] sending both spinning. [[Kyle Larson]] opted not to pit and assumed the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 212. Larson was passed by Stewart for the lead. Later, Hamlin drove under Stewart to retake that position on lap 223. The 12th caution of the race flew on lap 229 when Elliott blew his right-front tire out and hit the outside wall. Hamlin swapped the lead with Harvick on pit road as the former pitted before the start/finish line, and the latter left pit road with the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 238. The 13th caution of the race flew on lap 246 when [[Trevor Bayne]] cut down his right-rear tire and spun in turn 4. Logano opted not to pit and assumed the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 252. The 14th caution of the race flew on lap 265 when [[David Ragan]] got loose, slid down the track, and hit the inside wall on the frontstretch. Kyle Busch opted not to pit and assumed the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 270. Busch botched the restart and Joey Logano retook the lead. The 15th caution of the race flew on lap 279 when Ragan got hooked into the outside wall by [[Paul Menard]], turned down the track, and slammed the inside wall.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

====Fourth quarter====
[[File:Carl Edwards at the Daytona 500 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|[[Carl Edwards]], seen here at the [[2015 Daytona 500]], scored his 25th career victory in the Bojangles' Southern 500.]]
The race restarted on lap 283. Debris in turn 1 brought out the 16th caution of the race on lap 300.  Keselowski beat Harvick off pit road to retake the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted on lap 306. The 17th caution of the race flew with 60 laps to go when Martin Truex, Jr. tapped the rear of Kurt Busch and sent him spinning.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted with 55 laps to go. With 50 to go, Harvick began putting pressure on race leader Keselowski. He had the momentum to pull off the pass exiting turn 2 with 45 to go, but he bobbled on the exit and Keselowski remained in the lead. Edwards pulled to Harvick and began pressuring him for second. Edwards edged Keselowski at the line with 22 laps to go and Brad took back the lead the next lap. The 18th caution of the race, a new track record, came out with 13 laps to go when [[Jeb Burton]] made contact with Johnson and spun out. This was a new world record for the most cautions in the Southern 500. Edwards beat Keselowski off pit road to retake the lead.<ref name="2015 Bojangles' Southern 500" />

The race restarted with eight laps to go. Edwards drove off to score his 25th career victory at Darlington Raceway.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Carl Edwards wins Southern 500 at Darlington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/07/carl-edwards-wins-southern-500-darlington/71830224/|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}</ref>

====Media comments====
{{quote box|quote="The second race with a lower downforce aerodynamic package didn’t seem to have the overall dramatic results like what was seen at Kentucky in July. Certainly a huge part of the reason is the unique layout of Darlington, which is nowhere near as wide as Kentucky or has a racing surface as worn out. But there were some interesting battles for position during the 500-mile grind, particularly in the closing laps. However, the drivers were very optimistic heading into the race and gave it glowing reviews after the race. Overall it appears this is the direction NASCAR will head in creating 2016 rules packages. Goodyear’s tire seemed to perfectly fit the package and drivers needed to manage their rubber all race long to combat fall off. The sanctioning body will sift through the data acquired from Sunday’s race and solicit input from the garage area before making any final decisions.’’|source=[[Motor Racing Network]] lead writer and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]] Pete Pistone giving his thoughts on the Bojangles' Southern 500.<ref name="Darlington Rear-View Mirror" >{{cite web|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Darlington-Rear-View-Mirror.aspx|title=Darlington Rear-View Mirror|last=Pistone|first=Pete|publisher=Motor Racing Network|date=September 7, 2015|website=MRN.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909022553/http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2015/09/Darlington-Rear-View-Mirror.aspx|archive-date=September 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>|width=40%|align=right}}

Members of the NASCAR media gave their opinions of the second race with the low-downforce aero package. Pete Pistone, lead writer for the [[Motor Racing Network]] and co-host of ''The Morning Drive'' on [[Sirius XM NASCAR Radio]], said that this race "didn’t seem to have the overall dramatic results like what was seen at Kentucky in July," but that "there were some interesting battles for position during the 500-mile grind, particularly in the closing laps" and that "the drivers were very optimistic heading into the race and gave it glowing reviews after the race."<ref name="Darlington Rear-View Mirror" />

Jeff Gluck of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that while "the Southern 500 was a grueling marathon and a caution fest that lasted more than four and a half hours..., it also was a very entertaining race that featured tight battles for the lead and the kind of tire falloff that helped NASCAR rise to popularity in the first place."<ref name="Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington" >{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|title=Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/07/darlington-southern-500-carl-edwards-low-downforce-rules-package-hit-2016/71832922/|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]}}</ref> He also said that it was "exactly what the sport needed – confirmation the package is indeed the right direction to go after Kentucky already was a major success."<ref name="Gluck: NASCAR should take 2016 direction from Darlington" />

Jim Utter of [[Motorsport.com]], factoring in the opinions of drivers and NASCAR on the package, said that if there was "such a thing as a consensus in NASCAR, the low-downforce aerodynamics package debuted at Kentucky earlier this season may be as close as the sport gets to it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/nascar-and-drivers-praise-darlington-aero-package|title=NASCAR and drivers praise Darlington aero package|last=Utter|first=Jim|publisher=Motorsport.com, Inc.|date=September 7, 2015|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

John Oreovicz of [[ESPN.com]] said "the star of the show was NASCAR's low drag aero package" and that "[i]f the high-drag package run at Indianapolis and Michigan can almost unquestionably be called a failure, the low-drag package has proven to provide almost everything the drivers have asked for.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/story/_/page/MondayRundown20150907/nascar-low-drag-package-was-no-drag-darlington|title=Monday Rundown: Sprint Cup's low-drag package entertaining|last=Oreovicz|first=John|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|date=September 7, 2015|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

[[Larry McReynolds]] of [[Fox Sports]] said he doesn't "know how in the world anybody can complain about what we saw at Darlington on Sunday night" and that while he understands "the race was long...the racing was good. I know there will be some debate about a four-and-a-half-hour race. I am normally the one that's beating the drum that we don't need to be doing that as our society has outgrown that. This was a very special event, and I don't think it needs to change."<ref>{{cite web|last=McReynolds|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry McReynolds|title=A tip of the hat: Larry Mac likes what he saw at the 'Lady in Black'|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/darlington-raceway-southern-500-race-recap-larry-mcreynolds-carl-edwards-090815|website=FoxSports.com|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=September 8, 2015}}</ref>

[[Darrell Waltrip]] of Fox Sports said he thought "Sunday was a great example of why there is so much passion within our sport about Darlington" and that he thought "the aero package seems to be the way to go. It worked at Kentucky and it seemed to work Sunday night. These cars have a lot of downforce built into the body anyway, so we don't need that big huge spoiler on the back of the car."<ref>{{cite web|last=Waltrip|first=Darrell|authorlink=Darrell Waltrip|title=Embracing your past: DW breaks down the throwback weekend at Darlington|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/embracing-your-past-dw-breaks-down-the-throwback-weekend-at-darlington-090815|website=FoxSports.com|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=September 9, 2015|date=September 8, 2015}}</ref>

Nate Ryan of [[NBC Sports]] said that it would "be better if NASCAR bravely calls an audible for the Chase and institutes the low-downforce package that met with smashingly positive reviews at Kentucky Speedway and Darlington Raceway. The mantra from NASCAR over the past six years has been that fan satisfaction should supersede everything in determining its direction. Whether installing double-file restarts or making three attempts at a green-white-checkered finish, there often has been little fair to competitors about the recent initiatives aimed at increasing the entertainment value. The same concept holds true for low downforce."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2015/09/09/ryan-low-downforce-should-be-high-priority-in-chase/|title=Ryan: Low downforce should be high priority in NASCAR Chase|last=Ryan|first=Nate|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 9, 2015|website=nascartalk.nbcsports.com|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}</ref>
