'''American exceptionalism''' is the theory that the United States is inherently different from other nations,<ref name="amerExcep">[https://archive.org/details/americanexceptio00lips/page/n21 <!-- pg=18 --> ''American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.''] Seymour Martin Lipset.

This ideology itself is often referred to as "American exceptionalism."<ref name=Lipset1997>Lipset, ''American Exceptionalism'', pp. 1, 17–19, 165–74, 197</ref> Under this other definiton, America is seen as being superior to other nations or having a unique mission to transform the world.<ref>Walt, Stephen M. [https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/11/the-myth-of-american-exceptionalism/ "The Myth of American Exceptionalism."] ''Foreign Policy (October 21, 2011)</ref>

The theory of the exceptionalism of the U.S. has developed over time and can be traced to many sources. French political scientist and historian [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was the first writer to describe the country as "exceptional" in 1831 and 1840.<ref>de Tocqueville, Alexis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oEQvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA36 ''Democracy in America''] (1840), part 2, p. 36: "The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no other democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."</ref> The actual phrase "American exceptionalism" was originally coined by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1929 as a critique of a [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] faction of American communists that argued that the American political climate was unique and made it an 'exception' to certain elements of [[Marxist]] theory.<ref name="Tyrrell">{{cite magazine | title=What, exactly, is 'American exceptionalism'? | author=Tyrrell, Ian | date=October 21, 2016 | magazine=The Week | url=http://theweek.com/articles/654508/what-exactly-american-exceptionalism}}</ref> 

Some writers dismiss the theory of American exceptionalism, claiming that all countries are exceptional and there are no essential differences between the U.S. and other industrialized nations. Recent scholarship dismisses the theory because it relies on the view that there has been a liberal consensus since America's founding, instead seeing both liberalism and [[civic republicanism]] as competing ideologies within the United States.

== Terminology ==
The exact term "American exceptionalism" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', Fred Shapiro notes "exceptionalism" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]] on August 20, 1861.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/09/27/american_exceptionalism_neither_joseph_stalin_nor_alexis_de_tocqueville.html|last = Zimmer|first= Ben |title = Did Stalin Really Coin "American Exceptionalism"?|work = Slate.com|date = 27 September 2013}}</ref> The term's common use dates from communists in the late 1920s, when the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] chastised members of the Faction led by [[Jay Lovestone]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] for claiming that the U.S. is independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions." Stalin may have been told of the usage "American exceptionalism" by Broder & Zack in ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American communists started using the English term "American exceptionalism" in factional fights. The term was later moved into general use by intellectuals.<ref name="books.google.com">Albert Fried, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mLJbT3NMbN4C&pg=PA7 ''Communism in America: A History in Documents''] (1997), p. 7.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Donald E. Pease|title=The New American Exceptionalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&pg=PA10|year=2009|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|page=10|isbn=978-0-8166-2782-0}}</ref>
In 1989, the Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted that most American historians endorse exceptionalism, and he suggested their reasoning to be as follows:

<blockquote>America marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = Richard | year = 1989 | title = How Exceptional is the American Political Economy? | jstor = 2150989 | journal = Political Science Quarterly | volume = 104 | issue = 1| pages = 91–115 | doi=10.2307/2150989}}</ref></blockquote>

However, [[postnationalist]] scholars reject American exceptionalism and argue the U.S. did not break from European history and accordingly has retained class-based and [[racial inequality in the United States|race-based differences]] as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.<ref>David W. Noble, ''Death of a Nation: American Culture and the end of exceptionalism'', pp. xxiii ff.</ref>

In recent years, scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:

{{quote|Why has the myth of American exceptionalism, characterized by a belief in America's highly distinctive features or unusual trajectory based on the abundance of its natural resources, its revolutionary origins and its Protestant religious culture that anticipated God's blessing of the nation, held such tremendous staying power, from its influence in popular culture to its critical role in foreign policy?<ref>Timothy Roberts and Lindsay DiCuirci, eds., ''American Exceptionalism''  (2013) vol. 1, p. 9</ref>}}

Some historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology to avoid getting entangled in rhetorical debates. [[Bernard Bailyn]], a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase "American exceptionalism," he insists upon the "distinctive characteristics of British North American life." He argues the process of social and [[cultural transmission]] result in peculiarly-American patterns of education in the broadest sense of the word, and he believes in the unique character of the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Michael Kammen and Stanley N. Katz. "Bernard Bailyn, Historian, and Teacher: An Appreciation." in James A. Henretta, Michael Kämmen, and Stanley N. Katz, eds. ''The Transformation of Early American History: Society, Authority, and Ideology'' (1991) p. 10.</ref>

== Origin of term ==
Although the concept of American exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas,<ref>Bernard Bailyn, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution''. p. 92</ref> the term was first used in the 1920s.

Some claim the phrase "American exceptionalism" originated with the [[Communist Party USA]] in an English translation of a condemnation that was made in 1929 by the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] against communist supporters of [[Jay Lovestone]] for the latter's heretical belief the US was independent of the Marxist laws of history "thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions."<ref name="books.google.com" /><ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ewC6rekn86gC&q=American+exceptionalism+stalin&pg=PA10 |title = The New American Exceptionalism|first = Donald E. |last = Pease|author-link =Donald E. Pease|publisher = U of Minnesota Press|date = 2009 |isbn =978-0-8166-2783-7|page = 10}}</ref> That origin has been challenged, however, because the expression "American exceptionalism" had already been used by Brouder & Zack in the ''Daily Worker'' (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to [[Moscow]]. Also, Fred Shapiro, the editor of ''The Yale Book of Quotations'', that noted "exceptionalism" had been used to refer to the United States and its self-image during the Civil War by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on August 20, 1861.

Early examples of the term's usage include a declaration made at the 1930 American Communist convention that proclaimed "the storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism."<ref name="atl1">[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/how-joseph-stalin-invented-american-exceptionalism/254534/ How Joseph Stalin Invented American Exceptionalism], ''[[The Atlantic]]''.</ref>

The phrase fell to obscurity after the 1930s until American newspapers popularized it in the 1980s to describe America's cultural and political uniqueness.<ref name="atl1" /> The phrase became an issue of contention between the presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], with McCain attacking Obama for allegedly disbelieving the concept.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iviea | first1 = Robert L. | last2 = Ginerb | first2 = Oscar | year = 2009 | title = American Exceptionalism in a Democratic Idiom: Transacting the Mythos of Change in the 2008 Presidential Campaign | journal = Communication Studies | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 359–75 | doi = 10.1080/10510970903109961| s2cid = 143578350 }}</ref>

== History of concept ==
=== Alexis de Tocqueville and others (1835) ===
The first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by the French writer [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] in his 1835/1840 work ''[[Democracy in America]]'':<ref>"Foreword: on American Exceptionalism; Symposium on Treaties, Enforcement, and U.S. Sovereignty", ''Stanford Law Review'', May 1, 2003, p. 1479</ref>
{{quotation|The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects. His passions, his wants, his education, and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward; his religion alone bids him turn, from time to time, a transient and distracted glance to heaven. Let us cease, then, to view all democratic nations under the example of the American people.<ref>[[Alexis de Tocqueville]], ''[[Democracy in America]]'', Vintage Books, 1945</ref>}}

American exceptionalism has fueled American expansion through the ideology of [[manifest destiny]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Manifest Destiny |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Manifest-Destiny |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>]]
Kammen says that many foreign visitors commented on American exceptionalism including [[Karl Marx]], [[Francis Lieber]], [[Hermann Eduard von Holst]], [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], and [[Hilaire Belloc]] and that they did so in complimentary terms.<ref>Kammen p. 7</ref> The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the [[McGuffey Readers]] sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the ''Readers'' "hailed American exceptionalism, [[manifest destiny]], and America as God's country.... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world."<ref>{{cite book|author=Quentin R.

=== Communist debate (1927) ===
In June 1927 [[Jay Lovestone]], a leader of the [[Communist Party USA]] and who would be soon named as general secretary, described America's economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism and the country's "tremendous reserve power" and said that both prevented a [[communist revolution]].<ref name=Fried1997>Fried, Albert.

=== Uniqueness ===
In general, Americans have had consideration in national "uniqueness." The historian [[Dorothy Ross (historian)|Dorothy Ross]] points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics.

# Other American writers looked to the "millennial newness" of America. [[Henry Nash Smith]] stressed the theme of "virgin land" in the [[American frontier]] that promised an escape from the decay that had befallen to earlier republics.<ref>{{cite journal|first = Henry Nash|last= Smith|title = The Frontier Hypothesis and the Myth of the West|journal =American Quarterly|volume= 2|number =1|date = Spring 1950|pages = 3–11|jstor =2710571 |doi= 10.2307/2710571}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book | author = Dorothy Ross | title = Origins of American Social Science | url = https://archive.org/details/y00ross | url-access = registration |year =1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/y00ross/page/25 25]}}</ref>

=== 21st-century development ===
Recently, socialists{{who|date=January 2019}} and other writers tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U.S. within and outside its borders.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm American Exceptionalism]. The Washington Post</ref>

The concept has also been discussed in the context of the 21st century in a book co-authored by U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]: ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'' (2015).<ref name="simonandschuster">{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America|author=Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= 2015 |publisher= Simon & Schuster |access-date= November 3, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314}}</ref>

== Causes in historical context ==
Scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.

=== Absence of feudalism ===
Many scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist [[Louis Hartz]]. In ''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates, and a hereditary nobility,<ref>{{cite journal |first=Catherine A. |last=Holland |title=Hartz and Minds: The Liberal Tradition after the Cold War |journal=Studies in American Political Development |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=227–33 |doi=10.1017/S0898588X05000155}}</ref> although some European practices of feudal origin, such as primogeniture and indentured service, were transmitted to America. The "liberal consensus" school, typified by [[David M. Potter|David Potter]], [[Daniel Boorstin]], and [[Richard Hofstadter]] followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding [[private property]], [[individual right]]s, and [[representative government]]. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Cross |title=Comparative Exceptionalism: Rethinking the Hartz Thesis in the Settler Societies of Nineteenth-Century United States and Australia |journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies |year=1995 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=15–41 |jstor=41053761}}</ref>

=== Puritan roots and Protestant promise ===
Parts of American exceptionalism can be traced to American [[Puritan]] roots.<ref>Anna Gandziarowski, ''The Puritan Legacy to American Politics'' (2010) p. 2</ref> Many Puritans with [[Arminian]] leanings embraced a middle ground between strict [[Predestination (Calvinism)|Calvinist predestination]] and a less restricting theology of [[Divine Providence]]. They believed that God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, [[John Winthrop]], metaphorically expressed this idea as a "[[City upon a Hill]]: the Puritan community of [[New England]] should serve as a model for the rest of the world.<ref>Justin B. Litke, "Varieties of American Exceptionalism: Why John Winthrop Is No Imperialist," ''Journal of Church and State'', 54 (Spring 2012), 197–213.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html |title=John Winthrop, A Modell of Christian Charity(1630)|editor=The Hanover Historical Texts Project |publisher=Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society (Boston, 1838), 3rd series 7:31–48. |date=August 1996 |access-date=March 13, 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413143419/http://history.hanover.edu/texts/winthmod.html| archive-date= April 13, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> That metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans' moralistic values have remained one component of the national identity for centuries.<ref>Sarah Rivett, "Religious Exceptionalism and American Literary History: 'The Puritan Origins of the American Self' in 2012." ''Early American Literature'' 7.2 (2012): 391-410.</ref>

In that vein, [[Max Weber]] was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. Eric Luis Uhlmann of [[Northwestern University]] argues that Puritan values were eventually taken up by all other Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/AME%20CHAPTER.POSTING.pdf |title=Chapter posting |website=www.socialjudgments.com }}</ref> Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its ''Protestant Promise'', especially [[Catholics]] and [[Jews]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPIVDAAAQBAJ&q=protestant+promise&pg=PA94|title=Tri-Faith America: How Catholics and Jews Held Postwar America to Its Protestant Promise|first=Kevin M.|last=Schultz|date=January 15, 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199987542}}</ref>

=== American Revolution and republicanism ===
The ideas that created the [[American Revolution]] were derived from a tradition of [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism]] that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. The historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] has argued, "Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy."<ref>Gordon Wood, "Introduction" in ''Idea of America: Reflections on the Birth of the United States'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Idea-America-Reflections-United-States/dp/1594202907#reader_B004IYIUFG online].</ref> Wood notes that the term is "presently much-maligned" although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon S. Wood|title=The Purpose of the Past: Reflections on the Uses of History|url=https://archive.org/details/purposeofpastref00wood|url-access=registration|year= 2009|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://archive.org/details/purposeofpastref00wood/page/240 240]|isbn=9781440637919}}</ref>

[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land and a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. Those sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to [[republicanism]], the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not a hereditary ruling class.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ari |last=Hoogenboom |author-link=Ari Hoogenboom |chapter=American Exceptionalism Republicanism as Ideology |editor-first=Elisabeth |editor-last=Gläser |editor2-first=Hermann |editor2-last=Wellenreuther |title=Bridging the Atlantic: the question of American exceptionalism in perspective |year=2002 |pages=43–67 |isbn=978-0-521-78205-0}}</ref>

[[Religious freedom]] characterized the [[American Revolution]] in unique ways when most major nations had state religions. Republicanism, led by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], created modern [[constitutional republicanism]], which limits ecclesiastical powers. The historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, "With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some particular purpose."<ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kidd |title=God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2010 |page=9 |isbn=978-0-465-00235-1}}</ref> Kidd further argues that "a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue."<ref>Kidd, ''God of Liberty,'' p. 8</ref>

=== Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty ===
According to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America "was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions." Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on "[[reason of state]]," which could justify any action, and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over those of the people.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Robert W. |last1=Tucker |first2= David C. |last2= Hendrickson |title =Empire of Liberty: The Statecraft of Thomas Jefferson|date =1992|page = ix |isbn = 9780198022763}}</ref>

Jefferson envisaged America becoming the world's great "[[Empire of Liberty]]," the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, as he said when he departed the presidency in 1809: "Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence."<ref>Quoted in Tucker and  Hendrickson, ''Empire of Liberty'' p. 7; see John P. Foley, ed. ''The Jeffersonian Cyclopedia'' (1900) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ZTIoAAAAYAAJ/page/n946 <!-- quote="Trusted with the destinies of this solitary". --> text p. 895]</ref>

== Basis of arguments ==

[[Marilyn B. Young]] argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an "American empire," a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with the new vision of American empire. Young says the [[Iraq War]] (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.<ref>Marilyn B. Young, "One Empire Under G", ''European Contributions to American Studies'', May 2004, Vol. 55, pp. 8–18</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2019}}

In 2012, the conservative historians [[Larry Schweikart]] and Dave Dougherty argued that American exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) [[common law]]; (2) virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.<ref>Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, From America's Exceptional Ascent to the Atomic Bomb, 1898–1945''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-089-8}}. Moreover, ''A Patriot's History of the Modern World, Vol. II, From the Cold War to the Age of Entitlement, 1945–2012''. Sentinel. {{ISBN|978-1-59523-104-8}}</ref>

In a 2015 book, ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', former [[U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] sets out and argues the case for American exceptionalism and concludes: "we are, as [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] said, 'the last, best hope of earth.' We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]], [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]], and [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional."<ref>Cheney, Dick and Liz Cheney. ''Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America'', Threshold Editions, New York, 2015. pp. 259ff. {{ISBN|978-1-5011-1541-7}}.</ref>

=== Republican ethos and ideas about nationhood ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States is exceptional in that it was founded on a set of [[republicanism|republican]] ideals rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] in his [[Gettysburg Address]], America is a nation "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." In Lincoln's interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and the American mission is to ensure "that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." The historian [[T. Harry Williams]] argues that Lincoln believed:

{{quote|In the United States man would create a society that would be the best and the happiest in the world. The United States was the supreme demonstration of democracy. However, the Union did not exist just to make men free in America. It had an even greater mission—to make them free everywhere. By the mere force of its example, America would bring democracy to an undemocratic world.<ref>{{cite journal|first=T.

American policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and [[checks and balances]] (among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that the system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a "[[tyranny of the majority]]," preserve a free republican democracy, and allow citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters' values. A consequence of the political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that the system merely replaces the power of the federal majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On the balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than a more [[unitary state|unitary]] system would.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Alan Dahl|title=Toward democracy--a journey: reflections, 1940–1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FacUAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institute of Governmental Studies Press, University of California, Berkeley|page=2:711|isbn=9780877723721}}</ref>

The historian [[Eric Foner]] has explored the question of [[birthright citizenship]], the provision of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (1868) that makes anyone born in the United States a full citizen.
He argues that:

{{quote|birthright citizenship stands as an example of the much-abused idea of American exceptionalism... birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. No European nation recognizes the principle.<ref>Eric Foner, [http://www.thenation.com/article/birthright-citizenship-is-the-good-kind-of-american-exceptionalism/ "Birthright Citizenship Is the Good Kind of American Exceptionalism," ''The Nation'' Aug. 27, 2015]</ref>}}

=== Global leadership and activism ===
[[Yale Law School]] Dean [[Harold Hongju Koh]] has identified what he says is "the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism." He argues:

<blockquote>To this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.<ref>Harold Hongju Koh, "On American Exceptionalism" 55 Stan. L. Rev. 1479 (2003) quote at p. 1487 [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2737&context=fss_papers online]</ref></blockquote>

[[Peggy Noonan]], an American political pundit, wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that "America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional."

Former [[U.S. Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on [[American foreign policy]], ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', co-authored with his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]], a former official of the [[U.S. Department of State]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title= Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= September 2015|website= Simon & Schuster |access-date= October 5, 2015|isbn= 9781442388314 }}</ref>

=== Frontier spirit ===
Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the "American spirit" were shaped by the frontier process. Following [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]], they argue that the [[American frontier]] allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches, and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land.<ref>Richard W. Etulain, ''Does the Frontier Experience Make America Exceptional?'' (1999)</ref> However, the frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations had frontiers without them shaping them nearly as much as the American frontier did, usually because they were under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and Australia had long frontiers, but they did not have "free land" and local control.<ref>Walker D. Wyman and Clifton B. Kroeber, eds. ''Frontier in Perspective'' (1957)</ref> The political and cultural environments were much different since the other frontiers neither involved widespread ownership of free land nor allowed the settlers to control the local and provincial governments, as was the case in America. Their edge did not shape their national psyches.<ref>Marvin K. Mikesell, "Comparative Studies in Frontier History," in Richard Hofstadter and Seymour Martin Lipset, eds., ''Turner and the Sociology of the Frontier'' (1968) pp. 152–72</ref> Each nation had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers]] in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, "mateship" and working together were valued more than individualism was in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mateship and Individualism in Modern Australian Drama |first=Dennis |last=Carroll |journal=Theatre Journal |volume=34 |issue=4 |year=1982 |pages=467–80 |jstor=3206809|doi=10.2307/3206809 }}</ref>

=== Mobility and welfare ===
{{further|Economic mobility|Social mobility}}
For most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to the early-20th centuries, the United States has been known as the "land of opportunity" and in that sense prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background.<ref>{{cite book |first=Hartmut |last=Kaelble |title=Social Mobility in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Europe and America in Comparative Perspective |year=1981 |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-05274-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalresear0000kael }}</ref> Examples of that [[social mobility]] include:
* Occupational: children could easily choose careers that were not based upon their parents' choices.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Stephan |last=Thernstrom |title=The Other Bostonians: Poverty and Progress in the American Metropolis, 1880–1970 |year=1999 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-1-58348-443-2}}</ref>
* Physical: geographical location was not seen as static, and citizens often relocated freely over long distances without a barrier.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Stephenson |first2=Richard |last2=Jensen |first3=Janice Reiff |last3=Webster |title=Social predictors of American mobility: a census capture-recapture study of New York and Wisconsin, 1875–1905 |publisher=Newberry Library |year=1978}}</ref>
* Status: as in most countries, family standing and riches were often a means to remain in a higher social circle. America was notably unusual because if an accepted wisdom that anyone, from poor immigrants upwards, who worked hard could aspire to similar standing, regardless of circumstances of birth. That aspiration is commonly called living the [[American dream]]. Birth details were not taken as a social barrier to the upper echelons or high political status in American culture. That stood in contrast to other countries in which many larger offices were socially determined and usually difficult to enter unless one was born into the suitable social group.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Peter M. |last1=Blau |first2=Otis Dudley |last2=Duncan |title=The American Occupational Structure |location=London |publisher=Collier Macmillan |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-02-903670-9}}</ref>

However, social mobility in the US is lower than in some [[European Union]] countries if it is defined by income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there than similar people in the [[Nordic countries]] or the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/338|title=Structural rigidities in the US and Europe|last=De Grauwe|first=Paul|date=July 2, 2007|access-date=January 1, 2010}}</ref> Many economists, such as Harvard economist [[N. Gregory Mankiw]], however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: "Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html|date=January 12, 2011|title=Half-Full Glass of Economic Mobility|format=blog|first=Greg|last=Mankiw|access-date=January 1, 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110122182147/http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2011/01/half-full-glass-of-economic-mobility.html| archive-date= January 22, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Regarding public welfare, [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. "is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional." He concluded, "By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits."<ref>Rose, "How Exceptional is the American Political Economy?" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1989) 104#1 pp. 91, 92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150989 in JSTOR]</ref>

== Criticism ==
The historian [[Michael Kammen]] argues that criticisms against the topic were raised in the 1970s in the wake of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Michael Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" ''American Quarterly'' (1993) p. 11 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713051]</ref> According to Kammen, many intellectuals then decided, "The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver."<ref>Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" p. 12</ref> At about the same time, the new [[social history]] used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as [[social mobility]]. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a workers' party to emerge in the United States did not mean that America was exceptionally favorable for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme [[chauvinism]] displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally, in the mid-1980s, colonial historians debated the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history.<ref>Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–13</ref> On the other hand, Wilentz argued for "distinctively American forms of class conflict," and Foner said there was a "distinctive character of American trade unionism."<ref>Kamman, "The Problem of American Exceptionalism" pp. 12–14</ref>

The third idea of American exceptionalism, superiority, has been criticized with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In ''American Exceptionalism and Human Rights'' (2005), the Canadian commentator [[Michael Ignatieff]] treats the idea negatively and identifies three main sub-types: "exemptionalism" (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); "double standards" (criticizing "others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodie but ignoring what the organizations say of the United States"), and "legal isolationism" (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Ignatieff|title=American Exceptionalism and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUiZLQdGJwkC&pg=PA4|year=2009|pages=3–8|isbn=978-1400826889}}</ref>

=== Exceptionalism as "exemptionalism" ===
During the [[George W. Bush administration]] (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context.<ref>{{citation |title=Hegemony or Empire?: The Redefinition of US Power Under George W. Bush |author=Charles Philippe David, David Grondin|isbn = 978-0754647744|year = 2006}}</ref> Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being "above" or an "exception" to the law, specifically the [[public international law|law of nations]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/ |title=Could Bush Be Prosecuted for War Crimes? |journal=AlterNet |last=Frel |first=Jan |date=July 10, 2006 |access-date=May 17, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225220/http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/38604/| archive-date= May 13, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> (That phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.) The new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis, and the actual orientation diverges somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to "old-style" or "traditional American exceptionalism," the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others and that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history, also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by public international law. Indeed, recent research shows that "there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of [[unilateral]] attitudes."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thimm|first=Johannes|title=American Exceptionalism – Conceptual Thoughts and Empirical Evidence|url=http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225014354/http://www.politikwissenschaft.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/pg/Sektionstagung_IB/Thimm-American_exceptionalism.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 25, 2009|access-date=29 October 2013|location=Berlin|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On September 12, 2013, in the context of U.S. President Barack Obama's comment about American exceptionalism during his September 10, 2013 talk to the American people while he was considering military action on [[Syria]] for its alleged use of [[chemical weapons]] against civilians, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] criticized Obama: "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/opinion/putin-plea-for-caution-from-russia-on-syria.html?_r=0 ''Vladimir Putin's comments on American exceptionalism, Syria cause a fuss.''] CNN. 12 September 2013.

In his interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]] on October 4, 2013, Ecuadorian President [[Rafael Correa]] criticized Obama's policies and compared American exceptionalism with [[Nazi Germany]]: "Does not this remind you of the Nazis' rhetoric before and during [[World War II]]?

=== Similarities between US and Europe ===
In December 2009, historian [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]] published a book arguing that despite widespread attempts to contrast the "[[American way of life]]" and the "[[European social model]]," America and Europe are actually very similar to a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of the few areas in which a stark difference exists between the US and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/81ba6ffa-ed90-11de-ba12-00144feab49a,s01=1.html|title=Financial Times|last=Lloyd|first=John|date=December 20, 2009|work=Martian myths that flatter Europe|access-date=January 1, 2010}}</ref>

The historian [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto]] argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which the subject has been broached, the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the "dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance," and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which those characteristics are concentrated there.<ref>Fernández-Armesto, Felipe. ''The Americas: A Hemispheric History''.

In April 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] responded to a journalist's question in [[Strasbourg]] with this statement: "I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-kirchick28-2009apr28,0,4218519.story |title=Squanderer in chief |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 28, 2009 |access-date=March 11, 2010 | first=James | last=Kirchick}}</ref> Obama further noted, "I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/04/AR2009040400700.html |title=On European Trip, President Tries to Set a New, Pragmatic Tone |work=The Washington Post |date=April 5, 2009 |access-date=November 8, 2010 | first=Michael| last=Sheer}}</ref> [[Mitt Romney]] attacked Obama's statement and argued it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mitt Romney|title=No Apology: The Case for American Greatness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDpBpo5CVB4C&pg=PA29|year= 2010|publisher=Macmillan|page=29|isbn=978-1-4299-3960-7}}</ref> Former Arkansas Governor [[Mike Huckabee]] said that Obama's "worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we've had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation."<ref>{{cite web|first1=Jonathan|last1=Martin|first2=Ben|last2=Smith|title=The New Battle: What It Means to be American|date=August 20, 2010|url=https://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41273.html}}</ref>

In a speech on the [[Syrian Civil War|Syria crisis]] on September 10, 2013, Obama said that "however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act.... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional."<ref>Karen Tumulty, "American exceptionalism, explained", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/09/12/american-exceptionalism-explained/?hpid=z10 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]</ref> In a direct response the next day, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] published an [[op-ed]] in ''The New York Times'', articulating, "It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal."<ref>Max Fisher, "Vladimir Putin's New York Times op-ed, annotated and fact-checked", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/09/12/vladimir-putins-new-york-times-op-ed-annotated-and-fact-checked/?hpid=z1 ''The Washington Post'' September 12, 2013]</ref> Putin's views were soon endorsed by future President [[Donald Trump]], who declared the op-ed "a masterpiece." "You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You are not going to like that term," Trump said. "It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that."<ref>[[James Kirchick|Kirchik, James]] (15 August 2016), [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/15/beware-the-hillary-clinton-loathing-donald-trump-loving-useful-idiots-of-the-left.html?via=newsletter&source=CSAMedition "Beware the Hillary Clinton-Loathing, Donald Trump-Loving Useful Idiots of the Left"], ''[[The Daily Beast]]''.</ref> Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump's stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the [[New America Foundation]], who in a 2016 ''[[The Nation|Nation]]'' magazine symposium remarked, "Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that [[Hillary Clinton]] and many Republicans support."<ref>Schwenninger, Sherle R., Heather Hurlburt, [[Stephen Kinzer]] and [[Juan Cole]] (24 May 2016), [https://www.thenation.com/article/the-promise-and-the-peril-of-donald-trumps-foreign-policy/ "When Donald Trump Says His Foreign Policy Is 'America First'—What Exactly Does He Mean?"], ''[[The Nation]]''.</ref> However, Trump has also advocated an "[[America First (policy)|America First]]" policy, emphasizing [[American nationalism]] and [[unilateralism]], though with a greater emphasis on [[non-interventionism]] than [[imperialism]].

American exceptionalism has been a plank of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[party platform]] since 2012.<!-- Possibly before...? --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/gaming/article/bioshock_infinite-taking_american_exceptionalism_to_extreme|title=''Bioshock Infinite'' - Taking American Exceptionalism to the Extreme|last=Ostroff|first=Joseph|date=May 6, 2013|website=[[Exclaim!]]}}</ref> The [[political positions of the Republican Party|current platform]], [[2016 Republican National Convention#Platform|adopted in 2016]], defines it as "the notion that our ideas and principles as a nation give us a unique place of moral leadership" and affirms that the U.S. therefore must "retake its natural position as leader of the [[free world]]."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]|title=America Resurgent|url=https://www.gop.com/platform/american-exceptionalism/}}</ref>
