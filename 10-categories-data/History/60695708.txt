'''Historical reliability of the Quran''' concerns the question of the [[historicity]] of the described or claimed events in the [[Quran]]. 

The [[Quran]] is viewed to be the scriptural foundation of Islam and is believed by Muslims to have been sent down by Allah (God) and revealed to [[Muhammad]] by the angel [[Rūḥ#As_interpreted_to_refer_to_the_Archangel_Gabriel|Jabreel]] ([[Gabriel]]). [[Muslims]] have not used [[higher criticism|historical criticism]] in the study of the Quran, but they have used [[Biblical criticism|textual criticism]] in a similar way used by Christians and Jews.<ref>Religions of the world Lewis M. Hopfe – 1979 "Some Muslims have suggested and practiced textual criticism of the Quran in a manner similar to that practiced by Christians and Jews on their bibles. No one has yet suggested the [[higher criticism]] of the Quran."</ref> It has been practiced primarily by secular, Western scholars such as [[John Wansbrough]], [[Joseph Schacht]], [[Patricia Crone]], and [[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]], who set aside doctrines of the Quran's divinity, perfection, unchangeability, etc., accepted by Muslim scholars,<ref name="what-atlantic-1999">{{cite journal |journal=Atlantic |last1=LESTER |first1=TOBY |date= January 1999  |title=What Is the Koran? | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref> and instead investigate the Quran's origin, text, composition, and history.<ref name="what-atlantic-1999">{{cite journal |journal=Atlantic |last1=LESTER |first1=TOBY |date= January 1999  |title=What Is the Koran? | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ |accessdate=8 April 2019}}</ref>

In the [[Muslim world]], scholarly criticism of the Quran can be considered an [[apostasy in Islam|apostasy]]. Scholarly criticism of the Quran, is thus, a beginning area of study in the Islamic world.<ref>Christian-Muslim relations: yesterday, today, tomorrow Munawar Ahmad Anees, Ziauddin Sardar, Syed Z. Abedin – 1991 For instance, a Christian critic engaging in textual criticism of the Quran from a biblical perspective will surely miss the essence of the quranic message. Just one example would clarify this point.</ref><ref>Studies on Islam Merlin L. Swartz – 1981 One will find a more complete bibliographical review of the recent studies of the textual criticism of the Quran in the valuable article by Jeffery, "The Present Status of Qur'anic Studies," Report on Current Research on the Middle East</ref>

Scholars have identified several pre-existing sources for the Quran.<ref>Leirvik 2010, p. 33.</ref> The Quran assumes its readers' familiarity with the Christian [[Bible]] and there are many [[Biblical and Quranic narratives|parallels between the Bible and the Quran]]. Aside from the Bible, the Quran includes [[legend]]ary narratives about [[Alexander the Great]], [[New_Testament_apocrypha#Gospels|apocryphal gospels]],<ref>Leirvik 2010, pp. 33–34.</ref> and [[Jewish folklore|Jewish legends]]. Thus, the question of the historical reliability of the Quran is tied to the question of the [[Historicity of the Bible|historical reliability of the Bible.]]

==Textual history==
[[File:SanaaQuoranDoubleVersions.jpg|thumb|[[Sanaʽa manuscript]] of the Quran.]]

===Early manuscripts===
In the 1970s, 14,000 fragments of Quran were discovered in the [[Great Mosque of Sana'a|Great Mosque]] of [[Sana'a]], the Sana'a manuscripts. About 12,000 fragments belonged to 926 copies of the Quran, the other 2,000 were loose fragments. The oldest known copy of the Quran so far belongs to this collection: it dates to the end of the 7th–8th centuries.

The German scholar [[Gerd R. Puin]] has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were [[palimpsest]]s which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.<ref name="atlantic">{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/?single_page=true |title=What Is the Koran? |last=Lester |first=Toby |work=The Atlantic |date=January 1999 |accessdate=10 April 2019 |language=en-US }}</ref>

In 2015, some of the [[Birmingham Manuscript|earliest known Quranic fragments]], dating from between approximately AD 568 and 645, were identified at the [[University of Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-33436021 |first=Sean |last=Coughlan |title='Oldest' Koran fragments found in Birmingham University |work=BBC News |date=22 July 2015 |accessdate=10 April 2019 }}</ref> Islamic scholar [[Joseph E.

Professor Lumbard notes that the discovery of a Qur'anic text that may be confirmed by radiocarbon dating as having been written in the first decades of the Islamic era, and includes variations in the  “under text.” recorded in the Islamic historiographical tradition . <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-e-b-lumbard/new-light-on-the-history-_b_7864930.html |title=New Light on the History of the Qur'anic Text? |newspaper=The Huffington Post }}</ref> {{Unreliable source?|date=March 2020}}

==Quran and History==
{{Main|Biblical and Quranic narratives}}
===Creation narrative and the Flood===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
The Quran contains a [[creation narrative]] and may refer to the world being created in six days, although this is highly debatable. In [[Al-Anbiya|Sūrah al-Anbiyāʼ]], the Quran states that "the heavens and the earth were of one piece" before being parted.<ref>{{cite quran|21|30|s=r}}</ref> [[God in Islam|God]] then created the landscape of the earth, placed the sky above it as a roof, and created the day and night cycles by appointing an [[orbit]] for both the sun and moon.<ref>{{cite quran|21|31|e=33|s=r}}</ref> Some Muslim apologists, like [[Zakir Naik]] and [[Adnan Oktar]] advocate [[creationism]]. Some British Muslim students have distributed leaflets on campus, advocating against Darwin's theory of evolution<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/21/religion.highereducation|title=Academics fight rise of creationism at universities|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|date=21 February 2006|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> and contemporary Islamic scholar [[Yasir Qadhi]] believes that the idea that humans evolved is against the Quran.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/jan/11/muslim-thought-on-evolution-debate</ref> It has to be noted, however, that not all Muslims are against the theory of evolution. Evolution is taught in many Islamic countries, and some scholars have tried to reconcile the Quran and evolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ajmn.tv/4w622|title=Are evolution and religion compatible?|last=webmaster|date=6 December 2011|website=The Stream - Al Jazeera English}}</ref>

Quran also contains the [[flood myth|flood narrative]]. According to the Quran, [[Noah in Islam|Noah]] was a prophet for 950 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quran.com/|title=Surah Al-'Ankabut [29:14]|website=Surah Al-'Ankabut [29:14]}}</ref> and he built an ark where he filled it with pairs of animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quran.com/|title=Surah Hud [11:35-41]|website=Surah Hud [11:35-41]}}</ref> People who did not believe him, including one of his own sons, are said to have drowned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quran.com/|title=Surah Al-A'raf [7:64]|website=Surah Al-A'raf [7:64]}}</ref>

===Samiri===
Quran recounts a story of the golden calf, where it mentions that [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]], a rebellious follower of [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], created the calf while Moses was away for 40 days on [[Mount Sinai]], receiving the [[Ten Commandments]].<ref>The Qur'an, [http://al-quran.info/#20:85 Surah Ta Ha, Ayah 85]</ref> Due to the fact that ''as-Samiri'' can mean the [[Samaritan]],<ref>Rubin, Uri. "Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography," Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202.</ref> some believe that his character is a reference to the worship of the [[Biblical and Quranic narratives#Idol calf and Samaritan|golden calves]] built by [[Jeroboam]] of Samaria, conflating the two idol-worshiping incidents into one.

===Alexander the Great legends===
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]
{{Main|Alexander the Great in the Quran}}
{{Main|Dhul-Qarnayn}}
Quran also employs popular legends about [[Alexander the Great]] called [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] ("he of the two horns") in the Quran.
The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]).

The reasons behind the name "Two-Horned" are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall Dhul-Qarnayn builds on his northern journey may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

===Death of Jesus===
[[File:POxy405.jpg|thumb|Payrus of [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus']] ''Against Heresies'', which describes early Gnostic beliefs about Jesus' death which influenced Islam.<ref>"Et gentibus ipsorum autem apparuisse eum in terra hominem, et virtutes perfecisse. Quapropter neque passsum eum, sed Simonem quendam Cyrenæum angariatum portasse crucem ejus pro eo: et hunc secundum ignorantiam et errorem crucifixum, transfiguratum ab eo, uti putaretur ipse esse Jesus: et ipsum autem Jesum Simonis accepisse formam, et stantem irrisisse eos." [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101074938950;view=1up;seq=406 Book 1, Chapter 19]</ref>]]   
{{Main|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}
Quran maintains that [[Jesus]] was not actually crucified and did not die on the cross. The general Islamic view supporting the denial of crucifixion was probably influenced by [[Manichaenism]] ([[Docetism]]), which holds that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus, while concluding that Jesus will return during the end-times.<ref>Joel L. Kraemer ''Israel Oriental Studies XII'' BRILL 1992 {{ISBN|9789004095847}} p. 41</ref>
{{quote|That they said (in boast), "We killed [[Christ]] Jesus the son of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the [[Messengers of Islam|Messenger]] of [[Allah]]";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:-<br>Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;-|Qur'an, [[sura]] 4 ([[An-Nisa]]) [[ayah|ayat]] 157–158<ref>{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=Todd|date=1 March 2009|title=The Crucifixion and the Quran: A Study in the History of Muslim Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1cQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA12|publisher=Oneworld Publications|page=12|isbn=978-1851686353}}</ref>}}

Despite these views, scholars have maintained, that the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] is a fact of history and not disputed.<ref>Eddy, Paul Rhodes and Gregory A. Boyd (2007). The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition. Baker Academic. p. 172. {{ISBN|0801031141}}. ...if there is any fact of Jesus' life that has been established by a broad consensus, it is the fact of Jesus' crucifixion.</ref>
The view that Jesus only appeared to be crucified and did not actually die predates Islam, and is found in several apocryphal gospels.<ref>Joel L. Kraemer ''Israel Oriental Studies XII'' BRILL 1992 {{ISBN|9789004095847}} p. 41</ref>

[[Irenaeus]] in his book [[Against Heresies (Irenaeus)|Against Heresies]] describes Gnostic beliefs that bear remarkable resemblance with the Islamic view:
{{quote|''He did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all''.-|Against Heresies, Book I, Chapter 24, Section 40}}

Irenaeus mentions this view again:
<blockquote>He appeared on earth as a man and performed miracles. Thus he himself did not suffer. Rather, a certain Simon of Cyrene was compelled to carry his cross for him. It was he who was ignorantly and erroneously crucified, being transfigured by him, so that he might be thought to be Jesus.  Moreover, Jesus assumed the form of Simon, and stood by laughing at them.<ref>Haer. 1.24.4</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last= Kelhoffer|first=James A. |title=Conceptions of "Gospel" and Legitimacy in Early Christianity|year=2014 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |pages=80|isbn = 9783161526367}}</ref> Irenaeus, [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|''Against Heresies'']].<ref>"Et gentibus ipsorum autem apparuisse eum in terra hominem, et virtutes perfecisse. Quapropter neque passsum eum, sed Simonem quendam Cyrenæum angariatum portasse crucem ejus pro eo: et hunc secundum ignorantiam et errorem crucifixum, transfiguratum ab eo, uti putaretur ipse esse Jesus: et ipsum autem Jesum Simonis accepisse formam, et stantem irrisisse eos." [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101074938950;view=1up;seq=406 Book 1, Chapter 19]</ref></blockquote>

Another Gnostic writing, found in the Nag Hammadi library, [[Second Treatise of the Great Seth]] has a similar view of Jesus' death:

{{quote|''I was not afflicted at all, yet I did not die in solid reality but in what appears, in order that I not be put to shame by them''}}

and also:

{{quote|''Another, their father, was the one who drank the gall and the vinegar; it was not I. Another was the one who lifted up the cross on his shoulder, who was Simon. Another was the one on whom they put the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height over all the riches of the archons and the offspring of their error and their conceit, and I was laughing at their ignorance''}}

[[Coptic Apocalypse of Peter]], likewise, reveals the same views of Jesus' death:

{{quote|''I saw him (Jesus) seemingly being seized by them. And I said 'What do I see, O Lord? That it is you yourself whom they take, and that you are grasping me? Or who is this one, glad and laughing on the tree? And is it another one whose feet and hands they are striking?' The Savior said to me, 'He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive the nails is his fleshly part, which is the substitute being put to shame, the one who came into being in his likeness. But look at him and me.' But I, when I had looked, said 'Lord, no one is looking at you. Let us flee this place.' But he said to me, 'I have told you, 'Leave the blind alone!'. And you, see how they do not know what they are saying. For the son of their glory instead of my servant, they have put to shame.' And I saw someone about to approach us resembling him, even him who was laughing on the tree. And he was with a Holy Spirit, and he is the Savior. And there was a great, ineffable light around them, and the multitude of ineffable and invisible angels blessing them. And when I looked at him, the one who gives praise was revealed.''}}
