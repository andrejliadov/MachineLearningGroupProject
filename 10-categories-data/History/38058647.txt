The '''origin of the Moon''' is usually explained by a [[Mars]]-sized body striking the Earth, making a debris ring that eventually collected into a single [[natural satellite]], the [[Moon]], but there are a number of variations on this [[giant-impact hypothesis]], as well as alternative explanations, and research continues into how the Moon came to be.<ref name=nasa1/><ref name="NYT-20140907">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Revisiting the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/science/revisiting-the-moon.html |date=September 7, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=September 8, 2014 }}</ref> Other proposed scenarios include captured body, fission, formed together (condensation theory, [[Synestia]]), [[planetesimal]] collisions (formed from asteroid-like bodies), and collision theories.<ref name=theories>[http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/moon/moon_formation.html Theories of Formation for the Moon]</ref>

The standard giant-impact hypothesis suggests that the Mars-sized body, called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], impacted the proto-Earth, creating a large [[Accretion disk|debris ring]] around Earth, which then [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] to form the Moon.

== Formation ==
{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
{{quote box|width=22em|"One of the challenges to the longstanding theory of the collision, is that a Mars-sized impacting body, whose composition likely would have differed substantially from that of Earth, likely would have left Earth and the moon with different chemical compositions, which they are not."|—NASA<ref name=nasa1>[http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/moon_formation.html NASA Lunar Scientists Develop New Theory on Earth and Moon Formation]</ref>}}

[[File:Lunar Sample 61016 - Big Muley.jpg|thumb|right|Lunar sample 61016, better known as "[[Big Muley]]"]]
Some theories have been stated that presume the proto-Earth had no large moons early in the formation of the Solar System, 4.425 &nbsp;billion years ago, Earth being basically rock and lava. [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.

The hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.

[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|°C|°F}}.

The Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].

The newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. 

A 2012 study on the depletion of [[zinc]] isotopes on the Moon supported the giant-impact origin for Earth and the Moon.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature11507|journal=Nature|volume=490|issue=7420|date=18 October 2012 |author1=Randal C.

In 2013, a study was released that indicated that water in lunar magma is indistinguishable from that in [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s and nearly the same as that of Earth in [[Isotopic signature|isotopic composition]].<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Paul D. Spudis |date=May 14, 2013 |url=http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ |title=Earth-Moon: A Watery "Double-Planet" |magazine=Air & Space/Smithsonian |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807172422/http://blogs.airspacemag.com/moon/2013/05/earth-moon-a-watery-double-planet/ |archive-date=2013-08-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|date=14 June 2013 |volume=340 |issue=6138 |doi=10.1126/science.1235142 |first1=A.

The giant-impact hypothesis was again challenged in September 2013, with a growing sense that lunar origins are more complicated.{{Vague|date=May 2016}}<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Science |author= Daniel Clery |title= Impact Theory Gets Whacked |volume= 342 |issue= 6155 |pages= 183–185 |date= 11 October 2013 |doi=10.1126/science.342.6155.183 |pmid=24115419 |bibcode= 2013Sci...342..183C}}</ref>

== Derivatives of the Giant-Impact Hypothesis ==
Although the giant-impact hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth–Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J. H. Jones | title = TESTS OF THE GIANT IMPACT HYPOTHESIS | work = Origin of the Earth and Moon Conference | url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/origin98/pdf/4045.pdf | accessdate = 2006-11-21 }}</ref>

Another issue is lunar and Earth isotope comparisons. In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (less than 1 percent chance).<ref name=ps2007>{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3–4 |date=October 2007 | pages=438–449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 | s2cid=53064179 }}</ref> Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,<ref name="test">

=== Merger of two planets ===
To help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies—each five times the size of Mars—collided, then recollided, forming a large disc of mixed debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.<ref name=nasa1/> The paper was called “Forming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact”, by R.&nbsp;M. Canup.<ref name=nasa1/>

=== Multiple impacts ===
In 2017, planetary researchers at [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in Rehovot, Israel offered a new theory that suggests the Moon was forged in a violent rain of cosmic debris that repeatedly hammered the fledgling Earth over millions of years. They determined that a series of smaller impacts, which were likely more common in the early Solar System, could blast enough Earth rocks and dirt into orbit to form a small moonlet. As repeated impacts created more balls of debris, the moonlets could merge over time into one large moon.<ref name="WSJ-20170109">{{cite news |author=Robert Lee Hotz |title=Researchers Suggest New Theory for the Moon's Origin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/researchers-suggest-new-theory-for-the-moons-origin-1483977602|date=January 9, 2017 |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}</ref>

=== Synestia hypothesis ===
In 2018 researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and the [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] developed computer models demonstrating that one possible outcome of a [[Disrupted planet|planetary collision]] is that it creates a [[synestia]], a mass of vaporized rock and metal which forms a [[biconcave disc]] extending beyond the lunar orbit. The synestia will eventually shrink and cool to accrete the satellite and reform the impacted planet.<ref>{{cite news |first =Javier|last =Barbuzano |title=Could a Giant Impact Have Vaporized Earth to Create the Moon? |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/could-a-giant-impact-have-vaporized-earth-to-create-the-moon/ |date=March 1, 2018 |work=Sky and Telescope |accessdate=March 3, 2018}}</ref>

=== Former satellites ===
Another possibility is that before the giant impact, Earth had one or more normal satellites that shared its composition. Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and thus also Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

=== Capture ===
This hypothesis states that the Moon was captured by the Earth.<ref name=origin/> This model was popular until the 1980's, and some points in its favor are the Moon's size, orbit, and tidal locking.<ref name=origin/>

One problem is understanding the capture mechanism.<ref name=origin/> A close encounter of two planetary bodies typically results in either collision or altered trajectories. For this hypothesis to work, there might have been a large [[atmosphere]] around the primitive Earth, which would slow the movement of the Moon by [[aerobraking]] before it could escape. That hypothesis may also explain the [[irregular satellite]] orbits of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].<ref>{{Citation

The Common-Donor Capture theory explains the isotope similarities between the crust of the earth and the moon. Mercury has been suggested as the donor because samples from the earth and moon fall on exactly the same [[Mass-independent fractionation|fractionation]] line as [[Enstatite chondrite|enstatite chondrites]] which are thought to have originated in Mercury or in the region of Mercury. Pressure responsive silicon isotopes<ref>{{Cite web|title=Earth And Mars Are Different To The Core, Scientists Find|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070628162400.htm|access-date=2020-09-11|website=ScienceDaily|language=en}}</ref> concur with other isotopes by confirming that minerals on the surface of the moon and earth originated at great pressure, presumably from the interior of another planet.

===Fission===
This is the now discredited hypothesis that an ancient, rapidly spinning Earth expelled a piece of its mass.<ref name=origin>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180323131439/http://lunarorigin.com:80/lunar-origin-models/ Lunar Origin. JNot a valid reference must be a Scientifi publication]</ref>  This was proposed by [[George Darwin]] (son of the famous biologist [[Charles Darwin]]) in 1879<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wise |first1=D.

It was proposed that the [[Pacific Ocean]] represented the scar of this event.<ref name=origin/> Today it is known that the oceanic crust that makes up this ocean basin is relatively young, about 200&nbsp;million years old or less, whereas the Moon is much older. The Moon does not consist of oceanic crust but of mantle material, which originated inside the proto-Earth in the Precambrian.<ref name=Zhang/>

[[File:Lunar Thorium concentrations.jpg|thumb|Thorium concentrations on the Moon, as mapped by ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'']]

===Accretion===
The hypothesis of accretion suggests that the Earth and the Moon formed together as a double system from the primordial [[accretion disk]] of the [[Solar System]]<ref name="The Formation of the Moon">[http://burro.cwru.edu/Academics/Astr221/SolarSys/lunaform.html The Formation of the Moon] burro.cwru.edu</ref> or even a [[black hole]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150617-where-did-the-moon-come-from Where did the Moon come from? BBC]</ref>
The problem with this hypothesis is that it does not explain the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system or why the Moon has a relatively small iron core compared to the Earth (25% of its radius compared to 50% for the Earth).<ref name="The Formation of the Moon"/>

===Nuclear explosion===
Dutch scientists Rob de Meijer and Wim van Westrenen suggested in 2010 that the Moon may have formed from a nuclear explosion caused by the centrifugal force of an earlier, spinning proto-Earth. The centrifugal force would have concentrated heavy elements such as [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] on the equatorial plane and at the boundary between the Earth's [[outer core]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. If the concentrations of these radioactive elements were high enough, this could have led to a nuclear chain reaction that became supercritical, causing a nuclear explosion ejecting the Moon into orbit.<ref>https://phys.org/news/2010-01-moon-nuclear-explosion.html</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | arxiv=1001.4243| doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2012.12.015| title=Forming the Moon from terrestrial silicate-rich material| year=2013| last1=De Meijer| first1=R.J.| last2=Anisichkin| first2=V.F.| last3=Van Westrenen| first3=W.| journal=Chemical Geology| volume=345| pages=40–49| bibcode=2013ChGeo.345...40D| s2cid=55166272}}</ref> This [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] has been observed on earth at a much smaller scale.

===2011===
In 2011, it was theorized that a second moon existed 4.5&nbsp;billion years ago, and later had an impact with the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10289 | pmid=21814278 | volume=476 | issue=7358 | title=Forming the lunar farside highlands by accretion of a companion moon | year=2011 | journal=Nature | pages=69–72 | last1 = Jutzi | first1 = M.| bibcode=2011Natur.476...69J | s2cid=84558 }}</ref>
