This '''history by period''' summarizes significant eras in the [[history of the world]], from the ancient world to the present day.

== Ancient history (6,000 BCE – 650 CE) ==
{{main article|Ancient history}}
Ancient history refers to the time period in which scientists have found the earliest remains of human activity, approximately 6,000 BC. It ends with the fall of several significant empires, such as the [[Western Roman Empire ]] in the Mediterranean, the [[Han Dynasty]] in China, and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, collectively around 650 CE.

The [[Bronze Age]] is the time period in which humans around the world began to use [[bronze]] as a major metal in tools. It is generally accepted as starting around 3600 BCE and ending with the advent of iron in 1000 BCE.

The [[Iron Age]] is often called Antiquity or the Classical Era, but these periods more commonly refer to only one region. It begins around 1000 BCE with the widespread use of [[iron]] in tools. It is often accepted to end at approximately 650 CE, with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations.

Note that BC and BCE refer to the same time period. BCE is an abbreviation for Before Common Era, and BC for Before Christ. AD is Anno Domini, and CE is Common Era. This is done in order to standardize time periods across the world ([[ISO 8601]]).

The Contemporary Period generally covers history still in living memory, approximately 100 years behind the current year. However, for all intents and purposes, the period will be used here as spanning from the second world war in 1945 to present day, as it is considered separate from the past eras and the newest stage of world history.
