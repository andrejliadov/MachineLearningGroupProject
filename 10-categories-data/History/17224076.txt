'''Global Alliance For Preserving the History of WWII in Asia''' is a non-profit, non-partisan federation of over 40 grassroots organizations dedicated to the remembrance, redress and reconciliation concerning [[World War II]] in [[Asia]], also known as the [[Pacific War]].<ref>{{Citation |last = Global Alliance For Preserving the History of WWII in Asia|title = For Justice and Peace | year = 2008 | url = http://www.global-alliance.net/index.html|access-date = 2008-04-30}}</ref> It is concerned about crimes committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and issues related to them such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]], [[Unit 731]], [[Comfort women]], [[Prisoners of War]] and [[Forced Labor]]. It aims to bring together such groups electronically, organizationally, and personally. This federation has become increasingly recognized{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} as the leading organization safeguarding humanity and international justice with relation to [[World War II]] in Asia and the Pacific and its aftermath. It is also the first organization of its kind since previous similar groups were only focused on one or some aspects of the war.

==History==

{{Empty section|date=November 2016}}

==Mission and goals==
Global Alliance's mission focuses on bringing about the proper closure of unresolved issues arising from Japan’s aggression that led to World War II in Asia and the Pacific. It seeks justice for victims through punishment of those criminals that were either never put on trial or set free without fulfilling their sentence. Furthermore, it asks war reparations to be given to such victims that have been neglected for over five decades.

Besides reparation and redress, members of Global Alliance seek to preserve and disseminate the true story of the war. [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] theories have focused on the denial of such massacres as the [[Nanking Massacre|Rape of Nanjing]], and the actual events that took place during the war are largely unknown in [[Japan]] and the West. To address this issue, the organization has worked towards building a memorial museum in the U.S. similar to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] to preserve the truth of atrocities during World War II. Finally, Global Alliance advocates expanded coverage of World War II history in the public school textbooks, and has promoted the inclusion of material on the Asian experience of the war. Prevalent focus has been given to the European experience, which was not the only region suffering large losses during the war.

==Beliefs==
The federation believes that historical truth will bring about justice for victims and safeguard humanity from repeating the mistakes of the past. The following beliefs summarize Global Alliance's ideology: 
*A full accounting of the [[Asia-Pacific War]] is imperative with relation to the [[Japanese Government]]’s factions that foster [[collective amnesia]] and [[ultra-nationalism]], justifying and whitewashing [[Japanese war crimes]]
*[[Crimes against humanity]] were committed on a grand scale during this time period
*Victims are still seeking justice after nearly 60 years of the war’s end
*A nation who forgets the past is condemned to repeat its mistakes
*Embrace a feeling of sympathy and friendship with the people of Japan, for they too have been victims of [[Japanese militarism]]
*Transfer [[Confucius]]’ [[Golden Rule]] to an international scale: Nations shall not do unto other countries what they would not want others do unto themselves

==Demands==
Based on the premise that the Government of Japan has to honor its post-war responsibilities, Global Alliance demands that through legislation enacted by the [[Diet of Japan]], the Government of Japan must:
*Offer an official and unequivocal apology acknowledging the commission of atrocities in [[China]], [[Korea]], and other Asian states during the [[Asia-Pacific War]]
*Authorize full disclosure and preservation of documents relating to the mentioned events
*Mandate inclusion and teaching at all levels of schooling lessons of humanity learned from Japan’s wars of aggression and its related [[war crime]] issues in the first half of the 20th century
*Provide just and due compensation to all identified surviving victims and surviving family members of the deceased victims, and victims whose properties were looted and/or destroyed
*Amend all statutory limitations under Japanese laws to make them non-applicable to [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Imperial Forces]] during the [[Asia-Pacific War]] such that victims could seek due redress in the courts of Japan
*Provide funding for the creation of a memorial museum in [[Tokyo]] dedicated to: the commemoration and remembrance of [[war victims]] of the Asia-Pacific War, the preservation of documents declassified, research and publication of information pertaining to all facets of the war, educational outreach focusing on lessons learned through war crimes and related issues of this period, and to the efforts to bring closure to this war and to prevent future wars of aggression
*Outlaw public denial of war crimes committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]
*Prosecute the living Japanese war criminals that have escaped [[Japanese war crimes|international war crime trials]] after the end of the war, such as the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]]
*Remove relics of all war criminals now enshrined in the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] and prohibit honoring and worshiping of war criminals in that Shrine or any other religious establishments of national significance
*Establish a national day of remembrance for victims of the Asia-Pacific War
*Return all looted national treasures, including cultural and historical relics
*Honor the "[[Japanese military yen|military monetary certificates]]" issued by the Japanese occupational authorities for which people of victimized countries were forced to exchange their national currencies with due interest payment and adjustment for inflation

==Activities==
*Link to affiliate websites in order to enhance communication and public education
*Espouse the study, research, and dissemination of historical truths regarding World War II
*Support exhibits on World War II and exhibits on war crimes committed by the Japanese army
*Lobby to promote legislation in the U.S. and elsewhere that will facilitate sue for redress for victims
*Organize conferences to call the world’s attention to Japan’s unresolved wartime issues

==Related events==
*In 2000, a resolution ordering{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Japan to apologize and compensate victims of war crimes committed during World War II was proposed to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. The resolution included measures for comfort women, women who sexually serviced the Japanese Army. Congressman [[Lane Evans]] - [[Illinois' 13th congressional district]] - submitted the resolution to the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], formerly known as the International Relations Committee, on June 19 for consideration during the [[106th Congress]] in September. This resolution is the second of its kind, following one submitted by Congressman [[William Lipinski]]- [[Illinois' 3rd congressional district]] - in July 1997. The resolution was passed on to the International Relations Committee’s Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, but it was later scrapped when congressmen delayed passing the resolutions, fearing damage to United States relations with Japan.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
*In 2006, two members of the [[United States Congress]], Representative [[Lane Evans]] (D-Illinois) and Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (R-New Jersey), have introduced a non-binding resolution (H.Res. 759) in the current congressional session which calls on the government of Japan to "formally acknowledge and accept responsibility for its [[Comfort women|sexual enslavement]] of young women" during the 1930s and 40s.<ref>{{Citation |last = [[History News Network]] |title = US Congressional Resolution Calls on Japan to Accept Responsibility for Wartime Comfort women | year = 2006 | url = http://hnn.us/articles/24291.html|access-date = April 30, 2008}}</ref>
