{{short description|International educational organization}}
The '''European Association of History Educators''' (EUROCLIO) was established in 1992 with the support of the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[NGO]] works as a European wide facilitator for innovation and progress in history Education. The organisation contributes not only to the development, but also on the actual implementation of regional, national and European long-term projects, which focus on establishing knowledge, experience and expertise in the countries by training and consulting teachers. EUROCLIO develops teaching materials, builds and maintains professional Networks and acts as advisor to governments, international organisations, [[NGO]]s, History Teacher Associations and other Organisations. EUROCLIO is supported by the [[Europe for Citizens]] Programme of the European Union and has, for many years, Official Participatory Status and is part of the [[European Union|EU]] Stake Holder's Network in Education and Training.

== Background ==

=== History ===
EUROCLIO was officially founded in 1993, but already in 1992, delegates from [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], [[Portugal]], [[Hungary]], [[Estonia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] (14 countries), representing 18 history Teachers Associations decided that a European organization was needed to support the learning and teaching of history by sharing and exchanging knowledge and professional experience. EUROCLIO was founded by [[Joke van der Leeuw-Roord]]. The immediate cause for the foundation of such an institute was the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 and the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. These events changed the scope and perspective of history and history education in Europe completely and for many countries, a European dimension in history education suddenly became possible and important for the future. History education is frequently used as a vehicle for political [[propaganda]], hatred and aggression, but now the decision was made to renew contacts between East and West and reinforce a history education that could act as a tool to foster integration, peace and stability in Europe. From 1993 on, EUROCLIO grew rapidly and today it represents 64 member organizations from 46 (mostly) European countries, connecting 40,000 historians and history educators in primary, secondary and higher educational institutes.

=== Mission  ===

The organization supports the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

== Activities ==

=== Teacher Training and Conferences ===

Each year, EUROCLIO organises an International Training and Development Course where, on average, History Educators from more than 35 countries meet, learn and discuss a variety of topics and good practice to broaden their perspectives. These Annual Conferences take place in different countries and in close co-operation with local History Teachers’ Associations. In 2009, the Conference was in [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], on the theme “Taking the Perspective of the Others: Intercultural Dialogue and History Teaching”. This Conference is co-organised by nine Teacher Unions and History Educators’ Associations from across the divide.

All EUROCLIO Teacher Training activities are in close co-operation with both local academics and institutes for history teacher education, and international experts to train history teachers how to use the most modern teaching methods in their classes. For example: history educators everywhere recognise the importance of ICT as a learning and communications tool, and want further training in how to develop these areas and how to extend their skills in using ICT to promote historical understanding and learning. EUROCLIO operates through the medium of English for international work, and in home languages with translations for the experts supporting projects and in developmental work.

Since its foundation, EUROCLIO has organised more than 30 International Conferences and more than 70 National and Regional Training and Development Courses.

=== Programmes ===

EUROCLIO implements several long term programmes:
* '''International Trainings''' provides cross-border professional capacity building for history, heritage and citizenship educators related to innovative and responsible history education.
* '''Historiana - Your Portal to the Past''' promotes digital literacy through history, heritage and citizenship education by means of an on-line multimedia tool, offering students multi-perspective, cross-border and comparative historical resources supplementing their national history teaching tools.
* '''History that Connects in the Western Balkans''' restores the professional relations between history, heritage and citizenship educators and explores opportunities for a collaborative approach to teaching history in the region, including sensitive and controversial issues.
* '''Mediterranean Dialogues''' enables educators across the Euro-Mediterranean region to open a common dialogue, to share experiences and to develop cross-community and cross-border cooperation and networks.
* '''Innovating History Education in the Black Sea Region''' raises awareness in this region for approaches in history, heritage and citizenship education, which enhance democracy and intercultural dialogue and is creating sustainable national and cross border networks.
