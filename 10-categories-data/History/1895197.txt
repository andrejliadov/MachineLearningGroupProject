The '''British Book Awards''' or '''Nibbies''' are [[literary award]]s for the best UK writers and their works, administered by ''[[The Bookseller]]''. The awards have had several previous names, owners and sponsors since being launched in 1990, including the '''National Book Awards''' from 2010 to 2014.

==Book award history==

The '''British Book Awards''' or '''Nibbies''' ran from 1990–2009 and founded by the editor of ''[[Publishing News]]''.<ref name="hist">{{cite web|title=The British Book Awards - a History|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/british-book-awards/history|publisher=The Bookseller|access-date=11 August 2017}}</ref> The award was then acquired by [[Agile Marketing]] which renamed it the '''National Book Awards''' with headline sponsors '''Galaxy National Book Awards''' (2010–11) (sponsored by [[Galaxy (chocolate)|Galaxy]]) and '''Specsavers National Book Awards''' (2012–2014) (sponsored by [[Specsavers]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbookawards.co.uk:80/about-the-awards/ |title=About the awards |website=nationalbookawards.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119001303/http://www.nationalbookawards.co.uk/about-the-awards/# |archive-date=19 November 2012 |url-status=dead |quote=Before 2010 the awards were known as the British Book Awards.

In 2005, ''The Bookseller'' launched a separate scheme, The Bookseller Retail Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2010, running parallel to the National Book Awards, ''The Bookseller'' combined The Nibbies with its retail awards to produce '''The Bookseller Industry Awards''' (winners not listed in this article). In 2017 '''The British Book Industry Awards''' were renamed as The British Book Awards after it acquired the National Book Awards from Agile Marketing.<ref name="hist"/>

It is known as the ''Nibbies'' because of the golden [[nib (pen)|nib]]-shaped trophy given to winners.<ref name="about2017">{{cite web|title=About the British Book Awards|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/british-book-awards/about|work=The Bookseller|access-date=11 August 2017|date=2017}}</ref>
