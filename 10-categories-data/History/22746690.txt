The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to tropical cyclones:

'''[[Tropical cyclone]]''' &ndash; [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a large [[low pressure system|low-pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and heavy rain. Tropical [[cyclone]]s strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated [[air]] rises, resulting in [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] contained in the moist air. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s. The characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere, the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings; a phenomenon called "[[warm core]]" storm systems.

==Nature of tropical cyclones==

Tropical cyclones can be described as all of the following:
* [[Storm]] &ndash; disturbed state of an environment or astronomical body's atmosphere especially affecting its surface, and strongly implying severe weather. It may be marked by significant disruptions to normal conditions such as strong wind, hail, thunder and lightning (a thunderstorm), heavy precipitation (snowstorm, rainstorm), heavy freezing rain (ice storm), strong winds (tropical cyclone, windstorm), or wind transporting some substance through the atmosphere such as sand or debris.
* [[Natural disaster]] &ndash; major adverse event resulting from natural processes of the Earth; examples include floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other geologic processes. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or property damage, and typically leaves some economic damage in its wake, the severity of which depends on the affected population's resilience, or ability to recover.
