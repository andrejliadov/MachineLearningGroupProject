== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin<ref>{{cite book|last1= Edwards|first1= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slR7SFScEnwC&q=elamite+lurs}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&q=proto-lurs+elamite&pg=PA45}}</ref> or a Median or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |access-date=2015-09-21}}</ref>
=== Name ===
The first sighting of the word Lur is in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Luri tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Luri-inhabited areas. There are several hypotheses that discuss the origin of the name Lur or Lor, prominent amongst them is its attribution to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally forest or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.<ref>H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran</ref>

== Early History ==

The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated from Lorestan. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Iranian [[Medes]] invaded and settled in Luristan in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes assimilated the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC. In February 2017, archeological discoveries {{what|date=May 2020}} related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}</ref>

=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.<ref name=loor1>{{cite web| url= http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&ln=fa| title = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| trans-title=Is Ler Aryan or Elamite and Kasi?|access-date =September 13, 2014| date =September 26, 2010| publisher =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| language =fa| archive-url = https://archive.today/20120712064947/http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&ln=fa| archive-date=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam province and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Luri settlement. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise". Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later-arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In relation to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Edwards|first1= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slR7SFScEnwC&q=elamite+lurs}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&q=proto-lurs+elamite&pg=PA45}}</ref><ref name=Grugni>{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were warrior riders who repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They overthrew the government of Babylon and ruled the Babylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |title =قوم کاسی |trans-title =Kasy folk |publisher =مهدی رازانی |date =Dec 3, 1971 |access-date =January 17, 2019 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102009/http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |archive-date =October 6, 2014 |url-status =dead }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author =گرانتوسگی |title= ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز|trans-title=Iran from ancient times to today |publisher = تهران |date=1926 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author =پیگولووسکایا |title= ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸|trans-title=Iran from ancient times to the 18th century| publisher = تهران |date=1934 }}</ref>

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |title =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال |trans-title=Jabal (1) (Jebelab al-Jalal) or Jebel or mountain or mountain (mountainous mountain) or Balad Jabal|publisher =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |access-date =June 1, 2011|language=fa}}</ref> Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty and finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |title =پَهلَوی |trans-title=Pahlavi|publisher =[[Encyclopaedia Islamica|دانشنامه جهان اسلام]] |access-date =June 1, 2011|language=fa}}</ref>
