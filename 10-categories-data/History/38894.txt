'''Abolitionism''', or the '''abolitionist movement''', was the movement to end [[slavery]]. This term can be used both formally and informally. In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism was a historic movement that sought to end the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and set slaves free.

The British abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American [[Quakers]] began to question the morality of slavery, as noted at the Yearly Meetings of London and of Philadelphia in 1758.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} [[James Oglethorpe]] was among the first to articulate the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] case against slavery, banning it in the [[Province of Georgia]] on humanitarian grounds, and arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends [[Granville Sharp]] and [[Hannah More]] to vigorously pursue the cause.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Soon after his death in 1785, Sharp and More united with [[William Wilberforce]] and others in forming the [[Clapham Sect]].<ref>Wilson, Thomas, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 201–06.</ref>

The [[Somersett Case]] in 1772, in which a fugitive slave was freed with the judgement that slavery did not exist under [[English common law]], helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used [[slave labor]] continued to do so: [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[British Empire|British]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] territories in the West Indies, South America, and the Southern United States. After the [[American Revolution]] established the United States, northern states, [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|beginning with Pennsylvania]] in 1780, passed legislation during the next two decades abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual [[emancipation]]. Massachusetts [[Massachusetts Constitution|ratified a constitution]] that declared all men equal; [[freedom suits]] challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Vermont, which existed as an unrecognized state from 1777 to 1791, [[slavery in Vermont|abolished adult slavery in 1777]]. In other states, such as Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans and African Americans. During the following decades, the abolitionist movement grew in northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery in new states admitted to the union.

In 1787 the [[Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was formed in London. [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] abolished slavery throughout its empire in 1794, although it was [[Law of 20 May 1802|restored in 1802]] by [[Napoleon]] as part of a programme to ensure sovereignty over its colonies. Haiti (then Saint-Domingue) formally [[History of Haiti|declared independence from France]] in 1804 and became the first sovereign nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]] to unconditionally abolish slavery in the [[Human history#Modern history|modern era]].<ref name="The Washington Post">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/12/haiti-was-first-nation-permanently-ban-slavery/ |title=Haiti was the first nation to permanently ban slavery |publisher=Gaffield, Julia|accessdate=15 July 2020}}</ref> The northern states in the U.S. all abolished slavery by 1804. The United Kingdom (then including Ireland) and the United States outlawed the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] in 1807, after which Britain led efforts to [[Blockade of Africa|block slave ships]]. Britain abolished slavery throughout its empire by the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] (with the notable [[Slavery in India#Under early European colonial powers|exception of India]]), the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]] re-abolished it in 1848 and the U.S. abolished slavery in 1865 with the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]. In 1888 [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]] became the last country in the Americas to [[Golden Law|abolish slavery]].

In Eastern Europe, groups organized to abolish the enslavement of the [[Romani people|Roma]] in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and [[Emancipation reform of 1861|to emancipate the serfs in Russia]]. Slavery was declared illegal in 1948 under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. [[Mauritania]] was the last country to abolish slavery, with a presidential decree in 1981.<ref>"[http://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2012/03/world/mauritania.slaverys.last.stronghold/index.html Slavery's last stronghold]", CNN.

==Pre-Modern Anti-Slavery Views==

===Ancient times===

====The Essenes====

[[Philo of Alexandria]], a Jewish philosopher of the 1st century, offers a description of a group of Jews called the [[Essenes]] in his ''Every Good Man is Free''. He describes this isolated Jewish sect as rejecting many of the institutions of civilization, including that of the institution of slavery, on the basis that it violates the equality between all people that nature gives.<ref>[[Philo of Alexandria]], ''Every Good Man is Free'', 75-79</ref>

====Early Christianity====

In his [[Epistle to Philemon]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] requests the manumission of a slave named [[Onesimus]]<ref>Byron, John. "Paul and the background of slavery: the status quaestionis in New Testament scholarship." Currents in Biblical Research 3.1 (2004): 129</ref> writing "Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother" (Philemon 15-16). In 1 Corinthians 7:20-23, Paul warned his readers from becoming slaves and instructed individuals to make use of their opportunity to gain freedom from slavery if the opportunity became available.<ref>J. Albert Hill, ''The Manumission of Slaves in Early Christianity'', 1995, 68–128.</ref> In addition, the [[Book of Revelation]] condemns the slave trade on the basis that it involves the marketing of human souls and their bodies as if they were cargo.<ref>Vasser, Murray. "Bodies and Souls: The Case for Reading Revelation 18.13 as a Critique of the Slave Trade." New Testament Studies 64.3 (2018): 397-409.</ref>

In the fourth century, the bishop [[Gregory of Nyssa]] articulated a fundamentally Christian conception of the world that embedded a thorough rejection of the notion that one human could be owned by another and a condemnation of the institution of slavery. The historian {{ill|Kyle Harper|nl}} writes:

<blockquote>Humans were granted mastery over the animals by God. But in practicing slavery, humans overstepped the boundaries of their appointment. Gregory proceeded to attack slavery by questioning, philosophically, the paradigmatic act of the slave system: the sale. With penetrating insight, he asked how the human being, the rational creation of God, could be given a “price.” What, he asked, could have the same market value as human nature? “How much does rationality cost? How many obols for the image of God? How many staters did you get for selling the God-formed man?” Here Gregory offers a logic that was entirely novel in the ancient world but would reverberate in later centuries with tremendous consequence.<ref>Kyle Harper, “Christianity and the Roots of Human Dignity in Late Antiquity” in Shah and Hertzke, eds, ''Christianity and Freedom: Volume 1, Historical Perspectives'', 133-134. {{ISBN|978-1107124585}}.</ref></blockquote>

In addition, in a homily on 1 Corinthians, [[John Chrysostom]] reports that his readers understood 1 Corinthians 7:21 as instructing the escape from slavery when the opportunity is available to a slave. However, Chrysostom introduced a new interpretation asserting that the meaning of this passage was the opposite of what it is commonly understood as saying, and that it is implying that slaves should ''forego'' their opportunity to become free. Thus, Chrysostom set the trend for interpreting 1 Corinthians 7:21 for many centuries until modern scholars re-established the primary reading it had beforehand, although the original meaning was not forgotten and was often used to counter biblical arguments among American slaveowners who appealed to Chrysostom's interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:21 to justify slavery.<ref>J. Albert Harrill, "Revisiting the Problem of 1 Corinthians 7:21", ''Biblical Research'' (2020): 77-94.</ref>

The [[Synod of Gangra]] in the 4th century was a local assembly of a number of bishops that condemned what they claimed were heresies within their community. Among those heresies were Christians who were reported to have been encouraging slaves to escape the slavery imputed onto them by their masters.<ref>Jennifer Glancy, ''Slavery in Early Christianity'', 2002, pg. 90.</ref>

The evidence from both the Council of Gangra and the writings of John Chrysostom referring to a more widely held opinion regarding the freeing of slaves when possible or the censorship of an active group of Christians engaged in attempts to free slaves has been seen as evidence indicating a more widely held opinion among commoners, and it is "thus more likely points to the unmarked voices of rustics and traders, artisans and manual laborers, farmers and fishermen, and other raucous “middling” social inferiors below the aristocratic elite in Chrysostom’s congregation at Antioch".<ref>Harrill, "Revisiting the Problem of 1 Corinthians 7:21", Biblical Research (2020)</ref>

===Middle Ages===

In 1315, [[Louis X of France|Louis X]], king of France, published a decree proclaiming that "France signifies freedom" and that any slave setting foot on the French ground should be freed. This prompted subsequent governments to circumscribe slavery in the [[French colonial Empire|overseas colonies]].<ref>Christopher L. Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=480BBURkreYC&pg=PA122 ''The French Atlantic Triangle: literature and culture of the slave trade]'', Duke University Press, p. 20.</ref>

==France==

Some cases of African slaves freed by setting foot on the French soil were recorded such as this example of a [[Normandy|Norman]] slave merchant who tried to sell slaves in [[Bordeaux]] in 1571. He was arrested and his slaves were freed according to a declaration of the [[Parlement]] of [[Guyenne]] which stated that slavery was intolerable in France.<ref>Malick W. Ghachem, [https://books.google.com/books?id=btNeAEelkNMC&pg=PA54 ''The Old Regime and the Haitian Revolution''], Cambridge University Press, p. 54.</ref> Born into slavery in [[Saint Domingue]], [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]] became free when his father brought him to France in 1776.

===''Code Noir'' and Age of Enlightenment===
[[File:Portrait of Chevalier de Saint-George.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Chevalier de Saint-Georges]], known as the "Black Mozart", was, by his social position, and by his political involvement, a figurehead of free blacks.]]
As in other [[New World]] colonies, the French relied on the [[Atlantic slave trade]] for labour for their [[sugar cane]] [[plantations]] in their Caribbean colonies; the [[French West Indies]]. In addition, French colonists in ''[[Louisiane]]'' in North America held slaves, particularly in the South around [[New Orleans]], where they established sugarcane plantations.

[[Louis XIV]]'s ''[[Code Noir]]'' regulated the slave trade and institution in the colonies. It gave unparalleled rights to slaves. It included the right to marry, gather publicly, or take Sundays off. Although the ''Code Noir'' authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture them or to separate families. It also demanded enslaved Africans receive instruction in the Catholic faith, implying that Africans were human beings endowed with a soul, a fact French law did not admit until then. It resulted in a far higher percentage of blacks being free in 1830 (13.2% in [[History of slavery in Louisiana|Louisiana]] compared to 0.8% in [[History of Mississippi#Slavery|Mississippi]]).<ref>Rodney Stark, [https://archive.org/details/forgloryofgodhow0000star/page/322 ''For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-hunts, and the End of Slavery''], Princeton University Press, 2003, 0p. 322.

The ''Code Noir'' also forbade interracial marriages, but it was often ignored in French colonial society and the [[mulatto]]es became an intermediate caste between whites and blacks, while in the British colonies mulattoes and blacks were considered equal and discriminated against equally.<ref name="books.google.fr"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Martin H.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], many philosophers wrote pamphlets against slavery and its moral and economical justifications, including [[Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748) and [[Denis Diderot]] in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.<ref name="lorenzo et al"/> In 1788, [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] founded the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] (''Société des Amis des Noirs'') to work for the abolition of slavery. After the Revolution, on 4 April 1792, France granted [[free people of colour]] full citizenship.

The slave revolt, in the largest Caribbean French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in 1791, was the beginning of what became the [[Haitian Revolution]] led by formerly enslaved people like [[Georges Biassou]], [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]]. The rebellion swept through the north of the colony, and with it came freedom to thousands of enslaved blacks, but also violence and death.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution |last=Dubois |first=Laurent |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-674-03436-5 |pages=91–114|oclc = 663393691}}</ref> In 1793, French Civil Commissioners in St. Domingue and abolitionists, [[Léger-Félicité Sonthonax]] and [[Étienne Polverel]], issued the first emancipation proclamation of the modern world (Decree of 16 Pluviôse An II).

===First general abolition of slavery (1794)===
{{More citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}
[[File:Jacques Pierre Brissot (1754-1793).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques Pierre Brissot]] (1754–1793), who organized the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] in 1788.]]

The convention, the first elected Assembly of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] (1792–1804), on 4 February 1794, under the leadership of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], abolished slavery in law in France and its colonies. [[Henri Grégoire|Abbé Grégoire]] and the Society of the Friends of the Blacks were part of the abolitionist movement, which had laid important groundwork in building anti-slavery sentiment in the [[Metropolitan France|metropole]]. The first article of the law stated that "Slavery was abolished" in the French colonies, while the second article stated that "slave-owners would be indemnified" with financial compensation for the value of their slaves.  The French constitution passed in 1795 included in the declaration of the Rights of Man that slavery was abolished.

===Re-establishment of slavery in the colonies (1802)===

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], French slave-owners massively joined the [[counter-revolution]] and, through the [[Whitehall Accord (1794)|Whitehall Accord]], they threatened to move the French Caribbean colonies under British control, as Great Britain still allowed slavery. Fearing secession from these islands, successfully lobbied by planters and concerned about revenues from the West Indies, and influenced by the slaveholder family of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|his wife]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] decided to re-establish slavery after becoming [[First Consul]]. He promulgated the [[law of 20 May 1802]] and sent military governors and troops to the colonies to impose it. On 10 May 1802, [[Louis Delgrès|Colonel Delgrès]] launched a rebellion in [[Guadeloupe]] against Napoleon's representative, [[Antoine Richepanse|General Richepanse]]. The rebellion was repressed, and slavery was re-established. The news of this event sparked another wave of rebellion in Saint-Domingue. Although from 1802, Napoleon sent more than 20,000 troops to the island, two-thirds died mostly due to yellow fever. He withdrew the remaining 7,000 troops and slaves achieved an independent republic they called [[Haïti]] in 1804. Seeing the failure of the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]], in 1803 Napoleon decided to [[Louisiana Purchase|sell]] the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States. The French governments initially refused to recognize Haiti. It forced the nation to pay a substantial amount of reparations (which it could ill afford) for losses during the revolution and did not recognize its government until 1825.

France was a signatory to the first [[multilateral treaty]] for the suppression of the slave trade, the [[Treaty for the Suppression of the African Slave Trade]] (1841), but the king, [[Louis Philippe I]], declined to ratify it.

===Second abolition (1848) and subsequent events===
[[File:Biard Abolition de l'esclavage 1849.jpg|thumb|left|"Abolition of Slavery in French Colonies, 1848" by [[Auguste François Biard]] (1849).]]

On 27 April 1848, under the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848–52), the [[decree-law]] of [[Victor Schœlcher|Schœlcher]] abolished slavery in the remaining colonies. The state bought the slaves from the ''colons'' (white colonists; ''[[Béké]]s'' in [[Creole language|Creole]]), and then freed them.

At about the same time, France started colonizing Africa and gained possession of much of West Africa by 1900. In 1905, the French abolished slavery in most of [[French West Africa]]. The French also attempted to abolish Tuareg slavery following the [[Kaocen Revolt]]. In the region of the Sahel, slavery has however long persisted.

Passed on 10 May 2001, the [[Christiane Taubira|Taubira law]] officially acknowledges slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade as a [[crime against humanity]]. 10 May was chosen as the day dedicated to recognition of the crime of slavery.

The last known form of enforced servitude of adults ([[villein]]age) had disappeared in England by the beginning of the 17th century. In 1569 a court considered the case of Cartwright, who had bought a slave from Russia. The court ruled English law could not recognize slavery, as it was never established officially.

In addition to English colonists importing slaves to the North American colonies, by the 18th century, traders began to import slaves from Africa, India and East Asia (where they were trading) to [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] to work as personal servants.

Some of the first [[freedom suits]], court cases in the British Isles to challenge the legality of slavery, took place in Scotland in 1755 and 1769. The cases were ''Montgomery v. Sheddan'' (1755) and ''Spens v. Dalrymple'' (1769). Each of the slaves had been baptized in Scotland and challenged the legality of slavery. They set the precedent of legal procedure in British courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for the plaintiffs. In these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.<ref name="The National Archives of Scotland">{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071022.asp |title=Slavery, freedom or perpetual servitude? – the Joseph Knight case |publisher=[[National Archives of Scotland]]|accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref>

African slaves were not bought or sold in London but were brought by masters from other areas. Together with people from other nations, especially non-Christian, Africans were considered foreigners, not able to be English subjects. At the time, England had no [[naturalization]] procedure. The African slaves' legal status was unclear until 1772 and [[Somersett's Case]], when the fugitive slave James Somersett forced a decision by the courts. Somersett had escaped, and his master, Charles Steuart, had him captured and imprisoned on board a ship, intending to ship him to [[Jamaica]] to be resold into slavery. While in London, Somersett had been [[baptism|baptized]]; three godparents issued a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. As a result, [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench|Court of the King's Bench]], had to judge whether Somersett's abduction was lawful or not under English [[Common Law]]. No legislation had ever been passed to establish slavery in England. The case received national attention, and five advocates supported the action on behalf of Somersett.

In his judgement of 22 June 1772, Mansfield declared:

<blockquote>The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.<ref>Frederick Charles Moncrieff, ''The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar'', The Lawbook Exchange, 2006, pp. 85–86.</ref></blockquote>

Although the [[Slavery at common law|exact legal implications]] of the judgement are unclear when analysed by lawyers, the judgement was generally taken at the time to have determined that slavery did not exist under English common law and was thus prohibited in England.<ref>Mowat, Robert Balmain, ''History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', Oxford University Press, 1943, p. 162.</ref> The decision did not apply to the British overseas territories; by then, for example, the American colonies had established slavery by positive laws.<ref>MacEwen, Martin, ''Housing, Race and Law: The British Experience'', Routledge, 2002, p. 39.</ref> Somersett's case became a significant part of the common law of slavery in the English-speaking world and it helped launch the movement to abolish slavery.<ref>Peter P.

After reading about Somersett's Case, [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]], an enslaved African who had been purchased by his master John Wedderburn in Jamaica and brought to Scotland, left him. Married and with a child, he filed a [[freedom suit]], on the grounds that he could not be held as a slave in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. In the case of ''[[Knight v. Wedderburn]]'' (1778), Wedderburn said that Knight owed him "perpetual servitude". The [[Court of Session]] of Scotland ruled against him, saying that [[chattel slavery]] was not recognized under the [[law of Scotland]], and slaves could seek court protection to leave a master or avoid being forcibly removed from Scotland to be returned to slavery in the colonies.<ref name="The National Archives of Scotland"/>

In the 1776 book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Adam Smith]] argued for the abolition of slavery on economic grounds. Smith pointed out that slavery incurred security, housing, and food costs that the use of free labor would not, and opined that free workers would be more productive because they would have personal economic incentives to work harder. The death rate (and thus repurchase cost) of slaves was also high, and people are less productive when not allowed to choose the type of work they prefer, are illiterate, and are forced to live and work in miserable and unhealthy conditions. The free labor markets and international free trade that Smith preferred would also result in different prices and allocations that Smith believed would be more efficient and productive for consumers.

Prior to the [[American Revolution]], there were few significant initiatives in the American colonies that led to the abolitionist movement. Some Quakers were active. [[Benjamin Kent]] was the lawyer who took on most of the cases of slaves suing their masters for personal illegal enslavement. He was the first lawyer to successfully establish a slave's freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blanck |first1=Emily |title=Forging an American Law of Slavery in Revolutionary South Carolina and Massachusetts |date=2014 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=9780820338644 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e-wBAAAQBAJ}}</ref> In addition, Brigadier General [[Samuel Birch (military officer)|Samuel Birch]] created the [[Book of Negroes]], to establish which slaves were free after the war.

In 1783, an anti-slavery movement began among the British public to end slavery throughout the British Empire.

After the formation of the [[Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] in 1787, [[William Wilberforce]] led the cause of abolition through the parliamentary campaign. [[Thomas Clarkson]] became the group's most prominent researcher, gathering vast amounts of data on the trade. One aspect of abolitionism during this period was the effective use of images such as the famous [[Josiah Wedgwood]] "[[Josiah Wedgwood#Abolitionism|Am I Not A Man and a Brother?]]" anti-slavery medallion of 1787.  Clarkson described the medallion as "promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom".<ref>{{cite web

In the 1820s, the abolitionist movement revived to campaign against the institution of slavery itself. In 1823 the first Anti-Slavery Society, the [[Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions]], was founded. Many of its members had previously campaigned against the slave trade. On 28 August 1833, the [[Slavery Abolition Act]] was passed. It purchased the slaves from their masters and paved the way for the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire by 1838,<ref>Mary Reckord, "The Colonial Office and the Abolition of Slavery."

In 1839, the [[British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]] was formed by [[Joseph Sturge]], which attempted to outlaw slavery worldwide and also to pressure the government to help enforce the suppression of the slave trade by declaring [[slave traders]] to be pirates.

==In the Americas==
[[File:Hugh Elliot.png|right|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Hugh Elliot]] was a noted abolitionist. Whilst Governor in the [[British West Indies]], he was reported to be the driving force behind the arrest, trial and execution of a wealthy white planter [[Arthur William Hodge|Arthur Hodge]] for the murder of a slave.]]

[[Bartolomé de las Casas]] was a 16th-century [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest, the first resident Bishop of [[Chiapas]] (Central America, today Mexico). As a settler in the [[New World]] he witnessed and opposed the poor treatment and virtual slavery of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by the Spanish colonists, under the [[encomienda]] system. He advocated before King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] on behalf of rights for the natives.

Las Casas for 20 years worked to get African slaves imported to replace natives; African slavery was everywhere and no one talked of ridding the New World of it, though France had abolished slavery in France itself and there was talk in other countries about doing the same. In fact, from a purely economic point of view Africans were better slaves, stronger and healthier, because the "[[Middle Passage]]" had selected for these traits. However, Las Casas had a late change of heart, and became an advocate for the Africans in the colonies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3184668.stm |title=Columbus 'sparked a genocide' |date=12 October 2003|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Blackburn 1997: 136; Friede 1971:165–66. Las Casas' change in his views on African slavery is expressed particularly in chapters 102 and 129, Book III of his ''Historia''.</ref>

His book, ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'', contributed to Spanish passage of colonial legislation known as the [[New Laws of 1542]], which abolished native slavery for the first time in European colonial history. It ultimately led to the [[Valladolid debate]], the first European debate about the rights of colonized people.

During the early 19th century, slavery expanded rapidly in Brazil, Cuba, and the United States, while at the same time the new republics of mainland Spanish America became committed to the gradual abolition of slavery.  During the [[Spanish American wars of independence|Spanish American wars for independence]] (1810–1826), slavery was abolished in most of Latin America, though it continued until 1873 in [[Afro-Puerto Ricans#Abolition of slavery|Puerto Rico]], 1886 in Cuba, and 1888 in Brazil (where it was abolished by the ''[[Lei Áurea]]'', the "Golden Law"). Chile declared [[freedom of wombs]] in 1811, followed by the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] in 1813, [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] in 1821, but without abolishing slavery completely. While Chile abolished slavery in 1823, Argentina did so with the signing of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]]. Peru abolished slavery in 1854. Colombia abolished slavery in 1851.  Slavery was abolished in Uruguay during the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'', by both the government of [[Fructuoso Rivera]] and the [[government in exile]] of [[Manuel Oribe]].<ref>Peter Hinks and John McKivigan, eds.

With slaves escaping to New York and New England, legislation for gradual emancipation was passed in [[Upper Canada]] (1793) and [[Lower Canada]] (1803). In Upper Canada, the [[Act Against Slavery]] of 1793 was passed by the Assembly under the auspices of [[John Graves Simcoe]]. It was the first legislation against slavery in the [[British Empire]]. Under its provisions no new slaves could be imported, slaves already in the province would remain enslaved until death, and children born to female slaves would be slaves but must be freed at the age of 25. The last slaves in Canada gained their freedom when slavery was abolished in the entire British Empire by the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833.<ref>Robin Winks, ''Blacks in Canada: A History'' (1971).</ref>

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a slaveholder for much of his life, became a leading member of the [[Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery]], the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Seymour Stanton Black|title=Benjamin Franklin: Genius of Kites, Flights, and Voting Rights}}</ref> Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the [[Constitution of Vermont#1777|1777 Constitution of Vermont]], followed by [[Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780]]. Other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, and by 1804, all the Northern states had abolished it, although this did not mean that already enslaved people were freed. Some had to work without wages as "[[indentured servants]]" for two more decades, although they could no longer be sold.

Also in the post-Revolutionary years, individual slaveholders, especially in the [[Upper South]], manumitted slaves, sometimes in their wills. (In the [[Deep South]] manumission was made difficult; in South Carolina every manumission required legislative approval, and the freed slaves had to leave the state immediately.) Many noted that they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than one percent to nearly ten percent from 1790 to 1810 in the Upper South as a result of these actions.

By 1840 more than 15,000 people were members of abolitionist societies in the United States.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Young people's encyclopedia of the United States|date=1993|publisher=Millbrook Press|others=Shapiro, William E.|isbn=1-56294-514-9|location=Brookfield, Conn.|oclc=30932823}}</ref>

In the 1850s in the fifteen states constituting the [[Southern United States|American South]], slavery was legally established. While it was fading away in the cities as well as in the border states, it remained strong in plantation areas that grew cotton for export, or sugar, tobacco, or hemp.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. White southern leaders said that the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and they also said it challenged their autonomy. With the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential victory]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and the labor of enslaved people decided to secede and form a new nation. The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861 with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|firing on Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. When [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|Lincoln called for troops]] to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded. Meanwhile, four slave states (Maryland, Missouri, Delaware, and Kentucky) chose to remain in the Union.

====Civil War and final emancipation====
[[File:Mustered out, harper's weekly, little rock, AR.jpg|right|thumb|Black volunteer soldiers muster out to their first freedom, ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 1866]]
On 16 April 1862, Abraham Lincoln signed the [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act]], abolishing slavery in Washington D. C.  Meanwhile, the Union suddenly found themselves dealing with a steady stream of escaped slaves from the South rushing to Union lines.  In response, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Acts]], which essentially declared escaped slaves from the South to be confiscated war property, called [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]], so that they would not be returned to their masters in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].  Although the initial act did not mention emancipation, the second Confiscation Act, passed on 17 July 1862, stated that escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion "shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves." Later on, Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order of the U.S. government issued on 1 January 1863, changing the legal status of 3&nbsp;million slaves in the Confederacy from "slave" to "forever free". Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation and became actually free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Many served the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses, and laborers, as well as scouts, spies, and guides. Confederate General Robert Lee once said "The chief source of information to the enemy is through our negroes."<ref>https://www.historynet.com/african-americans-in-the-civil-war</ref> Plantation owners sometimes moved the Blacks they claimed to own as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.<ref>Leon F. Litwack, ''Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery'' (1979), pp. 30–36, 105–66.</ref> By "[[Juneteenth]]" (19 June 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all its slaves. The owners were never compensated, nor were freed slaves compensated by former owners.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed., ''The Emancipation Proclamation: A Brief History with Documents'' (2010).</ref><ref>Peter Kolchin, "Reexamining Southern Emancipation in Comparative Perspective," ''Journal of Southern History'', 81#1 (February 2015), 7–40.</ref>

As the war dragged on, both the federal government and Union states continued to take measures against slavery.  In June 1864, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], which required free states to aid in returning escaped slaves to slave states, was repealed.  The state of Maryland abolished slavery on 13 October 1864.  Missouri abolished slavery on 11 January 1865. [[West Virginia]], which had been admitted to the Union in 1863 as a slave state, but on the condition of gradual emancipation, fully abolished slavery on 3 February 1865.  The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] took effect in December 1865, 7 months after the end of the war, and finally ended slavery throughout the United States.

==National abolition dates==<!-- This section is linked from [[Slavery]] -->
{{Main|Timeline of abolition of slavery and serfdom}}
[[File:Abolicion de la esclavitud en Venezuela.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[José Gregorio Monagas]] abolished slavery in [[Venezuela]] in 1854.]]

== After abolition ==
In societies with large proportions of the population working in conditions of slavery or serfdom, stroke-of-the-pen laws declaring abolition can have thorough-going social, economic and political consequences. Issues of [[Compensated emancipation|compensation]]/redemption, land-redistribution and citizenship can prove intractable. For example:

* Haiti, which effectively achieved abolition due to slave revolt (1792–1804), struggled to overcome racial or anti-revolutionary prejudice in the international financial and diplomatic scene, and [[economy of Haiti|exchanged unequal prosperity for relative poverty]].
* Russia's emancipation of its serfs in 1861 failed to allay rural and industrial unrest, which played a part in fomenting the [[Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1917]].
* The United States of America achieved theoretical freedom for its slaves in 1864–1865, but faced ongoing slavery-associated racial issues ([[Jim Crow system]], [[Civil rights movement|civil-rights struggles]]).
* [[Queensland]] deported most of its [[blackbirding|blackbirded]] Pacific Islander labour-force in 1901–1906.

Emancipation proved arguably less disruptive in areas such as Prussia or Sweden.

== Commemoration ==
People in modern times have commemorated abolitionist movements and the abolition of slavery in different ways around the world. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2004 the [[International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition]]. This proclamation marked the bicentenary of the proclamation of the first modern slavery-free state, Haiti. Numerous exhibitions, events and research programmes became associated with the initiative.

2007 witnessed major exhibitions in British museums and galleries to mark the anniversary of the 1807 abolition act – 1807 Commemorated<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated |title= 1807 Commemorated |publisher= Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past and the Institute of Historical Research |year= 2007 |accessdate= 27 November 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101226235736/http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/ |archive-date= 26 December 2010 |url-status= dead }}</ref> 2008 marked the 201st anniversary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade in the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web |title= Slave Trade Act 1807 UK |url= http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1807act.htm |publisher= anti-slaverysociety.addr.com }}</ref> It also marked the 175th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web |title= Slavery Abolition Act 1833 UK |url= http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm |publisher= anti-slaverysociety.addr.com }}</ref>

On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the United Nations adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Article 4 states:

<blockquote>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.</blockquote>

Although outlawed in most countries, slavery is nonetheless practised secretly in many parts of the world.  Enslavement still takes place in the [[Human trafficking in the United States|United States]], Europe, and Latin America,<ref>[[Kevin Bales|Bales, Kevin]]. ''Ending Slavery: How We Free Today's Slaves''.

Modern-day abolitionists have emerged over the last several years, as awareness of slavery around the world has grown, with groups such as [[Anti-Slavery International]], the [[American Anti-Slavery Group]], [[International Justice Mission]], and [[Free the Slaves]] working to rid the world of slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Epps|first=Henry|title=A Concise Chronicle History of the African-American People Eperience in America|pages= 146}}</ref>

In the United States, The Action Group to End Human Trafficking and Modern-Day Slavery is a coalition of NGOs, [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundations]] and corporations working to develop a policy agenda for abolishing slavery and human trafficking.  Since 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice]] has, through work with the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], prosecuted six individuals in Florida on charges of slavery in the agricultural industry.  These prosecutions have led to freedom for over 1000 enslaved workers in the tomato and orange fields of South Florida.  This is only one example of the contemporary fight against slavery worldwide.  Slavery exists most widely in agricultural labour, apparel and sex industries, and service jobs in some regions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Kathrine Lynn|last2=Bendixsen|first2=Casper G.|date=2 January 2017|title="When This Breaks Down, It's Black Gold": Race and Gender in Agricultural Health and Safety|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=56–65|doi=10.1080/1059924X.2016.1251368|pmid=27782783|s2cid=4251094|issn=1059-924X}}</ref>

In 2014, for the first time in history major Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox Christian leaders, as well as Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist leaders, met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by the year 2020.<ref name="The Huffington Post">{{cite news|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6256640|title=Pope Francis And Other Religious Leaders Sign Declaration Against Modern Slavery|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=2 December 2014|last1=Belardelli|first1=Giulia}}</ref> The signatories were: [[Pope Francis]], [[Mata Amritanandamayi|Mātā Amṛtānandamayī]] (also known as Amma), Bhikkhuni Thich Nu [[Chân Không]] (representing Zen Master [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]]), [[Datuk K.

The [[United States Department of State]] publishes the annual Trafficking in Persons Report, identifying countries as either Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 2 Watch List or Tier 3, depending upon three factors: "(1) The extent to which the country is a country of origin, transit, or destination for severe forms of trafficking; (2) The extent to which the government of the country does not comply with the TVPA's minimum standards including, in particular, the extent of the government's trafficking-related corruption; and (3) The resources and capabilities of the government to address and eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105376.htm |title=US Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2008, Introduction |publisher=state.gov}}</ref>
