The [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland]] on 20 March 2010 affected the economic, political and cultural activities in Europe and across the world.

There was an [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption|extensive air travel disruption]] caused by the closure of airspace over many countries affecting the travel arrangements of hundreds of thousands of people in Europe and elsewhere. Sporting, entertainment and many other events were cancelled, delayed or disrupted when individuals or teams were unable to travel to their destination.

The [[Death and state funeral of Lech Kaczyński and Maria Kaczyńska|state funeral]] of President of Poland [[Lech Kaczyński]] and his wife [[Maria Kaczyńska]] on 18 April 2010 was affected as some national leaders were unable to attend, including [[Barack Obama]], [[Stephen Harper]], [[Angela Merkel]], and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].

=== European economies ===
Several sectors that depend on air-freighted imports and exports were badly affected by the flight disruptions.

Imports of medications were affected, and local stocks, as they expire.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2010/04/17/Ash-disrupts-deliveries-to-British-shops/UPI-24111271522165/ Ash disrupts deliveries to British shops], UPI.com, 17 April 2010/</ref>

The carmaker [[BMW]] said it was suspending production at three of its plants in Germany, because of interruptions in the supply of parts. As waylaid travellers scrambled for other modes of transport, ferry and railway companies enjoyed an unexpected bonanza, while some car-hire firms were reportedly hiking charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8633451.stm |title=Travel chaos persists despite easing of air lockdown |publisher=BBC News |date= 21 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

In the United Kingdom alone thirteen travel firms collapsed during the summer of 2010. The ash cloud disruption was cited as one of the contributing factors.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10449594 Kiss Flights travel company ceases trading]. Bbc.co.uk (18 August 2010).

=== African economies ===
[[Kenya]] is reported to have destroyed 400 tonnes of flowers it was unable to airship into the UK on 19 and 20 April 2010. As a result, their economy was estimated to be incurring losses of $3.8m each day of the disruption.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8629623.stm "Iceland volcano cloud: The economic impact"] BBC News, 19 April 2010</ref> Thousands of [[Kenya]]n farm workers were temporarily [[Layoff|laid off]] as harvesting of flowers and vegetables was stopped by 19 April due to the grounding of flights.

[[Zambia]]'s flower and vegetable industry lost about $150,000 (£98,000) a day. Other African industries, such as [[Uganda]]'s fish and flower export businesses, were also affected by the lack of air freight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8631439.stm |title=Zambia flowers and food exports hit by ash flight ban |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

=== Asian economies ===
[[Nissan]] declared a suspension in the production of three models in Japan on 21 April 2010 because supply of parts has been disrupted. It stopped production of 2,000 vehicles in two plants. [[Honda]] also announced a partial halt to production. Factories in China's Guangdong province saw air shipments of clothes and jewellery delayed. In South Korea, [[Samsung]] and [[LG]] were unable to air-freight more than 20% of their daily electronics exports and the Federation of Hong Kong Industries said hotels and restaurants in Hong Kong were facing shortages of European produce.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8631676.stm |title=Ash disruption causes Nissan to suspend some production |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>

=== New Zealand economies ===
The New Zealand fisheries economy was helped by the disruption caused to air transport in Europe. Difficulties in bringing fresh [[salmon]] to international markets normally supplied by Norway and other northern European states have substantially boosted orders for New Zealand salmon.
Similarly the [[Netherlands]] is unable to supply [[Cymbidium|orchids]] for the start of the May wedding market in North America.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The volcano released approximately 150,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> each day, but the massive reduction of air travel occurring over European skies caused by the ash cloud, saved an estimated 1.3 to 2.8 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] from entering the atmosphere by 19 April 2010.<ref>{{cite news
