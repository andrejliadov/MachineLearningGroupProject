==The Archives of Political History and of Trade Unions==

The precursor of the archives was established in 1948. It served as a department of the Institute of Labour Movement of the Hungarian Workers' Party until 1955, of the Institute of Party History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] from 1957, of the Institute of Political History of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] between 1989 and 1998, and as a part of the non-profit organization of the Institute of Political History from 1998. Its maintainer is the Foundation of Political History. Before 1989, the archives had been collecting primarily the documents of the pre-1945 legal and illegal movements of the Hungarian labour movement, of the parties of the popular democratic period following the [[First World War]], of the left-wing youth organizations, and of the people connected to these movements and organizations. Now it is storing the documents of the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]] and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party as well until 1992. Since 1998 it has been storing the documents of the Hungarian trade-unionist movement that were produced during the period of 1945 to 1989 and which had previously been stored in the [[Central Archives of Trade Unions]]. Nowadays the archives are focusing not merely on the political Left, but also on the entire Hungarian history of the [[modern age]].
