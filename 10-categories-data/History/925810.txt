'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',<ref>{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=978-0-203-88002-9}}</ref> from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a "pivotal age", characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

During this period, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged.

The concept of an axial age is disputed.

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book {{lang|de|Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte}} (''The Origin and Goal of History''),<ref name="Jaspers">Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, p. 2.</ref> published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].<ref name="Metzler2009" /> Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).<ref name="Metzler2009">{{cite journal

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers—[[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]],—of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".<ref name="Jaspers51">{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.</ref> It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.<ref name = "Thomassen">{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | author-link= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659| s2cid= 143930719 }}</ref>

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning<ref name = "Neville">{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&q=%22Axial+Age&pg=PA104 | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}</ref> and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Mediterranean.<ref name="Eisenstadt">{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | author-link = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&pg=PA1}}</ref>

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies which preceded them.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last1=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first1= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = New York|page = 162}}</ref>

==Thinkers and movements==
In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] (c. 6th century BCE) were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions. [[Mary Boyce]] believes it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.<ref name = "Boyce1979">{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | author-link = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url=https://archive.org/details/zoroastriansthei00boyc_0|url-access=registration| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | page = 77 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}</ref> William W.

[[Jainism]] propagated the religion of [[sramana]]s (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced [[Indian philosophy]] by propounding the principles of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Karma in Jainism|karma]],  [[samsara]] and [[asceticism]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Zydenbos | first = Robert J | author-link = Robert J.

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived c. 5th century BCE; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]] (c. 4th century BCE), which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.<ref name = "Voegelin1985">{{cite book |last= Voegelin |first= Eric |author-link= Eric Voegelin |series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order |location=Columbia | publisher = The University of Missouri Press |year= 2000 |orig-year= 1985 |isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}</ref> Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}</ref>

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."<ref name = "Graeber">{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.</ref> Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion".<ref>{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}</ref>

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.<ref name= "Stanford">{{cite encyclopedia | year=2006 | title = Karl Jaspers | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate= 2006-06-14}}</ref><ref name ="Szakolczai">{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition= First hardcover | publisher =Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hGduSwFHFSEC&q=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&pg=PA80}}</ref><ref name= "EoST">{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter = Historical sociology | publisher = Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5 |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LrBrWXtez8YC&q=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&pg=PA251 | page = 251}}</ref> [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that Weber's work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.<ref name="Eisenstadt" /> Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion among other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.<ref name = "EoST" /> In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC |title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-1438401942 |series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies |date=2012 |page=31 |chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece |quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes. [...] In the economic field, we find a growing occupational differentiation between the economic ties to the land and the urban vocations, be they in trade, craft, industry, or the ritual and educational fields. This phenomenon was also very closely connected with the development of many free economic resources—partially even land and manpower resources—not bound to ascriptive social units, the concomitant development of widespread internal and external, relatively free, market activities, and the accumulation of relatively mobile capital. |last1=Eisenstadt |first1=Shmuel N. |editor1-last=Eisenstadt |editor1-first=Shmuel N. |accessdate=2015-06-28}}

Religious historian [[Karen Armstrong]] explored the period in her ''The Great Transformation'',<ref name= "Armstrong">{{cite book | first = Karen | last=Armstrong | author-link=Karen Armstrong | year= 2006 | title= The Great Transformation: The Beginning of our Religious Traditions | edition=First | publisher=Knopf | location=New York | isbn= 0-676-97465-1}}</ref> and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences.<ref name="Conference">{{cite web|author=Strath, Bo |year=2005 |title=Axial Transformations |url=http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?/Personal/Strath/archive/past_conferences/axialtrans.htm |accessdate=2006-06-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233849/http://www.iue.it/Personal/Strath/Welcome.html?%2FPersonal%2FStrath%2Farchive%2Fpast_conferences%2Faxialtrans.htm |archive-date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Yves Lambert argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a Second Axial Age, including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Albert Einstein]], wherein relationships between religion, secularism, and traditional thought are changing.<ref name="modern">{{cite journal | first =Yves | last = Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= 3| pages= 303–333 |url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939| jstor = 3711939 }}</ref>

The validity of the concept has been called into question.

In 2006 [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] called the Jaspers thesis "a baggy monster, which tries to bundle up all sorts of diversities over four very different civilisations, only two of which had much contact with each other during the six centuries that (after adjustments) he eventually singled out, between 800 and 200&nbsp;BCE".<ref>{{Cite news |title = The axis of goodness | date = 17 March 2006 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/18/highereducation.news |first = Diarmaid | last = MacCulloch |author-link = Diarmaid MacCulloch |work = [[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

In 2013, another comprehensive critique appears in [[Iain Provan]]'s book ''Convenient Myths: The Axial Age, Dark Green Religion, and the World That Never Was''.{{Sfn | Provan | 2013}}

In 2018, contrary to Suzuki and Provan, and similar to Whitaker, [[Stephen Sanderson]] published another book dealing somewhat with the axial age and its religious contributions, arguing that religions and religious change in general are essentially biosocial adaptations to changing environments.<ref name="Sanderson">Stephen K.
