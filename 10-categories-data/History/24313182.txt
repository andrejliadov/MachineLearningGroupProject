Both [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] thought and [[Jewish history|ancient Jewish]] thought are considered to have affected early Christian thought about abortion.  According to Bakke and Clarke &Linzey, early Christians adhered to Aristotle's belief in delayed ensoulment,<ref name=bioethics>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HZ2aOV2BSQC&pg=PA5 A companion to bioethics] By Helga Kuhse, Peter Singer</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2011|reason=this speaks of the Hippocratic Oath and mediaeval writers; nothing about alleged early Christian acceptance of Aristotle}}<ref name=religioustolerance>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm ReligiousTolerance.org]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2011|reason=says nothing about early Christian acceptance of Aristotle's ideas}}<ref name=bakke />{{Request quotation|date=July 2011}}<ref name="dictionaryethics"/>{{Request quotation|date=July 2011}}<ref name="Stemcells"/>{{Failed verification|date=July 2011|reason=this says nothing about alleged early Christian acceptance of Aristotle}} and consequently did not see abortion before ensoulment as homicide.<ref name=bakke />{{rp|150}}<ref name=dictionaryethics /> Lars Østnor says this view was only "presaged" by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]],<ref name="Stemcells"/> who belongs to a period later than that of [[early Christianity]]. According to David Albert Jones, this distinction appeared among Christian writers only in the late fourth and early fifth century, while the earlier writers made no distinction between formed and unformed, a distinction explicitly rejected by 4th-century Saint [[Basil of Caesarea]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VSG94ZH0SxEC&pg=PA73 David Albert Jones, ''Soul of the Embryo: Christianity and the Human Embryo''] (Continuum International 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6296-1}}), pp. 72-73</ref> who also, though earlier than Saint Augustine, does not belong to the early-Christianity period. While the Hebrew text of the Bible only required a fine for the loss of a fetus, whatever its stage of development, the Jewish [[Septuagint]] translation, which the early Christians used, introduced a distinction between a formed and an unformed fetus and treated destruction of the former as murder.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xh9vy_dvO6YC&pg=PA24 Daniel Schiff, ''Abortion in Judaism''] (Cambridge University Press 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-521-52166-6}}), pp. 9, 24</ref> It has been commented that "the [[Septuagint|LXX]] could easily have been used to distinguish human from non-human fetuses and homicidal from non-homicidal abortions, yet the early Christians, until the time of Augustine in the fifth century, did not do so."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=PPKqTazyENGKhQfE45HOCQ&ct=result&id=jooEAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22early+christians%22+abortion&q=yet+the+early+christians#search_anchor Paul T.

The view of early Christians on the moment of ensoulment is also said to have been not the Aristotelian, but the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]]:
{{Quote|As early as the time of Tertullian in the third century, Christianity had absorbed the Pythagorean Greek view that the soul was infused at the moment of conception. Though this view was confirmed by St. Gregory of Nyssa a century later, it would not be long before it would be rejected in favour of the Septuagintal notion that only a formed fetus possessed a human soul. While Augustine speculated whether "animation" might be present prior to formation, he determined that abortion could only be defined as homicide once formation had occurred. Nevertheless, in common with all early Christian thought, Augustine condemned abortion from conception onward.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xh9vy_dvO6YC&pg=PA40 Daniel Schiff, ''Abortion in Judaism''] (Cambridge University Press 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-521-52166-6}}), p. 40.</ref>}}

Scholars generally agree that abortion was performed in the classical world, but there is disagreement about the frequency with which abortion was performed and which cultures influenced early Christian thought on abortion.<ref name=bioethics/> Some writers point to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] as evidence that condemnation of abortion was not a novelty introduced by the early Christians.<ref name=bioethics/> Some writers state that there is evidence that some early Christians believed, as the Greeks did, in delayed [[ensoulment]], or that a fetus does not have a soul until [[quickening]], and therefore early abortion was not murder;<ref name=bakke /> Luker says there was disagreement on whether early abortion was wrong.<ref name="universityofcalifornia" /> Other writers say that early Christians considered abortion a sin even before [[ensoulment]].<ref name="google.com">[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CxDarcSR6cC&pg=PA86 Evelyn B.

==Early Christianity==

Early Christian thought on abortion is interpreted in different ways. At different times, [[early Christians]] held different beliefs about abortion,<ref name="bakke"/><ref name="faculty.cua.edu"/><ref name="universityofcalifornia"/> while yet considering it a grievous sin.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=F_fcKr9iZM0C&pg=PA58 D'Antonio, ''Laity, American and Catholic'' (Rowman & Littlefield 1996), p. 58]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=CnpATdqMNIqKhQfIhsXNCA&ct=result&id=NsgnAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22early+christian%22+abortion+sin&q=%22abortion+was+treated+as+a+grievous+sin%22#search_anchorCallahan, ''Abortion: Law, Choice, and Morality'' (Collier-Macmillan 1970), p. 410]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1CxDarcSR6cC&pg=PA86 Kelly, ''Stem Cells''] (Greenwood Press 2007 {{ISBN|0-313-33763-2}}), p. 86</ref>

The earliest Christian texts on abortion condemn it with "no mention of any distinction in seriousness between the abortion of a formed foetus and that of an unformed embryo".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VSG94ZH0SxEC&pg=PA57 David Albert Jones, ''The Soul of the Embryo''] (Continuum International 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-8264-6296-1}}), p. 57</ref>

According to sociologist [[Kristin Luker]]: <blockquote>After the beginning of the Christian era... legal regulation of abortion as existed in the Roman Empire was designed primarily to protect the rights of fathers rather than rights of embryos.<br />...induced abortion is ignored in the most central [[Judeo-Christian]] writings: it was not mentioned in the [[Christian Bible|Christian]] or the [[Jewish Bible]], or in the Jewish Mishnah or [[Talmud]]. Abortion, it is true, was denounced in early Christian writings such as the Didache and by early Christian authors such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and [[St. Basil]]. But church councils, such as those of [[Synod of Elvira|Elvira]] and [[Synod of Ancyra|Ancyra]], which were called to specify the [[Biblical law in Christianity|legal groundwork for Christian communities]], outlined penalties only for those women who committed abortion after a sexual crime such as adultery or prostitution. Most importantly, perhaps, from the third century A.D. onward, Christian thought was divided as to whether early abortion - the abortion of an "unformed" embryo - was in fact murder. Different sources of [[Canon law|church teachings and laws]] simply did not agree on the penalties for abortion or on whether early abortion is wrong.<ref name="universityofcalifornia"/></blockquote>

However, that the early Christians agreed in rejecting abortion is more generally accepted.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gxEONS0FFlsC&pg=PA4 Frank K. Flinn, J.

== Later Christian thought on abortion ==
{{See also|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}

From the 4th to 16th Century AD, Christian philosophers, while maintaining the condemnation of abortion as wrong, had varying stances on whether abortion was murder. Under the first Christian Roman emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], there was a relaxation of attitudes toward abortion and exposure of children.<ref name=bakke /> Bakke writes, "Since an increasing number of Christian parents were poor and found it difficult to look after their children, the theologians were forced to take into account this situation and reflect anew on the question. This made it possible to take a more tolerant attitude toward poor people who exposed their children."<ref name="bakke"/>

===Ensoulment===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] believed that an early abortion is not murder because, according to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] concept of delayed [[ensoulment]], the soul of a fetus at an early stage is not present, a belief that passed into [[canon law]].<ref name=bioethics/><ref name=religioustolerance /> Nonetheless, he harshly condemned the procedure: "Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or if you please, cruel lust, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born."(De Nube et Concupiscentia 1.17 (15))

[[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Pope Innocent III]] also believed that a fetus does not have a soul until "[[quickening]]," or when the fetus begins to kick and move, and therefore early abortion was not murder, though later abortion was.<ref name="dictionaryethics" /><ref name="bioethics" /> {{Failed verification|date=February 2013|reason=not mention of Innocent III or Gregory XIV in the book}} Aquinas held that abortion was still wrong, even when not murder, regardless of when the soul entered the body.<ref name="catholic.com">[https://www.catholic.com/qa/did-st-thomas-aquinas-believe-ensoulment-occurred-40-or-80-days-after-conception-making-abortion Aquinas on Abortion By Catholic Answers]</ref> [[Pope Stephen V]] and [[Pope Sixtus V]] opposed abortion at any stage of pregnancy.<ref name=bioethics/><ref name=religioustolerance />

==Protestant Reformation==
In general, the Protestant Reformers retained the teaching of their time against abortion. Neither [[Martin Luther]] nor [[John Calvin]] wrote individual works discussing only the question of abortion per se,<ref name="Maguire2003">{{cite book|last=Maguire|first=Daniel C. |title=Sacred rights: the case for contraception and abortion in world religions|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredrightscase0000magu|url-access=registration|access-date=16 January 2012|date=3 April 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-516001-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/sacredrightscase0000magu/page/88 88]}}</ref> although in 1542, Luther wrote a pamphlet entitled ''Comfort for Women Who Have Had a Miscarriage''.

In his commentary on Exodus 21:22, John Calvin wrote:

<blockquote>

...the unborn, though enclosed in the womb of his mother, is already a human being, and it is an almost monstrous crime to rob it of life which it has not yet begun to enjoy. If it seems more horrible to kill a man in his own house than in a field, because a man's house is his most secure place of refuge, it ought surely to be deemed more atrocious to destroy the unborn in the womb before it has come to light.

</blockquote>

In his 1535–1545 ''Commentary on Genesis'', when discussing Chapter 25, verses 1 through 4, Luther noted,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aIU10D1ZkKsC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=%22How+great,+therefore,+the+wickedness+of+human+nature+is!+How+many+girls+there+are+who+prevent+conception+and+kill+and+expel+tender+fetuses,+although+procreation+is+the+work+of+God!+Indeed,+some+spouses+who+marry+and+live+together+in+a+respectable+manner+have+various+ends+in+mind,+but+rarely+children%22&source=bl&ots=CIZetHO28z&sig=ACfU3U21NHUmeQdEGhZfk0htYhxVRQZG2Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiR35W20vvgAhUk9IMKHT17D1UQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22How%20great%2C%20therefore%2C%20the%20wickedness%20of%20human%20nature%20is!%20How%20many%20girls%20there%20are%20who%20prevent%20conception%20and%20kill%20and%20expel%20tender%20fetuses%2C%20although%20procreation%20is%20the%20work%20of%20God!%20Indeed%2C%20some%20spouses%20who%20marry%20and%20live%20together%20in%20a%20respectable%20manner%20have%20various%20ends%20in%20mind%2C%20but%20rarely%20children%22&f=false Sexual Ethics: An Evangelical Perspective] by Stanley James Grenz, the portion quoted is from ''Luther's Works, vol. 1, American Edition''

<blockquote>
How great, therefore, the wickedness of human nature is! How many girls there are who prevent conception and kill and expel tender fetuses, although procreation is the work of God! Indeed, some spouses who marry and live together in a respectable manner have various ends in mind, but rarely children.’ The God who declares that we are to be fruitful and multiply regards it as a great evil when human beings destroy their offspring.
</blockquote>
In a letter written in 1544, Luther strongly condemned a woman who reportedly had another person jump on her belly to induce an abortion.<ref>[https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4701&context=etd Seizing the stake: Female martyrdom in England during the Reformation] Douglas Winkey, Master's thesis, Iowa State University, page 28.</ref>
