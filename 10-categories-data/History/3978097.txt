==Etymology==
The name "Iran", meaning "land of the [[Aryan]]s", is the [[New Persian]] continuation of the old genitive plural ''aryānām'' (proto-Iranian, meaning "of the Aryans"), first attested in the [[Avesta]] as ''airyānąm'' (the text of which is composed in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], an old [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] spoken in northeastern Greater Iran, or in what are now [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).<ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica1">{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrianism-i-historical-review | title=ZOROASTRIANISM i.

While up until the end of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]] in the 3rd century CE, the idea of "Irān" had an ethnic, linguistic, and religious value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an "Iranian" empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely [[Sasanian]] one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr "Kingdom of the Iranians", which was "ēr" ([[Middle Persian]] equivalent of [[Old Persian]] "ariya" and Avestan "airya").<ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica2"/>

==Definition==
[[Richard Nelson Frye]] defines Greater Iran as including "much of the Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, with cultural influences extending to China and western India." According to Frye, "Iran means all lands and peoples where Iranian languages were and are spoken, and where in the past, multi-faceted Iranian cultures existed."<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, Richard Nelson]], ''Greater Iran'', {{ISBN|978-1-56859-177-3}} p.''xi''</ref>

[[Richard Foltz]] notes that while "A general assumption is often made that the various Iranian peoples of 'greater Iran'—a cultural area that stretched from Mesopotamia and the Caucasus into [[Khwarizm]], [[Transoxiana]], Bactria, and the [[Pamirs]] and included Persians, Medes, Parthians and Sogdians among others—were all 'Zoroastrians' in pre-Islamic times... This view, even though common among serious scholars, is almost certainly overstated." Foltz argues that "While the various Iranian peoples did indeed share a common [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and pool of religious myths and [[Religious symbol|symbols]], in actuality a variety of deities were worshipped—particularly [[Mitra]], the god of covenants, and [[Anahita]], the goddess of the waters, but also many others—depending on the time, place, and particular group concerned".<ref>[[Richard Foltz]], "Religions of the Silk Road: Premodern Patterns of globalization", Palgrave Macmillan, rev. 2nd edition, 2010. pg 27</ref>

According to [[J. P. Mallory]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] most of Western ''greater Iran'' spoke Southwestern Iranian languages in the Achaemenid era while the Eastern territory spoke Eastern Iranian languages related to Avestan.<ref>Mallory, J. P.; Adams, D. Q. (1997), Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture, London and Chicago: Fitzroy-Dearborn, {{ISBN|978-1-884964-98-5}}. pg 307: "Dialetically, Old Persian is regarded as a southwestern Iranian language in contrast to the east Iranian Avestan which covered most of the rest of Greater Iran. However, it is important to note that during the Achaemeid era, the official language of the empire was [[Aramaic]], which was the mother tongue of the ancient [Iraqis], since it was the language of literature, religion, and science at that time. [Aramaic] language had a great impact on Persian and survived as the dominant language in the middle east until the [Islamic conquest].</ref>

George Lane also states that after the dissolution of the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Ilkhanids]] became rulers of greater Iran<ref>George Lane, "Daily life in the Mongol empire", Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pg 10" The year following 1260 saw the empire irrevocably split but also signaled the emergence of the two greatest achievements of the house of Chinggis, namely the Yuan dynasty of greater China and the Il-Khanid dynasty of greater Iran.</ref> and [[Uljaytu]], according to Judith G. Kolbas, was the ruler of this expanse between 1304–1317 A.D.<ref>Judith G. Kolbas, "The Mongols in Iran", Excerpt from 399: "Uljaytu, Ruler of Greater Iran from 1304-1317 A.D."</ref>

Primary sources, including Timurid historian Mir Khwand, define Iranshahr (Greater Iran) as extending from the Euphrates to the Oxus<ref>Mīr Khvānd, Muḥammad ibn Khāvandshāh, Tārīkh-i rawz̤at al-ṣafā. Taṣnīf Mīr Muḥammad ibn Sayyid Burhān al-Dīn Khāvand Shāh al-shahīr bi-Mīr Khvānd.

Iranshahr stretches from the Euphrates to the Oxus, and it is the center of the prosperity of the World.</ref>

Traditionally, and until recent times, ethnicity has never been a defining separating criterion  in these regions. In the words of Richard Nelson Frye:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

{{quote|Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of Central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them. | Richard Nelson Frye}}

Only in modern times did western colonial intervention and ethnicity tend to become a dividing force between the provinces of Greater Iran. As [[Patrick Clawson]] states, "ethnic nationalism is largely a nineteenth century phenomenon, even if it is fashionable to retroactively extend it."<ref>[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005 {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6276-8}} p.23</ref> "Greater Iran" however has been more of a cultural super-state, rather than a political one to begin with.

In the work ''Nuzhat al-Qolub'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|نزهه القلوب|fa}}}}), the medieval geographer [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] wrote:

{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|چند شهر است اندر ایران مرتفع تر از همه|fa}}}}<br />
''Some cities in Iran are above the rest,''<br />
{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|بهتر و سازنده تر از خوشی آب و هوا|fa}}}}<br />
''better and more productive due to good weather,''<br />
{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|گنجه پر گنج در اران صفاهان در عراق|fa}}}}<br />
''Ganja full of treasure in [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]], and [[Esfahān]] in [[Persian Iraq|Iraq]],''<br />
{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|در خراسان مرو و طوس در روم باشد اقسرا|fa}}}}<br />
''[[Merv]] and [[Tus, Iran|Tus]] in [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and [[Konya]] (Aqsara) in Rome (Anatolia).''

The ''Cambridge History of Iran'' takes a geographical approach in referring to the "historical and cultural" entity of "Greater Iran" as "areas of Iran, parts of Afghanistan, and Chinese and Soviet Central Asia".<ref>''The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. III: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods'', [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Review author[s]: [[Richard N. Frye]], [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], Vol. 21, No. 3. (Aug., 1989), pp.415. Link: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163454]</ref> A detailed list of these territories follows in this article.

==Background==
Greater Iran is called ''Iranzamin'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|ایرانزمین|fa}}}}) which means "The Land of Iran". ''Iranzamin'' was in the mythical times opposed to the ''Turanzamin'' the Land of [[Turan]], which was located in the upper part of Central Asia.<ref>[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]], [[Dehkhoda]], see under entry "Turan"</ref>

In the pre-Islamic period, Iranians distinguished two main regions in the territory they ruled, one Iran and the other ''Aniran''. By Iran they meant all the regions inhabited by [[ancient Iranian peoples]], this region was more extensive in the past. This notion of ''Iran'' as a territory (opposed to ''Aniran'') can be seen as the core of early Greater Iran. Later many changes occurred in the boundaries and areas where Iranians lived but the languages and culture remained the dominant medium in many parts of the Greater Iran.

As an example, the Persian language (referred to, in Persian, as ''Farsi'') was the main literary language and the language of correspondence in Central Asia and Caucasus prior to the Russian occupation, Central Asia being the birthplace of modern Persian language. Furthermore, according to the British government, Persian language was also used in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], prior to the British Occupation and Mandate in 1918–1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/KURDICA/1999/FEB/Iraq-policy.html|title=The old www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk server|work=ed.ac.uk|accessdate=9 December 2015}}</ref>

With [[Imperial Russia]] continuously advancing south in the course of two wars against Persia, and the treaties of Turkmenchay and Gulistan in the western frontiers, plus the unexpected death of [[Abbas Mirza]] in 1833, and the murdering of Persia's Grand [[Vizier]] (Mirza AbolQasem Qa'im Maqām), many Central Asian khanates began losing hope for any support from Persia against the [[Tsar]]ist armies.<ref>[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun|Homayoun, N. T.]], ''Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?''. 2004. {{ISBN|978-964-379-023-3}}, p.78</ref> The Russian armies occupied the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] coast in 1849, [[Tashkent]] in 1864, [[Bukhara]] in 1867, [[Samarkand]] in 1868, and [[Khiva]] and [[Amudarya]] in 1873.

:''"Many Iranians consider their natural sphere of influence to extend beyond Iran's present borders. After all, Iran was once much larger. Portuguese forces seized islands and ports in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire wrested from [[Tehran]]'s control what is today Armenia, [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], and part of Georgia. Iranian elementary school texts teach about the Iranian roots not only of cities like [[Baku]], but also cities further north like [[Derbent]] in southern Russia. The [[Shah]] lost much of his claim to western Afghanistan following the Anglo-Iranian war of 1856-1857. Only in 1970 did a [[UN]] sponsored consultation end Iranian claims to [[suzerainty]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] island nation of [[Bahrain]]. In centuries past, Iranian rule once stretched westward into modern Iraq and beyond. When the western world complains of Iranian interference beyond its borders, the Iranian government often convinced itself that it is merely exerting its influence in lands that were once its own. Simultaneously, Iran's losses at the hands of outside powers have contributed to a sense of grievance that continues to the present day."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]] of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]<ref>[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave. 2005. Coauthored with [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6276-8}} p.9,10</ref>

:''"Iran today is just a rump of what it once was. At its height, Iranian rulers controlled Iraq, Afghanistan, Western Pakistan, much of Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Many Iranians today consider these areas part of a greater Iranian sphere of influence."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]]<ref>[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave. 2005. Coauthored with [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-6276-8}} p.30</ref>

:''"Since the days of the [[Achaemenids]], the Iranians had the protection of geography. But high mountains and vast emptiness of the Iranian plateau were no longer enough to shield Iran from the Russian army or British navy. Both literally, and figuratively, Iran shrank. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Afghanistan were Iranian, but by the end of the century, all this territory had been lost as a result of European military action."''<ref>[[Patrick Clawson]].

==Provinces and regions==
In the 8th century, Iran was conquered by the [[Abbassids]] who ruled from [[Baghdad]]. The territory of Iran at that time was composed of two portions: ''[[Persian Iraq]]'' (western portion) and ''Khorasan'' (eastern portion). The dividing region was mostly the cities of [[Gurgan]] and [[Damghan|Damaghan]]. The [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] divided their empires into Iraqi and Khorasani regions. This point can be observed in many books such as [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi|Abul Fazl Bayhqi]]'s ''"Tārīkhi Baïhaqī"'', [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam'' and other books. Transoxiana and [[Chorasmia]] were mostly included in the Khorasanian region.

===Middle East===

====Bahrain====
{{See also|Persians in Bahrain|Huwala|Ajam of Bahrain}}
The "Ajam" and "Huwala" are ethnic communities of Bahrain of Persian origin. The Persians of Bahrain are a significant, influential ethnic community whose ancestors arrived in Bahrain within the last 1,000 years as laborers, merchants and artisans. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of [[Manama]] and [[Muharraq]]. Bahrain's Persians who adhere to the [[Shia]] sect of Islam are called [[Ajam]] and the Persians who adhere to the [[Sunni]] sect are called the [[Huwala]]; who migrated from [[Larestan]] in Iran to the [[Persian Gulf]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.

The immigration of Persians to Bahrain began with the fall of the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdom, which ruled the island at the time. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] successfully invaded, but it is often believed that mass immigration began much later, during the 1600s, when the [[Safavid]] shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas the Great]] conquered  Bahrain. After settlemen, some of the Persians were effectively Arabized. They usually settled in areas inhabited by the indigenous [[Baharna]], probably because they share the same Shia Muslim faith, however, some Sunni Persians settled in areas mostly inhabited by Sunni Arab immigrants such as [[Hidd]] and [[Galali, Bahrain|Galali]]. In [[Muharraq]], they have their own neighborhood called ''Fareej Karimi'' named after a rich Persian man called Ali Abdulla Karimi.

From the 6th century BC to the 3rd century BC, Bahrain was a prominent part of the Persian Empire by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] dynasty. It was referred to by the Greeks as "[[Tylos]]", the centre of [[pearl]] trading, when [[Nearchus]] discovered it while serving under [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name="Larsen">''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient ...'' by Curtis E. Larsen p. 13</ref> From the 3rd century BC to the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, the island was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the [[Sassanids]].

During most of the second half of the eighteenth century, Bahrain was ruled by [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]], the ruler of [[Bushehr]]. The Bani Utibah tribe from Zubarah exceeded in taking over Bahrain after a war broke out in 1782. Persian attempts to reconquer the island in 1783 and in 1785 failed; the 1783 expedition was a joint Persian-[[Qawasim]] invasion force that never left Bushehr. The 1785 invasion fleet, composed of forces from Bushehr, Rig and [[Shiraz]] was called off after the death of the ruler of Shiraz, [[Ali Murad Khan]]. Due to internal difficulties, the Persians could not attempt another invasion.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=46}} In 1799, Bahrain came under threat from the [[expansionist]] policies of [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sayyid Sultan]], the [[Sultan of Oman]], when he invaded the island under the pretext that Bahrain did not pay taxes owed.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=47}} The Bani Utbah solicited the aid of Bushire to expel the Omanis on the condition that Bahrain would become a [[tributary state]] of Persia.

Bahrain's local Persian community have heavily influenced the country's local food dishes. One of the most notable local delicacies of the people in Bahrain is [[mahyawa]], consumed in Southern Iran as well, is a watery earth brick coloured sauce made from sardines and consumed with bread or other food. Bahrain's Persians are also famous in Bahrain for bread-making. Another local delicacy is "pishoo" made from [[rose water]] (golab) and [[agar agar]]. Other food items consumed are similar to [[Persian cuisine]].

Throughout history, Iran always had strong cultural ties with the region of present–day [[Iraq]]. Mesopotamia is considered as the cradle of civilization and the place where the first empires in history were established. These empires, namely the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Babylonia]]n, and [[Assyria]]n, dominated the ancient middle east for millennia, which explains the great influence of the Mesopotamia on the Iranian culture and history, and it is also the reason why the later Iranian and Greek dynasties chose Mesopotamia to be the political centre of their rule. For a period of around 500 years, what is now Iraq formed the core of Iran, with the Iranian [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] empire having their capital in what is modern-day Iraq for the same centuries long time span. ([[Ctesiphon]])

Because the Achaemenid Empire or "First Persian Empire" was the successor state to the empires of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]] based in Iraq, and because [[Elam]] is part of Iran, the ancient people of Iran were ruled by ancient Mesopotamians, which explains the close proximity between the people of south western Iran and the Iraqis even in modern days, in fact, the people of that part of Iran speak Mesopotamian Arabic and were put under the rule of modern Iran by the British. The ancient Persians adopted the Babylonian [[Cuneiform|cuneiform script]] and [[Old Persian cuneiform|modified it]] to write their [[Old Persian language|language]], along with adopting many other facets of ancient Iraqi culture, including the [[Aramaic language]] which became the official language of the Persian Empire.

Testimony to the close relationship shared by Iraq and western Iran during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]] and later centuries, is the fact that the two regions came to share the same name. The western region of [[Iran]] (ancient Media) was called [[Persian Iraq|'Irāq-e 'Ajamī]] ("Persian Iraq"), while central-southern [[Iraq]] (Babylonia) was called 'Irāq al-'Arabī ("Arabic Iraq") or Bābil ("Babylon"). And the name Iraq comes from the ancient Mesopotamian city Uruk, which suggests an even older relationship.

For centuries the two neighbouring regions were known as "[[The Two Iraqs]]" ("al-'Iraqain"). The 12th century Persian poet [[Khaqani|Khāqāni]] wrote a famous poem ''Tohfat-ul Iraqein'' ("The Gift of the Two Iraqs"). The city of [[Arak, Iran|Arāk]] in western Iran still bears the region's old name, and Iranians still traditionally call the region between [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Ilam, Iran|Īlām]] "ʿErāq".

During medieval ages, Mesopotamian and Iranian peoples knew each other's languages because of trade, and because Arabic was the language of religion and science at that time. The [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] historian [[Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru]] (d. 1430) wrote of Iraq:<ref>{{cite web|last=Morony|first=Michael G|author-link=Michael G.

But, all three peoples (qawms) know each other's languages due to the mixture and amalgamation."}}</ref>

[[Iraqi people|Iraqis]] share religious and certain cultural ties with [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]]. The majority of Iranians are Twelver [[Shia]] (an Islamic sect established in Iraq), although the majority of Iranians were [[Sunni]] Muslims and did not convert to Shia until the [[Safavids]] forced [[Shi'ism]] in Iran.

Iraqi culture has commonalities with the [[culture of Iran]]. The spring festival of [[Nowruz]] that is celebrated in Iran and some parts of Iraq roots back to the Akitu spring festival (Babylonian new year). The [[Iraqi cuisine|Mesopotamian cuisine]] also has similarities to the [[Iranian cuisine|Persian cuisine]], including common dishes and cooking techniques. The [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi dialect]] has absorbed many words from the [[Persian language]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Csató|first1=Éva Ágnes|last2=Isaksson|first2=Bo|last3=Jahani|first3=Carina |title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case Studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic|year=2005|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-30804-5|page=177}}</ref>

There are still cities and provinces in Iraq where the Persian names of the city are still retained – e.g., [[Al Anbar Governorate|’Anbār]] and [[Baghdad]].

In the modern era, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran briefly reasserted hegemony over Iraq in the periods of [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555)|1501–1533]] and [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|1622–1638]], losing Iraq to the [[Ottoman Empire]] on both occasions (via the [[Peace of Amasya|Treaty of Amasya]] in 1555 and the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639). Ottoman hegemony over Iraq was reconfirmed in the [[Treaty of Kerden]] in 1746.

Following the fall of the Ba'athist regime in 2003 and the empowerment of Iraq's majority Shī'i community, relations with Iran have flourished in all fields.

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], the territories of [[Iran]] and the republic of [[Azerbaijan]] usually shared the same history from the time of ancient Media (ninth to seventh centuries b.c.) and the Persian Empire (sixth to fourth centuries b.c.).<ref>Historical Background Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996</ref>

Intimately and inseparably intertwined histories for millennia, Iran irrevocably lost the territory that is nowadays Azerbaijan in the course of the 19th century. With the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] Iran had to cede eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], its possessions in the [[North Caucasus]] and many of those in what is today the [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan Republic]], which included [[Baku Khanate]], [[Shirvan Khanate]], [[Karabakh Khanate]], [[Ganja Khanate]], [[Shaki Khanate]], [[Quba Khanate]], and parts of the [[Talysh Khanate]]. [[Derbent]] (Darband) [[Derbent khanate|Khanate]] of [[Dagestan]] was also lost to Russia. These Khanates comprise most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan in Southern Russia. By the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the result was even more disastrous, and resulted in Iran being forced to cede the [[Nakhichevan Khanate]] and the Mughan regions to Russia, as well as [[Erivan Khanate]], and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. All these territories together, lost in 1813 and 1828 combined, constitute all of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, [[Armenia]], and southern [[Dagestan]].

Many localities in this region bear Persian names or names derived from Iranian languages and Azerbaijan remains by far Iran's closest cultural, religious, ethnic and historical neighbor. [[Azerbaijanis]] are by far the second largest ethnicity in Iran, and comprise the largest community of ethnic Azerbaijanis in the world, vastly outnumbering the number in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Both nations are the only officially Shia majority in the world, with adherents of the religion comprising an absolute majority in both nations. The people of nowadays Iran and Azerbaijan were [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|converted to Shiism]] during exactly the same time in history. Furthermore, the name of "Azerbaijan" is derived through the name of the Persian [[satrap]] which ruled the contemporary region of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] and minor parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan in ancient times.<ref>{{cite book |last=Houtsma|first=M.

Early in antiquity, [[Narseh of Persia]] is known to have had fortifications built here. In later times, some of Persia's literary and intellectual figures from the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period have hailed from this region. Under intermittent Iranian suzerainty since antiquity, it was also separated from Iran in the mid-19th century, by virtue of the Gulistan Treaty and Turkmenchay Treaty.

Oh [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], respect you've attained,<br />
بدین شاه شد بخت پیرت جوان<br />
With this King in luck you'll remain.<br />

[[Khwarazm]] is one of the regions of ''Iran-zameen'', and is the home of the ancient Iranians, [[Airyanem Vaejah]], according to the ancient book of the [[Avesta]]. Modern scholars believe Khwarazm to be what ancient Avestic texts refer to as "Ariyaneh Waeje" or Iran vij. ''Iranovich''  These sources claim that [[Kunya Urgench|Urgandj]], which was the capital of ancient Khwarazm for many years, was actually "Ourva": the eighth land of [[Ahura Mazda]] mentioned in the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of Vendidad. Others such as [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] believe Khwarazm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the Avestan people,<ref>[[Elton L. Daniel|Daniel, E.]], ''The History of Iran''. 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-313-30731-7}}, p.28</ref> while Dehkhoda calls Khwarazm "the cradle of the [[Arya]]n tribe" (مهد قوم آریا). Today Khwarazm is split between several central Asian republics.

Superimposed on and overlapping with Chorasmia was Khorasan which roughly covered nearly the same geographical areas in Central Asia (starting from [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]] eastward through northern Afghanistan roughly until the foothills of [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]], ancient [[Mount Imeon]]). Current day provinces such as [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]] in [[Turkmenistan|Turkmenia]], [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[North Khorasan Province]], and [[Southern Khorasan Province]] in Iran are all remnants of the old Khorasan. Until the 13th century and the devastating Mongol invasion of the region, Khorasan was considered the cultural capital of Greater Iran.<ref>

====Tajikistan====
The national anthem in Tajikistan, "[[Surudi Milli]]", attests to the Perso-Tajik identity, which has seen a large revival, after the breakup of the [[USSR]]. [[Tajik language|Their language]] is almost identical to that spoken in Afghanistan and Iran, and their cities have Persian names, e.g. [[Dushanbe]], [[Isfara]], [[Rasht Valley]], [[Garm, Tajikistan|Garm]], [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]], [[Vahdat]], [[Zeravshan|Zar-afshan river]], [[Shurab, Tajikistan|Shurab]], and [[Kulob]] ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_kulab_20050727.html]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). It is also important{{to whom|date=December 2015}} to note that [[Rudaki]], considered by many as the father of modern Persian poetry, was from the modern day region of Tajikistan.

====Turkmenistan====
Home of the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nysa]]). Merv is also where the half-Persian caliph [[al-Mamun]] moved his capital to. The city of [[Ashgabat|Eshgh Abad]] (some claim that the word is actually the transformed form of "Ashk Abad" literally meaning "built by Ashk", the head of Arsacid dynasty) is yet another Persian word meaning "city of love", and like East Iran, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan, it was once part of [[Airyanem Vaejah]].

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbekistan has a local Tajik population. The famous Persian cities of [[Afrasiab]], [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Shahrisabz]], [[Andijan]], [[Khiva|Khiveh]], [[Navoiy|Navā'i]], [[Shirin]], [[Termez]], and [[Zarafshan|Zar-afshan]] are located here. These cities are the birthplace of the Islamic era Persian literature. The [[Samanid]]s, who claimed inheritance to the Sassanids, had their capital built here.

ای بخارا شاد باش و دیر زی<br />
Oh Bukhara! Joy to you and live long!<br />
شاه زی تو میهمان آید همی<br />
Your King comes to you in ceremony.<br />
''---[[Rudaki]]''

====Xinjiang====

The [[Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County]] regions of China harbored a Tajik population and culture.<ref>See ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', p. 443, for Persian settlements in southwestern China; ''[[Iran-China relations|Iran-China Relations]]'' for more on the historical ties.

===South Asia===

====Afghanistan====
Modern state of Afghanistan was part of [[Sistan]] and [[Greater Khorasan]] regions, and hence was recognized with the name Khorasan (along with regions centered on Merv and Nishapur), which in Pahlavi means "The Eastern Land" (خاور زمین in Persian).<ref>[[Dehkhoda]], ''[[Dehkhoda dictionary]]'', Tehran University Press, p.8457</ref>

Nowadays region of Afghanistan is where [[Balkh]] is located, home of [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai|Sanāī Ghaznawi]], [[Jami]], [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] and where many other notables in [[Persian literature]] came from.

ز زابل به کابل رسید آن زمان<br />
From [[Zabul]] he arrived to [[Kabul]]<br />
گرازان و خندان و دل شادمان<br />
Strutting, happy, and mirthful<br />
''---[[Ferdowsi]] in [[Shahnama]]''

====Pakistan====
There is considerable influence of Iranian-speaking peoples in Pakistan. The region of Baluchistan is split between Pakistan and Iran and Baluchi, the majority languages of the Baluchistan province of Pakistan are also spoken in Southeastern Iran. In fact, the Chagai Hills and the western part of Makran district were part of Iran till the [[Durand Line]] was drawn in the late 1800s.

[[Pashto language|Pashto]] which is spoken in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan is an Iranian language.
