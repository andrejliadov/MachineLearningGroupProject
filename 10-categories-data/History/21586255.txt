'''''Adams Synchronological Chart or Map of History''''', originally published as '''''Chronological Chart of Ancient, Modern and Biblical History''''' is a synchronological [[wallchart]] and [[timeline]] ("timechart") that graphically depicts the [[History of the world|history of mankind]] from [[5th millennium BC#Biblical chronology|4004 BC]], the biblical beginning of man, to [[Modernity|modern times]].<ref name="GoogleWallchart"/><ref name="ExodusWallchart"/><ref name= "TIWALL">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books-top-of-the-popups-and-wallcharts-1131964.html|title=Books: Top of the pop-ups and wallcharts |accessdate=2009-02-27 |last=Feay |first=Suzi |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=12 December 1999 |work=[[The Independent]] |publisher=[[Tony O'Reilly]] |location= |pages= |doi= |quote=it resembles an unusually complicated digestive system, with its lines, loops, bulges and branches |dateformat=}}</ref><ref name= "VALWALL"/>

The original version by Presbyterian missionary [[Sebastian C.

==Format and design==
The chart maintains a [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] design (even in updated versions) and is thoroughly accompanied by illustrations.

As indicators of time, all through is the chart divided into big black posts which mark [[century|centuries]] and thin red lines which mark decades (with very thin red lines occasionally marking single years).<ref name="VALWALL">{{cite web|url=http://www.valerieslivingbooks.info/wallchar.htm|title=The Wall Chart of World History / The Timechart of Biblical History|accessdate=2009-02-28|last=Jacobsen|first=Valerie|authorlink=|coauthors=|date=|year=|month=|work=Valerie's Living Books|publisher=|location=|pages=|doi=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229033220/http://www.valerieslivingbooks.info/wallchar.htm|archivedate=2008-12-29|quote=|dateformat=|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>

Additionally, big red crosses indicate great persecutions of [[Christians]] at the times of the [[Roman Empire]] and small red crosses stand for each of the [[crusades]]. Red circles indicate [[ecumenical council]]s. Also, [[question mark]]s indicate uncertainties (they are mostly seen at the beginning of the timechart, where the certainty of events and the accuracy of dates are most disputed).<ref name= "VALWALL"/>

The nation streams are segmented into different colours, each colour indicating the reign of a particular ruler or a certain type of government. In some cases, [[prime minister]]s are shown in the lower half of nation streams and [[president (government title)|president]]s in the upper half. Coloured scrolls and strips near the top of the chart stand for important people other than the rulers and other political leaders shown on the nation streams. These streams grow wider or thinner in accordance to historical context. Some streams divide to indicate a split in the nation (e.g. to indicate the independence of a state) or flow into others to illustrate its conquest, invasion, or acquisition by such other nation.

Suzi Feay of ''[[The Independent]]'' describes the chart's peculiar design for a peculiarly big scope of human history as something that "resembles an unusually complicated digestive system, with its lines, loops, bulges and branches."<ref name= "TIWALL"/>

==Content==
The chart begins with [[Adam and Eve]] and advances with [[genealogies of Genesis|their genealogy]]. At a point of this [[genealogy]], after [[Deluge myth|the deluge]] (which is indicated by a black line), the chart is divided in two: the upper part continuing with the genealogy and the lower broader part showing the origin of the first nations as men supposedly separated because of the [[confusion of tongues]] following the construction of the [[Tower of Babel]]. The link between the genealogy upwards and the nation streams downwards is presented by recognizing the founders of each nation as specific people from the genealogy, in accordance to certain interpretations of The Bible.

At certain points of the chart, large percentages of space are occupied by big empires such as the [[Babylonia]]n Empire (under the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]), the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the [[Macedon#Empire|Macedonian Empire]], and the [[Roman Empire]], which, at one page, occupies almost the entire part of the chart used for nation streams.

At the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of Rome]], the empire's colossal nation stream is divided into many smaller streams of [[Barbarian|Barbaric Kingdoms]].

As history advances, the nation streams, being first wavy, gradually straighten up, probably to illustrate how history becomes more certain and undisputed as it narrows down to the present.

The independence of many colonies is clearly shown as big nation streams standing for [[colonial empire]]s split into several smaller streams. World War I and World War II are indicated by bold black lines behind the streams with a thickness determined by their duration.
