{{further|History of gunpowder}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}

This is a timeline of the history of [[gunpowder]] and related topics such as weapons, warfare, and industrial applications. The timeline covers the history of gunpowder from the first hints of its origin as a [[Taoist]] [[alchemical]] product in China until its replacement by [[smokeless powder]] in the late 19th century (from 1884 to the present day).

==10th century==
'''Major developments''': Gunpowder is utilized in Chinese warfare and an assortment of gunpowder weapons appear. [[Fire arrow]]s utilizing gunpowder as an incendiary appear in the early 900s and possibly rocket arrows as well by the end of the century. The gunpowder [[slow match]] is used for igniting [[flame thrower]]s. The ancestor of firearms, the [[fire lance]], also appears, but its usage in the 10th century is uncertain and no textual evidence for it exists during this period.

==11th century==
'''Major developments''': The chemical formula for gunpowder is recorded in the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' by 1044. Bombs appear in the early 11th century. Gunpowder becomes more common in the [[Song dynasty]] and production of gunpowder weapons is systematized. The Song court restricts trade of gunpowder ingredients with the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] and [[Western Xia]] dynasties.

==13th century==
'''Major developments''': [[Bomb|Bomb shell]]s gain an iron casing. [[Fire lance]]s are equipped with projectiles and reusable iron barrels. [[Rocket]]s are used in warfare. "Fire emitting tubes" are produced in the [[Song dynasty]] by the mid-13th century and [[hand cannon]]s are recorded to have been used in battle by the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1287. The earliest extant cannons appear in [[China]]. The [[Mongols]] spread gunpowder weaponry to [[Japan]], [[Southeast Asia]], and possibly the [[Middle East]] as well as [[Europe]]. Europe and [[India]] both acquire gunpowder by the end of the century, but only in the Middle East are gunpowder weapons mentioned in any detail.

==14th century==
'''Major developments''': Chinese gunpowder weaponry continues to advance with the development of one-piece cast iron cannons, accompanying carriages, and the addition of [[land mine]]s, [[naval mine]]s and [[rocket launcher]]s. Earliest recorded instance of [[volley fire]] with gunpowder weaponry, by the [[Ming dynasty]]. The rest of the world catches up quickly and most of [[Eurasia]] acquires gunpowder weapons by the second half of the 14th century. Cannon development in [[Europe]] progresses rapidly and by 1374, cannons in Europe are able to breach a city wall for the first time. [[Breechloader|Breech loading cannons]] appear in Europe.

==15th century==
'''Major developments''': [[Large-calibre artillery]] weighing several thousand kg are produced in [[Europe]] during the early 15th century and spread to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Modifiable two wheeled gun carts known as [[limbers and caissons]] appear, greatly improving the mobility of artillery. The [[matchlock]] [[arquebus]], the first firearm with a trigger mechanism, appears in Europe by 1475. [[Rifle]]d barrels also appear in the late 15h century. The term [[musket]] is used for the first time in 1499. [[Rocket launcher]]s are used in battle by the [[Ming dynasty]] and the kingdom of [[Joseon]] develops a mobile rocket launcher vehicle called the [[hwacha]]. Chinese style bombs are used in [[Japan]] by 1468 at the latest.

==16th century==
'''Major developments''': [[Matchlock]] firearms spread throughout [[Eurasia]], reaching [[China]] and [[Japan]] by the mid-16th century. The [[volley fire]] technique is implemented using matchlock firearms by the [[Ottomans]], [[Ming dynasty]], and [[Dutch Republic]] by the end of the century. The [[arquebus]] is replaced by its heavier variant called the [[musket]] to combat heavily armoured troops. "Musket" becomes the dominant term for all shoulder arms fireweapons until the 1800s. The [[wheellock]] and [[flintlock]] trigger mechanisms are invented. [[Pistol]]s and [[revolver]]s both appear during this period. Ottoman troops attach [[bayonet]]s to their firearms. Both Europe and China develop handheld breech loading firearms. The [[star fort]] spreads across Europe in response to increasing effectiveness of siege artillery. The Ming dynasty uses gunpowder for [[hydraulic engineering]].

A [[ship of the line]] carrying 60 to 120 cannons appears in Europe. [[Samuel Pepys]]' diary mentions a machine gun like pistol.

'''Major developments''': [[Flintlock]]s completely displace [[matchlock]] firearms in [[Europe]] both on land and at sea. [[Sir William Congreve, 1st Baronet]] discovers "cylinder powder", gunpowder produced using charcoal in iron cylinders, which is twice as powerful as traditional gunpowder and less likely to spoil. He also invents block trail carriages, the most advanced artillery transport of the time. [[James Puckle]] invents a breechloader flintlock capable of firing 63 shots in seven minutes. The [[Kingdom of Mysore]] deploys iron cased rockets known as [[Mysorean rockets]].
