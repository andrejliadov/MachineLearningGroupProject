'''''Tales From Te Papa''''' was a television series of mini-documentaries about objects from the collection of the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] (Te Papa) and the activities of the Museum staff. The series is a partnership between [[Television New Zealand]] and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Tales From Te Papa | work = TVNZ Website | publisher = Television New Zealand | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/tales-from-te-papa/ta-ent-tales-te-papa-index-group-2922277 | accessdate = 18 November 2010}}</ref>  The series was commissioned by Television New Zealand for TVNZ6, a digital channel and New Zealand's first fully public service broadcasting channel without advertising breaks.<ref>{{Cite web | title = About TVNZ 6 | work = TVNZ Website | publisher = Television New Zealand | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/497100/1302905 | accessdate = 18 November 2010}}</ref>  Each episode runs for 5 to 8 minutes and shows on rotation in what would be the advertising break between programmes.
