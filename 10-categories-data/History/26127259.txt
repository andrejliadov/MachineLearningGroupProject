{{Life timeline}}
The '''Boring Billion''', otherwise known as the '''Barren Billion''', the '''Dullest Time in Earth's History''', and '''Earth's Middle Ages''', is the time period between 1.8 and 0.8 billion years ago (Gya) spanning the middle [[Proterozoic]] [[eon (geology)|eon]], characterized by more or less [[tectonic]] stability, climatic stasis, and stalled biological evolution. It is bordered by two different oxygenation and glacial events, but the Boring Billion itself had very low oxygen levels and no evidence of glaciation.

The oceans may have been oxygen- and nutrient-poor and sulfidic ([[euxinia]]), populated by mainly [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]] [[cyanobacteria]], a type of photosynthetic bacteria which uses [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S) instead of water and produces [[sulfur]] instead of oxygen. This is known as a [[Canfield ocean]]. Such composition may have caused the oceans to be black- and milky-turquoise instead of blue.

Despite such adverse conditions, [[eukaryote]]s may have evolved around the beginning of the Boring Billion, and adopted several novel adaptations, such as various [[organelle]]s and possibly [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]], and diversified into [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]]. Such advances may have been important precursors to the evolution of large, complex life later in the [[Cambrian explosion]]. However, [[prokaryotic]] cyanobacteria were the dominant lifeforms during this time, and likely supported an energy-poor [[food-web]] with a small number of [[protist]]s at the [[apex predator|apex level]]. The land was likely inhabited by prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic proto-[[lichen]]s, the latter more successful here probably due to the greater availability of nutrients than offshore ocean waters.

==Description==
In 1995, geologists [[Roger Buick]], [[Davis Des Marais]], and [[Andrew Knoll]] reviewed the apparent lack of major biological, geological, and climatic events during the [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[era]] 1.6 to 1 billion years ago (Gya), and, thus, described it as "the dullest time in Earth's history".<ref name=Buick1995>{{Cite journal|title = Stable isotopic compositions of carbonates from the Mesoproterozoic Bangemall group, northwestern Australia|journal = Chemical Geology|year=1995|pages = 153–171|volume = 123|issue = 1–4|doi = 10.1016/0009-2541(95)00049-R|pmid = 11540130|first1 = R.|last1 = Buick|first2 = D.

The Boring Billion is now largely cited as spanning about 1.8 to 0.8 Gya, contained within the [[Proterozoic]] [[eon (geology)|eon]], mainly the Mesoproterozoic.

The evolution of Earth's [[biosphere]], atmosphere, and [[hydrosphere]] has long been linked to the [[supercontinent cycle]], where the continents aggregate and then drift apart. The Boring Billion saw the evolution of two supercontinents: [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] (or Nuna) and [[Rodinia]].<ref name=":0"/><ref name=Evans2013/>

The supercontinent Columbia formed between 2.0 and 1.7&nbsp;Ga and remained intact until at least 1.3&nbsp;Ga. Geological and [[Paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] evidence suggest that Columbia underwent only minor changes to form the supercontinent Rodinia from 1.1 to 0.9&nbsp;Ga.

It is possible the [[asthenosphere]]—the molten layer of Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] that tectonic plates essentially float and move around upon—was too hot to sustain modern plate tectonics at this time. Instead of vigorous plate recycling at [[Subduction|subduction zones]], plates were linked together for billions of years until the mantle cooled off sufficiently. The onset of this component of plate tectonics may have been aided by the cooling and thickening of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] that, once initiated, made plate subduction anomalously strong, occurring at the end of the Boring Billion.<ref name=":1" />

It has also been proposed that, because the intensity of [[cosmic ray]]s has been shown to be positively correlated to cloud cover, and cloud cover reflects light back out into space and reduces global temperatures, lower rates of bombardment during this time due to reduced star formation in the galaxy caused less cloud cover and prevented glaciation events, maintaining a warm climate.<ref name=Veizer2005>{{Cite journal|title = Celestial Climate Driver: A Perspective from Four Billion Years of the Carbon Cycle|url = https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/2691|journal = Geoscience Canada|year=2005 |df=dmy-all |issn = 1911-4850|volume = 32|issue = 1|first = J.|last = Veizer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| last = Shaviv| first = Nir J.| year=2003 |df=dmy-all| title = The spiral structure of the Milky Way, cosmic rays, and ice age epochs on Earth| journal = New Astronomy| volume = 8| issue = 1| pages = 39–77| doi = 10.1016/S1384-1076(02)00193-8| arxiv = astro-ph/0209252| bibcode = 2003NewA....8...39S}}</ref> Also, some combination of weathering intensity which would have reduced CO<sub>2</sub> levels by oxidation of exposed metals, cooling of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and reduced [[geothermal heat]] and volcanism, and increasing solar intensity and solar heat may have reached an equilibrium, barring ice formation.<ref name=":4" />

Conversely, glacial movements over a billion years ago may not have left many remnants today, and an apparent lack of evidence could be due to the incompleteness of the fossil record rather than absence. Further, the low oxygen and solar intensity levels may have prevented the formation of the [[ozone layer]], preventing [[greenhouse gas]]ses from being trapped in the atmosphere and heating the Earth via the [[greenhouse effect]], which would have caused glaciation.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Glacio-epochs and the supercontinent cycle after ∼ 3.0&nbsp;Ga: Tectonic boundary conditions for glaciation|journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|year=2008 |df=dmy-all |pages = 89–129|volume = 258|issue = 1–2|doi = 10.1016/j.palaeo.2007.09.021|first = N.|last = Eyles}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Palaeoclimates: the first two billion years|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|year=2006 |df=dmy-all |issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 1868609|pmid = 16754607|pages = 917–929|volume = 361|issue = 1470|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2006.1839|first1 = J.

===Sulfur===
[[File:How oceans become euxinic.png|thumb|upright=2|Diagram of how [[euxinic]] conditions form]]
In 1998, geologist [[Donald Canfield]] proposed what is now known as the [[Canfield ocean]] hypothesis. Canfield claimed that increasing levels of oxygen in the atmosphere at the Great Oxygenation Event would have reacted with and oxidized continental [[iron pyrite]] (FeS<sub>2</sub>) deposits, with [[sulfate]] (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) as a byproduct, which was transported into the sea. [[Sulfate-reducing microorganisms]] converted this to [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H<sub>2</sub>S), dividing the ocean into a somewhat oxic surface layer, and a sulfidic layer beneath, with [[anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]] bacteria living at the border, metabolizing the H<sub>2</sub>S and creating sulfur as a waste product. This created widespread [[euxinic]] conditions in middle-waters, an anoxic state with a high sulfur concentration, which was maintained by the bacteria.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Lyons| first1 = Timothy W.| last2 = Reinhard| first2 = Christopher T.| year=2009 |df=dmy-all| title = An early productive ocean unfit for aerobics| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 106| issue = 43

===Iron===
Among rocks dating to the Boring Billion, there is a conspicuous lack of [[banded iron formation]]s, which form from iron in the upper water column (sourced from the deep ocean) reacting with oxygen and precipitating out of the water. They seemingly cease around the world after 1.85 Ga. Canfield argued that oceanic SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> [[redox|reduced]] all the iron in the anoxic deep sea.<ref name=Canfield1998/> Iron could have been metabolized by anoxygenic bacteria.<ref name=Canfield2018/> It has also been proposed that the 1.85 Ga [[Sudbury Basin|Sudbury meteor impact]] mixed the previously stratified ocean via tsunamis, interaction between vaporized seawater and the oxygenated atmosphere, oceanic [[cavitation]], and massive runoff of destroyed [[continental margin]]s into the sea. Resultant suboxic deep waters (due to oxygenated surface water mixing with previously anoxic deep water) would have oxidized deep-water iron, preventing it from being transported and deposited on continental margins.<ref name=Slack2009>{{cite journal|first1=J. F.|last1=Slack|first2=W.

Nonetheless, iron-rich waters did exist, such as the 1.4 Ga Xiamaling Formation of Northern China, which perhaps was fed by deep water hydrothermal vents. Iron-rich conditions also indicate anoxic bottom water in this area, as oxic conditions would have oxidized all the iron.<ref name=Canfield2018>{{cite journal|first1=D.

==Lifeforms==
Low nutrient abundance may have caused increased [[symbiosis|photosymbiosis]]—where one organism is capable of photosynthesis and the other metabolizes the waste product—among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), and the emergence of [[eukaryote]]s. Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota are the three [[domain (biology)|domains]], the highest taxonomic ranking. Eukaryotes are distinguished from prokaryotes by a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and membrane-bound organelles, and all multicellular organisms are eukaryotes.<ref name=Brasier1998>{{cite journal|first1=M.

===Prokaryotes===
[[File:Stromatolites, Belt Supergroup, Glacier National Park.jpg|thumb|1.44 Ga [[stromatolite]] from [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], Montana]]
Prokaryotes were the dominant lifeforms throughout the Boring Billion.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=Gueneli/><ref name=Canfield1998/> Anoxygenic cyanobacteria are thought to have been the dominant photosynthesizers, metabolizing the abundant H<sub>2</sub>S in the oceans. However, in iron-rich waters, cyanobacteria may have suffered from [[iron poisoning]], especially in offshore waters where iron-rich deep water mixed with surface waters, and were outcompeted by other bacteria which could metabolize both iron and H<sub>2</sub>S. However, iron poisoning could have been abated by [[silica]]-rich waters or [[biomineralization]] of iron within the cell.<ref name=Javaux2018>{{cite journal|first1=E.

===Eukaryotes===
Eukaryotes may have arisen around the beginning of the Boring Billion,<ref name=Mukherjee2018/> coinciding with the accretion of Columbia, which could have somehow increased oceanic oxygen levels.<ref name=Brooke2014/> However, multicellular eukaryotes had possibly already evolved by this time, with the earliest claimed fossil evidence dating to the Great Oxygenation Event with jellyfish-like [[Francevillian biota]].<ref>{{cite journal|first1=A.|last1=El Albani|first2=S.|last2=Bengtson|first3=D.

Due to the marginalization of large food particles, such as algae, in favor of cyanobacteria and prokaryotes which do not transmit as much energy to higher [[trophic level]]s, a complex [[food web]] likely did not form, and large lifeforms with high energy demands could not evolve.
