The '''past''' is the set of all [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] that occurred before a given point in time.<ref>{{cite web |title=past |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/past |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=25 June 2018 |format=web article}}</ref> The past is contrasted with and defined by the [[present]] and the [[future]]. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience [[time]], and is accessed through [[memory]] and [[recollection]]. In addition, human beings have [[recorded history|recorded the past]] since the advent of written language.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Christian |first1=David |title=Record Keeping and History: How We Chronicle the Past |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/agriculture-civilization/first-cities-appear/a/recordkeeping-and-history |website=www.khanacademy.org |publisher=Khan Academy |accessdate=25 June 2018 |format=web article}}</ref> The first known use of the word "past" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the [[past participle]] of the [[middle English]] verb ''passen'' meaning "to pass."<ref>{{cite web |author1=Merriam-Webster |title=Past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past |publisher=Merram-Webster.com |accessdate=24 July 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}</ref>

== Grammar ==
In [[grammar]], actions are classified according to one of the following twelve verb tenses: past (past, [[Uses of English verb forms#Past progressive/continuous|past continuous]], [[past perfect]], or [[past perfect continuous]]), present ([[present]], [[present continuous]], [[present perfect]], or [[present perfect continuous]]), or future ([[future]], [[future continuous]], [[future perfect]], or [[future perfect continuous]]).<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> The past tense refers to actions that have already happened. For example, "she is walking" refers to a girl who is currently walking (present tense), while "she walked" refers to a girl who was walking before now (past tense).

The past continuous tense refers to actions that continued for a period of time, as in the sentence "she was walking," which describes an action that was still happening in a prior window of time to which a speaker is presently referring. The past perfect tense is used to describe actions that were already completed by a specific point in the past. For example, "she had walked" describes an action that took place in the past and was also completed in the past.

The past perfect continuous tense refers to an action that was happening up until a particular point in the past but was completed.<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=Verb tenses |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/grammar/verb-tenses |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> It is different from the past perfect tense because the emphasis of past perfect continuous verbs is not on the action having been completed by the present moment, but rather on its having taken place actively over a time period before another moment in the past. The verb tense used in the sentence "She had been walking in the park regularly before I met her" is past perfect continuous because it describes an action ("walking") that was actively happening before a time when something else in the past was happening (when "I met her").

Depending on its usage in a sentence, "past" can be described using a variety of terms. [[Synonyms]] for "past" as an [[adjective]] include, "former," "bygone," "earlier," "preceding," and "previous." Synonyms for "past" as a [[noun]] include, "history, "background," "life story," and "biography." Synonyms of "past" as a [[preposition]] include, "in front of," "beyond," "by," and "in excess of."<ref>{{cite web |author1=(no author) |title=past |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/thesaurus/past |website=oxforddictionaries.com |publisher=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}</ref>

== Other uses ==
The word "past" can also be used to describe the offices of those who have previously served in an organization, group, or event such as, "past president," or, "past champions."<ref>{{cite web |title=past |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/past |website=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web}}</ref> "Past" can also refer to something or someone being at or in a position that is further than a particular point.<ref>{{cite web |title=past |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/past |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |publisher=Cambridge.org |accessdate=27 August 2018 |format=Web |date=n.d.}}</ref> For instance, in the sentence, "I live on Fielding Road, just past the train station," the word "past" is used to describe a location (the speaker's residence) beyond a certain point (the train station).
