'''Geotargeting''' in [[geomarketing]] and [[internet marketing]] is the method of determining the [[geolocation]] of a website visitor and delivering different [[Web content|content]] to that visitor based on their location. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/[[zip code]], organization, [[IP address]], [[ISP]] or other criteria.<ref>Michael Freedman, Mythili Vutukuru, Nick Feamster and Hari Balakrishnan, Geographic Locality of IP Prefixes, Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2005</ref> A common usage of geo targeting is found in [[online advertising]], as well as [[internet television]] with sites such as [[iPlayer]] and [[Hulu]]. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing [[digital rights management]]. Use of [[proxy server]]s and [[virtual private network]]s may give a false location.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/technology/internet/16privacy.html?ref=technology | title=Many See Privacy on Web as Big Issue, Survey Says | work=Nytimes.com | date=March 15, 2009 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=STEPHANIE CLIFFORD}}</ref>

==Geographical information provided by the visitor==
In geotargeting with [[geolocation software]], the [[geolocation]] is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others.

===Different content by choice===
Typical examples for different content by choice in geotargeting are the [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] websites where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical [[geolocation]] and other personal information is automated.<ref name=automated>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal, “On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only”, August 4, 2010]</ref> A good example is the [[Ace Hardware]] website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor's location, the website's [[online locator service]] can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.<ref>[http://www.gsicommerce.com/assets/docs/pdf/generic/CSA-AceHardware-Nov08.pdf Chain Store Age, “Making it Personal”, November, 2008]</ref>

==IP spidering==
The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on [[IP address]]es by [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/digital-element-rob-friedman-ip-targeting/|title=Digital Element Finding Demand for Granular IP targeting|accessdate=2010-04-28|date=2009-08-20}} Discussing automated spidering technology</ref>

It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/google-says-ip-addresses-arent-personal/?_php=true&_type=blogs&ref=technology&_r=0 | title=Google Says I.P. Addresses Aren’t Personal | work=Nytimes.com | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=SAUL HANSELL}}</ref> enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/technology/personaltech/how-to-muddy-your-tracks-on-the-internet.html | title=How to Muddy Your Tracks on the Internet | work=Nytimes.com | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=KATE MURPHY}}</ref> Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of [[Web crawler|Web spidering]].

==IP delivery in SEO==
{{main|Cloaking}}
IP delivery for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the method of delivering different content to search engine spiders (also known as robots and crawlers) then to human visitors. The IP address determines if a visitor is a known search engine spider. SEOs compare the visitor's IP address with their list of IP addresses, which are known to be servers that are owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The delivery of different content to search engine spiders than to human visitors is called [[cloaking]] and is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.<ref name=gguide>[https://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769 Google webmaster guidelines]</ref><ref name=yguide>[http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/indexing/indexing-14.html Yahoo! search content quality guidelines]</ref><ref name=msguide>[http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm MS Search guidelines for successful indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819035446/http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm |date=2006-08-19 }}</ref>

Although the search engine guidelines seem to imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are cases where cloaking might be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and SEO experts continue to debate about when cloaking might be acceptable and when not.<ref>Chris Sherman (July 18, 2001), [http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 Search Engine Cloaking: The Controversy Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063408/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 |date=2007-11-13 }}, ''Search Engine Watch'', retrieved on December 9, 2007</ref>

"Cloaking" via IP delivery works differently from cloaking via "[[user agent]]". While [[IP address spoofing]] is harder than [[User agent#User agent spoofing|user-agent spoofing]] and more reliable, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list with active crawler IP addresses missing enables the search engines to detect the cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.
