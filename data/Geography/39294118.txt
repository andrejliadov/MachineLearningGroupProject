'''British wildwood''', or simply '''the wildwood''', is the wholly [[natural landscape]] which developed across major parts of [[Prehistoric England|England]] after the [[Last Glacial Period|last ice age]]. This [[woodland]] had not yet been affected by [[human]] intervention, and was home to many [[species]] which are not now found in England, such as [[elk]] and [[brown bear]]s. Over centuries, starting in the [[Neolithic period]], this wildwood gradually gave way to [[grassland|open plains]] and fields as [[human population]]s increased and began to exploit and develop the land to their advantage.

Most of the areas of woodland that remain in England descend from the original wildwood, but are now in a semi-natural state due to being managed and controlled, including as a source of [[timber]]. These are known as [[ancient woodland]]. True wildwood is thought to be no longer extant in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/environment/woodland/ancient-woodland |title=Ancient Woodland |publisher=Exmoor National Park, UK |accessdate=4 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307200856/http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/environment/woodland/ancient-woodland |archivedate=7 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://south-coast-central.co.uk/wildwood.htm |title=An Introduction to Britain's Lost Wildwood |publisher=South Coast Central: A Guide To England's South-Central Region |accessdate=12 May 2013 }}</ref>
