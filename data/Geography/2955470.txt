'''OpenStreetMap''' ('''OSM''') is a [[virtual community|collaborative project]] to create a [[free content|free]] editable [[map]] of the world. The [[geodata]] underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable [[satellite navigation]] devices.<ref name="GPS-inspires-DIY" />

Created by [[Steve Coast]] in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of [[Wikipedia]] and the predominance of [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] map data in the UK and elsewhere.<ref name="tc10">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data/|title=For the Love of Mapping Data|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|date=9 August 2014|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|type=Interview|access-date=30 Sep 2019}}</ref><ref name="ramm-topf-chilton_2011">{{cite book |title=OpenStreetMap: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World |first1=Frederick |last1=Ramm |first2=Jochen |last2=Topf |first3=Steve |last3=Chilton |publisher=UIT Cambridge |year=2011}}{{ISBN missing|date=October 2019}}</ref> Since then, it has grown to over two million registered users.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neis |first1=Pascal |last2=Zipf |first2=Alexander |title= Analyzing the Contributor Activity of a Volunteered Geographic Information Project — the Case of OpenStreetMap |journal= ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=146–165 |year=2012 |doi=10.3390/ijgi1020146 |bibcode=2012IJGI....1..146N |doi-access=free }}</ref> Users may collect data using manual survey, [[GPS]] devices, [[aerial photography]], and other free sources, or use their own local knowledge of the area.

==History==
[[File:Steve Coast - OSM im Rheinland (0604).jpg|thumb|The founder of OSM, [[Steve Coast]], in 2009]]

[[Steve Coast]] founded the project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom. In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the [[Ordnance Survey]] created massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. The first contribution, made in the British city of [[London]] in 2005,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coast |first1=Steve |title=Changest #1 on OpenStreetMap |url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/1 |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=September 19, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> was thought to be a road by the Directions Mag.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sinton |first1=Diana |title=OSM: The simple map that became a global movement |url=https://www.directionsmag.com/article/1163 |website=The Directions Mag |access-date=September 19, 2018 |date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2006, the [[OpenStreetMap Foundation]] was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free [[geospatial]] data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its [[aerial photography]] as a backdrop for map production.<ref name="ogd-Coast1" />

In April 2007, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] (AND) donated a complete road data set for the [[Netherlands]] and [[trunk road]] data for [[India]] and China to the project<ref name="ogd-Coast3" /> and by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included [[Google]], Yahoo! and [[Multimap.com|Multimap]]. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a [[United States Census Bureau|US Census]] [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] road dataset.<ref name="linux" /> In December 2007, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] became the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website.<ref name="geothought" />

Ways to import and export data have continued to grow – by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps.<ref name="systemed" /> In March, two founders{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=of what?}} announced that they have received venture capital funding of €2.4{{nbsp}}million for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data.<ref name="CloudMade2" /> In November 2010, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] changed their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/11/23/bing-engages-open-maps-community |title=Bing engages open maps community |date=23 November 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, the launch of pricing for [[Google Maps]] led several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fossum |first=Mike |title=Websites Bypassing Google Maps Due to Fees |url=http://www.webpronews.com/websites-bypassing-google-maps-due-to-new-fees-2012-03 |access-date=13 November 2012 |date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Chief among these were Foursquare and [[Craigslist]], which adopted OpenStreetMap, and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform using [[TomTom]] and OpenStreetMap data.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ingraham |first=Nathan |title=Apple using TomTom and OpenStreetMap data in iOS 6 Maps app |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3078987/apple-tomtom-openstreemap-ios-6-maps-app |access-date=13 November 2012 |date=11 June 2012}}</ref>

==Map production==
[[File:Adding data to OSM after mapping Brighton Pier.jpg|thumb|Editing with [[JOSM]] after a ground survey]]
Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. [[Mapathon]] competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.

The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Import/Guidelines |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=23 March 2015 |quote=The import guidelines, along with the Automated Edits code of conduct, should be followed when importing data into the OpenStreetMap database as they embody many lessons learned throughout the history of OpenStreetMap. Imports should be planned and executed with more care and sensitive than other edits, because poor imports can have significant impacts on both existing data and local mapping community.}}</ref>

===Software for editing maps===
[[File:StreetComplete - House number quest.png|alt=A map with different colored icons on it, currently a quest about a house number|thumb|StreetComplete asking user a question, with answer filled in. After tapping "OK" this answer will be added to an OpenStreetMap database.]]
Editing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called [[iD (software)|iD]], an [[HTML5]] application using [[D3.js]] and written by [[Mapbox]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://Mapbox.com/blog/announcing-id/ |title=A New Editor for OpenStreetMap: iD |author=Saman Bemel Benrud |publisher=Mapbox |date=31 January 2013}}</ref> which was originally financed by the [[Knight Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://knightfoundation.org/articles/collaborating-improve-openstreetmap-infrastructure |title=Collaborating to improve OpenStreetMap infrastructure |first=Alex |last=Barth |date=20 May 2013}}</ref> The earlier Flash-based application [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch]] is retained for intermediate-level users. [[JOSM]] and Merkaartor are more powerful desktop editing applications that are better suited for advanced users.

Vespucci is the first full-featured editor for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]; it was released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vespucci.io/ |title=Welcome to Vespucci |access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> StreetComplete is an Android app launched in 2016,<ref>{{cite document|last=Zwick |first=Tobias |title=StreetComplete: Surveyor app for Android |date=21 February 2018 |url=https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> which allows users without any OpenStreetMap knowledge to answer simple quests for existing data in OpenStreetMap, and thus contribute data.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete |title=StreetComplete – OpenStreetMap Wiki |website=wiki.openstreetmap.org |language=en|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> [[Maps.me]] and [[OsmAnd]], two offline map mobile applications available for Android and iOS, both include limited OSM data editors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.maps.me/hc/en-us/sections/201941155 |title= Map editor  |website=maps.me |access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://osmand.net/features/osm-editing-plugin |title= OSM editing  |website=OsmAnd.net |access-date=2020-09-19}}</ref> [[openstreetmap:Go Map!!|Go Map!!]] is an iOS app that lets users create and edit information in OpenStreetMap.

Shown in the photo is the Betis group standing beside one of the [[List of memorials to Bataan Death March victims|Death March trail monuments]].]]
The project has a geographically diverse user-base, due to emphasis of local knowledge and [[ground truth]] in the process of data collection. Many early contributors were [[Bicycle|cyclists]] who survey with and for bicyclists, charting [[Bikeway|cycleroutes]] and navigable trails.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key and More Info |url=http://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/ |publisher=OpenCycleMap |access-date=17 November 2012}}</ref> Others are [[Geographic Information System|GIS]] professionals who contribute data with [[Esri]] tools.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vines |first=Emily |title=Esri Releases ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap |url=http://www.esri.com/news/releases/10_3qtr/openstreetmap.html |publisher=Esri |access-date=17 November 2012}}</ref> Contributors are predominately men, with only 3–5% being women.<ref>"Gender and Experience-Related Motivators for Contributing to OpenStreetMap". https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_218905.pdf</ref>

By August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009, there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000. In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors.<ref name="osm-wiki-stats" /> On 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached one million registered users.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Harry |title=1 million OpenStreetMappers |url=http://opengeodata.org/1-million-openstreetmappers |work=OpenGeoData |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> Around 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neis |first=Pascal |title=The OpenStreetMap Contributors Map aka Who's around me? |url=http://neis-one.org/2013/01/oooc/ |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref>

There are approximately 6,500 contributors active on any given day, although this number continues to rise quite rapidly as OSM gains popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OSMstats - Statistics of the free wiki world map|url=https://osmstats.neis-one.org/?item=members|access-date=2020-09-05|website=osmstats.neis-one.org}}</ref>

===Surveys and personal knowledge===
[[File:Motion X GPS and OSM.jpg|thumb|Surveying routes with a [[GPS receiver]]]]

Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, [[Pedestrian|on foot]], bicycle, or in a [[car]], [[motorcycle]], or [[boat]]. Map data was typically recorded on a [[GPS tracking unit|GPS unit]]. In late 2006  [[Yahoo!]] made their aerial imagery available for tracing to OSM contributors, which simplified mapping of readily visible and identifiable features.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of OpenStreetMap - OpenStreetMap Wiki|url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap|access-date=2020-09-05|website=wiki.openstreetmap.org}}</ref> The project still makes use of GPS traces from volunteers which are used to delineate the more difficult to identify and classify features such as footpath, as well as providing ground-truth for aerial imagery alignment.

Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.

Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.

=== Street-level image data ===
In addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360° image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[KartaView]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>

===Government data===
Some government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>

Globally, OSM initially used the Prototype Global Shoreline from [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]. Due to it being oversimplified and crude, it has been mainly replaced by other government sources or manual tracing.

In the United States, most roads originate from [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census Bureau. Geographic names were initially sourced from [[Geographic Names Information System]], and some areas contain water features from the [[National Hydrography Dataset]]. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported. In Canada [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.

[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.

===Route planning===
In February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|access-date = 28 April 2015}}</ref>

There are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.

OpenStreetMap maintains lists of online and offline routing engines available, such as the [[Open Source Routing Machine]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Filney |first=Klint |title=Out in the Open: How to Get Google Maps Directions Without Google |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/11/osrm |access-date=11 November 2013 |newspaper=Wired |date=11 November 2013}}</ref> OSM data is popular with routing researchers, and is also available to open-source projects and companies to build routing applications (or for any other purpose).

===Humanitarian aid===
{{See also|Crisis mapping|Smart mob|Ushahidi}}
[[File:Openstreetmap Philippines GPS Map by Schadow1 Expeditions.jpg|thumb|OpenStreetMap Philippines GPS map, an end-product of over a thousand crisis mappers that contributed almost 5 million map updates during the 2013 Haiyan humanitarian activation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors|title=OpenStreetMap Activities for Typhoon Haiyan (2013)|website=Neis-one.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721191839/http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors|archive-date=21 July 2018|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>]]

The [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] has established a model for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with international organisations. OpenStreetMap and Crisis Commons volunteers using available satellite imagery to map the roads, buildings and refugee camps of [[Port-au-Prince]] in just two days, building "the most complete digital map of Haiti's roads".<ref name="forbes" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://crisiscommons.org |title=CrisisCommons |website=CrisisCommons}}</ref><ref name="nytimes" />

The resulting data and maps have been used by several organisations providing relief aid, such as the [[World Bank]], the European Commission Joint Research Centre, the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], [[UNOSAT]] and others.<ref name="osm-wiki-haiti" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Andrew |title=World Bank Haiti Situation Room – featuring OSM |date=3 February 2010 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4329833289/in/photostream/}}</ref><ref name="pbatty_video">{{cite web |last=Batty |first=Peter |title=OpenStreetMap in Haiti – video |date=14 February 2010 |url=http://geothought.blogspot.com/2010/02/openstreetmap-in-haiti-video.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=European Commission Joint Research Centre |title=Haiti Earthquakes: Infrastructure Port-au-Prince 15/01/2010 |date=15 January 2010 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025082950/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |archive-date=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

NGOs, like the [[HOT-OSM|Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team]] and others, have worked with donors like [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) to map other parts of Haiti and parts of many other countries, both to create map data for places that were blank, and to engage and build capacity of local people.<ref>{{cite web |title=OSM Marks the SpotHaitians use a crowdsourced map to chart their own country, and its development |url=https://medium.com/medium-for-haiti/f4582ed41656 |publisher=medium.com|date=26 June 2013 }}</ref>

After Haiti, the OpenStreetMap community continued mapping to support humanitarian organisations for various crises and disasters. After the [[Northern Mali conflict]] (January 2013), [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the Philippines (November 2013), and the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] (March 2014), the OpenStreetMap community has shown it can play a significant role in supporting humanitarian organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=OSM 2012 Mali Crisis wiki page |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2012_Mali_Crisis |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Debora |last=MacKenzie |title=Social media helps aid efforts after typhoon Haiyan |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24565-social-media-helps-aid-efforts-after-typhoon-haiyan.html#.U-QaA2MmUro |date=12 November 2013 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Robinson |last=Meyer |title=How Online Mapmakers Are Helping the Red Cross Save Lives in the Philippines |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-online-mapmakers-are-helping-the-red-cross-save-lives-in-the-philippines/281366/ |date=12 November 2013 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Nuviun |title=How the Internet is Stopping the Ebola Outbreak, One Street Map at a Time |url=http://nuviun.com/content/blog/How-the-Internet-is-Stopping-the-Ebola-Outbreak-One-Street-Map-at-a-Time |access-date=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019042927/http://nuviun.com/content/blog/How-the-Internet-is-Stopping-the-Ebola-Outbreak-One-Street-Map-at-a-Time |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Along with post-disaster work, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has worked to build better risk models and grow the local OpenStreetMap communities in multiple countries including [[Uganda]], [[Senegal]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in partnership with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], [[World Bank]], and other humanitarian groups.<ref>{{cite web |title=Preventative Mapping in Uganda with the Red Cross |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-08-21_preventative_mapping_in_uganda_with_the_red_cross |work=Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vyncke |first1=Jorieke |title=A week in Lubumbashi (DRC) |url=https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-04-01_a_week_in_lubumbashi_drc |access-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920192747/https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-04-01_a_week_in_lubumbashi_drc |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Out and about in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: An OSM workshop sponsored by the World Bank |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-07-13_out_and_about_in_yogyakarta_indonesia_an_osm_workshop_sponsored_by_the_world_bank |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

==Legal aspects==

===Licensing terms===
OpenStreetMap data was originally published under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike licence (CC BY-SA) with the intention of promoting free use and redistribution of the data. In September 2012, the licence was changed to the [[Open Database License|Open Database Licence]] (ODbL) published by Open Data Commons (ODC) in order to more specifically define its bearing on data rather than representation.<ref name="ogd-Fairhurst" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence |title=Licence – OpenStreetMap Foundation |website=wiki.osmfoundation.org |language=en|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

As part of this relicensing process, some of the map data was removed from the public distribution. This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |first=Simon |last=Poole |access-date=21 May 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |first=Harry |last=Wood |access-date=1 October 2012}}</ref>

All data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a [[OpenStreetmap:Copyright|set of terms]] which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.

Software used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].<ref name="osm-wiki-legalfaq" />

===Commercial data contributions===
Some OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.

Notably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a [[free content license|free]] and [[open content license|open]] licence,<ref name="ogd-Coast1" /> until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011.<ref name="yahoo-maps-close" /> In November 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors.<ref name="ogd-Coast2" /> For a period from 2009 to 2011, [[NearMap|NearMap Pty Ltd]] made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a [[CC BY-SA]] licence.<ref name="nearmap" />

In June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project – four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/microsoft-releases-building-footprints/|title=Microsoft releases more than 100 million Building Footprints in the US as open data|date=2018-07-03|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data|title=Microsoft Releases 125 million Building Footprints in the US as Open Data|website=blogs.bing.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>

==Operation==
While OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.

===Data format===
OpenStreetMap uses a [[topology|topological]] [[graph (discrete mathematics)|data structure]], with four core elements (also known as ''data primitives''):
* ''Nodes'' are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a [[latitude]] and a [[longitude]]) according to [[WGS 84]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WGS_84 WGS 84] ''OpenStreetMap Wiki''</ref> Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as [[point of interest|points of interest]] or mountain peaks.
* ''Ways'' are ordered lists of ''nodes'', representing a [[polyline]], or possibly a [[polygon]] if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.
* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called "members"), where each member can optionally have a "role" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.
* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219–230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Data storage===
The OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.

The main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database with [[PostGIS]] extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenStreetMap Wiki: Database |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs |title=Databases and data access APIs |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.

For data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called [[Openstreetmap:planet.osm|planet.osm]]. These dumps exist in two formats, one using [[XML]] and one using the [[Protocol Buffers|Protocol Buffer Binary Format]] (PBF).

=== Popular services ===

[[Image:Moovit Navigate 3.0.png|thumb|upright|Moovit Navigate]]

A variety of popular services incorporate some sort of [[geolocation]] or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:

* [[Apple Inc.]] unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for [[IPhoto#iOS version|iPhoto for iOS]] on {{Start date|df=yes|2012|03|07}}, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source – though this was corrected in 1.0.1. OpenStreetMap is one of the many cited sources for Apple's custom maps in [[iOS]] 6, though the majority of map data is provided by [[TomTom]].
* [[Craigslist]] switched to OpenStreetMap in 2012, rendering their own tiles based on the data.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |title=Craigslist quietly switching to OpenStreetMap data |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/08/28/craigslist-open-street-map/ |access-date=12 November 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=28 August 2012}}</ref>

'''OpenStreetMap''' ('''OSM''') is a [[virtual community|collaborative project]] to create a [[free content|free]] editable [[map]] of the world. The [[geodata]] underlying the map is considered the primary output of the project. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable [[satellite navigation]] devices.<ref name="GPS-inspires-DIY" />

Created by [[Steve Coast]] in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of [[Wikipedia]] and the predominance of [[Proprietary format|proprietary]] map data in the UK and elsewhere.<ref name="tc10">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data/|title=For the Love of Mapping Data|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|date=9 August 2014|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|type=Interview|access-date=30 Sep 2019}}</ref><ref name="ramm-topf-chilton_2011">{{cite book |title=OpenStreetMap: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World |first1=Frederick |last1=Ramm |first2=Jochen |last2=Topf |first3=Steve |last3=Chilton |publisher=UIT Cambridge |year=2011}}{{ISBN missing|date=October 2019}}</ref> Since then, it has grown to over two million registered users.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neis |first1=Pascal |last2=Zipf |first2=Alexander |title= Analyzing the Contributor Activity of a Volunteered Geographic Information Project — the Case of OpenStreetMap |journal= ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information|volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=146–165 |year=2012 |doi=10.3390/ijgi1020146 |bibcode=2012IJGI....1..146N |doi-access=free }}</ref> Users may collect data using manual survey, [[GPS]] devices, [[aerial photography]], and other free sources, or use their own local knowledge of the area.

==History==
[[File:Steve Coast - OSM im Rheinland (0604).jpg|thumb|The founder of OSM, [[Steve Coast]], in 2009]]

[[Steve Coast]] founded the project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom. In the UK and elsewhere, government-run and tax-funded projects like the [[Ordnance Survey]] created massive datasets but failed to freely and widely distribute them. The first contribution, made in the British city of [[London]] in 2005,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coast |first1=Steve |title=Changest #1 on OpenStreetMap |url=https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/1 |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=September 19, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> was thought to be a road by the Directions Mag.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sinton |first1=Diana |title=OSM: The simple map that became a global movement |url=https://www.directionsmag.com/article/1163 |website=The Directions Mag |access-date=September 19, 2018 |date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2006, the [[OpenStreetMap Foundation]] was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free [[geospatial]] data and provide geospatial data for anybody to use and share. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap could use its [[aerial photography]] as a backdrop for map production.<ref name="ogd-Coast1" />

In April 2007, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] (AND) donated a complete road data set for the [[Netherlands]] and [[trunk road]] data for [[India]] and China to the project<ref name="ogd-Coast3" /> and by July 2007, when the first OSM international The State of the Map conference was held, there were 9,000 registered users. Sponsors of the event included [[Google]], Yahoo! and [[Multimap.com|Multimap]]. In October 2007, OpenStreetMap completed the import of a [[United States Census Bureau|US Census]] [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] road dataset.<ref name="linux" /> In December 2007, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] became the first major organisation to use OpenStreetMap data on their main website.<ref name="geothought" />

Ways to import and export data have continued to grow – by 2008, the project developed tools to export OpenStreetMap data to power portable GPS units, replacing their existing proprietary and out-of-date maps.<ref name="systemed" /> In March, two founders{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=of what?}} announced that they have received venture capital funding of €2.4{{nbsp}}million for CloudMade, a commercial company that uses OpenStreetMap data.<ref name="CloudMade2" /> In November 2010, [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] changed their licence to allow use of their satellite imagery for making maps.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.bing.com/maps/2010/11/23/bing-engages-open-maps-community |title=Bing engages open maps community |date=23 November 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, the launch of pricing for [[Google Maps]] led several prominent websites to switch from their service to OpenStreetMap and other competitors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fossum |first=Mike |title=Websites Bypassing Google Maps Due to Fees |url=http://www.webpronews.com/websites-bypassing-google-maps-due-to-new-fees-2012-03 |access-date=13 November 2012 |date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Chief among these were Foursquare and [[Craigslist]], which adopted OpenStreetMap, and [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], which ended a contract with Google and launched a self-built mapping platform using [[TomTom]] and OpenStreetMap data.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ingraham |first=Nathan |title=Apple using TomTom and OpenStreetMap data in iOS 6 Maps app |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/11/3078987/apple-tomtom-openstreemap-ios-6-maps-app |access-date=13 November 2012 |date=11 June 2012}}</ref>

==Map production==
[[File:Adding data to OSM after mapping Brighton Pier.jpg|thumb|Editing with [[JOSM]] after a ground survey]]
Map data is collected from scratch by volunteers performing systematic ground surveys using tools such as a handheld GPS unit, a notebook, digital camera, or a voice recorder. The data is then entered into the OpenStreetMap database. [[Mapathon]] competition events are also held by OpenStreetMap team and by non-profit organisations and local governments to map a particular area.

The availability of aerial photography and other data from commercial and government sources has added important sources of data for manual editing and automated imports. Special processes are in place to handle automated imports and avoid legal and technical problems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Import/Guidelines |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=23 March 2015 |quote=The import guidelines, along with the Automated Edits code of conduct, should be followed when importing data into the OpenStreetMap database as they embody many lessons learned throughout the history of OpenStreetMap. Imports should be planned and executed with more care and sensitive than other edits, because poor imports can have significant impacts on both existing data and local mapping community.}}</ref>

===Software for editing maps===
[[File:StreetComplete - House number quest.png|alt=A map with different colored icons on it, currently a quest about a house number|thumb|StreetComplete asking user a question, with answer filled in. After tapping "OK" this answer will be added to an OpenStreetMap database.]]
Editing of maps can be done using the default web browser editor called [[iD (software)|iD]], an [[HTML5]] application using [[D3.js]] and written by [[Mapbox]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://Mapbox.com/blog/announcing-id/ |title=A New Editor for OpenStreetMap: iD |author=Saman Bemel Benrud |publisher=Mapbox |date=31 January 2013}}</ref> which was originally financed by the [[Knight Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://knightfoundation.org/articles/collaborating-improve-openstreetmap-infrastructure |title=Collaborating to improve OpenStreetMap infrastructure |first=Alex |last=Barth |date=20 May 2013}}</ref> The earlier Flash-based application [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch]] is retained for intermediate-level users. [[JOSM]] and Merkaartor are more powerful desktop editing applications that are better suited for advanced users.

Vespucci is the first full-featured editor for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]; it was released in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vespucci.io/ |title=Welcome to Vespucci |access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> StreetComplete is an Android app launched in 2016,<ref>{{cite document|last=Zwick |first=Tobias |title=StreetComplete: Surveyor app for Android |date=21 February 2018 |url=https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> which allows users without any OpenStreetMap knowledge to answer simple quests for existing data in OpenStreetMap, and thus contribute data.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete |title=StreetComplete – OpenStreetMap Wiki |website=wiki.openstreetmap.org |language=en|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> [[Maps.me]] and [[OsmAnd]], two offline map mobile applications available for Android and iOS, both include limited OSM data editors.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.maps.me/hc/en-us/sections/201941155 |title= Map editor  |website=maps.me |access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://osmand.net/features/osm-editing-plugin |title= OSM editing  |website=OsmAnd.net |access-date=2020-09-19}}</ref> [[openstreetmap:Go Map!!|Go Map!!]] is an iOS app that lets users create and edit information in OpenStreetMap.

===Contributors===
[[File:Guagua ESSC-OSMPH Training field survey.jpg|thumb|Field survey in various parts of the [[Guagua]] by a group of mappers. They took notes and photos, and recorded GPS tracks. Shown in the photo is the Betis group standing beside one of the [[List of memorials to Bataan Death March victims|Death March trail monuments]].]]
The project has a geographically diverse user-base, due to emphasis of local knowledge and [[ground truth]] in the process of data collection. Many early contributors were [[Bicycle|cyclists]] who survey with and for bicyclists, charting [[Bikeway|cycleroutes]] and navigable trails.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key and More Info |url=http://www.opencyclemap.org/docs/ |publisher=OpenCycleMap |access-date=17 November 2012}}</ref> Others are [[Geographic Information System|GIS]] professionals who contribute data with [[Esri]] tools.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vines |first=Emily |title=Esri Releases ArcGIS Editor for OpenStreetMap |url=http://www.esri.com/news/releases/10_3qtr/openstreetmap.html |publisher=Esri |access-date=17 November 2012}}</ref> Contributors are predominately men, with only 3–5% being women.<ref>"Gender and Experience-Related Motivators for Contributing to OpenStreetMap". https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/PubDat_218905.pdf</ref>

By August 2008, shortly after the second The State of the Map conference was held, there were over 50,000 registered contributors; by March 2009, there were 100,000 and by the end of 2009 the figure was nearly 200,000. In April 2012, OpenStreetMap cleared 600,000 registered contributors.<ref name="osm-wiki-stats" /> On 6 January 2013, OpenStreetMap reached one million registered users.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Harry |title=1 million OpenStreetMappers |url=http://opengeodata.org/1-million-openstreetmappers |work=OpenGeoData |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref> Around 30% of users have contributed at least one point to the OpenStreetMap database.<ref>{{cite web |last=Neis |first=Pascal |title=The OpenStreetMap Contributors Map aka Who's around me? |url=http://neis-one.org/2013/01/oooc/ |access-date=7 January 2013}}</ref>

There are approximately 6,500 contributors active on any given day, although this number continues to rise quite rapidly as OSM gains popularity.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OSMstats - Statistics of the free wiki world map|url=https://osmstats.neis-one.org/?item=members|access-date=2020-09-05|website=osmstats.neis-one.org}}</ref>

===Surveys and personal knowledge===
[[File:Motion X GPS and OSM.jpg|thumb|Surveying routes with a [[GPS receiver]]]]

Ground surveys are performed by a mapper, [[Pedestrian|on foot]], bicycle, or in a [[car]], [[motorcycle]], or [[boat]]. Map data was typically recorded on a [[GPS tracking unit|GPS unit]]. In late 2006  [[Yahoo!]] made their aerial imagery available for tracing to OSM contributors, which simplified mapping of readily visible and identifiable features.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of OpenStreetMap - OpenStreetMap Wiki|url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap|access-date=2020-09-05|website=wiki.openstreetmap.org}}</ref> The project still makes use of GPS traces from volunteers which are used to delineate the more difficult to identify and classify features such as footpath, as well as providing ground-truth for aerial imagery alignment.

Once the data has been collected, it is entered into the database by uploading it onto the project's website together with appropriate attribute data. As collecting and uploading data may be separated from editing objects, contribution to the project is possible without using a GPS unit.

Some committed contributors adopt the task of mapping whole towns and cities, or organising mapping parties to gather the support of others to complete a map area. A large number of less active users contribute corrections and small additions to the map.

=== Street-level image data ===
In addition to several different sets of satellite image backgrounds available to OSM editors, data from several street-level image platforms are available as map data photo overlays: [[Streetside|Bing Streetside]] 360° image tracks, and the open and crowdsourced [[Mapillary]] and [[KartaView]] platforms, generally smartphone and other windshield-mounted camera images. Additionally, a Mapillary traffic sign data layer can be enabled; it is the product of user-submitted images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://blog.mapillary.com/tutorials/2017/08/21/mapping-traffic-signs-in-osm.html|title=Fast Traffic Sign Mapping with OpenStreetMap and Mapillary|date=2017-08-21|work=The Mapillary Blog|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en}}</ref>

===Government data===
Some government agencies have released official data on appropriate licences. This includes the United States, where works of the federal government are placed under [[public domain]].<ref>See [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government]] for more details.</ref>

Globally, OSM initially used the Prototype Global Shoreline from [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]. Due to it being oversimplified and crude, it has been mainly replaced by other government sources or manual tracing.

In the United States, most roads originate from [[Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing|TIGER]] from the Census Bureau. Geographic names were initially sourced from [[Geographic Names Information System]], and some areas contain water features from the [[National Hydrography Dataset]]. In the UK, some [[Ordnance Survey]] OpenData is imported. In Canada [[Natural Resources Canada]]'s CanVec vector data and [[GeoBase (geospatial data)|GeoBase]] provide landcover and streets.

[[List of countries' copyright length|Out-of-copyright]] maps can be good sources of information about features that do not change frequently. Copyright periods vary, but in the UK [[Crown copyright]] expires after 50 years and hence Ordnance Survey maps until the 1960s can legally be used. A complete set of UK 1&nbsp;inch/mile maps from the late 1940s and early 1950s has been collected, scanned, and is available online as a resource for contributors.

===Route planning===
In February 2015, OpenStreetMap added route planning functionality to the map on its official website. The routing uses external services, namely [[OSRM]], [[GraphHopper]] and [[MapQuest]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Routing on OpenStreetMap.org {{!}} OpenStreetMap Blog|url = https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2015/02/16/routing-on-openstreetmap-org/|access-date = 28 April 2015}}</ref>

There are other routing providers and applications listed in the official Routing wiki.

;[[GNOME Maps]]
:GNOME Maps is a graphical front-end written in JavaScript and introduced in [[GNOME]] 3.10. It provides a mechanism to find the user's location with the help of [[GeoClue]], finds directions via GraphHopper and it can deliver a list as answer to queries.
;[[Marble (software)|Marble]]
:Marble is a [[KDE]] [[virtual globe]] application which received support for OpenStreetMap.
;FoxtrotGPS
:FoxtrotGPS is a [[GTK+]]-based map viewer, that is especially suited to touch input.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxtrotgps.org/ |title=FoxtrotGPS homepage}}</ref> It is available in the [[SHR (operating system)|SHR]] or [[Debian]] repositories.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://packages.debian.org/sid/foxtrotgps |title=FoxtrotGPS in Debian}}</ref>

The web site OpenStreetMap.org provides a [[tiled web map|slippy map]] interface based on the [[Leaflet (software)|Leaflet]] JavaScript library (and formerly built on [[OpenLayers]]), displaying map tiles rendered by the Mapnik rendering engine, and tiles from other sources including OpenCycleMap.org.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opencyclemap.org |title=OpenCycleMap.org – the OpenStreetMap Cycle Map |website=opencyclemap.org}}</ref>

Custom maps can also be generated from OSM data through various software including Jawg Maps, [[Mapnik]], Mapbox Studio, [[Mapzen]]'s Tangrams.

OpenStreetMap maintains lists of online and offline routing engines available, such as the [[Open Source Routing Machine]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Filney |first=Klint |title=Out in the Open: How to Get Google Maps Directions Without Google |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/11/osrm |access-date=11 November 2013 |newspaper=Wired |date=11 November 2013}}</ref> OSM data is popular with routing researchers, and is also available to open-source projects and companies to build routing applications (or for any other purpose).

===Humanitarian aid===
{{See also|Crisis mapping|Smart mob|Ushahidi}}
[[File:Openstreetmap Philippines GPS Map by Schadow1 Expeditions.jpg|thumb|OpenStreetMap Philippines GPS map, an end-product of over a thousand crisis mappers that contributed almost 5 million map updates during the 2013 Haiyan humanitarian activation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors|title=OpenStreetMap Activities for Typhoon Haiyan (2013)|website=Neis-one.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721191839/http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors|archive-date=21 July 2018|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref>]]

The [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] has established a model for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to collaborate with international organisations. OpenStreetMap and Crisis Commons volunteers using available satellite imagery to map the roads, buildings and refugee camps of [[Port-au-Prince]] in just two days, building "the most complete digital map of Haiti's roads".<ref name="forbes" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://crisiscommons.org |title=CrisisCommons |website=CrisisCommons}}</ref><ref name="nytimes" />

The resulting data and maps have been used by several organisations providing relief aid, such as the [[World Bank]], the European Commission Joint Research Centre, the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], [[UNOSAT]] and others.<ref name="osm-wiki-haiti" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Andrew |title=World Bank Haiti Situation Room – featuring OSM |date=3 February 2010 |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/ajturner/4329833289/in/photostream/}}</ref><ref name="pbatty_video">{{cite web |last=Batty |first=Peter |title=OpenStreetMap in Haiti – video |date=14 February 2010 |url=http://geothought.blogspot.com/2010/02/openstreetmap-in-haiti-video.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=European Commission Joint Research Centre |title=Haiti Earthquakes: Infrastructure Port-au-Prince 15/01/2010 |date=15 January 2010 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025082950/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/jrc/downloads/jrc_pp_haiti_map_04.pdf |archive-date=25 October 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

NGOs, like the [[HOT-OSM|Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team]] and others, have worked with donors like [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) to map other parts of Haiti and parts of many other countries, both to create map data for places that were blank, and to engage and build capacity of local people.<ref>{{cite web |title=OSM Marks the SpotHaitians use a crowdsourced map to chart their own country, and its development |url=https://medium.com/medium-for-haiti/f4582ed41656 |publisher=medium.com|date=26 June 2013 }}</ref>

After Haiti, the OpenStreetMap community continued mapping to support humanitarian organisations for various crises and disasters. After the [[Northern Mali conflict]] (January 2013), [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in the Philippines (November 2013), and the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] (March 2014), the OpenStreetMap community has shown it can play a significant role in supporting humanitarian organisations.<ref>{{cite web |title=OSM 2012 Mali Crisis wiki page |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2012_Mali_Crisis |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Debora |last=MacKenzie |title=Social media helps aid efforts after typhoon Haiyan |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24565-social-media-helps-aid-efforts-after-typhoon-haiyan.html#.U-QaA2MmUro |date=12 November 2013 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Robinson |last=Meyer |title=How Online Mapmakers Are Helping the Red Cross Save Lives in the Philippines |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/how-online-mapmakers-are-helping-the-red-cross-save-lives-in-the-philippines/281366/ |date=12 November 2013 |access-date=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Nuviun |title=How the Internet is Stopping the Ebola Outbreak, One Street Map at a Time |url=http://nuviun.com/content/blog/How-the-Internet-is-Stopping-the-Ebola-Outbreak-One-Street-Map-at-a-Time |access-date=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019042927/http://nuviun.com/content/blog/How-the-Internet-is-Stopping-the-Ebola-Outbreak-One-Street-Map-at-a-Time |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team acts as an interface between the OpenStreetMap community and the humanitarian organisations.

Along with post-disaster work, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team has worked to build better risk models and grow the local OpenStreetMap communities in multiple countries including [[Uganda]], [[Senegal]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in partnership with the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], [[World Bank]], and other humanitarian groups.<ref>{{cite web |title=Preventative Mapping in Uganda with the Red Cross |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-08-21_preventative_mapping_in_uganda_with_the_red_cross |work=Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Vyncke |first1=Jorieke |title=A week in Lubumbashi (DRC) |url=https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-04-01_a_week_in_lubumbashi_drc |access-date=31 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920192747/https://hotosm.org/updates/2014-04-01_a_week_in_lubumbashi_drc |archive-date=20 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Out and about in Yogyakarta, Indonesia: An OSM workshop sponsored by the World Bank |url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-07-13_out_and_about_in_yogyakarta_indonesia_an_osm_workshop_sponsored_by_the_world_bank |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

==Legal aspects==

===Licensing terms===
OpenStreetMap data was originally published under the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike licence (CC BY-SA) with the intention of promoting free use and redistribution of the data. In September 2012, the licence was changed to the [[Open Database License|Open Database Licence]] (ODbL) published by Open Data Commons (ODC) in order to more specifically define its bearing on data rather than representation.<ref name="ogd-Fairhurst" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence |title=Licence – OpenStreetMap Foundation |website=wiki.osmfoundation.org |language=en|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

As part of this relicensing process, some of the map data was removed from the public distribution. This included all data contributed by members that did not agree to the new licensing terms, as well as all subsequent edits to those affected objects. It also included any data contributed based on input data that was not compatible with the new terms. Estimates suggested that over 97% of data would be retained globally, however certain regions would be affected more than others, such as in Australia where 24 to 84% of objects would be retained, depending on the type of object.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://odbl.poole.ch |title=OSM V1 Objects ODbL acceptance statistics |first=Simon |last=Poole |access-date=21 May 2012}}</ref> Ultimately, more than 99% of the data was retained, with Australia and Poland being the countries most severely affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/ |title=Automated redactions complete |first=Harry |last=Wood |access-date=1 October 2012}}</ref>

All data added to the project needs to have a licence compatible with the Open Database Licence. This can include out-of-copyright information, public domain or other licences. Contributors agree to a [[OpenStreetmap:Copyright|set of terms]] which require compatibility with the current licence. This may involve examining licences for government data to establish whether it is compatible.

Software used in the production and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application{{nbsp}}{{mdash}} what users access to edit maps and view changelogs, is powered by [[Ruby on Rails]]. The application also uses [[PostgreSQL]] for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by [[Mapnik]], stored in [[PostGIS]], and powered by an [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] module called ''mod_tile''. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch2]], have been made available as [[public domain]].<ref name="osm-wiki-legalfaq" />

===Commercial data contributions===
Some OpenStreetMap data is supplied by companies that choose to freely license either actual street data or satellite imagery sources from which OSM contributors can trace roads and features.

Notably, [[Automotive Navigation Data]] provided a complete road data set for Netherlands and details of trunk roads in China and India. In December 2006, [[Yahoo!]] confirmed that OpenStreetMap was able to make use of their vertical aerial imagery and this photography was available within the editing software as an overlay. Contributors could create their vector based maps as a derived work, released with a [[free content license|free]] and [[open content license|open]] licence,<ref name="ogd-Coast1" /> until the shutdown of the Yahoo! Maps API on 13 September 2011.<ref name="yahoo-maps-close" /> In November 2010, [[Microsoft]] announced that the OpenStreetMap community could use Bing vertical aerial imagery as a backdrop in its editors.<ref name="ogd-Coast2" /> For a period from 2009 to 2011, [[NearMap|NearMap Pty Ltd]] made their high-resolution PhotoMaps (of major Australian cities, plus some rural Australian areas) available for deriving OpenStreetMap data under a [[CC BY-SA]] licence.<ref name="nearmap" />

In June 2018, the Microsoft Bing team announced a major contribution of 125 million U.S. building footprints to the project – four times the number contributed by users and government data imports.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/microsoft-releases-building-footprints/|title=Microsoft releases more than 100 million Building Footprints in the US as open data|date=2018-07-03|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data|title=Microsoft Releases 125 million Building Footprints in the US as Open Data|website=blogs.bing.com|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>

==Operation==
While OpenStreetMap aims to be a central data source, its map rendering and aesthetics are meant to be only one of many options, some which highlight different elements of the map or emphasise design and performance.

===Data format===
OpenStreetMap uses a [[topology|topological]] [[graph (discrete mathematics)|data structure]], with four core elements (also known as ''data primitives''):
* ''Nodes'' are points with a geographic position, stored as coordinates (pairs of a [[latitude]] and a [[longitude]]) according to [[WGS 84]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WGS_84 WGS 84] ''OpenStreetMap Wiki''</ref> Outside of their usage in ways, they are used to represent map features without a size, such as [[point of interest|points of interest]] or mountain peaks.
* ''Ways'' are ordered lists of ''nodes'', representing a [[polyline]], or possibly a [[polygon]] if they form a closed loop. They are used both for representing linear features such as streets and rivers, and areas, like forests, parks, parking areas and lakes.
* ''Relations'' are ordered lists of nodes, ways and relations (together called "members"), where each member can optionally have a "role" (a string). Relations are used for representing the relationship of existing nodes and ways. Examples include turn restrictions on roads, routes that span several existing ways (for instance, a long-distance motorway), and areas with holes.
* ''[[Tag (metadata)|Tags]]'' are key-value pairs (both arbitrary strings). They are used to store [[metadata]] about the map objects (such as their type, their name and their physical properties). Tags are not free-standing, but are always attached to an object: to a node, a way or a relation. A recommended [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of map features (the meaning of ''tags'') is [[openstreetmap:Map features|maintained on a wiki]]. New tagging schemes can always be proposed by a [[OpenStreetmap:Proposal process|popular vote of a written proposal]] in OpenStreetMap wiki, however, there is no requirement to follow this process. There are over 89 million different kinds of tags in use as of June 2017.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mocnik|first1=Franz-Benjamin|last2=Zipf|first2=Alexander|last3=Raifer|first3=Martin|title=The OpenStreetMap folksonomy and its evolution|journal=Geo-spatial Information Science|date=18 September 2017|volume=20|issue=3|pages=219–230|doi=10.1080/10095020.2017.1368193|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Data storage===
The OSM data primitives are stored and processed in different formats.

The main copy of the OSM data is stored in OSM's main database. The main database is a [[PostgreSQL]] database with [[PostGIS]] extension, which has one table for each data primitive, with individual objects stored as rows.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenStreetMap Wiki: Database |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Database |website=OpenStreetMap |access-date=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Databases_and_data_access_APIs |title=Databases and data access APIs |access-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> All edits happen in this database, and all other formats are created from it.

For data transfer, several database dumps are created, which are available for download. The complete dump is called [[Openstreetmap:planet.osm|planet.osm]]. These dumps exist in two formats, one using [[XML]] and one using the [[Protocol Buffers|Protocol Buffer Binary Format]] (PBF).

=== Popular services ===

[[Image:Moovit Navigate 3.0.png|thumb|upright|Moovit Navigate]]

A variety of popular services incorporate some sort of [[geolocation]] or map-based component. Notable services using OSM for this include:

* [[Apple Inc.]] unexpectedly created an OpenStreetMap-based map for [[IPhoto#iOS version|iPhoto for iOS]] on {{Start date|df=yes|2012|03|07}}, and launched the maps without properly citing the data source – though this was corrected in 1.0.1. OpenStreetMap is one of the many cited sources for Apple's custom maps in [[iOS]] 6, though the majority of map data is provided by [[TomTom]].
* [[Craigslist]] switched to OpenStreetMap in 2012, rendering their own tiles based on the data.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |title=Craigslist quietly switching to OpenStreetMap data |url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/08/28/craigslist-open-street-map/ |access-date=12 November 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=28 August 2012}}</ref>

* [[Hasbro]], the toy company behind the real estate-themed [[board game]] ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', launched ''[[Monopoly City Streets]]'', a [[massively multiplayer online game]] (MMORPG) which allowed players to "buy" streets all over the world. The game used map tiles from Google Maps and the Google Maps API to display the game board, but the underlying street data was obtained from OpenStreetMap.<ref name="pcworld" /> The online game was a limited time offering, its servers were shut down in the end of January 2010.<ref name="BBC-Monopoly" />
