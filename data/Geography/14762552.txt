Listed below are known African [[empire]]s and their respective capital cities.

==Sahelian kingdoms==
{{main|Sahelian kingdoms}}
[[File:Mapa mali.svg|thumb|[[Mali Empire]] circa 1350]]

The Sahelian kingdoms were a series of medieval empires centred on the [[Sahel]], the area of grasslands south of the [[Sahara]].

* The first major state to rise in this region was the [[Ghana Empire|Ghana Empire (Wagadu)]].  The name Ghana, often used by historians, was the regnal title given to the ruler of the Wagadu empire.<ref name="The Civilizations of Africa">{{cite book|title=The Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 |isbn=081392085X|author1=Ehret|first1=Christopher |year=2002}}</ref>  Centered in what is today [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]], it was the first to benefit from the introduction of gold mining.  Ghana dominated the region between about 750 and 1078.  Smaller states in the region at this time included [[Takrur]] to the west, the [[Malinke]] kingdom of Mali to the south, and the [[Songhai Empire]]  centred on [[Gao]] to the east.
* When Ghana collapsed in the face of invasion from the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a series of brief kingdoms followed, notably that of the [[Sosso|Sosso (Susu)]]; after 1235, the [[Mali Empire]] rose to dominate the region.  Located on the [[Niger River]] to the west of Ghana in what is today [[Niger]] and [[Mali]], it reached its peak in the 1350s, but had lost control of a number of vassal states by 1400.
* The most powerful of these states was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded rapidly beginning with king [[Sonni Ali]] in the 1460s. By 1500, it had risen to stretch from [[Cameroon]] to the [[Maghreb]], the largest state in African history.  It too was quite short-lived and collapsed in 1591 as a result of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[musket]]ry.
* Far to the east, on [[Lake Chad]], the state of [[Bornu Empire|Kanem-Bornu]], founded as Kanem in the 9th century, now rose to greater preeminence in the central Sahel region. To their west, the loosely united [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city-states became dominant.  These two states coexisted uneasily, but were quite stable.
* In 1810, the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] rose and conquered the Hausa, creating a more centralized state.  It and Kanem-Bornu would continue to exist until the arrival of Europeans, when both states would fall and the region would be divided between [[France]] and [[Great Britain]].
* The  [[Jolof Empire]] ruled parts of [[Senegal]] from 1350 to 1549. After 1549, its vassal states were fully or ''de facto'' independent; in this period it is known as the [[Jolof Kingdom]]. It was largely conquered by the [[imamate of Futa Jallon]] in 1875 and its territories fully incorporated into [[French West Africa]] by 1890.

==Empires of 15th–19th century Africa==
From the 15th century until the final [[Scramble for Africa]] in the late 19th century a number of empires were also established south of the Sahel, especially in [[West Africa]].

===West Africa===
{{further|History of West Africa#Iron Age}}

The West African empires of this period peaked in power in the late 18th century, paralleling the peak of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. These empires implemented a culture of permanent warfare in order to generate the required numbers of captives required to satisfy the demand for slaves by the European colonies.  With the gradual [[abolitionism|abolition]] of slavery in the European colonial empires during the 19th century, slave trade again became less lucrative and the West African empires entered a period of decline, and mostly collapsed by the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm|title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade|last=Bortolot|first=Alexander Ives|date=May 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

* The  [[Kingdom of Dagbon]] was founded by the Red Hunter [[Tohazee]] circa 11th Century. The Kingdom is one of the largest and oldest in modern Ghana. The capital city of the Kingdom is [[Yendi]] and the largest settlement is the City of [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]]. 
* The [[Nok culture|Nok Civilization]] is considered to be one of the most advanced ancient sub-Saharan civilizations in African history. {{cn|date=December 2019}}Beginning some time around 1500 BC, it was largely concentrated in what is now Nigeria but produced some of the first sub-Saharan iron smelting and [[terracotta]] architecture. Mysteriously died out around 200 AD.
* The [[Kingdom of Nri]] (1043–1911) was the [[West Africa]]n medieval state of the [[Nri-Igbo]], a subgroup of the [[Igbo people]], and is the oldest kingdom in [[Nigeria]]. The Kingdom of Nri was unusual in the history of world government in that its leader exercised no military power over his subjects. The kingdom existed as a sphere of religious and political influence over much of [[Igboland]], and was administered by a [[priest]]-[[king]] called the [[eze Nri]]. The eze Nri managed trade and diplomacy on behalf of the Igbo people, and was the possessor of divine authority in religious matters.
* The [[Oyo Empire]] (1400–1895) was a [[West African]] empire of what is today western [[Nigeria]]. The empire was established by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] in the 15th century and grew to become one of the largest West African states. It rose to prominence through wealth gained from trade and its possession of a powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the region from the mid-17th to the late 18th century, holding sway not only over other Yoruba states, but also over the [[Fon people|Fon]] kingdom of [[Dahomey]] (located in the state now known as the [[Benin|Republic of Benin]]).
* [[Benin Empire]] (1240–1897), a pre-colonial African empire of modern [[Nigeria]]. The empire once stretched to present day Ghana ruled by sky kings ( OGISO ) in the first dynasty and by OBAS in the second dynasty. It was the first kingdom to come in contact with the Europeans. 
* [[Kaabu|Kaabu Empire]] (1537–1867), a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] Kingdom of [[Senegambia]] (centered on modern northeastern [[Guinea-Bissau]] but extending into [[Casamance]], [[Senegal]]) that rose to prominence in the region thanks to its origins as a former province of the [[Mali Empire]]. After the decline of the Mali Empire, Kaabu became an independent kingdom.
* [[Aro Confederacy]] (1690–1902), a trading union orchestrated by the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] subgroup, the [[Aro people]], centered in [[Arochukwu]] in present-day Southeastern [[Nigeria]].
* [[Bonoman]] (11th century–19th century), earliest known Akan state.  Gold trading and Kola nut trading with Northern Neighbors brought wealth and prosperity to Akan creators of this state. Culture influenced much of modern Akan culture.
*  [[Ashanti Empire]] (1701–1894), a pre-colonial Akan West African state of what is now the [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti]] Region in [[Ghana]]. The empire stretched from central [[Ghana]] to present day [[Togo]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]], bordered by the [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] kingdom to the north and [[Dahomey]] to the east. Today, the [[List of rulers of Asante|Ashanti monarchy]] continues as one of the constitutionally protected, sub-national traditional states within the Republic of Ghana.
* Various states by [[Akan people]] (11th century–19th century)
* [[Kong Empire]] (1710–1898)  centered in north eastern [[Côte d'Ivoire]] that also encompassed much of present-day [[Burkina Faso]].
* [[Bamana Empire]] (1712–1896) based at [[Ségou]], now in [[Mali]].  It was ruled by the Kulubali or Coulibaly dynasty established c. 1640 by [[Fa Sine]] also known as [[Biton-si-u]]. The empire existed as a centralized state from 1712 to the 1861 invasion of [[Toucouleur Empire|Toucouleur]] conqueror El Hadj [[Umar Tall]].
* [[Sokoto Caliphate]] (1804–1903), an Islamic empire in [[Nigeria]], led by the [[Sultan of Sokoto]], [[Sa'adu Abubakar]]. Founded during the [[Fulani Jihad]] in the early 19th century, it was one of the most powerful empires in sub-Saharan Africa prior to European conquest and colonization. The caliphate remained extant through the colonial period and afterwards, though with reduced power.
* [[Wassoulou Empire]] (1878–1898), a short-lived empire built from the conquests of [[Dyula people|Dyula]] ruler [[Samori|Samori Ture]] and destroyed by the French colonial army.

===Central Africa===
{{further|Central Africa#History}}
* The [[Kongo Kingdom]] (1400–1888) was a quasi-imperial state as is evident by the number of people and kingdoms that paid it tribute. If not for the large amount of text written by the EssiKongo that repeatedly called themselves a kingdom, they would be listed as the "Kongo Empire".
* The [[Luba Empire]] (1585–1885) arose in the marshy grasslands of the [[Upemba Depression]] in what is now southern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].
* [[Lunda Empire]] (1660–1887) in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], north-eastern [[Angola]] and northwestern [[Zambia]]. Its central state was in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]].
* [[Central African Empire]] (1976–79) was a short-lived and self-stylised 'Imperial' [[one-party state]] ruled by an [[absolute monarch]] that replaced the [[Central African Republic]] and was, in turn, replaced by the restoration of the Republic.

===Southern Africa===
{{further|History of Southern Africa}}
The [[Mutapa Empire]] or Empire of Great Zimbabwe (1450–1629) was a medieval kingdom located between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers of [[Southern Africa]] in the modern states of [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. Remnants of the historical capital are found in the ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]].

* [[Zulu Kingdom]]
* [[Maravi Empire]] or Marawi or Merowi or Merowe/ Meroe Empire. Not to be confused with Ancient [[Meroe]].
* [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]]

===East Africa===
{{further|East Africa#History}}

* An [[Empire of Kitara]] in the area of the [[African Great Lakes]] has long been treated as a historical entity, but is now mostly considered an unhistorical narrative created as a response to the dawn of rule under the [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Lwo]] empire. The latter is the sole historical record of an organized [[Nilotic]] migration into the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chrétien|first=Jean-Pierre|author2=Scott Strauss|title=The Great Lakes of Africa: Two Thousand Years of History|publisher=MIT Press|date=October 2006}}</ref>
* The [[Kingdom of Buganda|Buganda]] (1300–present), home of the [[Buganda|Buganda people]] of [[Uganda]]
* The medieval [[Swahili culture|Swahili city-states]]

==Comparison==
[[Jan Vansina|Vansina]] (1962) discusses the classification of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n kingdoms, mostly of Central, South and East Africa, with some additional data on West African (Sahelian) kingdoms distinguishing five types, by decreasing centralization of power:

# '''[[Despotic]] kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king controls the internal and external affairs directly. Examples are Ruanda, Nkore, Soga and Kongo in the 16th century
# '''Regal kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king controls the external affairs directly, and the internal affairs via a system of overseers. The king and his chiefs belong to the same clans or lineages.
# '''Incorporative kingdoms''': Kingdoms where the king controls only the external affairs with no permanent administrative links between him and the chiefs of the provinces. The hereditary chiefdoms of the provinces were left undisturbed after conquest. Examples are the Bamileke, Lunda, Luba, Lozi.
# '''Aristocratic kingdoms''': The only link between central authority and the provinces is payment of [[tribute]]. These kingdoms are morphologically intermediate between regal kingdoms and federations. This type is rather common in Africa, examples including the Kongo of the 17th century, the Cazembe, Luapula, Kuba, Ngonde, Mlanje, Ha, Zinza and Chagga states of the 18th century
# '''Federations''': Kingdoms (such as the [[Ashanti Union]]) where the external affairs are regulated by a council of elders headed by the king, who is simply ''primus inter pares''.
