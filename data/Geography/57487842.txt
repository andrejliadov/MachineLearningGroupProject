'''Valentine Seaman''' (April 2, 1770 – July 3, 1817) was an American physician who introduced the smallpox vaccine to the United States and mapped [[yellow fever]] in New York City. His contributions to public health also include women's education in nursing and midwifery.

==Public health work==
Seaman was an attending surgeon at [[New York Hospital]] from 1796 until his death. He is best known for mapping the spread of yellow fever in New York City and introducing the smallpox vaccination to the United States.

===Mapping of yellow fever===
[[File:Valentine Seaman's map of yellow fever epidemic in New York City (Plate 2 of 2).jpg|alt=Book page with engraved map of a city dock, with marks denoting yellow fever cases and waste sites|thumb|Seaman's map (plate 2 of 2), with yellow fever cases marked with dots and waste sites marked with S's and crosses]]
In 1795, [[yellow fever]] broke out in New York City. At the time, it was not known how yellow fever spread; some blamed incoming ships from the tropics. As the fever spread, Seaman mapped each case he could find in the New Slip area, marking which cases were fatal. He then mapped local waste sites, compared the two maps, and concluded that yellow fever originated in these waste areas. (While he did note that mosquitoes were present at the waste sites, he did not identify them correctly as the vectors for the disease.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Human Geography|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalenc07thri|url-access=limited|last=Koch|first=T.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Kitchin|editor-first=Rob|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/internationalenc07thri/page/n314 234]–241|chapter=Disease Mapping|editor-last2=Thrift|editor-first2=Nigel}}</ref> He wrote, in a 1796 account of the epidemic, that he was indebted to Benjamin Rush for "innovations in the treatment of the Epidemic Fever of Philadelphia of 1793." The city's Committee of Health asked for his advice regarding the disease's cause and prevention; Seaman recommended filling in areas that were below sea-level and wherever water tended to stagnate, cleaning and paving streets, covering sewers, and filling in the areas beneath granaries and docks.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/2571027R.nlm.nih.gov|title=An account of the epidemic yellow fever, as it appeared in the city of New-York in the year 1795: containing, besides its history, &c., the most probable means of preventing its return, and of avoiding it, in case it should again become epidemic|last=Seaman|first=Valentine|date=1796|publisher=Hopkins, Webb & Co.|others=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}</ref> A fuller account and the maps he created were published in ''An Inquiry into the Cause of the Prevalence of the Yellow Fever in New-York'' in 1798.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/101290761.nlm.nih.gov|title=An inquiry into the cause of the prevalence of the yellow fever in New-York|last=Seaman|first=Valentine|date=1798|publisher=T. and J. Swords|others=U.S. National Library of Medicine}}</ref>

===Introduction of vaccination to the United States===
His first child died of [[smallpox]] in 1795, a tragedy that spurred Seaman to identify preventative measures. At the time, vaccinations were not understood or trusted in the United States. [[Edward Jenner]], a British physician, had just introduced vaccination in England. Seaman acquired the vaccination serum from Jenner and, in 1799, successfully vaccinated his own children with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.weill.cornell.edu/newyork-presbyterian-hospitalweill-cornell|title=History of the Institutions, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell {{!}} Weill Cornell Medicine, Samuel J.

In 1802, he coordinated a system to provide free vaccinations to the poor in New York City.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation|last=Morman|first=Edward T.|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Finkelman|editor-first=Paul|location=|pages=207–208|chapter=Smallpox}}</ref>

===Education===
Seaman taught medicine as well, focusing in particular on women's education. In 1798-9, Seaman founded the first instructional classes for nurses at New York Hospital, which continued until 1817.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/stats/representation.htm|title=Missouri Women in the Health Sciences – By the Numbers – Changing Representation of Women in Health Professions|website=beckerexhibits.wustl.edu|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.weill.cornell.edu/nursing-collections-medical-center-archives|title=Nursing collections at the Medical Center Archives {{!}} Weill Cornell Medicine Samuel J.

He wrote ''The Midwives Monitor'' in 1800 for their instruction.<ref name="memorialhistory"/>

==Legacy==
Seaman, a [[Quakers|Quaker]], was against slavery and was a member of the [[New York Manumission Society]], which advocated for the abolition of slavery in New York state.<ref name="memorialhistory"/><ref name="princeton"/>

He died at the age of 47 from [[tuberculosis]], leaving behind a legacy of public health innovations and advocacy.<ref name="princeton"/>

He had 10 children, including John Ferris Seaman and Valentine Seaman (the younger), who owned an estate in 1855 in the [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]] area of upper Manhattan. There, they constructed "Seaman's Folly," including a castle and a structure now known as the [[Seaman-Drake Arch]].<ref name="newyorker"/>

His papers (from 1795–1817) are housed at the Samuel J. Wood Library at [[Weill Cornell Medicine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.weill.cornell.edu/seaman-valentine-md-1770-1817|title=Seaman, Valentine, MD (1770–1817) {{!}} Weill Cornell Medicine Samuel J.
