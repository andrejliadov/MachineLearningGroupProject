The '''Far East ''' is a geographical region that includes the Russian Far East, Eastern and Southeastern Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/fareast?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, & Grammar|work=askoxford.com}}</ref> [[South Asia]] is sometimes also included for economic and cultural reasons.<ref>[http://www.feer.com/ The 'Far Eastern Economic Review' for example covers news from India and Sri Lanka.]</ref> The term "Far East" came into use in [[Europe]]an geopolitical discourse in the 12th century, denoting the Far East as the "farthest" of the three "easts", beyond the [[Near East]] and the [[Middle East]]. Likewise, in [[Qing Dynasty]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries the term "[[Far West (Taixi)|Tàixī]] ({{lang|zh|泰西}})" – i.e., anything further west than the [[Arab world]] – was used to refer to the [[Western world|Western]] countries.

Since the 1960s, East Asia has become the most common term for the region in international [[mass media]] outlets.<ref name="Economist">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15213613|title=A menagerie of monikers|date=7 January 2010|accessdate=9 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}</ref><ref name="Reischauer 1960">Reischauer, Edwin and John K Fairbank, ''East Asia: The Great Tradition,'' 1960.</ref>

As in relating to the remoteness of the territory from Europe, the term ''Far East'' informs of an [[Eurocentric]] worldview.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-19-1981/fields.pdf|title=The eurocentric worldview: misunderstanding East Asia|first=Larry|last=Fields|page=40|journal=Asian Studies|year=1981|volume=19}}</ref>

== Popularization ==
Among [[Western Europe]]ans, prior to the [[colonial era]], "Far East" referred to anything further east than the Middle East. In the 16th century, [[King John III of Portugal]] called [[India]] a "rich and interesting country in the Far East<ref>{{cite book|title=A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar; A Contribution to the History of India|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenempire00robe|author=Robert Sewell|year=1901}}</ref> (''Extremo Oriente'')." The term was popularized during the period of the [[British Empire]] as a blanket term for lands to the east of [[British Raj|British India]].

In pre-[[World War I]] European geopolitics, the ''[[Near East]]'' referred to the relatively nearby lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ''[[Middle East]]'' denoted northwestern [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]], and the ''Far East'' meant countries along the western [[Pacific Ocean]] and eastern [[Indian Ocean]]. Many European languages have analogous terms, such as the [[French language|French]] (''{{lang|fr|[[:fr:Extrême-Orient|Extrême-Orient]]}}''), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''{{lang|es|[[:es:Lejano Oriente|Lejano Oriente]]}}''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''{{lang|pt|[[:pt:Extremo Oriente|Extremo Oriente]]}}''), [[German language|German]] (''{{lang|de|[[:de:Ferner Osten|Ferner Osten]]}}''), [[Italian language|Italian]] (''{{lang|it|[[:it:Estremo Oriente|Estremo Oriente]]}}''), [[Polish language|Polish]] (''{{lang|pl|[[:pl:Daleki Wschód|Daleki Wschód]]}}''), [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (''{{lang|no|[[:no:Det fjerne Østen|Det fjerne Østen]]}}'') and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (''{{lang|nl|[[:nl:Verre Oosten|Verre Oosten]]}}'').

== Cultural as well as geographic meaning ==
Significantly, the term evokes cultural as well as geographic separation; the ''Far East'' is not just geographically distant, but also culturally exotic. It never refers, for instance, to the culturally Western nations of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], which lie even farther to the east of Europe than East Asia itself. This combination of cultural and geographic subjectivity was well illustrated in 1939 by [[Robert Menzies]], a [[Prime Minister of Australia]]. Reflecting on his country's geopolitical concerns with the onset of [[World War II|war]], Menzies commented that: 
<blockquote> The problems of the Pacific are different. What Great Britain calls the Far East is to us the Near North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/2~73|title=Historical documents|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade}}</ref> </blockquote>

''Far East'' in its usual sense is comparable to terms such as ''the [[Orient]]'', which means [[East]]; the ''[[Eastern world]]''; or simply the ''East''. [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Russian Far East]], and occasionally [[South Asia]] might be included in the Far East to some extent.

Concerning the term, [[John K. Fairbank]] and [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], professors of East Asian Studies at [[Harvard University]], wrote (in ''East Asia: The Great Tradition''):
{{quote|When Europeans traveled far to the east to reach [[Cathay]], Japan and the [[East Indies|Indies]], they naturally gave those distant regions the general name 'Far East.' Americans who reached China, Japan and Southeast Asia by sail and steam across the Pacific could, with equal logic, have called that area the 'Far West.' For the people who live in that part of the world, however, it is neither 'East' nor 'West' and certainly not 'Far.' A more generally acceptable term for the area is 'East Asia,' which is geographically more precise and does not imply the outdated notion that Europe is the center of the civilized world.<ref name="Reischauer 1960"/>}}

Today, the term remains in the names of some longstanding institutions, including the [[Far Eastern Federal University]] in [[Vladivostok]], [[Far Eastern University]] in [[Manila]], the [[Far East University (Korea)|Far East University]] in [[South Korea]], and ''Far East'', the periodical magazine of the [[Missionary Society of St. Columban]]. Furthermore, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] have historically used ''Far East'' for several military units and commands in the region; the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Far East Fleet]], for instance.
