The era of '''European and American voyages of scientific exploration''' followed the [[Age of Discovery]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Brosse|1983|pp=9–11}}</ref> and were inspired by a new confidence in science and reason that arose in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Maritime expeditions in the Age of Discovery were a means of expanding colonial empires, establishing new trade routes and extending diplomatic and trade relations to new territories, but with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] scientific curiosity became a new motive for exploration to add to the commercial and political ambitions of the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/age_of_enlightenment.htm|title=The age of Enlightenment|author=Hackett, Louis|year=1992|accessdate=6 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110022535/http://history-world.org/age_of_enlightenment.htm|archive-date=10 January 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> See also [[List of Arctic expeditions]] and [[List of Antarctic expeditions]].

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery==
From the early 15th century to the early 17th century the Age of Discovery had, through Spanish and Portuguese seafarers, opened up southern Africa, the Americas (New World), Asia and Oceania to European eyes: [[Bartholomew Dias]] had sailed around the Cape of southern Africa in search of a trade route to India; [[Christopher Columbus]], on four journeys across the Atlantic, had prepared the way for European colonisation of the New World; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] had commanded the first expedition to sail across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans to reach the [[Maluku Islands]] and was continued by [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth. During the 17th century the naval hegemony started to shift from the Portuguese and Spanish to the Dutch and then the British and French. The new era of scientific exploration began in the late 17th century as scientists, and in particular natural historians, established scientific societies that published their researches in specialist journals. The British [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660 and encouraged the scientific rigour of empiricism with its principles of careful observation and deduction. Activities of early members of the Royal Society served as models for later maritime exploration. [[Hans Sloane]] (1650–1753) was elected a member in 1685 and travelled to Jamaica from 1687 to 1689 as physician to the [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]] (1653–1688) who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica. In Jamaica Sloane collected numerous specimens which were carefully described and illustrated in a published account of his stay.<ref>See{{Harvnb|Sloane|1707–1725}}</ref> Sloane bequeathed his vast collection of natural history 'curiosities' and library of over 50,000 bound volumes to the nation, prompting the establishment in 1753 of the [[British Museum]]. His travels also made him an extremely wealthy man as he patented a recipe that combined milk with the fruit of ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' (cocoa) he saw growing in Jamaica, to produce milk chocolate.  Books of distinguished social figures like the intellectual commentator [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], Director of the [[Paris Museum of Natural History]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], and scientist-travellers like [[Joseph Banks]], and [[Charles Darwin]], along with the romantic and often fanciful [[travelogue (literature)|travelogues]] of intrepid explorers, increased the desire of European governments and the general public for accurate information about the newly discovered distant lands.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Speake|2003}}</ref>

One of the earliest French expeditions on the coasts of Africa, South America and through the [[Strait of Magellan]] was made by a squadron of French [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]] under the command of M. de Gennes in 1695–97. The young French explorer, engineer and hydrographer François Froger described this expedition in his ''[[A Relation of a Voyage]]'' (1699).

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Enlightenment==
By the 18th century maritime exploration had become safer and more efficient with technical innovations that vastly improved navigation and cartography: improvements were made to the [[theodolite]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]], precision clocks, as well as the [[compass]], [[telescope]], and general [[shipbuilding]] techniques.
From the mid-18th century through the 19th century scientific missions mapped the newly discovered regions, brought back to Europe the newly discovered [[fauna]] and [[flora]], made hydrological, astronomical and meteorological observations and improved the methods of navigation. This stimulated great advances in the scientific disciplines of [[natural history]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[ichthyology]], [[conchology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[medicine]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]] etc. – all contributing to the sense of "improvement" and "progress" that characterized the Enlightenment. Artists were used to record landscapes and indigenous peoples, while natural history illustrators captured the appearance of organisms before they deteriorated after collection.<ref name="Rice 2010 320">{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=320}}</ref> Some of the world's finest natural history illustrations were produced at this time and the illustrators changed from informed amateurs to fully trained professionals acutely aware of the need for scientific accuracy.<ref name="Rice 2010 10">{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=10}}</ref>

By the middle of the 19th century all of the world's major land masses, and most of the minor ones, had been discovered by Europeans and their coastlines charted.<ref name="Rice 2010 290">{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=290}}</ref> This marked the end of this phase of science as the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration#1873–76: HMS Challenger|''Challenger'' Expedition]] of 1872–1876 began exploring the deep seas beyond a depth of 20 or 30 meters. In spite of the growing community of scientists, for nearly 200 years science had been the preserve of wealthy amateurs, educated middle classes and clerics.<ref name="Rice 2010 320"/> At the start of the 18th century most voyages were privately organized and financed but by the second half of the century these scientific expeditions, like [[James Cook]]'s three Pacific voyages under the auspices of the British Admiralty, were instigated by government.<ref name="Rice 2010 10"/> In the late 19th century, when this phase of science was drawing to a close, it became possible to earn a living as a professional scientist although photography was beginning to replace the illustrators. The exploratory sailing ship had gradually evolved into the modern [[research vessel]]s. From now on maritime research in new European colonies in America, Africa, Australia, India and elsewhere, would be carried out by researchers within the occupied territories themselves.<ref name="Rice 2010 290"/>

=== Chronology of voyages ===
This compendium of voyages of scientific exploration provides an overview of maritime scientific research carried out at the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe.
Published journals and accounts are included with the individual voyages.

==== 1735–1739: French Geodesic Mission ====
The [[French Geodesic Mission]] was an 18th-century expedition to what is now [[Ecuador]] carried out for the purpose of measuring the roundness of the [[Earth]] and measuring the length of a degree of [[latitude]] at the [[Equator]]. The mission was one of the first [[geodesic]] (or geodetic) missions carried out under modern scientific principles, and the first major international scientific expedition.

==== 1764–1766: HMS ''Dolphin'' ====
[[File:HMS Dolphin 1751.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS ''Dolphin'']] at [[Tahiti]] in 1767]]
Considered the first scientific voyage undertaken by the Royal Navy, its primary purpose was the discovery of new lands in the South Atlantic Ocean. It was during this trip that several islands of the [[Tuamotu archipelago]] were discovered. {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}} was a 24-gun post ship launched in 1751 and used as a [[survey ship]] from 1764, making two [[circumnavigation]]s under the command of [[John Byron]] and [[Samuel Wallis]]. She was broken up in 1777.

** Captain: [[John Byron]] (1723–1786).
** Publications: J. Byron, ''A Voyage round the world.'' (London, 1767), translated into French the same year under the title ''Journey around the world in 1764 and 1765, on the English warship "The Dolphin", commissioned by Vice-Admiral Byron ...'' (Paris).

==== 1766–1768: HMS ''Dolphin'' and HMS ''Swallow'' ====
A circumnavigation by the English navigator [[Samuel Wallis]], on board HMS {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}}, accompanied by [[Philip Carteret]] on the consort ship HMS ''Swallow''. In August 1766, the two ships passed through the [[Strait of Magellan]]. In December 1766, conflicts between the two captains led to the separation of the ships. ''Dolphin'' reached [[Tahiti]] in June 1767. Samuel Wallis studied the customs of the Polynesians, reaching the [[Dutch East Indies]] at [[Jakarta|Batavia]], returning to London in May 1768. Meanwhile, Philip Carteret in ''Swallow'' explored and studied the [[Solomon Islands]], [[New Ireland (island)]] (now part of Papua New Guinea) and the islands of the Indonesian archipelago ([[Sulawesi]] among others). The expedition also stopped in Batavia from June to September 1768 and returned to London in March 1769.

** Captains: [[Samuel Wallis]] (1728–1795) (leader of the expedition), [[Philip Carteret]] (1733–1796) (Commander of ''Swallow'' which was separated from the ''Dolphin'' and returned to its point of departure a year later).

Ordered by [[Louis XV]], it is the first trip around the world initiated by the French. The discovery and description of [[Tahiti]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] in his trip will have a very significant impact on the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–78). The expedition was organised by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] and received the support of such prominent figures of the time as [[Charles de Brosses]] (1709–77), [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–88), [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] (1698–1759) and [[Jérôme Lalande]] (1732–1807).

An expedition to find the two vessels commanded by [[Jean-François de La Pérouse]] (1741–1788), and of which there was no news after they had left [[Port Jackson]] heading for southern [[Tasmania]] and southern Australia. The two captains of the search expedition both perished en route: Captain Kermadec died in May 1793 and Captain d'Entrecasteaux in July of the same year. The expedition was headed by a royalist, and heard of [[Reign of Terror|The Terror]] in France when putting into the Dutch colonies. The crew was arrested and collections of natural history confiscated and offered by the Dutch to the British. These were however, on the express request of the scientist [[Joseph Banks]] (1743–1820), returned to France.

==== 1791–1793: HMS ''Providence''====
The Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce offered a reward of fifty pounds for living [[breadfruit]] plants. Bligh completed this in {{HMS|Providence|1791|2}}, his second mission to collect breadfruit plants and other botanical specimens from the Pacific. These he transported to the West Indies, specimens being given to the [[Botanic Gardens St. Vincent|Royal Botanic Gardens in St. Vincent]]. This expedition was a success, returning to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens Kew]] with 1,283 plants including varieties of apple, pear, oranges and mangoes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In addition to these specimens, the expedition accomplished many observations and cartographic surveys in the South Seas.

====1791–1795: HMS ''Discovery'' and HMS ''Chatham''====
[[File:HMS Discovery 1789 Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} in 1789]]
{{Main|Vancouver Expedition}}
A mission to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and Pacific Northwest coast of America. In 1791, {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} left England with {{HMS|Chatham|1788|2}}. Both ships anchored at [[Cape Town]] before exploring the south coast of Australia. In King George Sound, the Discovery's naturalist and surgeon Archibald Menzies collected various plant species including ''[[Banksia grandis]]'', the first recording of the genus ''[[Banksia]]'' from Western Australia. The two ships sailed to Hawai{{okina}}i where Vancouver named Kamehameha I. Chatham and Discovery then sailed on to the Northwest Pacific. Over the course of the next four years, Vancouver surveyed the northern Pacific Ocean coast in Discovery wintering in Spanish California or Hawai{{okina}}i. Discovery's primary mission was to exert British sovereignty over this part of the Northwest Coast following the hand-over of the Spanish Fort San Miguel at Nootka Sound, although exploration in co-operation with the Spanish was seen as an important secondary objective. Exploration work was successful as relations with the Spanish went well; resupply in California was especially helpful. Vancouver and the Spanish commandant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra were on such good terms that the original name of Vancouver Island was actually ''Quadra and Vancouver's Island''.

Then located some land which was named ''Terre de Louis-Philippe'' (now called [[Graham Land]]), the [[Joinville Island group]] and ''Rosamel Island'' (now called [[Andersson Island]]. In poor shape the two ships headed for [[Talcahuano]] in Chile. Turning south they led for the first time some experiments to determine the approximate position of the [[South magnetic pole]], discovered the [[Terre Adélie]] on 20 January 1840 and landed two days later on an [[Débarquement Rock|islet]] of the [[Géologie Archipelago]] ({{coord|66|36|19|S|140|4|0|E|source:GNIS}}) 4&nbsp;km from the mainland to take mineral and animal samples.

==== 1838–1842: USS ''Vincennes'' and USS ''Peacock'' ====
[[File:Vincennes.jpg|thumb|USS ''Vincennes'' in Disappointment Bay, Antarctica, during the Wilkes expedition.]]
{{Main|United States Exploring Expedition}}
The "Wilkes Expedition", included [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], [[taxidermist]]s, artists and a [[philologist]] in the ships [[USS Vincennes (1826)|''Vincennes'']], [[USS Peacock (1828)|''Peacock'']], the [[brig]] [[USS Porpoise (1836)|''Porpoise'']], the store-ship [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], and two [[schooner]]s, [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']], and [[USS Flying Fish (1838)|''Flying Fish'']].

Departing [[Hampton Roads]] on 18 August 18, 1838, the expedition stopped at [[Madeira]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Argentina; visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], the [[Tuamotu]] Archipelago, [[Samoa]], and [[New South Wales]]. From Sydney, the fleet sailed into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] in December 1839 and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]" of which it sighted the coast on 25 January 1840. Next, the expedition visited [[Fiji]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1840. In July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on [[Malolo]], in [[Fiji]]. Wilkes retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man of Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident.

From December 1840 to March 1841, his men with [[native Hawaiian]] porters hauled a [[pendulum]] to the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] to measure gravity. He explored the west coast of North America, including the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Puget Sound]], the [[Columbia River]], [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento River]], in 1841.
The expedition returned by way of the [[Philippines]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Borneo]], Singapore, [[Polynesia]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching New York City on 10 June 1842. This was the first circumnavigation of the world funded by the Government of the United States and the last by a sailing vessel. The expedition was poorly prepared and of five vessels which left, only two returned to port. The natural history collections were very rich with 50,000 plant specimens (approximately 10&nbsp;000 species) and 4,000 specimens of animals (half being new species).

This British trip, sponsored by the [[Royal Society]], was to discover magnetic and geographic features of the [[Antarctic]]. The expedition was prepared with great care by James Clark Ross, already familiar with Polar navigation. The two ships left the United Kingdom on 19 September 1839, stopping to explore the [[Kerguelen Islands]] in 1840, and then on [[Tasmania]] to build a magnetic observatory for the Antarctic and to conduct cartographic work. [[Mount Erebus]] and the [[Ross Sea]] were discovered during this journey. After three attempts, Ross admitted that the [[South Magnetic Pole|magnetic pole]] lay in land that he could not reach. Following the footsteps of his uncle [[John Ross (explorer)|John Ross]], he performed the first deep sea surveys up to 4800 m (2677 [[fathom]]s), using ropes.

====1897–98: ''Lila and Mattie''====
Zoologist [[Walter Rothschild]] commissioned the Webster-Harris Expedition to the [[Galápagos Islands]] from June 1897 to February 1898. This expedition on the schooner ''Lila & Mattie'' is well-described in the 1983 book titled ''Dear Lord Rothschild'' by Miriam Rothschild. In the 1936 book ''Oceanic Birds of South America'' by Robert Cushman Murphy, Rollo Beck describes the seminal telegram from C.M Harris that started his long and important association with the Galápagos Islands. The original of this telegram is in the Rollo Beck Collection in the California Academy of Sciences Archives. There is also a photo from Beck's Sierra Nevada collecting trip in the archives of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology on the University of California, Berkeley campus. The story of buried treasure on Tower Island connected with this trip was apparently known to Captain Lindbridge during this voyage, but the information was not revealed until after the group had left Tower Island. This trip lasted from June 1897 to February 1898, after having started on a tragic note with the deaths of three of the original crew to Yellow Fever, and having to reconstitute the expedition in San Francisco, California.
