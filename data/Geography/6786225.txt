'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}</ref>

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

<math>I = const. \times d^{-2}</math> 
or
<math>I \propto 1/d^2</math>,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P.

.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.
