== Location ==
The Late Romanesque ruins of Schönburg Castle are on top of a mottled sandstone cliff by the [[Saale]] River, which is 40 metres high and declines sharply in the west. The castle was built with the local mottled [[sandstone]].

== History ==
The castle on top of the southern slopes of the Saale was erected as the most important castle in the 12th century on commission by the [[bishops]] of Naumburg. The bishops owned several castles within their territory to secure their assets. From 1158 at the latest, a free [[noble family]] that owned property around [[Naumburg]] named itself after the castle. It was first documented in 1137. Schönburg has been preserved to this day and is an example from the time of classical [[castle]] construction.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zur Geschichte und Baugeschichte der Schönburg, Burgenlandkreis.

== Architecture ==
All the walls, gates and parts of the [[Palas]] have retained their original substance from the High Middle Ages, as have parts of the interior like visible [[chimneys]] dated to 1220 and decorated windows. The [[architecture]] and decorations found here correspond to other monuments in the World Heritage nomination.<ref>{{cite book|title=Die Schönburg. Bischofsburg zu Naumburg.

== World Heritage Nomination ==
Schönburg Castle is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape “[[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]”. As a landmark the castle is an important part of the lines of sight connecting the [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.<ref group=note>The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.</ref>

The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.<ref>UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name="Bartlett">{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780140154092|url-access=registration|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}</ref>
