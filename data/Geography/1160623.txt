'''John Snow''' (15 March 1813 – 16 June 1858<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=John Snow |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Snow-British-physician |access-date=12 March 2018 |date=8 March 2018}}</ref>) was an English physician and a leader in the development of [[anaesthesia]] and [[Hygiene#Medical_hygiene|medical hygiene]]. He is considered one of the founders of modern [[epidemiology]], in part because of his work in tracing the source of a [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854]], which he curtailed by removing the handle of a water pump. Snow's findings inspired the adoption of anaesthesia as well as fundamental changes in the water and [[Great Stink|waste systems of London]], which led to similar changes in other cities, and a significant improvement in general [[public health]] around the world.<ref name=b1>{{cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Vinten-Johansen |first2=Howard |last2=Brody |first3=Nigel |last3=Paneth |first4=Stephen |last4=Rachman |first5=Michael |last5=Rip |title=Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_93j18W7cvwC&q=John++snow++St++Thomas%27s++hospital |publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2003 |page=30|quote=A Life of John Snow Peter Vinten-Johansen, Howard Brody, Nigel Paneth, Stephen ...

== Early life and education ==
Snow was born on 15 March 1813 in [[York]], England, the first of nine children born to William and Frances Snow in their [[North Street (York)|North Street]] home, and was baptised at [[All Saints' Church, North Street, York]]. His father was a labourer<ref>Wedding Record of William Snow and Frances Empson, Huntington All Saints, 24 May 1812</ref> who worked at a local coal yard, by the Ouse, constantly replenished from the Yorkshire coalfield by barges, but later was a farmer in a small village to the north of York.<ref>Census 1841</ref>

The neighbourhood was one of the poorest in the city, and was frequently in danger of flooding because of its proximity to the [[River Ouse, Yorkshire|River Ouse]]. Growing up, Snow experienced unsanitary conditions and contamination in his hometown. Most of the streets were unsanitary and the river was contaminated by runoff water from market squares, cemeteries and sewage.<ref name=":03">{{cite journal |pmc=1325279 |title=John Snow, MD: anaesthetist to the Queen of England and pioneer epidemiologist |journal=Proceedings (Baylor University.

[[File:allsaintsnorthstreetyork.jpg|thumb|left|[[All Saints' Church, North Street, York]], where Snow was baptised]]

From a young age, Snow demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics. In 1827, when he was 14, he obtained a medical apprenticeship with William Hardcastle in the area of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]. In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered [[1826–1837 cholera pandemic|a cholera epidemic]] for the first time in [[Killingworth]], a coal-mining village.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ball |first=Laura |year=2009 |title=Cholera and the Pump on Broad Street: The Life and Legacy of John Snow }}</ref> Snow treated many victims of the disease and thus gained experience. Eventually he adjusted to [[teetotalism]] and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an [[Temperance movement|abstinence pledge]] in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was “pure”.<ref name=":03"/> Between 1832 and 1835 Snow worked as an assistant to a [[colliery]] surgeon, first in [[Burnopfield]], County Durham, and then in [[Pateley Bridge]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. In October 1836 he enrolled at the [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunterian school of medicine]] on [[Great Windmill Street]], London.<ref>Thomas, KB.

== Career ==
In the  1830s,  Snow's colleague at the [[Newcastle Infirmary]] was surgeon [[Thomas  Michael  Greenhow]]. The surgeons worked together conducting research on England's [[cholera]]  epidemics, both continuing to do so for many years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tominey |first1=Camilla |title=The Duchess of Cambridge's Ancestor Would Have Led The Fight Against Covid 19 |url=https://www.pressreader.com/search?query=Greenhow%20Middleton%20&languages=en&groupBy=Language&hideSimilar=0&type=1&state=1 |access-date=28 June 2020 |agency=PressReader |location=UK  |work=Daily Telegraph| page =25|date=28 May 2020|quote=Based in Tynemouth, near Newcastle, Dr  Greenhow, his nephew Dr EH Greenhow and  Dr John Snow were founding members of the Royal Society of Medicine's Epidemiological Society in the 1850s....

In 1837, Snow began working at the [[Westminster Hospital]]. Admitted as a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the [[University of London]] in December 1844 and was admitted to the [[Royal College of Physicians]] in 1850. Snow was a founding member of the [[Epidemiological Society of London]] which was formed in May 1850 in response to the cholera outbreak of 1849.  By 1856, Snow and  Greenhow's nephew, [[Edward Headlam  Greenhow|Dr. E.H. Greenhow]] were some of a handful of esteemed medical men of the society who held discussions on this "dreadful scourge, the [[cholera]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/LESociety.html |title=London Epidemiology Society |publisher=UCLA |access-date=22 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Lancet London: A Journal of British and Foreign Medicine ..., Volume 1...

== Anaesthesia ==
[[File:Barker--John Snow--1847.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Snow by [[Thomas Jones Barker]] (detail), 1847, private collection]]
John Snow was one of the first physicians to study and calculate dosages for the use of [[Diethyl ether|ether]] and [[chloroform]] as surgical [[anaesthetic]]s, allowing patients to undergo surgical and [[obstetrics|obstetric]] procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. He designed the apparatus to safely administer ether to the patients and also designed a mask to administer chloroform.<ref>[http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/johnsnow.aspx John Snow (1813–58)]. sciencemuseum.org.uk</ref> He personally administered chloroform to [[Queen Victoria]] when she gave birth to the last two of her nine children, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Leopold]] in 1853 and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Beatrice]] in 1857 and was still not yet knighted,<ref>{{cite web |title=Anesthesia and Queen Victoria |work=John Snow |publisher=Department of Epidemiology [[UCLA School of Public Health]] |url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/victoria.html |access-date=21 August 2007}}</ref> leading to wider public acceptance of obstetric anaesthesia. Snow published an article on ether in 1847 entitled ''On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether''.<ref>Snow, John (1847) [http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/oninhalationvapourether.pdf On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether]. ph.ucla.edu</ref>  A longer version entitled ''On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration'' was published posthumously in 1858.<ref>Snow, John (1858) [https://archive.org/details/onchloroformothe1858snow On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration]. London: John Churchill</ref>

After finishing his medical studies in the [[University of London]], he earned his MD in 1844. Snow set up his practice at 54 Frith Street in Soho as a surgeon and general practitioner. John Snow contributed to a wide range of medical concerns including [[anaesthesiology]]. He was a member of the [[Westminster Medical Society]], an organisation dedicated to clinical and scientific demonstrations. Snow gained prestige and recognition all the while being able to experiment and pursue many of his scientific ideas. He was a speaker multiple times at the society's meetings and he also wrote and published articles. He was especially interested in patients with respiratory diseases and tested his hypothesis through animal studies. In 1841, he wrote, ''On Asphyxiation, and on the Resuscitation of Still-Born Children'', which is an article that discusses his discoveries on the physiology of neonatal respiration, oxygen consumption and the effects of body temperature change.<ref name=":12">{{cite journal |url=http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=1945835#81074985 |title=John Snow's Practice of Obstetric Anesthesia |last=Caton |first=Donald |journal=Anesthesiology: The Journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=247 |date=January 2000 }}</ref> Therefore, his interest in anaesthesia and breathing was evident since 1841 and beginning in 1843, Snow experimented with ether to see its effects on respiration.<ref name=":03"/> Only a year after ether was introduced to Britain, in 1847, he published a short work titled, ''On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether,'' which served as a guide for its use. At the same time, he worked on various papers that reported his clinical experience with anaesthesia, noting reactions, procedures and experiments.

Though he thoroughly worked with [[diethyl ether|ether]] as an anaesthetic, he never attempted to patent it; instead, he continued to work and publish written works on his observations and research. Within two years after ether was introduced, Snow was the most accomplished anaesthetist in Britain. London's principal surgeons suddenly wanted his assistance.<ref name=":03" />

John Snow studied [[chloroform]] as much as he studied ether, which was introduced in 1847 by [[James Young Simpson]], a Scottish obstetrician. He realised that chloroform was much more potent and required more attention and precision when administering it. Snow first realised this with Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old patient who died on 28 January 1848 after a surgical procedure that required the cutting of her toenail. She was administered chloroform by covering her face with a cloth dipped in the substance. However, she quickly lost pulse and died. After investigating her death and a couple of deaths that followed, he realized that chloroform had to be administered carefully and published his findings in a letter to ''The Lancet''.<ref name=":03"/>

=== Obstetric anaesthesia ===
Snow's work and findings were related to both [[anaesthesia]] and the practice of childbirth. His experience with [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, [[amylene]] and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby, they would only feel the first half of the contraction and be on the border of unconsciousness, but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person that was not the surgeon applied it.<ref name=":12"/>

The use of chloroform as an anaesthetic for childbirth was seen as unethical by many physicians and even the [[Church of England]]. However, on 7 April 1853, [[Queen Victoria]] asked John Snow to administer chloroform during the delivery of her eighth child. He then repeated the procedure for the delivery of her daughter three years later. Medical and religious acceptance of obstetrical anaesthesia came after in the 19th century.<ref name=":03"/>

== Cholera ==

[[File:Chol an.gif|thumb|300px|Map of a later cholera outbreak in London, in 1866]][[File:Choleramaplondon1866.png|thumb|right|300px|Legend for the map above]]
Snow was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases such as cholera and [[bubonic plague]] were caused by pollution or a noxious form of "bad air". The [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, so Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. He first published his theory in an 1849 essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'',<ref>{{ cite book | last=Snow | first=John | author-link=John Snow | year=1849 | title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera | place=London | publisher=John Churchill | url=https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/ext/cholera/PDF/0050707.pdf }}</ref> followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.<ref name="Snow 1855">{{ cite book | last=Snow | first=John | author-link=John Snow | year=1855 | title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera | edition=2nd | place=London | publisher=John Churchill | url=https://archive.org/stream/b28985266#page/n3/mode/2up }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Gunn, S.

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Henry Whitehead (priest)|Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle ([[Hand pump#Types|force rod]]). This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline:

{{quote|There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it.<ref name="Snow 1855" />{{rp|51–52}}}}

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854, drawn and lithographed by [[Charles Cheffins]].]]
Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that homes supplied by the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]], which was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]], had a cholera rate fourteen times that of those supplied by [[Lambeth Waterworks Company]], which obtained water from the upriver, cleaner [[Seething Wells]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Location of water companies |url=https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/watercompanies.html |website=www.ph.ucla.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Proof from Seething Wells |url=http://seethingwellswater.org/Proof_from_Seething_Wells.html |website=seethingwellswater.org}}</ref> Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.

Snow wrote:
{{quote|On proceeding to the spot, I found that nearly all the deaths had taken place within a short distance of the [Broad Street] pump. There were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another street-pump. In five of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they always sent to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street...

With regard to the deaths occurring in the locality belonging to the pump, there were 61 instances in which I was informed that the deceased persons used to drink the pump water from Broad Street, either constantly or occasionally...

The result of the inquiry, then, is, that there has been no particular outbreak or prevalence of cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well.

I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St James's parish, on the evening of the 7th inst [7 September], and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day.|John Snow|letter to the editor of the ''Medical Times and Gazette''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Snow |first1=John |title=The cholera near Golden-Square, and at Deptford |journal=The Medical Times and Gazette |date=1854 |volume=9 |pages=321–322 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044103087938&view=1up&seq=331 |series=2nd series}}; see p. 322.</ref>}}

[[File:John Snow memorial and pub.jpg|thumb|John Snow memorial and public house on [[Broadwick Street]], [[Soho]]]]
Researchers later discovered that this public well had been dug only {{convert|3|ft|m|sigfig=1}} from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak faecal bacteria. The cloth nappy of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.<ref>{{cite book |title=Seeing What Others Don't |last=Klein |first=Gary |year=2014 |isbn=978-1480592803 |pages=73}}</ref>

[[Thomas Shapter]] had conducted similar studies and used a point-based map for the study of cholera in [[Exeter]], seven years before John Snow, although this did not identify the water supply problem that was later held responsible.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shapter |first1=Thomas |title=The History of the Cholera in Exeter in 1832 |date=1849 |publisher=John Churchill |location=London}}</ref>

=== Political controversy ===
After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the Broad Street pump handle. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant indirectly accepting the fecal-oral route of disease transmission, which was too unpleasant for most of the public to contemplate.<ref>Chapelle, Frank  (2005) ''Wellsprings''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press. p. 82. {{ISBN|0-8135-3614-6}}</ref>

It wasn't until 1866 that [[William Farr]], one of Snow's chief opponents, realised the validity of his diagnosis when investigating another outbreak of cholera at [[Bromley by Bow]] and issued immediate orders that unboiled water was not to be drunk.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cadbury |first=Deborah |title=Seven Wonders of the Industrial World |year=2003 |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London and New York |pages=189–192 }}</ref>

Farr denied Snow's explanation of how exactly the contaminated water spread cholera, although he did accept that water had a role in the spread of the illness. In fact, some of the statistical data that Farr collected helped promote John Snow's views.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Eyler |first=John M. |date=April 1973 |title=William Farr on the Cholera: The Sanitarian's Disease Theory and the Statistician's Method |journal=Journal of the History of Medicine |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/xxviii.2.79 |pmid=4572629}}</ref>
