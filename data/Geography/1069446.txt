'''Aerial survey''' is a method of collecting [[geomatics]] or other [[image]]ry by using [[airplane]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s, [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s or other aerial methods. Typical types of data collected include [[aerial photography]], [[Lidar]], [[remote sensing]]  (using various visible and invisible bands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], such as [[infrared]], [[gamma ray|gamma]], or [[ultraviolet]]) and also geophysical data (such as [[aeromagnetic survey]]s and [[gravity]]. It can also refer to the chart or map made by analysing a region from the air. Aerial survey should be distinguished from [[satellite imagery]] technologies because of its better resolution, quality and [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] conditions (which can negatively impact and obscure [[Earth observation satellite|satellite observation]]). Today, aerial survey is sometimes recognized as a synonym for aerophotogrammetry, part of [[photogrammetry]] where the [[camera]] is placed in the air. Measurements on aerial images are provided by [[Photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] technologies and methods.<ref>A. Sechin. Digital Photogrammetric Systems: Trends and Developments. GeoInformatics. #4, 2014, pp. 32-34.</ref>

Aerial surveys can provide information on many things not visible from the ground.

==Terms used in aerial survey==

;exposure station or air station: the position of the [[Cardinal point (optics)#Principal planes and points|optical centre]] of the camera at the moment of exposure.
;flying height:  the elevation of the exposure station above the datum (usually mean [[sea level]]).
;[[altitude]]: the vertical distance of the aircraft above the [[Earth]]'s surface.
;tilt: the angle between the aerial camera and the horizontal axis perpendicular to the [[Steady flight|line of flight]].
;tip: the angle between the aerial camera and the line of flight.
;principal point:  the point of intersection of the optical axis of the aerial camera with the [[Picture plane|photographical plane]].
;isocentre:  the point on the aerial photograph in which the bisector of the angle of tilt meets the photograph.
;[[nadir]] point: the image of the nadir, i.e. the point on the aerial photograph where a [[Plumb bob|plumbline]] dropped from the front nodal point pierces the photograph.
;scale: ratio of the [[focal length]] of the camera objective and the distance of the exposure station from the ground.
;[[azimuth]]: the clockwise horizontal angle measured about the ground [[nadir]] point from the ground survey [[North]] meridian in the plane of photograph.
;[[orthomosaic]]: A high-resolution map created by orthophotos, usually via drones is termed as an orthomosaic. Ortho meaning a [[nadir]] image and mosaic meaning a collection of images.
;[[Temporal Resolution]]:Time between observations.

==Uses==
Aerial surveys are used for:

Aerial surveys use a measuring camera where the elements of its interior orientation are known, but with much larger [[focal length]] and [[Photographic film|film]] and specialized [[Camera lens|lens]]es.

==Aerial survey sensors==
In order to carry out an aerial survey, a sensor needs to be fixed to the interior or the exterior of the airborne platform with line-of-sight to the target it is [[Remote sensing|remotely sensing]]. With manned [[aircraft]], this is accomplished either through an aperture in the [[Skin (aeronautics)|skin]] of the aircraft or mounted externally on a wing [[strut]]. With [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs), the sensor is typically mounted under or inside.

Aerial survey systems are typically operated with the following:
* Flight navigation software, which directs the pilot to fly in the desired pattern for the survey.
* [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], a combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) to provide position and orientation information for the data recorded.
* [[Gyro-stabilized camera systems|Gyro-stabilized]] mount to counter the effects of aircraft roll, pitch and yaw.
* Data storage unit to save the data that is recorded.

==Examples of aerial survey sensors==
* Vexcel UltraCam (Eagle, Falcon, Osprey, Condor)
* [[Leica Camera|Leica]] ADS100
* WaldoAir XCAM
* RIEGL LMS-Q780
* [[Trimble (company)|Trimble]] AX80
