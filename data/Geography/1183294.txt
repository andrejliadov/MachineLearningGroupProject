The '''''Casa de Contratación''''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkasa ðe kontɾataˈθjon}}, "House of Trade") or '''''Casa de la Contratación de las Indias''''' ("House of Trade of the Indies") was established by the [[Crown of Castile]], in 1503 in the port of [[Seville]] (and transferred to [[Cadiz]] in 1717) as a crown agency for the [[Spanish Empire]]. It functioned until 1790, when it was abolished in a government reorganization. Before the establishment of the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524, the Casa de Contratación had broad powers over overseas matters, especially financial matters concerning trade and legal disputes arising from it.  It also was responsible for the licensing of emigrants, training of pilots, creation of maps and charters, probate of estates of Spaniards dying overseas.<ref>John R.

==Introduction==
Unlike the later [[East India Company|East India Companies]], chartered companies established by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[British Empire|English]], and others, the ''Casa'' collected all colonial taxes and duties, approved all voyages of exploration and trade, maintained  secret information on trade routes and new discoveries,<ref name="FlintFlint2003">{{cite book|author1=Richard Flint|author2=Shirley Cushing Flint|title=The Coronado Expedition: From the Distance of 460 Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHTAtBO5jeIC&pg=PA265|date=18 March 2003|publisher=UNM Press|isbn=978-0-8263-2977-6|page=265}}</ref><ref name="HendersonDelpar2000">{{cite book|author1=James D.

==Operation==
A 20 per cent tax, the ''[[quinto real]]'' (royal fifth)  was levied by the ''Casa'' on all [[precious metals]] entering Spain.<ref name="Livi-Bacci2008">{{cite book|author=Massimo Livi-Bacci|title=Conquest: The Destruction of the American Indios|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QrmXCotytmAC&pg=PA293|year=2008|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4001-3|page=293}}</ref><ref name="Acosta2002">{{cite book|author=José de Acosta|title=Natural and Moral History of the Indies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NC4wPdoD7HEC&pg=PA177|date=24 September 2002|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8393-4|page=177}}</ref> The other taxes could run as high as 40% to provide naval protection for the trading ships or as low as 10 per cent during financial turmoil to encourage investment and economic growth in the colony. Each ship was required to employ a clerk to keep detailed logs of all goods carried and all transactions.<ref name="O'Flanagan2013">{{cite book|author=Patrick O'Flanagan|title=Port Cities of Atlantic Iberia, c. 1500–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrG9Apm7VfgC&pg=PA46|date=28 June 2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-8011-2|page=46}}</ref>

The ''Casa de Contratación'' produced and managed the ''[[Padrón Real]]'', the official and secret Spanish map used as a template for the maps carried by every Spanish ship during the 16th century.<ref name="Waters1970">{{cite book|author=David Waters|title=The Iberian Bases of the English Art of Navigation in the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aE1NGdUh-VwC&pg=PA13|year=1970|publisher=UC Biblioteca Geral 1|page=13|id=GGKEY:KXSJC7ZAS51}}</ref> It was constantly improved from its first version in 1508, and was the counterpart of the Portuguese map, the ''[[Padrão Real]]''.

Spain employed the then standard [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] model, governed (at least in theory) by the ''Casa'' in [[Seville]].  Trade with the overseas possessions was handled by a merchants' guild based in Seville, the ''[[Consulado de mercaderes]]'', which worked in conjunction with the ''Casa de Contratación''. Trade was physically controlled in well-regulated [[Spanish treasure fleet|trade fleets]], the famous ''Flota de Indias'' and the [[Manila galleon]]s.

==Reductions==
By the late 17th century, the ''Casa de Contratación'' had fallen into bureaucratic gridlock, and the empire as a whole was failing, due primarily to Spain's inability to finance both war on the Continent and a global empire. More often than not, the riches transported from [[Manila]] and [[Acapulco]] to Spain were officially signed over to Spain's creditors before the Manila galleon made port. In the 18th century, the new [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon kings]] reduced the power of Seville and the ''Casa de Contratacion''.<ref name="Harding2002">{{cite book|author=Richard Harding|title=Seapower and Naval Warfare, 1650-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHaOAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-36486-1|page=24}}</ref> In 1717 they moved the ''Casa'' from Seville to [[Cádiz]], diminishing Seville's importance in international trade.

== Mapmakers ==
The mapmaking enterprise at the ''Casa de Contratación'' was a huge undertaking, and critical to the success of the voyages of discovery.  Without good navigational aids, the ability of Spain to exploit and profit from what it found would have been limited. The ''Casa'' had a large number of cartographers and navigators (pilots), archivists, record keepers, administrators and others involved in producing and managing the ''Padrón Real''.<ref name="Brown1979">{{cite book|author=Lloyd Arnold Brown|title=The Story of Maps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh7nDfGm7BkC&pg=PA143|year=1979|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-23873-9|page=143}}</ref>
