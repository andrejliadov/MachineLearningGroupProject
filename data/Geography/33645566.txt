A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is an interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
<!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count -->
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.
