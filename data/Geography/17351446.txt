'''Geographic features''' are features of the Earth, natural or not. Natural geographical features consist of [[landform]]s and [[ecosystem]]s. For example, [[terrain]] types (physical factors of the environment) are natural geographical features. Conversely, [[human settlement]]s or other engineered forms are considered types of artificial geographical features.

==Natural geographical features==
===Ecosystems ===
{{main|Ecosystem}}
There are two different terms to describe habitats: ecosystem and biome. An ecosystem is a community of organisms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Odum|first1=Eugene P.|authorlink1=Eugene Odum|last2=Odum|first2=Howard T.|authorlink2=Howard Thomas Odum|title=Fundamentals of Ecology |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofec0000odum|url-access=registration|date=1971|publisher=[[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]]|edition=3rd}}</ref> In contrast, [[biomes]] occupy large areas of the globe and often encompass many different kinds of geographical features, including [[mountain range]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Botkin|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Keller|first2=Edward A.|title=Environmental Science: Earth as a Living Planet|url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalsci00botk|url-access=registration|date=1995|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Canada}}</ref>

Biotic diversity within an ecosystem is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including ''[[inter alia]]'', terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Convention Text â€” Article 2. Use of Terms|url=https://www.cbd.int/convention/articles/default.shtml?a=cbd-02|website=www.CBD.int|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> [[Living organism]]s are continually engaged in a set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist, and ecosystem describes any situation where there is relationship between organisms and their environment.

Biomes represent large areas of ecologically similar [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plants]], [[animals]], and soil organisms.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Basak|first1=Anindita|title=Environmental Studies|date=2009|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|isbn=978-81-317-2118-6|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yElrhPSIq-wC&pg=PA288|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozones]], biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].

== Landforms ==
{{main|Landform}}
A landform comprises a [[geomorphology|geomorphological]] unit and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the [[terrain]], and as such is typically an element of [[topography]]. Landforms are categorized by features such as elevation, slope, orientation, [[stratum|stratification]], rock exposure, and soil type. They include [[berm]]s, mounds, hills, [[cliffs]], [[valleys]], [[river]]s, and numerous other elements. [[Oceans]] and [[continents]] are the highest-order landforms.

A body of water is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth. The term "body of water" most often refers to [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, and [[lake]]s, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as [[pond]]s, [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] or [[wetland]]s. [[River]]s, [[stream]]s, [[canal]]s, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not always considered bodies of water, but they are included as geographical formations featuring water.

== Artificial geographical features ==
=== Settlement ===
{{main|Human settlement}}
A settlement is a permanent or temporary [[community]] in which people live. Settlements range in components from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Other landscape features such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods, mills, manor houses, moats, and churches may be considered part of a settlement.<ref>{{cite web|title=MSRG Policy Statement|url=http://medieval-settlement.com/about/policy/|website=Medieval-Settlement.com|publisher=Medieval Settlement Research Group|accessdate=13 September 2015|date=2014-05-11}}</ref>

=== Engineered constructs ===
{{main|Construction engineering|Building|Nonbuilding structure}}
{{See also|Infrastructure}}
Engineered geographic features include [[highway]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[airport]]s, [[railroad]]s, [[building]]s, [[dam]]s, and [[reservoir (water)|reservoirs]], and are part of the [[anthroposphere]] because they are man-made geographic features.

== Cartographic features ==
{{main|Cartography|Map}}
Cartographic features are types of abstract geographical features, which appear on maps but not on the planet itself, even though they are located on the planet. For example, [[latitudes]], [[longitudes]], the [[Equator]], and the [[Prime Meridian]] are shown on maps of the Earth, but it do not physically exist. It is a theoretical line used for reference, navigation, and measurement.

==In geographic information standardization==
In the [[ISO/TC 211]] standards on [[geographic information]], there are the following definitions:
* a ''feature'' is defined as an "abstraction of real world phenomena";<ref>[https://isotc211.geolexica.org/concepts/168/]</ref>
* a ''geographic feature'' is a "representation of real world phenomenon associated with a location relative to the Earth";<ref>[https://isotc211.geolexica.org/concepts/203/]</ref>
* a ''[[simple feature]]'' is a "feature restricted to 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices, having both spatial and non spatial attributes";<ref>[https://isotc211.geolexica.org/concepts/412/]</ref>
* a ''complex feature'' is a "feature composed of other features".<ref>[https://isotc211.geolexica.org/concepts/52/]</ref>
