In [[geomorphology]], a '''butte''' ({{IPAc-en|b|juː|t}}) is an isolated [[hill]] with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller [[landform]]s than [[mesa]]s, [[plateau]]s, and [[table (landform)|tablelands]]. The word ''butte'' comes from a [[French language|French]] word meaning [[Hillock|knoll]] (but of any size); its use is prevalent in the [[Western United States]], including the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] where ''mesa'' is used for the larger landform. Because of their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in [[plain]]s and mountainous areas. To differentiate, geographers use the [[rule of thumb]] that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa and Butte |work=Science Clarified |year=2008 |url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230831/http://www.scienceclarified.com/landforms/Faults-to-Mountains/Mesa-and-Butte.html |archive-date=2 December 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Formation==
Buttes form by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] when hard [[caprock]] overlies a layer of less resistant [[rock (geology)|rock]] that is eventually worn away. The harder rock on top of the butte resists erosion. The caprock provides protection for the less resistant rock below from wind abrasion which leaves it standing isolated. As the top is further eroded by abrasion and weathering, the excess material that falls off adds to the [[scree]] or talus slope around the base. On a much smaller scale, the same process forms [[Hoodoo (geology)|hoodoo]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Davis, George Herbert|year=1999|title=Structural Geology of the Colorado Plateau Region of Southern Utah, with Special Emphasis on Deformation Bands|series=G.S.A.

==Notable buttes==
The [[West and East Mitten Buttes|Mitten Buttes]] of [[Monument Valley]] in [[Arizona]] are two of the most distinctive and widely recognized buttes. Monument Valley and the Mittens provided backgrounds in scenes from many  [[Western (genre)|western-themed]] [[film]]s, including seven movies directed by [[John Ford]].{{refn|name=note1|group=note|The John Ford westerns with location work shot in Monument Valley were ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964).}} The [[Devils Tower]] in northeastern [[Wyoming]] is a [[laccolith]]ic butte composed of [[igneous rock]] rather than [[sandstone]], [[limestone]] or other [[sedimentary rock]]s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Devils Tower National Monument – Geologic Formations | url=http://www.nps.gov/deto/naturescience/geologicformations.htm | publisher=National Park Service | date=10 Mar 2014 | accessdate=13 Mar 2014}}</ref>

Three other notable formations that are either named ''butte'' or may be considered buttes even though they do not conform to the formal geographer's rule are [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]] in [[Nebraska]] which is actually a collection of five bluffs, [[Crested Butte]] which is a {{convert|12168|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain in [[Colorado]], and [[Elephant Butte (Sierra County, New Mexico)|Elephant Butte]] which is now an island in Elephant Butte Reservoir in [[New Mexico]].

Among the well-known non-flat-topped buttes in the United States are [[Bear Butte]], [[South Dakota]], [[Black Butte (Oregon)|Black Butte]], [[Oregon]], and the [[Sutter Buttes]] in [[California]]. In many cases, buttes have been given other names that do not use the word ''butte'', for example, [[Courthouse Rock]], Nebraska.  Also, some large hills that are technically not buttes have names using the word, examples of which are [[Kamiak Butte]] and Chelan Butte in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].
