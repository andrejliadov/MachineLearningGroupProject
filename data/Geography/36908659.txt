'''Mountain research''' or ''[[Mountain research#Denomination|montology]]'', traditionally also known as ''orology''<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orology Merriam Webster</ref> (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oros'' ὄρος for 'mountain' and ''logos'' λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the [[Earth's surface]]'s part covered by [[mountain]] [[landscape]]s.

==Mountain areas==
Different approaches have been developed to define ''mountainous'' areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 [[meter|m]] inside an area to define that zone as mountainous,<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1553/eco.mont-5-1s3 | volume=5 | title=Editorial | journal=Eco.mont (Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research) | year=2014 | pages=3–4| doi-access=free | last1=Borsdorf | first1=Axel }}</ref> others consider differences from 1000 m or more,<ref>http://www.unep.org/maweb/documents/document.293.aspx.pdf Mountain Systems. UNEP</ref> depending on the areas' [[latitude]]. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding high [[plateau]]s (e.g. the Andean [[Altiplano]] or the [[Tibetan Plateau]]), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]], which classifies municipalities as mountainous

* if at least 80% of their territory is situated above ≥ 600 m [[above sea level]], and/or 
* if they have an altitudinal difference of 600 m (or more) within their administrative boundaries.<ref>http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/147760 Precisazione sulla classificazione dei comuni montani</ref>

The [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] has produced a map<ref>http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=0a5d90defc33466cbc3eb85a6564b6d6 UNEP-WCNC (2011): Mountains of the World – 2000.

Data</ref> of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with

* elevations from 300 to 1000 m and local elevation range [[Greater-than sign|>]] 300 m;
* elevations from 1000 to 1500 m and slope [[≥]] 5[[°]] or local elevation range > 300 m;
* elevations from 1500 to 2500 m and slope ≥ 2°;
* elevations of 2500 m or more.

==Focus==

===Broader definition===
In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research ''in'' mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan [[Plant (botanical)|plants]], Andean [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], Alpine [[City|cities]], or Carpathian [[Ethnic group|people]]. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] (polar research) or [[coast]]s (coastal research).

===Narrower definition===
In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses ''on'' mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the [[Integrated geography|human-environment interaction]] in ([[positivism|positive]]) and the [[sustainable development]] of ([[normative]]) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of [[natural science]]s, [[social science]]s and [[humanities]]. Drawing on [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s work in the [[Andes|Andean realm]], [[Geography|mountain geography]] and [[Landscape ecology|ecology]] are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from [[anthropology]], [[geology]], [[economics]], [[history]] or [[spatial planning]]. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. [[Olav Slaymaker|Slaymaker]] summarizes:

{{Quotation|The science of montology [...] starts with recognition of the importance of verticality, a distinctive feature of mountain regions, which imposes vertical control of the production system; marginality, which results from low agricultural potential; centrality of mechanisms of power and violence; population growth and expansion; and religion and myth, expressed in mountains as sacred places. Montology emphasises restoration ecology to include re-vegetation, rehabilitation, reclamation and recovery of the lost landscape form and function [...]. Landscape ecological effects are arranged along altitudinal belts and form the basis for a more comprehensive understanding of critical habitats for conservation and development. This approach has an underlying assumption of climax communities each fitting into a narrow altitudinal band.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Slaymaker | first1 = O | year = 2007 | title = The potential contribution of geomorphology to tropical mountain development: The case of the MANRECUR project | journal = Geomorphology | volume = 87 | issue = 1–2| pages = 90–100 | doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.06.044 | bibcode = 2007Geomo..87...90S }}</ref>}}

==Denomination==
Mountain research or ''orology''—not to be confused with [[orography]]—, is sometimes denominated ''montology''. This term stems from Carl Troll's ''mountain geoecology''—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German ''[[Landscape ecology|Landschaftsökologie]]''—and appeared at a meeting in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Neustadtl | first1 = SJ | year = 1977 | title = Montology: the Ecology of Mountains | journal = Technology Review | volume = 79 | issue = 8| pages = 64–66 }}</ref> Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oed.com/public/update0212/december-2002-update | title=New words list December 2002}}</ref> It defines montology as:

{{Quotation|The study of mountains; specifically the interdisciplinary study of the physical, chemical, geological, and biological aspects of mountain regions; (also) the study of the lifestyles and economic concerns of people living in these regions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/montology |title = Montology &#124; Meaning of Montology by Lexico}}</ref>}}

On the one hand, the term ''montology'' received criticism due to the mix of [[Latin language|Latin]] (''mōns'', [[Plural|pl.]] ''montēs'') and [[Greek language|Greek]] (''logos''). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as [[glaciology]] or [[sociology]].
