The '''Brussels Geographic Conference''' was held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] in September 1876 at the request of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. At the conference were invited nearly forty well-known experts, mainly they were schooled in the geographic sciences or were wealthy [[philanthropist]]s. Before the guests returned to their respective countries, they voted to establish the [[International African Association]]. This initiative would in the end pave the way for the creation of [[Congo Free State]].
