'''Geodesign''' is a set of concepts and methods<ref>Carl Steinitz. 2012. A framework for Geodesign - changing geography by design. Redlands: Esri Press. {{ISBN|9781589483330}}</ref> used to involve all stakeholders and various professions in collaboratively designing and realizing the optimal solution for spatial challenges in the [[Built environment|built]] and [[natural environment]]s, utilizing all available techniques and data in an integrated process. Originally, geodesign was mainly applied during the design and planning phase. "Geodesign is a design and planning method which tightly couples the creation of design proposals with impact simulations informed by geographic contexts."<ref>Flaxman, Michael.

Talk at GeoDesign Summit 2010.</ref> Now, it is also used during realization and maintenance phases and to facilitate re-use of for example buildings or industrial areas.<ref>Danbi J.Lee, Eduardo Dias, Henk J.

==History==
Geodesign builds greatly on a long history of work in [[geographic information science]], [[computer-aided design]], [[landscape architecture]], and other [[environmental design]] fields. See for instance, the work of [[Ian McHarg]] and [[Carl Steinitz]].  

Members of the various disciplines and practices relevant to geodesign have held defining discussions at a workshop on [http://ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/scdg/ Spatial Concepts in GIS and Design] in December 2008 and the [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/ GeoDesign Summit] in January 2010. GeoDesign Summit 2010 Conference Videos from [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-one.html Day 1] and [http://www.geodesignsummit.com/videos/day-two.html Day 2] are an important resource to learn about the many different aspects of GeoDesign.  ESRI co-founder Jack Dangermond has introduced each of the GeoDesign Summit meetings.  Designer and technologist [[Bran Ferren]], was the keynote speaker for the first and fourth Summit meetings in Redlands, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2013/02/08/a-250-year-plan-for-the-planet/|title=A 250-Year Plan for the Planet {{!}} Esri Insider|website=blogs.esri.com|date=8 February 2013|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> During the fourth conference he presented a provocative view of how what is needed is a 250-year plan, and how GeoDesign was a key concept in making this a reality.<ref>{{Citation|title=Five Minutes into the Future: An Argument for Taking a Longer View|url=https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=2119&title=five-minutes-into-the-future-an-argument-for-taking-a-longer-view|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Carl Steinitz was a presenter at both the 2010<ref>{{Citation|last=esri|title=GeoDesign Summit 2010: Carl Steinitz: Ways of Designing (Part 4 of 4)|date=2010-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HmYxTzPnLY|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> and 2015<ref>{{Citation|last=Esri Events|title=Esri 2015 Geodesign Summit: Experiments in Geodesign Synthesis|date=2017-12-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czIeEJoEvuo|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref> Summits.

The 2013 Geodesign Summit drew a record 260 attendees from the United States and abroad ([http://video.esri.com watch video coverage of the summit]). That same year, a master's degree in Geodesign — the first of its kind in the nation — began at [[Philadelphia University]].<ref>[http://www.esri.com/news/arcwatch/0113/educating-the-next-generation-in-geodesign.html Goldberg, Debbie. Educating the Next Generation in Geodesign ''ArcWatch'', january 2013.]</ref> Claudia Goetz Phillips, director of Landscape Architecture and GeoDesign at [[Philadelphia University]] says "it is very exciting to be at the forefront of this exciting and relevant paradigm shift in how we address twenty-first-century global to local design and planning issues."<ref>[http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0313/geodesign-in-motion Wheeler, Carla. Geodesign in Motion ' 'ArcWatch'', march 2013.]</ref>

==Theory==
The theory underpinning Geodesign derives from the work of [[Patrick Geddes]] in the first half of the twentieth century and [[Ian McHarg]] in its second half. They advocated a layered approach to regional planning, landscape planning and urban planning. McHarg drew the layers on translucent overlays. Through the work of [[Jack Dangermond]], Carl Steinitz, Henk Scholten and others the layers were modeled with  [[Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS).<ref>''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.9</ref> The three components of this term each say something about its character. 'Geographical' implies that the layers are geographical (geology, soils, hydrology, roads, land use etc.). 'Information' implies  a positivist and scientific methodology. 'System' implies the use of computer technology for the information processing.<ref>''Landscape Planning and Environmental Impact Design'', (UCL Press London 1998). {{ISBN|1-85728-321-X}} p.20</ref>
The scientific aspects of Geodesign contrast with the cultural emphasis of [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] but the two approaches to landscape planning share a concern for layered analysis <ref>Pe, R. (2012) Hyper-localism and Parametric Mapping for Collaborative Urbanism. ''Digital Landscape Architecture conference, 31 May 2012''</ref> which sits comfortably with [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[post-postmodernism|post-postmodern]] theory.

==Technologies==
Nascent geodesign technology extends [[geographic information systems]] so that in addition to analyzing existing environments and [[geodata]], users can synthesize new environments and modify geodata.  See, for example, [[CommunityViz]] or [[marinemap]].

"GeoDesign brings geographic analysis into the design process, where initial design sketches are instantly vetted for suitability against myriad database layers describing a variety of physical and social factors for the spatial extent of the project. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving land-use planners, engineers, transportation planners, and others involved with design, the tools to leverage geographic information within their design workflows."<ref>[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/summer09articles/gis-designing-our-future.html Dangermond, Jack. GIS: Designing Our Future ''ArcNews'', summer 2009.]</ref>
