In the [[visual arts]] a '''cityscape''' (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[Publishing|print]] or [[photograph]], of the physical aspects of a [[city]] or [[urban area]]. It is the urban equivalent of a [[landscape]]. ''Townscape'' is roughly synonymous with ''cityscape,'' though it implies the same difference in urban size and density (and even modernity) implicit in the difference between the words ''city'' and ''town''.  In [[urban design]] the terms refer to the configuration of built forms and interstitial space.

==History of cityscapes in art==
From the first century A.D. dates a [[fresco]] at the [[Baths of Trajan]] in [[Rome]] depicting a bird's eye view of an ancient city.<ref>Eugenio la Rocca: "The Newly Discovered City Fresco from Trajan's Baths, Rome." ''Imago Mundi''  Vol. 53 (2001), pp. 121–124.</ref>  In the Middle Ages, cityscapes appeared as a background for [[portrait]]s and [[Bible|biblical]] themes. From the 16th up to the 18th century numerous [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] prints and [[etching]]s were made showing cities in [[aerial landscape art|bird's eye view]]. The function of these prints was to provide a map-like overview.

In Ancient China, scroll paintings such as [[Qingming Shanghe Tu]] offer a panoramic view of the cities depicted.

Halfway through the 17th century the cityscape became an independent genre in the [[Netherlands]]. In his famous [[View of Delft (Vermeer)|''View of Delft'']] in 1660–1661 [[Jan Vermeer]] painted a quite accurate portrait of the city [[Delft]]. Cities like [[Amsterdam]], [[Haarlem]] and [[The Hague]] also became popular subjects for paintings. Painters from other European countries (i.e., [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]]) followed the Dutch example. The 18th century was a flourishing period for cityscape painting in [[Venice]] ([[Canaletto]], [[Francesco Guardi|Guardi]]).

At the end of the 19th century the [[impressionists]] focused on the atmosphere and dynamics of [[everyday life]] in the city. Suburban and industrial areas, building sites and [[Rail yard|railway yards]] also became subjects for cityscapes. During the 20th century attention became focused on [[abstract art|abstract]] and [[conceptual art]], and thus the production of cityscapes declined. American painter [[Edward Hopper]], who stayed loyal to figurative painting, created intriguing images of the American scene. With a revival of figurative art at the end of the 20th century comes a revaluation of the cityscape. Well-known living cityscape painters are [[Rackstraw Downes]], [[Antonio López García]], and [[Richard Estes]]. American artist [[Yvonne Jacquette]] has made a specialty of [[aerial landscape art|aerial]] cityscapes.
