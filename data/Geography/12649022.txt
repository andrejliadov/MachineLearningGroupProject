In [[agriculture]], [[gardening]], and [[landscaping]], '''barkdust''' (also '''bark dust''', '''bark chips''', '''bark mulch''', or '''beauty bark''') is a form of [[mulch]] produced out of chipped or shredded [[tree]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]].  Coarser forms of barkdust may be known as '''bark nuggets'''.  Trees typically used in the production of barkdust include the [[Douglas fir]] and the [[Western hemlock]].

==Production and types of barkdust==

Barkdust is commonly produced from several tree species.  The [[Douglas fir]] and the [[Western hemlock]] are the most common sources of barkdust, with [[Cedar wood|cedar]] bark also being used.  Barkdust may be a byproduct of [[lumber]] production, of [[Source Separated Organics|yard debris]] recycling processes, or it may be produced in its own right.  Barkdust is typically categorized by the source plant, as well as by the coarseness of the resulting material.  Fine barkdusts are used as [[mulch]], with coarser forms being used for weed control, as a [[playground]] surface, or for decorative purposes. 

According to voluntary guidelines published by the [[Mulch and Soil Council]], a trade group of mulch and soil producers, a material with "bark" in the name should consist of "the corky exterior covering of trees, with a maximum wood content (interior [[xylem]] of 15%)".   Products with greater than 15% wood content may be labelled as "wood mulch", but should not be called "bark", according to the group's guidelines.<ref>{{cite web

Fresh fir bark is reddish-brown in color. The bark from cedar or hemlock is more tan in color, as the processes which produce these types of barkdust may leave a greater percentage of wood (as opposed to bark) in the resulting material. Shredded Douglas fir bark is known for its many slivers, those who handle it with bare hands or walk on it with bare feet are likely to get [[splinter]]s. Bark produced from hemlock or cedar is far less likely to produce splinters, and is commonly used as a covering for children's play areas.

==Properties and uses==

Like many other types of [[mulch]], barkdust is used in gardening and landscaping for its properties in affecting soil [[pH]], in regulating the temperature of the underlying soil, 
and preventing water loss and erosion.

Barkdust increases soil acidity,<ref>{{cite web|title=How to grow dahlias|publisher=Pleasant Valley Glads and Dahlias|accessdate=2007-08-06|url=http://www.gladiola.com/dahlias.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629114653/http://www.gladiola.com/dahlias.htm|archivedate=2007-06-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the decomposition of barkdust consumes [[nitrogen]], especially when fine bark mulch is mixed in with soil; coarser barkdust laid on top of soil will extract nitrogen at a much slower rate. Barkdust is also effective at absorbing water and preventing water loss due to evaporation.

Barkdust is commonly used in landscaping around trees or shrubs. It is especially common in the [[Pacific Northwest]] where the tree species used to produce it are native. Barkdust is valued for its effectiveness at suppressing [[weed]]s; tree bark contains natural [[herbicide]]s.{{cn|date=February 2017}} In addition, many consider barkdust to be visually appealing.{{citation needed |date=July 2014}}

As barkdust is less dense than other types of soil or mulch, and doesn't compress a great deal, it is often considerably softer than bare earth. As a result, it also finds applications as a [[playground]] surface. For playground applications, hemlock or cedar bark is most commonly used, as fir bark frequently produces [[splinter]]s when handled by or trod upon with bare skin.

===Commerce in barkdust===

Barkdust is typically sold by the '''unit''', with one unit of barkdust being equal to 200&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet (7.41&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;yards, or 5.66&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>); such large quantities of barkdust are typically delivered by truck to a jobsite. Barkdust is often spread with a [[bark blower]], a machine consisting of a supply of barkdust, a blower, and a long flexible tube which "sprays" the barkdust over the intended area. Use of a bark blower often results in a more consistent application of barkdust than spreading it by hand, as well as being much faster.

Smaller quantities of barkdust, typically 2&ndash;3&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;feet, are sold prepackaged in [[home improvement]] and [[gardening]] [[retailer]]s.

For landscaping applications, a layer of 2"&ndash;3"&nbsp;(5&nbsp;cm&ndash;7.5&nbsp;cm) is generally recommended. For use in playgrounds, a 12"&nbsp;(30&nbsp;cm) layer is often recommended.<ref>{{cite web
