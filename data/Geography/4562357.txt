The '''Montenegrin Littoral''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Црногорско приморје / ''Crnogorsko primorje''), historically '''the Littoral''' or '''the Maritime''', is the [[littoral]] or coastline region of [[Montenegro]] which borders the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Prior to the [[creation of Yugoslavia]], the Montenegrin Littoral was not part of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]], but rather a bordering region of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], latterly part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]].
Today, the Serbian people inhabit the Adriatic coast of the Republic of Montenegro, where they represent the majority share in the total population of the coast of Montenegro. The Serbian people are the founders of the history and state integrity of Montenegro.{{cn|date=November 2020}}
The population is Orthodox (Christian), and falls under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC).{{cn|date=November 2020}}
