'''GeoPlanet''' is a computer platform for coordinating world-wide [[Geographic information system|geographic information]], and providing both text and [[Cartography|cartographic]] output, such as digital maps for any location in the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tech Update: GeoPlanet|year=2002|journal=Internet Magazine|volume=2002|issue=March|page=21}}</ref><ref name="Cosmo">{{Cite web|title=Free geo data solutions compared: GeoNames.org vs. Yahoo!

It was developed by GDC, a London-based geographic information company,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Open for business|journal=GEO Europe|year=2001|volume=2001|issue=September|page=46}}</ref> which was acquired by [[Whereonearth]] in 1998.<ref name="GDC-sale">{{Cite journal|title=Whereonearth has completed the spin-off of GDC through a successful management buyout|year=2002|journal=GEO: Connexion|volume=2|issue=1|page=62}}</ref> When Whereonearth spun off GDC in 2002, it kept GeoPlanet. When [[Yahoo!]] purchased Whereonearth in 2005, it acquired GeoPlanet.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yahoo Buys Whereonearth To Bolster Local Search |date=18 October 2005 |publisher=TechDirt |url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20051018/1445219.shtml |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QbWUn60J?url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20051018/1445219.shtml |archivedate=25 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Directory of Companies, Applications, and Organizations|journal=Release 2.0|volume=0|issue=10|page=43}}</ref>

An integral part of GeoPlanet is the [[WOEID]] (Where On Earth IDentifier), a unique 32-bit reference identifier, now assigned by Yahoo!, that identifies any feature on Earth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yahoo! WOEID Lookup|publisher=http://Zourbuth Project|url=http://zourbuth.com/tools/woeid/}}</ref> In addition to the strict numerical WOEID, GeoPlanet also has a hierarchical structure that allows accessing surrounding locations, and zooming up and down administrative divisions.<ref name="Cosmo" />  In 2009, Yahoo! released GeoPlanet's WOEID data to the public,<ref name="Cosmo" /> but the last release was on 1 June 2012 after which Yahoo! decided to cease making the data downloadable until they "determine a better way to surface the data as a part of the service".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yahoo!

In June 2015 Yahoo announced that the GeoPlanet APIs would be dropped as the functionality is now available through their Yahoo Query Language and BOSS APIs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/120700756894/q2-2015-progress-report-on-our-product|title=Q2 2015 Progress Report On Our Product Prioritization|work=Yahoo|access-date=2018-03-20}}</ref> The GeoPlanet APIs stopped responding to requests in late August 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://where.yahooapis.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802072936/http://where.yahooapis.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
