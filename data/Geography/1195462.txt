In 2008, The [[Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences]] (AESS) was founded as the first professional association in the interdisciplinary field of environmental studies in the United States. In 2010, the National Council for Science and the Environment (NCSE) agreed to advise and support the Association. In March of 2011, The Association's scholarly journal, the ''Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences'' (JESS), commenced publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aess.info|title=Association for Environmental Studies & Sciences AESSonline.org|website=AESSOnline.org|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310034932/http://aess.info/|archive-date=10 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The History and Development of AESS|url=https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|website=Association for Environmental Studies and Sciences|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106060958/https://aessonline.org/about-aess/history/|archive-date=6 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In the United States, many high school students are able to take environmental science as a college-level course.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-environmental-science|title=AP Environmental Science|publisher=Collegeboard|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref> Over 500 colleges and universities in the United States offer environmental studies as a degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/natural-resources-conservation-environmental-studies|title=Major: Environmental Studies|publisher=Collegeboard|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref>

== Education ==
Worldwide, programs in environmental studies may be offered through colleges of liberal arts, life science, social science or agriculture. Students of environmental studies use what they learn the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to better understand environmental problems and potentially offer solutions to them. Students look at how we interact with the natural world and come up with ideas to prevent its destruction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/majors/natural-resources-conservation-environmental-studies|title=Environmental Studies College Degree Programs {{!}} The College Board|website=bigfuture.collegeboard.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>
