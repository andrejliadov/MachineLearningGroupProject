'''Surroundings''' are the area around a given physical or geographical [[Point (geometry)|point]] or [[Location (geography)|place]].  The exact definition depends on the field. Surroundings can also be used in [[geography]] (when it is more precisely known as vicinity, or vicinage) and mathematics, as well as philosophy, with the literal or metaphorically extended definition.

In [[thermodynamics]], the term (and its synonym, [[environment (systems)|environment]]) is used in a more restricted sense, meaning everything outside the [[System (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic system]]. Often, the simplifying assumptions are that [[energy]] and [[matter]] may move freely within the surroundings, and that the surroundings have a uniform composition.
