{{wiktionary|locale}}
As defined by the [[United States Geological Survey]], a '''locale''' is a [[geographic]] [[Location (geography)|place]] at which there is or was human activity.  It does not include [[populated places]] (such as cities, settlements, towns, or villages), [[Mining|mine]]s, and [[dam]]s. Locale indicates locations of more dispersed, periodic or temporary human activity, such as a [[Intersection (road)|crossroad]], a [[Campsite|camp]], a [[farm]], a [[Landing (water transport)|landing]], a [[railroad siding]], a [[ranch]], a [[windmill]] or one of any of the various types of [[Station (disambiguation)#Agriculture and geography|agricultural]], [[Station (disambiguation)#Communications|communication]], [[Station (disambiguation)#Infrastructure|infrastructure]] or [[Station (disambiguation)#Transport|transport station]]s where human activities are carried out.

Locale also indicates locations of former locales and incidents of human activity, such as a [[battle]]field or [[historic site]], and former locations of populated places such as a [[ghost town]] or [[ruins]] or an [[archaeological site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:8|title=Feature Class Definitions|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Geologic Survey|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
