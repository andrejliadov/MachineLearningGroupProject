The '''geography of Pluto''' entails the delineation and characterization of regions on [[Pluto]]. Plutonian geography is mainly focused on what is called [[physical geography]] on Earth; that is, the distribution of physical features across Pluto and their [[cartography|cartographic]] representations. On 14 July 2015, the ''[[New Horizons]]'' [[spacecraft]] became the first spacecraft to [[planetary flyby|fly by]] Pluto.<ref name="NYT-20150714-kc">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=NASA's New Horizons Spacecraft Completes Flyby of Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/science/space/nasa-new-horizons-spacecraft-reaches-pluto.html |date=14 July 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=14 July 2015 }}</ref><ref name="AP-20150714">{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Pluto close-up: Spacecraft makes flyby of icy, mystery world |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20150714/us-sci--pluto-1a20f848e7.html |date=14 July 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=14 July 2015 }}</ref> During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed geographical measurements and observations of Pluto and its [[Moons of Pluto|moons]].<ref name="NYT-20150706">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Almost Time for Pluto's Close-Up |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/science/space/almost-time-for-plutos-close-up.html |date=6 July 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>

==Coordinate system orientation==
{{further|Poles of astronomical bodies}}
Pluto may be defined as having [[retrograde rotation]] and an axial tilt of 60 degrees, or prograde rotation and a tilt of 120 degrees. Following the latter convention (the [[right-hand rule]]), the hemisphere currently in daylight is the northern one, with much of the southern hemisphere in darkness. This is the convention used by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and the ''New Horizons'' team, and their maps put the sunlit hemisphere on top. However, older sources may define Pluto's rotation as retrograde and therefore the sunlit side as the southern hemisphere. East and west are also swapped between the two conventions.<ref>For example, {{cite web | title = Puzzling Seasons and Signs of Wind Found on Pluto | first=Robert Roy |last=Britt | work = Space.com | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/pluto_seasons_030709.html | date = 2003 | accessdate = 26 March 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109025459/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/pluto_seasons_030709.html | archivedate=9 January 2011}}</ref>

The following names were originally proposed by the ''New Horizons'' discovery team. These names were variously taken from historical figures involved in the study of Pluto, notable space exploration missions, and a variety of chthonic deities or demons, some from ancient mythology and others from modern popular culture. While several of these names have been canonized by the IAU as of 2017,<ref name = "name approval">{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/pluto-features-given-first-official-names|title=Pluto Features Given First Official Names|publisher=NASA|date=2017-09-07}}</ref> most remain informal classifications that have yet to be considered.

===Tombaugh Regio===
[[File:Tombaugh Regio.jpg|thumb|Tombaugh Regio, as viewed by ''[[New Horizons]]'' 13{{nbsp}}July 2015]]
{{main|Tombaugh Regio|Sputnik Planitia}}
Tombaugh Regio, nicknamed The Heart, is a large, light-colored region in the [[Heart (symbol)|shape of a heart]] named after the discoverer of Pluto, [[Clyde Tombaugh]]. Two lobes of the heart are distinct geological features sharing a bright appearance, with the western lobe ([[Sputnik Planitia]], a vast plain of [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen]] and other ices) smoother than the eastern lobe.<ref name="brokenheart">{{cite web|last1=Feltman|first1=Rachel|title=New data reveals that Pluto's heart is broken|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/07/14/new-data-reveals-that-plutos-heart-is-broken/|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=14 July 2015|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> The heart is about {{convert|990|mi|km|disp=flip|abbr=on}} across.<ref name="whale"/>  The region contains {{convert|11,000|ft|m|abbr = on|order=flip}}
mountains made of water ice, [[Hillary Montes]] and [[Tenzing Montes]], along its southwestern edge. The lack of craters suggests that its surface there is less than 
100 million years old and hence that Pluto is probably geologically active.<ref>{{cite web|last1 = Orwig|first1 = Jessica|title = The first insanely close-up photos of Pluto reveal water on its surface|url = http://www.businessinsider.com/the-first-insanely-close-up-photos-of-pluto-reveal-water-on-its-surface-2015-7|work = Business Insider|accessdate = 15 July 2015|date = 15 July 2015}}</ref> Subsequent data indicated that features near the edges of the region show evidence of ice flow such as glaciers, and light material overlying the darker material at the eastern edge of Cthulhu Macula.<ref name="NASA-20150724-lg"/>

===The Brass Knuckles===
[[File:Pluto-BrassKnuckles-20150716.jpg|thumb|The "Brass Knuckles" region of Pluto. Meng-p'o is at the zero meridian; to the east is the 'tail' of Cthulhu.]]
A series of semi-regularly spaced dark spots with irregular boundaries are nicknamed the '''[[brass knuckles|Brass Knuckles]]'''.

{{main|Cthulhu Macula}}
Cthulhu Macula (formerly called ''Cthulhu Regio''),<ref name = "Pluto System after New Horizons" /> nicknamed The Whale after its shape, is an elongated, dark region along Pluto's equator named after the fictional [[Cthulhu|deity]] from the works of [[H.

===Dune fields===
[[File:PIA20198-Pluto-SputnikPlanum-Mountains-20150714.jpg|thumb|Dune fields in Sputnik Planitia near Planitia]]
In the Western part of Sputnik Planitia near [[Al-Idrisi Montes]] there are fields of [[transverse dunes]] formed by the winds, which blow from the center of Sputnik Planitia in the direction of surrounding mountings. The dune wavelengths are in the range of 0.4–1&nbsp;km and they are likely consists of methane ice particles 200–300&nbsp;&mu;m in size. The particles are lofted above the surface when the nitrogen ice [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]] under solar irradiation. After that they are moved by gentle winds blowing with 1–10&nbsp;m/s speeds despite generally low atmospheric pressure of about 15&nbsp;&mu;bar.<ref name=Brown2018>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.aao2975|pmid=29853681|title=Dunes on Pluto|journal=Science|volume=360|issue=6392|pages=992|year=2018|last1=Telfer|first1=Matt W|last2=Parteli|first2=Eric J.

==Nomenclature==
{{main|Planetary nomenclature#Pluto}}
The [[Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature]] of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is responsible for assigning official names to surface features on Pluto. On 7 September 2017, the first 14 names have been officially approved by the IAU.<ref name="name approval"/>

As of August 2015, the ''New Horizons'' science team derives ''informal'' names from the following themes: explorers, space missions, spacecraft, scientists and engineers; fictional explorers, travellers, vessels, destinations and origins; authors and artists who have envisioned exploration; and fictional [[underworld]]s, underworld beings, and travellers to the underworld. The ''New Horizons'' science team invited members of the public to propose names and vote on them before the spacecraft's arrival.<ref name=nominatename>{{cite web
