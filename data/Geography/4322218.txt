Critical geography is one variant of&nbsp;[[Critical theory|critical social science and humanities]]&nbsp;that adopt&nbsp;[[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the&nbsp;[[oppression]]&nbsp;in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K98AAAAIAAJ|title=Critical social science: liberation and its limits|last=Fay|first=Brian|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780801494581|language=en}}</ref> Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of&nbsp;[[positivism]]; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of&nbsp;[[Social dominance theory|domination]]; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of&nbsp;[[determinism]]; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eB-B6XercZoC|title=Critical Social Theories: An Introduction|last=Agger|first=Ben|publisher=Avalon Publishing|year=1988|isbn=9780813321745|language=en}}</ref>

== Origin ==
Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the&nbsp;'''radical geography'''&nbsp;that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Peet|first=Richard|year=2000|title=Celebrating Thirty Years of Radical Geography|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=951–953|doi=10.1068/a32202}}</ref> In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the&nbsp;[[quantitative revolution]]&nbsp;and the adoption of&nbsp;[[Marxism|Marxist]]&nbsp;approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self-identified field.

Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of&nbsp;[[Marxism]], in accordance with the&nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]]; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and&nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]], in contrast to radical geography’s focus on the economy.<ref name=":0" /> Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s.<ref name=":2" /> Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments.<ref name=":1" /> He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the "radical" tradition.<ref name=":1" />

== Common themes ==
As a consequence of the&nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]], critical geography doesn’t have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse&nbsp;[[epistemology]],&nbsp;[[ontology]], and&nbsp;[[methodology]], and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=71SvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=thinking+geographically#v=onepage|title=Thinking Geographically: Space, Theory and Contemporary Human Geography|last=Hubbard|first=Phil|last2=Bartley|first2=Brendan|last3=Fuller|first3=Duncan|last4=Kitchin|first4=Rob|publisher=A&C Black|year=2002|isbn=9780567259882|language=en}}</ref> Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blomley|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Uncritical critical geography?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–94|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph593pr}}</ref> encompassing:
# '''A commitment to theory and a rejection of&nbsp;[[empiricism]].'''&nbsp;Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as&nbsp;[[political economy]],&nbsp;[[governmentality]],&nbsp;[[feminism]],&nbsp;[[anti-racism]], and&nbsp;[[anti-imperialism]].
# '''A commitment to reveal the processes that produce&nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequalities]]'''. Critical geographers seek to unveil&nbsp;[[Power (social and political)|power]], uncover&nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]], expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and&nbsp;[[social change]]s.
# '''An emphasis on&nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]]&nbsp;as a means of domination and resistance'''. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power.
# '''An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship'''. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self-education.
# '''A commitment to progressive practices'''. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with&nbsp;[[social movement]]s&nbsp;and activists with commitments to&nbsp;[[social justice]]. The relationship between critical geography and&nbsp;[[activism]]&nbsp;has been much debated.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGabDAEACAAJ|title=Radical Theory/critical Praxis: Making a Difference Beyond the Academy?|last=Fuller|first=Duncan|last2=Kitchin|first2=Rob|publisher=Praxis (e)Press|year=2004|isbn=9780973456103|language=en}}</ref>
# '''An understanding of&nbsp;[[space]]&nbsp;as a critical tool.'''&nbsp;Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce&nbsp;[[oppression]]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]]. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.

== Critiques ==
A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography.<ref name=":0" /> The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacesofhope0000harv|url-access=registration|title=Spaces of Hope|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=9780520225787|language=en}}</ref> The question such as "what are geographers critical of", and "to what end" needs to be answered.<ref name=":0" /> Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Trevor J.|year=2002|title=Critical notes on economic geography from an aging radical. Or radical notes on economic geography from a critical age|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/acme/article/view/687|journal=ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–14|issn=1492-9732}}</ref>

The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/maps-and-chaps-7142744|title=Maps and Chaps|last=Byles|first=Jeff|date=2001-07-31|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-04-04}}</ref> Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography.<ref name=":1" /> Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooptation.<ref name=":0" /> The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change.<ref name=":0" />

Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bialasiewicz|first=Luiza|year=2003|title=The Many Wor(l)ds of Difference and Dissent|journal=Antipode|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00299|issn=1467-8330}}</ref> In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mizuoka|first=Fujio|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=Toshio|last3=Hisatake|first3=Tetsuya|last4=Tsutsumi|first4=Kenji|last5=Fujita|first5=Tetsushi|year=2005|title=The Critical Heritage of Japanese Geography: Its Tortured Trajectory for Eight Decades|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–473|doi=10.1068/d2204r}}</ref> In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.
