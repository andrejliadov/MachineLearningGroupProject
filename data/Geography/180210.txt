A '''biogeographic realm''' or '''ecozone''' is the broadest [[biogeography|biogeographic]] division of Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] organisms. They are subdivided into [[ecoregion]]s, which are classified based on their [[biome]]s or habitat types.

The realms delineate the large areas of Earth's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as [[ocean]]s, broad [[desert]]s, or high [[mountain range]]s, that constitute barriers to migration. As such, biogeographic realm designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography. Biogeographic realms correspond to the [[phytochorion|floristic kingdoms]] of [[botany]] or [[zoogeography|zoogeographic regions]] of [[zoology]].

Biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on ''life form'', or the adaptation of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants to climatic, [[soil]], and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar [[climax vegetation]]. Each realm may include a number of different biomes. A [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories.

The patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world's biogeographic realms were shaped by the process of [[plate tectonics]], which has redistributed the world's land masses over geological history.

==Concept history==
The "biogeographic realms" of Udvardy (1975) were defined based on taxonomic composition. The rank corresponds more or less to the [[floristic kingdom]]s and [[zoogeographic region]]s.

The usage of the term "ecozone" is more variable. It was used originally in [[stratigraphy]] (Vella 1962,{{citation not found|date=August 2019}} Hedberg 1971{{citation not found|date=August 2019}}). In Canadian literature, the term was used by Wiken (1986) in macro level [[land classification]], with geographic criteria (see [[Ecozones of Canada]]) (Wicken 1986, Scott 1995). Later, Schültz (1988) would use it with ecological and physiognomical criteria, in a way similar to the concept of [[biome]].

In the [[Global 200]]/WWF scheme (Olson & Dinerstein 1998), originally the term "biogeographic realm" in Udvardy sense was used. However, in a scheme of [[BBC]] (n.d.), it was replaced by the term "ecozone".

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] scheme (Olson & Dinerstein 1998, Olson et al. 2001) is broadly similar to [[Miklos Udvardy]]'s (1975) system, the chief difference being the delineation of the Australasian realm relative to the Antarctic, Oceanic, and Indomalayan realms. In the WWF system, the Australasia realm includes [[Australia]], [[Tasmania]], the islands of [[Wallacea]], [[New Guinea]], the [[East Melanesian Islands]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Udvardy's Australian realm includes only Australia and Tasmania; he places [[Wallacea]] in the Indomalayan Realm, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and East Melanesia in the Oceanian Realm, and New Zealand in the Antarctic Realm.

The [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]] and [[Nearctic realm|Nearctic]] are sometimes grouped into the [[Holarctic realm]].

===Morrone (2015) biogeographic kingdoms===
Following the nomenclatural conventions set out in the [[International Code of Area Nomenclature]], Morrone (2015) defined the next biogeographic kingdoms (or realms) and regions:
* Holarctic kingdom Heilprin (1887)
** Nearctic region Sclater (1858)
** Palearctic region Sclater (1858)
* Holotropical kingdom Rapoport (1968)
** Neotropical region Sclater (1858)
** Ethiopian region Sclater (1858)
** Oriental region Wallace (1876)
* Austral kingdom Engler (1899)
** Cape region Grisebach (1872)
** Andean region Engler (1882)
** Australian region Sclater (1858)
** Antarctic region Grisebach (1872)
* Transition zones: 
** Mexican transition zone (Nearctic–Neotropical transition)
** Saharo-Arabian transition zone (Palearctic–Ethiopian transition)
** Chinese transition zone (Palearctic–Oriental transition zone transition) 
** Indo-Malayan, Indonesian or Wallace's transition zone (Oriental–Australian transition)
** South American transition zone (Neotropical–Andean transition)

==Freshwater biogeographic realms==
[[Image:Ocean drainage.png|300px|thumb|right|Major [[continental divide]]s, showing drainage into the major oceans and seas of the world&nbsp;– grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the ocean]]

The applicability of Udvardy (1975) scheme to most freshwater taxa is unresolved (Abell et al. 2008).

The drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world are marked by continental divides. The grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the ocean.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Marine biogeographic realms==
According to Briggs (1995) and Morrone (2009):
{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|
* Indo-West Pacific region

}}

According to the WWF scheme (Spalding, 2007):

{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|
*[[Arctic realm]]
*[[Temperate Northern Atlantic]] realm
*[[Temperate Northern Pacific]] realm
*[[Tropical Atlantic]] realm
