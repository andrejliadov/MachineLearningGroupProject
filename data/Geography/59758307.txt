In 2015, the circle was tested by [[Danny Quah]], who verified the claim but moved the circle slightly to exclude most of Japan and used a different [[map projection]] as well as more specific calculations. He calculated that, as of 2015, half the world's population lived within a {{convert|2050|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on|sp=us}} radius of the city of [[Mong Khet]] in [[Myanmar]].<ref name=quah/> 

The most common visual of the circle, originally used by Myers and also featured by ''[[io9]]''<ref>[https://io9.gizmodo.com/more-than-half-of-the-worlds-population-lives-inside-t-493103044 More than half of the world's population lives inside this circle], ''io9''</ref> and ''Tech in Asia'',<ref>[https://www.techinasia.com/population-world-lives-circle-asia-future-startups If More Than Half the Population of the World Lives in This Circle, Asia is the Future of Startups], ''Tech in Asia''</ref> used the [[Winkel tripel projection]].
