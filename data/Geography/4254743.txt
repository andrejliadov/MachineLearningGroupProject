{{distinguish|Choreography}}

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}</ref> and by extension such a description or map.<ref name=Merriam-Webster>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]</ref> This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".<ref>Helgerson 1992, p. 132.</ref> Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".<ref>Rohl 2011, p. 1.</ref>

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".<ref>J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.</ref>

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.<ref>See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.</ref> An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.<ref>British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.</ref> [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.<ref>John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.</ref>

The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}</ref> [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}</ref>

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}</ref>

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull (sic) Chorographers";<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}</ref> and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |url=https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryo00plot |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=[https://archive.org/details/naturalhistoryo00plot/page/299 299] }}</ref> and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}</ref> both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".<ref>{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.</ref> In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.<ref>[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.</ref>

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.<ref>Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.</ref>
