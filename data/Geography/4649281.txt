The '''bay owls''' ('''''Phodilus''''') are a [[genus]] of [[Old World]] [[Tytonidae|barn-owl]]s. The defining characteristics of bay owls are their smaller bodies, in comparison to other barn owls, and their U- or V-shaped faces.<ref name=":0" /> These owls can be found in South to Southeast Asia, and parts of central Africa within forest and grassland ecosystems.<ref name=":0" /> 

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus ''Phodilus'' was erected by the French zoologist [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1830.<ref name = "Geoffroy"/> Some taxonomists place two species in the genus, while others include three.<ref name="König"/> The name is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''phōs'' for "light" or "daylight" and ''deilos'' for "timid" or "cowardly".<ref name="Jobling"/>
Most classification schemes recognize three extant species in this genus:<ref name="IOC"/>

==Description==
Although bay owls are typically smaller, they bare resemblances to other barn owls.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Bay Owl|url=https://www.owlrescue.co.uk/project/bay-owl/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Owl Rescue|language=en-GB}}</ref> Other characteristics of the bay owl are groupings of feathers that resemble ears, and a divided face disk.<ref name=":0" /> Bay owls have also been attributed with U-or V-shaped faces.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="König" /> Their wings are rounded and their tail is chestnut-colored, with a few narrow, dark bars.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lewis|first=Deane|title=Oriental Bay Owl (Phodilus badius) - Information, Pictures, Sounds|url=https://www.owlpages.com/owls/species.php?s=270|access-date=2020-12-15|website=The Owl Pages|language=en}}</ref>  Their tarsi, or leg/foot bones, are relatively short and fully feathered to the joint.<ref name="König" /> Their toes are yellowish-brown with pale claws.<ref name="König" /> Their throat has a creamy color and their underparts are often a pale yellowish-brown, with speckles of blackish-brown coloring.<ref name="König" />

==Distribution and habitat==
The bay owl can be found in regions from India to Southeast Asia and Indonesia, as well as parts of central Africa.<ref name=":0" /> It is uncertain where the ancestors of these avians lived as the phylogeny of all species of bay owls has not been analyzed.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Uva|first=Vera|last2=Päckert|first2=Martin|last3=Cibois|first3=Alice|last4=Fumagalli|first4=Luca|last5=Roulin|first5=Alexandre|date=2018-08-01|title=Comprehensive molecular phylogeny of barn owls and relatives (Family: Tytonidae), and their six major Pleistocene radiations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790317306115|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|language=en|volume=125|pages=127–137|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2018.03.013|issn=1055-7903}}</ref> These owls can be found in both forests and grasslands, but are fairly scattered in their distribution.<ref name=":1" /> However, their primary habitat is within dense evergreen forests, where the owls may roost during the day in the opening of tree trunks or branches sheltered by palm tree leaves.<ref name=":0" /> They are often found roosting no more than 2 meters off the ground.<ref name=":0" /> They are most vulnerable in this state and not very alert.<ref name=":0" />
