This program is designed for both recent graduates and individuals with experience in the private or public sector in dealing with [[natural resource]]s and the [[Environmental quality|environment]]. The program seeks students from a range of disciplines including [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], [[geology]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[geography]], planning and [[social sciences]]. The program is recognized as an accredited [[sustainable planning]] program by the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cip-icu.ca/web/la/en/pa/5580378D83DC444EB76DE6A461BB2E21/template.asp|title=The Canadian Institute of Planners|accessdate=2010-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410083347/http://www.cip-icu.ca/web/la/en/pa/5580378D83DC444EB76DE6A461BB2E21/template.asp|archive-date=2009-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aashe.org/resources/grad_planning.php|title=AASHE: Graduate Programs in Sustainable Planning|accessdate=2010-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621023304/http://www.aashe.org/resources/grad_planning.php|archive-date=2010-06-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Degree requirements ==
The M.R.M. degree requires completion of six required courses (social science in [[natural resource management]], [[ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[earth systems]], research methods), six elective courses, a [[field workshop]], and a [[research project]].

The aim is to increase familiarity and competence in understanding the dynamics of natural resources, the strategies and techniques of natural resource and [[environmental planning]] and management, and the biological, physical, social, economic and institutional implications of resource decisions. Students also become familiar with various quantitative methods of analysis and aids to [[decision making]]. In the field of natural resources, in particular, it is important that an academic degree provide a foundation for problem-solving as well as creative and critical thinking rather than focus primarily on subject matter such as [[fisheries]], economics, or forestry.

Graduate student research projects required to complete the degree evaluate the effectiveness of existing natural resource management policies and, where appropriate, present alternatives. Students apply a range of approaches including [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[simulation modeling]], legal and institutional assessment frameworks, and social surveys to address critical and emerging natural resource management issues on local, national, and international scales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/research/publications/|title=REM Publications|accessdate=2010-03-29}}</ref>
