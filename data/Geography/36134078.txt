The '''Ice Warrior Project''' is an organisation founded in 2001 by the explorer [[Jim McNeill]]. Its remit is to develop people from all walks of life and echelons of society into modern-day explorers; to discover change in the worldâ€™s most remote regions under the guidance of partner leading scientific authorities; and deliver these discoveries in an engaging, human manner to audiences around the globe.<ref name="test">[http://www.ice-warrior.com/about Ice Warrior > About]</ref>

The organisation provides raw, scientific data for others to go on and interpret. Its rationale for doing so is that if we do not monitor these regions, which were described by Nobel peace prize nominee<ref name="nobel">[[Sheila Watt-Cloutier#Awards and honors|Sheila Watt-Cloutier Awards and Honours]]</ref> [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] as "clearly one of the most important regions when it comes to climate change.",<ref name="canada">{{Cite web |url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ja08/insidestory.asp |title=Canadian Geographic |access-date=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512025042/http://canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ja08/insidestory.asp |archive-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> then how will we know that any action to mitigate the human impact on our Earth is actually working?

The project's founder [[Jim McNeill]] maintains that without such knowledge how can we be true guardians of the planet on which we live? And if we are not, then this ultimately affects our chances of survival as a species. 

As an organisation it has an altruistic project side which relies on corporate sponsorship and involves charitable work and also an underpinning commercial side.
