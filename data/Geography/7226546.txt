'''''The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic&nbsp;– and How it Changed Science, Cities and the Modern World''''' is a book by [[Steven Berlin Johnson]] in which he describes the most intense outbreak of [[cholera]] in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[London]] and centers on [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] and [[Reverend Henry Whitehead|Henry Whitehead]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2007/03/the-ghost-map-by-steven-johnso|title=The Ghost Map by Steven Johnson|last=Prusak|first=Larry|date=2007-03-22|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2019-07-08|issn=0017-8012}}</ref>

It was released on 19 October 2006 through Riverhead. 

== Synopsis ==
The work covers the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. The two central figures are physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]], who created a map of the cholera cases, and the Reverend [[Reverend Henry Whitehead|Henry Whitehead]], whose extensive knowledge of the local community helped determine the initial cause of the outbreak.  Dr. John Snow was a revered anesthetist who carried out epidemiological work in Soho, London.   Around the mid-1850s Snow figured out the source of cholera contamination to be the drinking water from the Broad Street pump. 

== Reception ==
The New York Times reviewed ''The Ghost Map'', stating that there was "a great story here".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/books/review/Quammen.t.html|title=The Ghost Map By Steven Johnson - Books - Review|last=Quammen|first=David|date=2006-11-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A review posted in the ''International Journal of Epidemiology'' was largely favorable, stating that "the single weakness of this book is a bewildering final section which attempts to apply John Snow's work to a long list of contemporary problems. But for the reader prepared to put the book down at page 217, Steven Johnson has written a comprehensive, diversely sourced and insightful blockbuster account of a cholera outbreak in Victorian London."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Metcalfe|first=Chris|date=2007-08-01|title=The Ghost Map.
