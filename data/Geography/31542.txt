Minneapolis' city limits border those of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], the capital of Minnesota. From Downtown Minneapolis to Downtown Saint Paul is only 10 miles in length. This gave birth to the nickname of the region, the "[[Twin Cities]]" metropolitan area.]]

'''Twin cities''' are a special case of two [[city|cities]] or urban centres that are founded in close geographic proximity and then grow into each other over time, losing most of their mutual [[buffer zone]].

There are no precise criteria for twin-cityhood, but to be considered twin cities, the cities involved have to have a similar administrative status and somewhat comparable sizes; a [[suburb]] of a much larger population center is usually not considered to form a twin city with it. For example, [[South San Francisco]] (population about 65,000) is not considered a twin city with [[San Francisco]] (population about 850,000). However, cities considered twinned by proximity do not necessarily match demographically, economically, or politically.

In many historical cases, cities that grew into each other's space lost their individual identities, and the border or barrier originally separating them became almost irrelevant. An 1873 case of twin cities merging to become a united city is [[Budapest]] in Hungary, which began as two settlements ([[Buda]] and [[Pest (city)|Pest]]) facing each other across the [[Danube]] at a strategic [[ford (crossing)|fording place]] along a trade route.  In China, the three ancient cities of [[Hankou]], [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]], and [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]], separated by the junction of the [[Yangtze]] and [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Hanjiang]] rivers, were joined in 1927 into the single entity of [[Wuhan]].

Twin cities may share an airport into whose [[IATA airport code|airport codes]] are integrated the component initials, e.g., [[Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport|DFW]] ([[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]]), [[Leeds Bradford Airport|LBA]] ([[Leeds]]&ndash;[[Bradford]]), [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|MSP]] ([[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]), [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport|RDU]] ([[Raleigh]] and [[Durham, NC]]), and [[Akron–Canton Airport|CAK]] ([[Akron]]–[[Canton, Ohio]]).

In some cases, such as [[Albury]]/[[Wodonga]] in Australia, the two cities are permanently divided by a state border, often one that strictly adheres to a geographical landmark, such as the [[Murray River]] that divides [[New South Wales]] from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and thus Albury from Wodonga. In other cases twin cities can be divided by an international border, but retain a cultural and historical similarity, for example [[Haparanda]] ([[Sweden]]) and [[Tornio]] ([[Finland]]), [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] ([[Colombia]]) and [[Tabatinga]] ([[Brazil]]) or [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] ([[Estonia]]) and [[Valka]] ([[Latvia]]).
