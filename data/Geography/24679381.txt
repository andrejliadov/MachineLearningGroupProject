'''Central Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Центральна Україна}}, ''Tsentralna Ukrayina'') consists of historic regions of [[left-bank Ukraine]] and [[right-bank Ukraine]] that reference to the [[Dnieper]] river. It is situated away from the Black Sea Littoral North and a midstream of Dnieper river and its basin.

==Territory==
The territory is often associated with the 17th century [[Cossack Hetmanate]].

It mostly corresponds to:
* Generally, the territories in the Center of [[Ukraine]], Poltava
* [[Kyiv]], the northern Ukraine, [[Polissia]]
* portions of the northeastern Ukraine, [[Severia]], [[Little Russia]]
* Near western and southwestern Ukraine, eastern [[Podillia]]
Sometimes, a separate region of northern Ukraine is identified based on Severia and eastern Polissya, while Kirovohrad region is associated with the southern Ukraine and Black Sea Littoral.

Unlike the big cities of the Ukrainian south and east, the cities of the central Ukraine are among the oldest in Ukraine, among which are: Kyiv, [[Vinnytsia]], [[Poltava]], [[Chernihiv]]. Also in contrast to the southeastern portion of the country, the region is more agricultural with extensive grain and sunflower fields in the heart of Ukraine.

[[Surzhyk]], a term for mixed Russian-Ukrainian dialects, is commonly spoken throughout Central Ukraine, though, according to [[Sociological group "RATING"|RATING]] and [[Research & Branding Group]], most of the people self-identify as Ukrainian speakers.<ref name="RatingJuly12"/><ref>[http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poll_ukrainian_language_prevails_at_home_229692 Poll: Ukrainian language prevails at home] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728124303/http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/poll_ukrainian_language_prevails_at_home_229692 |date=2013-07-28 }}, [[Ukrinform]] (7 September 2011)</ref>  In the major cities of Central Ukraine, [[Russian language|Russian]] is the primary spoken language.

In a poll conducted by [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] in the first half of February 2014, only 5.4% of polled in Central Ukraine believed "Ukraine and [[Russia]] must unite into a single state", whereas nationwide this percentage was 12.5.<ref>[http://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=236&page=1 How relations between Ukraine and Russia should look like?

[[Elections in Ukraine|Elections]] in the Central Ukrainian [[Oblasts of Ukraine|oblasts]] (provinces) have historically been competitive between pro-Russian and pro-Western candidates.  However, since the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]], Central Ukrainian voters have started to lean toward more pro-Western parties ([[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]], [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"|Batkivshchyna]])<ref>[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 Центральна виборча комісія України - WWW відображення ІАС "Вибори народних депутатів України 2012"<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016140034/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vnd2012/WP406?PT001F01=900&pf7171=52 |date=2012-10-16 }}<br>[http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html CEC {{not a typo|substitues}} Tymoshenko, Lutsenko in voting papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813233711/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/08/30/111349.html |date=2014-08-13 }}</ref> and presidential candidates ([[Viktor Yuschenko]] and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]).<ref name=EWparties>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H23Pv4Ik3vMC&pg=PA396&dq=Ukrainian++parties+pro-Western+Bloc&hl=nl&ei=8OdZTczRCMueOteptKIL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Ukrainian%20%20parties%20pro-Western%20Bloc&f=false Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe] by [[Uwe Backes]] and [[Patrick Moreau]], [[Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36912-8}} (page 396)</ref><ref name=Umland>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/andreas-umland/ukraine-right-wing-politics-is-genie-out-of-bottle Ukraine right-wing politics: is the genie out of the bottle?], [[openDemocracy.net]] (January 3, 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=39981 Eight Reasons Why Ukraine’s Party of Regions Will Win the 2012 Elections] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (17 October 2012)<br>[http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf UKRAINE: Yushchenko needs Tymoshenko as ally again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515074305/http://www.taraskuzio.net/media20_files/8.pdf |date=2013-05-15 }} by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Oxford Analytica]] (5 October 2007)</ref>
