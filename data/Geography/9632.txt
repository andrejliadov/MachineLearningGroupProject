An '''ecosystem''' is a [[community (ecology)|community]] of living organisms in conjunction with the [[abiotic component|nonliving components]] of their environment, interacting as a [[system]].<ref>Tansley (1934); Molles (1999), p. 482; Chapin ''et al''.

[[Biodiversity]] affects ecosystem functioning, as do the processes of [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and [[Ecological succession|succession]]. Ecosystems provide a variety of [[Ecosystem services|goods and services]] upon which people depend.

== History ==
The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist [[Arthur Tansley]].<ref group="fn">The term "ecosystem" was actually coined by [[Arthur Roy Clapham]], who came up with the word at Tansley's request (Willis 1997).</ref><ref name = "Willis1997">Willis (1997)</ref> Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment.<ref name = "Chapin7">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 7–11)</ref> He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment".<ref name="Tansley1935">Tansley (1935)</ref> Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates".<ref name="Tansley1935" /> Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "[[ecotope]]".<ref name="Tansley1939">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1io8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PP1|title=The British Islands and Their Vegetation|last=Tansley|first=A.G.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1939|author-link=Arthur Tansley}}</ref>

[[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]], a [[limnologist]] who was a contemporary of Tansley's, combined [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]'s ideas about [[Trophic level|trophic]] ecology with those of Russian geochemist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. As a result, he suggested that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited [[Algal bloom|algal production]]. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. [[Raymond Lindeman]] took these ideas further to suggest that the flow of energy through a lake was the primary driver of the ecosystem. Hutchinson's students, brothers [[Howard T. Odum]] and [[Eugene P. Odum]], further developed a "systems approach" to the study of ecosystems. This allowed them to study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.<ref name = "Chapin7"/>

==Processes==

[[File:Vegetation.png|thumb|right|Biomes of the world]]

Ecosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. The most important of these is [[climate]].<ref name="Chapin112"/> Climate determines the [[biome]] in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of water and energy available to the ecosystem.<ref name="Chapin112"/>

[[Parent material]] determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. [[Topography]] also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like [[microclimate]], soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.<ref name="Chapin112"/>

Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. Similarly, the set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect ecosystems. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present.<ref name="Chapin112"/> The [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|last2=Martin|first2=Jean-Louis|last3=Genovesi|first3=Piero|last4=Maris|first4=Virginie|last5=Wardle|first5=David A.|last6=Aronson|first6=James|last7=Courchamp|first7=Franck|last8=Galil|first8=Bella|last9=García-Berthou|first9=Emili|date=2013|title=Impacts of biological invasions: what's what and the way forward|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution|volume=28|issue=1|pages=58–66|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2012.07.013|pmid=22889499|issn=0169-5347|hdl=10261/67376|hdl-access=free}}</ref>

Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Consequently, they are often subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].<ref name="Chapin112"/> While the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.<ref name="Chapin112"/> Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors.

===Primary production===
[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Global oceanic and terrestrial [[phototroph]] abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of [[autotroph]] biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential and not an actual estimate of it.]]
{{main|Primary production}}
Primary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through [[photosynthesis]]. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, [[soil carbon]] and [[fossil fuel]]s. It also drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]].

Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).<ref name = "Chapin97">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 97–104</ref> About half of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration.<ref>"Chapin ''et al.'' 2011, p. 157</ref> The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the [[net primary production]] (NPP).<ref name="Chapin123">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 123–150</ref> Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of [[leaf]] area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the [[chloroplast]]s to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out [[photosynthesis]].<ref name = "Chapin97"/>

===Energy flow===

{{main|Energy flow (ecology)}}
{{See also|Food web|Trophic level}}
[[Energy]] and [[carbon]] enter ecosystems through [[photosynthesis]], are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration.<ref name="Chapin123" />

The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes [[detritus]]. In [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, roughly 90% of the net primary production ends up being broken down by [[decomposition|decomposers]]. The remainder is either consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system, or it is consumed after it has died, and enters the detritus-based trophic system.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic systems]], the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by [[herbivore]]s is much higher.<ref name="Chapin244">Chapin ''et al''. (2002) pp. 244–264</ref>
In trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or [[secondary production|secondary producers]]—[[herbivores]]. Organisms which feed on [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) are termed [[microbivore]]s. Animals that feed on primary consumers—[[carnivore]]s—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a [[trophic level]].<ref name="Chapin244" />

The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a [[food chain]]. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey which is part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form [[food web]]s rather than food chains.<ref name="Chapin244" /> The food chain usually consists of five levels of consumption which are producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and decomposers.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Decomposition===
{{See also|Decomposition}}
[[File:Decomposition stages.jpg|thumb|Decomposition stages]]
The carbon and nutrients in [[soil organic matter|dead organic matter]] are broken down by a group of processes known as [[decomposition]]. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for [[photosynthesis]]. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.<ref name= Chapin151>Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 151–157</ref> Approximately 90% of terrestrial net primary production goes directly from plant to decomposer.<ref name = "Chapin244"/>

Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—[[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it).<ref name="Chapin151" /> Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include [[sugar]]s, [[amino acid]]s and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and much less important in dry ones.<ref name="Chapin151" />

Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed [[leaf litter]] may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[protoplasm|cell contents]] are protected by a [[cell wall]]. Newly dead animals may be covered by an [[exoskeleton]]. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition.<ref name= Chapin151/> Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. [[Freeze-thaw cycle]]s and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.<ref name= Chapin151/>

The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal [[hypha]]e produces enzymes that can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes which break down [[lignin]], which allows them access to both cell contents and the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.<ref name = "Chapin151"/>

Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems.<ref name="raul">{{cite journal |last1=Ochoa-Hueso |first1=R |last2=Delgado-Baquerizo |first2=M |last3=King |first3=PTA |last4=Benham |first4=M |last5=Arca |first5=V |last6=Power |first6=SA |title=Ecosystem type and resource quality are more important than global change drivers in regulating early stages of litter decomposition |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=February 2019 |volume=129 |pages=144–152 |doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.009 }}</ref> The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.<ref name = "Chapin159">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 159–174</ref> Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster the microbial decomposition occurs. It also affects soil moisture, which slows microbial growth and reduces leaching. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients which become available.<ref name = "Chapin159"/>

Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.<ref name = "Chapin159"/>

===Nutrient cycling===
{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Biogeochemical cycle|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Biological nitrogen cycling]]
Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider [[environment (systems)|environment]]. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological [[nitrogen fixation]], is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as [[fertilizer]].<ref name="Chapin197">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 197–215</ref>

Since most [[terrestrial ecosystems]] are nitrogen-limited, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycling]] is an important control on ecosystem production.<ref name="Chapin197" />

Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants that support nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the [[legume]] plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some [[cyanobacteria]] are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are [[phototroph]]s, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants.<ref name = "Chapin197"/> Other sources of nitrogen include [[acid deposition]] produced through the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[ammonia]] gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust.<ref name = "Chapin197"/> Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.<ref name = "Chapin197"/>

When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. This process is known as [[ammonification|nitrogen mineralization]]. Others convert ammonium to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions, a process known as [[nitrification]]. [[Nitric oxide]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are also produced during nitrification.<ref name = "Chapin197"/> Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to [[nitrogen|nitrogen gas]], a process known as [[denitrification]].<ref name = "Chapin197"/>

Other important nutrients include [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]] and [[manganese]].<ref name = "Chapin215">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 215–222</ref><ref name="raul"/> Phosphorus enters ecosystems through [[weathering]]. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the tropics).<ref name = "Chapin215"/> Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes. Potassium is primarily cycled between living cells and soil organic matter.<ref name = "Chapin215"/>

[[File:View of loch lomond.JPG|thumb|[[Loch Lomond]] in [[Scotland]] forms a relatively isolated ecosystem.

[[Biodiversity]] plays an important role in ecosystem functioning.<ref name="Schulze449">Schulze ''et al''. (2005), pp. 449–453</ref> The reason for this is that ecosystem processes are driven by the number of species in an ecosystem, the exact nature of each individual species, and the relative abundance of organisms within these species.<ref name="Chapin265">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 265–277</ref> Ecosystem processes are broad generalizations that actually take place through the actions of individual organisms. The nature of the organisms—the species, [[functional group (ecology)|functional groups]] and trophic levels to which they belong—dictates the sorts of actions these individuals are capable of carrying out and the relative efficiency with which they do so.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist, species must have some level of [[limiting similarity]]—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise one species would [[competitive exclusion|competitively exclude]] the other.<ref name="niche">{{cite book|last=Schoener|first=Thomas W.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|url=https://archive.org/details/princetonguideto00levi|url-access=limited|editor=[[Simon A. Levin]]|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2009|pages=[https://archive.org/details/princetonguideto00levi/page/n16 2]–13|chapter=Ecological Niche|isbn=978-0-691-12839-9}}</ref> Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear—additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example, but beyond some level of species richness, additional species may have little additive effect.<ref name = "Chapin265"/>

The addition (or loss) of species that are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. [[Keystone species]] tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.<ref name="Chapin265" /> Similarly, an [[ecosystem engineer]] is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Clive G.|last2=Lawton|first2=John H.|last3=Shachak|first3=Moshe|date=1994|title=Organisms as Ecosystem Engineers|journal=Oikos|volume=69|issue=3|pages=373–386|doi=10.2307/3545850|issn=0030-1299|jstor=3545850}}</ref>

===Dynamics===

Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.<ref name="Chapin2812"/> When a [[perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] occurs, an ecosystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its [[resistance (ecology)|resistance]]. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]].<ref name="Chapin2812"/> Time plays a role in the development of soil from bare rock and the [[ecological succession|recovery of a community from disturbance]].<ref name="Chapin112"/>

From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, a colder than usual winter, and a pest outbreak all are short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in [[net primary production]] [[decomposition]] rates, and other ecosystem processes.<ref name="Chapin2812"/> Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes—the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while [[methane]] production in eastern [[Siberia]]n lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name="Chapin2812"/>

[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] also plays an important role in ecological processes. [[F. Stuart Chapin III|F. Stuart Chapin]] and coauthors define disturbance as "a relatively discrete event in time and space that alters the structure of populations, communities, and ecosystems and causes changes in resources availability or the physical environment".<ref name = "Chapin 285">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 285</ref> This can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks to hurricanes and wildfires to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well as soil organic matter content.<ref name="Chapin2812"/> Disturbance is followed by [[ecological succession|succession]], a "directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resources supply."<ref name = "Chapin 285"/>

The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or [[Glacier|glacial]] advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo [[primary succession]]. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in [[secondary succession]] and a faster recovery.<ref name="Chapin2812"/> More severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.<ref name="Chapin2812"/>

The [[Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study]] started in 1963 to study the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains in New Hampshire]]. It was the first successful attempt to study an entire [[Watershed management|watershed]] as an ecosystem.

==Human activities==
Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external factors like climate.<ref name="Chapin112"/>

As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the effects of the human [[ecological footprint]]. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: [[Pollution|environmental pollution]], [[climate change]] and [[biodiversity loss]]. For [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s further threats include [[air pollution]], [[Soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]],  and [[deforestation]]. For [[aquatic ecosystems]] threats include also unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[microplastics]] pollution, [[water pollution]], the warming of oceans, and building on coastal areas.<ref name=":0">{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 978-0-412-74050-3 }}</ref>

Society is increasingly becoming aware that [[ecosystem services]] are not only limited but also that they are threatened by human activities. The need to better consider long-term [[ecosystem health]] and its role in enabling human habitation and economic activity is urgent and global advocacy associated to targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 15]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goal 15 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref> on sustainable ecosystem is growing. To help inform decision-makers, many ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic value to nature, for example through [[biodiversity banking]], is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, [[social responsibility]], business opportunities, and our future as a species.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}
