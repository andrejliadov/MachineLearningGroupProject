The term "'''Old World'''" is used commonly in the West to refer to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]] or the World Island), regarded collectively as the part of the [[world]] known to its population before contact with the "[[New World]]" (the [[Americas]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-world?show=2&t=1417643287 |title=Old World |work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/new%20world |title=New world |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}</ref>

==Etymology==
In the context of [[archaeology]] and [[world history]], the term "Old World" includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the [[Bronze Age]] onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early [[civilization]]s, mostly in the [[temperate]] zone between roughly the [[45th parallel north|45th]] and [[25th parallel north|25th]] parallels north, in the area of the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iranian plateau|Persian plateau]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]].

These regions were connected via the [[Silk Road]] trade route, and they have a pronounced [[Iron Age]] period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called [[Axial Age]], referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical [[Western world|Western]] ([[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]], "[[classics|classical]]"), [[Near Eastern]] ([[Zoroastrian]] and [[Abrahamic]]) and [[Far Eastern]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]]) cultural spheres.

==History==
The concept of the three [[continent]]s in the Old World, viz. [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]], goes back to [[classical antiquity]]. Their boundaries as defined by [[Ptolemy]] and other geographers of antiquity were drawn along the [[Nile]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This definition remained influential throughout the Middle Ages (see [[T and O map]]) and the [[Early Modern period]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Other names==
The [[mainland]] of [[Afro-Eurasia]] (excluding [[island]]s or island groups such as the [[British Isles]], [[Japan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]]) has been referred to as the "''World Island''". The term may have been coined by Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]] in ''[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]''.<ref>See Francis P. Sempa, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_14/sempa_mac2.html "Mackinder's World."] ''American Diplomacy'' (UNC.edu). Retrieved 8 September 2018.</ref>

The equivalent of the Old World had names in some of its ancient cultures, including [[Midgard]] in Germanic cosmology and [[Oikoumene]] among the Greeks.
