A '''geographer''' is a scientist whose area of study is [[geography]], the study of [[Earth]]'s natural environment and human society. The Greek prefix "geo" means "earth" and the Greek suffix, "graphy," meaning "description," so a geographer is someone who studies the earth. The word "[[geography]]" is a [[Middle French]] word that is believed to have been first used in 1540.<ref>{{cite web |title=geography (n.) |url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/geography |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=10 October 2018 |format=Web article |date=n.d.}}</ref>

Although geographers are historically known as people who make [[maps]], map making is actually the field of study of [[cartography]], a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to human society and how human society affects the natural environment.

In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society. Modern geographers are the primary practitioners of the GIS ([[geographic information system]]), who are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms.

The paintings by [[Johannes Vermeer]] titled ''[[The Geographer]]'' and ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668â€“69.

== Areas of study ==
{{History of geography sidebar}}

There are three major fields of study, which are further subdivided:
* [[Physical geography]]: including [[geomorphology]], [[hydrology]], [[glaciology]], [[biogeography]], [[climatology]], [[meteorology]], [[Pedology (soil study)|pedology]], [[oceanography]], [[geodesy]], and [[environmental geography]].
* [[Human geography]]: including [[Urban geography]], [[cultural geography]], [[economic geography]], [[political geography]], [[historical geography]], [[marketing geography]], [[health geography]], and [[social geography]].
* [[Regional geography]]: including [[atmosphere]], [[biosphere]], and [[lithosphere]]

The [[National Geographic Society]] identifies five broad key [[Five themes of geography|themes]] for geographers:
