The '''Sydney Harbour Bridge''' is an Australian heritage-listed steel [[through arch bridge]] across [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] that carries rail, vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic between the [[Sydney central business district]] (CBD) and the [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]]. The view of the bridge, the harbour, and the nearby [[Sydney Opera House]] is widely regarded as an iconic image of Sydney, and of Australia itself. The bridge is nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based design.<ref name="7bwh">{{cite web|title=7BridgesWalk.com.au|work=Bridge History|url=http://www.7bridgeswalk.com.au/pages/bridge-history.php#sydharbourbridge|access-date=23 October 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829175704/http://www.7bridgeswalk.com.au/pages/bridge-history.php#sydharbourbridge|archive-date=29 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=[[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]|date=14 August 2008|access-date=29 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512054556/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/sydney-harbour-bridge|archive-date=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Under the direction of [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] of the [[NSW Public Works|New South Wales Department of Public Works]], the bridge was designed and built by British firm [[Dorman Long]] of [[Middlesbrough]] (who based the design on their 1928 [[Tyne Bridge]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]) and opened in 1932.<ref name="pl-jb">{{cite web|title=Dr J.J.C.

This general design document, however, did not form any part of the request for tender, which remained sufficiently broad as to allow cantilever (Bradfield's original preference) and even suspension bridge proposals. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from their own Tyne Bridge which, though superficially similar, does not share the graceful flares at the ends of each arch which make the harbour bridge so distinctive.<ref name=bridging-sydney>{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturemedia.com/aa/aaissue.php?article=3&issueid=200703&typeon=1#jumptoitem2007030301|title=Radar Exhibition â€“ Bridging Sydney|year=2007|author=James Weirick|access-date=20 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906134244/https://www.architecturemedia.com/aa/aaissue.php?issueid=200703&article=3&typeon=1#jumptoitem2007030301|archive-date=6 September 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all|author-link=James Weirick}}</ref> It is the [[List of the largest arch bridges|seventh longest spanning-arch bridge]] in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring {{Convert|134|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from top to water level.<ref name="culture.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/harbourbridge|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge|work=culture.gov.au|publisher=Australian Government|access-date=1 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920172424/http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/harbourbridge/|archive-date=20 September 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was also the world's widest long-span bridge, at {{convert|48.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, until construction of the new [[Port Mann Bridge]] in [[Vancouver]] was completed in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/10000/widest-bridge|title=Widest Bridge|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]]|access-date=15 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914200138/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/10000/widest-bridge|archive-date=14 September 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pmh1project.com/in-your-community/in-your-community-port-mann-bridge/Pages/default.aspx|title=Port Mann Bridge|year=2007|work=TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT CORPORATION|publisher=Province of British Columbia|location=British Columbia|access-date=15 September 2012|quote=Once complete, the new 10-lane Port Mann Bridge will the second largest and longest cable-supported bridge in North America, and at 65 metres wide it will be the widest bridge in the world.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911095545/http://www.pmh1project.com/in-your-community/in-your-community-port-mann-bridge/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=11 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Structure==
[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge from the air.JPG|thumb|Sydney Harbour from the air, showing the Opera House, the CBD, Circular Quay, the Bridge, the Parramatta River, North Sydney and Kirribilli in the foreground]]
The southern end of the bridge is located at [[Dawes Point, New South Wales|Dawes Point]] in [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]] area, and the northern end at [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] in the lower [[North Shore (Sydney)|North Shore]] area. There are six original lanes of road traffic through the main roadway, plus an additional two lanes of road traffic on its eastern side, using lanes that were formerly [[Trams in Sydney|tram tracks]]. Adjacent to the road traffic, a path for pedestrian use runs along the eastern side of the bridge, whilst a dedicated path for bicycle use only runs along the western side; between the main roadway and the western bicycle path lies the [[North Shore railway line]].

[[File:A close view of Sydney Harbour Bridge at night.jpg|thumb|A close view of Sydney Harbour Bridge at night]]
The main roadway across the bridge is known as the [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]] and is about {{Convert|2.4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long, making it one of the shortest highways in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factsforkids.net/sydney-harbour-bridge-facts-kids/|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge Facts for Kids|date=2016-05-12|website=Facts For Kids|access-date=2018-12-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227085405/http://factsforkids.net/sydney-harbour-bridge-facts-kids/|archive-date=27 December 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Abutment]]s at the base of the pylons are essential to support the loads from the arch and hold its span firmly in place, but the pylons themselves have no structural purpose. They were included to provide a frame for the arch panels and to give better visual balance to the bridge. The pylons were not part of the original design, and were only added to allay public concern about the structural integrity of the bridge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lalor|first=Peter|title=The bridge|page=142|publisher=Allen & Unwin|origyear=2005|year=2006|isbn=978-1-74175-027-0}}</ref>

Although originally added to the bridge solely for their aesthetic value, all four pylons have now been put to use. The south-eastern pylon contains a museum and tourist centre, with a 360Â° lookout at the top providing views across the harbour and city. The south-western pylon is used by the New South Wales [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] (RTA) to support its [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras overlooking the bridge and the roads around that area. The two pylons on the north shore include venting chimneys for fumes from the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]], with the base of the southern pylon containing the RMS maintenance shed for the bridge, and the base of the northern pylon containing the traffic management shed for tow trucks and safety vehicles used on the bridge.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

In 1942, the pylons were modified to include parapets and anti-aircraft guns designed to assist in both Australia's defence and general war effort.<ref>{{cite web|title=1942â€“1945 (WWII)|url=http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/PylonLookoutMediaKit.pdf|work=The Pylon Lookout|year=2004|access-date=24 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314082136/http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/PylonLookoutMediaKit.pdf|archive-date=14 March 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The top level of stonework was never removed.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

There had been plans to build a bridge as early as 1815, when [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] and noted architect [[Francis Greenway]] reputedly proposed to Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] that a bridge be built from the northern to the southern shore of the harbour.<ref name=culture.gov /><ref name="shb-archives37">{{cite web|title=Archives In Brief 37 â€“ A brief history of the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/guides-and-finding-aids/archives-in-brief/archives-in-brief-37/|work=The State Archives|publisher=NSW Government|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218203227/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/guides-and-finding-aids/archives-in-brief/archives-in-brief-37|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1825, Greenway wrote a letter to the then "The Australian" newspaper stating that such a bridge would "give an idea of strength and magnificence that would reflect credit and glory on the colony and the Mother Country".<ref name="shb-archives37" />

Nothing came of Greenway's suggestions, but the idea remained alive, and many further suggestions were made during the nineteenth century. In 1840, naval architect Robert Brindley proposed that a [[Pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] be built. Engineer Peter Henderson produced one of the earliest known drawings of a bridge across the harbour around 1857. A suggestion for a [[truss bridge]] was made in 1879, and in 1880 a high-level bridge estimated at Â£850,000 was proposed.<ref name="shb-archives37" />

In 1900, the [[Lyne ministry|Lyne government]] committed to building a new [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]] and organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a harbour bridge. Local engineer [[Norman Selfe]] submitted a design for a [[suspension bridge]] and won the second prize of Â£500. In 1902, when the outcome of the first competition became mired in controversy, Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for a steel [[cantilever bridge]]. The selection board were unanimous, commenting that, "The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and... the outline is graceful".<ref name="Freyne">{{cite book |title= Norman Selfe, Man of the North Shore|last= Arthur|first= Ian |year= 2001|publisher=unpublished essay submitted for the North Shore History Prize|pages=21â€“24}} Cited in {{cite web|url = http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/selfe_norman|title = Selfe, Norman|last = Freyne|first = Catherine|year = 2009|work = [[Dictionary of Sydney]]|access-date = 26 May 2012|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120624064441/http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/selfe_norman|archive-date = 24 June 2012|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> However due to an economic downturn and a change of government at the [[1904 New South Wales state election|1904 NSW State election]] construction never began.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

A unique three-span bridge was proposed in 1922 by Ernest Stowe with connections at [[Balls Head Reserve|Balls Head]], [[Millers Point, New South Wales|Millers Point]], and [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] with a memorial tower and hub on [[Goat Island (Port Jackson)|Goat Island]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Design Tenders and Proposals|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bostes.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/design-tenders-and-proposals.php|publisher=NSW Government|access-date=3 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911105231/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bostes.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/design-tenders-and-proposals.php|archive-date=11 September 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=McCallum|first1=Jake|title=Rare plans for the Sydney Harbour Bridge show how the iconic landmark could have looked|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/the-hills/lifeline-to-auction-off-plans-for-the-sydney-harbour-bridge-after-donation-of-rare-documents/news-story/81d30d48e90ca6e90b05c41136f3d46b|access-date=3 September 2016|work=Hornsby Advocate|publisher=News Corp|date=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819131504/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/the-hills/lifeline-to-auction-off-plans-for-the-sydney-harbour-bridge-after-donation-of-rare-documents/news-story/81d30d48e90ca6e90b05c41136f3d46b|archive-date=19 August 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Planning===
In 1914 [[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] was appointed "Chief Engineer of Sydney Harbour Bridge and Metropolitan Railway Construction", and his work on the project over many years earned him the legacy as the "father" of the bridge.<ref name="pl-jb" /> Bradfield's preference at the time was for a [[cantilever bridge]] without piers, and in 1916 the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|NSW Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill for such a construction, however it did not proceed as the [[New South Wales Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] rejected the legislation on the basis that the money would be better spent on the war effort.<ref name=shb-archives37 />

Following [[World War I]], plans to build the bridge again built momentum.<ref name=culture.gov /> Bradfield persevered with the project, fleshing out the details of the specifications and financing for his cantilever bridge proposal, and in 1921 he travelled overseas to investigate tenders. On return from his travels Bradfield decided that an arch design would also be suitable<ref name=shb-archives37 /> and he and officers of the NSW Department of Public Works prepared a general design<ref name=culture.gov /> for a single-arch bridge based upon [[New York City]]'s [[Hell Gate Bridge]].<ref name=bridging-sydney /><ref name=repaint-rta>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/resources/documents/permanent_panels/sydney_harbour_bridge.pdf|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge repainting|publisher=NSW [[Roads and Traffic Authority]]|access-date=1 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713090933/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/resources/documents/permanent_panels/sydney_harbour_bridge.pdf|archive-date=13 July 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1922 the government passed the Sydney Harbour Bridge Act No. 28, specifying the construction of a high-level cantilever or arch bridge across the harbour between Dawes Point and Milsons Point, along with construction of necessary approaches and electric railway lines,<ref name=shb-archives37 /> and worldwide [[Request for tender|tender]]s were invited for the project.<ref name=pl-jb />

[[File:Hell Gate Bridge cricket.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hell Gate Bridge]] in [[New York City]] inspired the final design of Sydney Harbour Bridge.]]
As a result of the tendering process, the government received twenty proposals from six companies; on 24 March 1924 the contract was awarded to British firm [[Dorman Long|Dorman Long and Co Ltd]], of [[Middlesbrough]] well known as the contractors who later built the similar [[Tyne Bridge]] of [[Newcastle Upon Tyne]], for an arch bridge at a quoted price of [[Australian pound|AUÂ£]]4,217,721 11s 10d.<ref name=pl-jb /><ref name=shb-archives37 /> The arch design was cheaper than alternative cantilever and [[suspension bridge]] proposals, and also provided greater [[Stiffness|rigidity]] making it better suited for the heavy loads expected.<ref name=shb-archives37 />

Bradfield and his staff were ultimately to oversee the bridge design and building process as it was executed by Dorman Long and Co, whose Consulting Engineer, [[Ralph Freeman (1880â€“1950)|Sir Ralph Freeman]] of [[Charles Douglas Fox#Douglas Fox & Partners|Sir Douglas Fox and Partners]], and his associate Mr. G.C. Imbault, carried out the detailed design and erection process of the bridge.<ref name=pl-jb /> Architects for the contractors were from the British firm [[John James Burnet|John Burnet & Partners]] of [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name="glasgowsculpture"/> Lawrence Ennis, of Dorman Long, served as Director of Construction and primary onsite supervisor throughout the entire build, alongside Edward Judge, Dorman Long's Chief Technical Engineer, who functioned as Consulting and Designing Engineer.

The building of the bridge coincided with the construction of a system of [[Sydney underground railways|underground railways]] in Sydney's CBD, known today as the [[City Circle]], and the bridge was designed with this in mind. The bridge was designed to carry six lanes of road traffic, flanked on each side by two railway tracks and a footpath. Both sets of rail tracks were linked into the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] on the south (city) side of the bridge by symmetrical ramps and tunnels. The eastern-side railway tracks were intended for use by a planned rail link to the [[Northern Beaches]];<ref>{{cite NSW HD|4800281|Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> in the interim they were used to carry [[Trams in Sydney|trams]] from the North Shore into a terminal within Wynyard station, and when tram services were discontinued in 1958, they were converted into extra traffic lanes. The [[Bradfield Highway, Sydney|Bradfield Highway]], which is the main roadway section of the bridge and its approaches, is named in honour of Bradfield's contribution to the bridge.

Bradfield visited the site sporadically throughout the eight years it took Dorman Long to complete the bridge. Despite having originally championed a cantilever construction and the fact that his own arched general design was used in neither the tender process nor as input to the detailed design specification (and was anyway a rough copy of the Devil's Gate bridge produced by the NSW Works Department), Bradfield subsequently attempted to claim personal credit for Dorman Long's design.  This led to a bitter argument, with Dorman Long maintaining that instructing other people to produce a copy of an existing design in a document not subsequently used to specify the final construction did not constitute personal design input on Bradfield's part. This friction ultimately led to a large contemporary brass plaque being bolted very tightly to the side of one of the granite columns of the bridge in order to makes things clear.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The official ceremony to mark the "turning of the first sod" occurred on 28 July 1923, on the spot at Milsons Point on the north shore where two workshops to assist in building the bridge were to be constructed.<ref name="bos-time">{{cite web|title=Six million rivets: The timeline|url=http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|work=Sydney Harbour Bridge|publisher=NSW Government: Board of Studies|access-date=26 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221151649/http://sydney-harbour-bridge.bos.nsw.edu.au/building-the-bridge/rivets.php|archive-date=21 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>North Shore Bridge ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 October 1923 page 417</ref>

An estimated 469 buildings on the north shore, both private homes and commercial operations, were demolished to allow construction to proceed, with little or no compensation being paid. Work on the bridge itself commenced with the construction of approaches and approach spans, and by September 1926 concrete piers to support the approach spans were in place on each side of the harbour.<ref name="bos-time" />

As construction of the approaches took place, work was also started on preparing the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] required to support the enormous weight of the arch and loadings. Concrete and granite faced [[Abutment|abutment towers]] were constructed, with the angled foundations built into their sides.<ref name="bos-time" />

Once work had progressed sufficiently on the support structures, a giant [[Crane (machine)|"creeper crane"]] was erected on each side of the harbour.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholson|first=John|title=Building the Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|format=Google books|access-date=10 December 2009|year=2001|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=978-1-86508-258-5|page=14|quote=There was one creeper crane on each side of the harbour.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101135121/https://books.google.com/books?id=1DXydVvXi4EC|archive-date=1 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> These cranes were fitted with a cradle, and then used to hoist men and materials into position to allow for erection of the steelwork. To stabilise works while building the arches, tunnels were excavated on each shore with [[Wire rope|steel cables]] passed through them and then fixed to the upper sections of each half-arch to stop them collapsing as they extended outwards.<ref name="bos-time" />

Arch construction itself began on 26 October 1928. The southern end of the bridge was worked on ahead of the northern end, to detect any errors and to help with alignment. The cranes would "creep" along the arches as they were constructed, eventually meeting up in the middle. In less than two years, on Tuesday, 19 August 1930, the two halves of the arch touched for the first time. Workers riveted both top and bottom sections of the arch together, and the arch became self-supporting, allowing the support cables to be removed. On 20 August 1930 the joining of the arches was celebrated by flying the flags of [[Flag of Australia|Australia]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] from the jibs of the creeper cranes.<ref name="bos-time"/><ref>The Sydney Harbour Bridge ''Railway Gazette'' 18 March 1932 page 433</ref>

[[File:JJC Bradfield Sydney Harbour Bridge 1932.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Bradfield (engineer)|John Bradfield]] riding the first test train across the bridge on 19 January 1932]]
Once the arch was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked back down the arches, allowing the roadway and other parts of the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical [[Tie (engineering)|hangers]] were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal crossbeams. The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the crossbeams, with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled. Rails for trains and trams were laid, and road was surfaced using concrete topped with asphalt.<ref name="bos-time" /> Power and telephone lines, and water, gas, and drainage pipes were also all added to the bridge in 1931.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

The pylons were built atop the abutment towers, with construction advancing rapidly from July 1931. [[Carpenter]]s built wooden [[scaffold]]ing, with concreters and masons then setting the [[masonry]] and pouring the concrete behind it. [[wikt:ganger|Gangers]] built the steelwork in the towers, while [[Day labor|day labourers]] manually cleaned the granite with wire brushes. The last stone of the north-west pylon was set in place on 15 January 1932, and the timber towers used to support the cranes were removed.<ref name="pl-ph22" /><ref name="bos-time" />

On 19 January 1932, the first test train, a steam locomotive, safely crossed the bridge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16834951|title=FIRST TRAIN TO CROSS THE BRIDGE.|date=20 January 1932|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|issue=29,342|location=New South Wales, Australia|page=14|via=National Library of Australia|accessdate=2 February 2017}}</ref> [[Load testing]] of the bridge took place in February 1932, with the four rail tracks being loaded with as many as 96 [[steam locomotive]]s positioned end-to-end. The bridge underwent testing for three weeks, after which it was declared safe and ready to be opened.<ref name="bos-time" /> The construction worksheds were demolished after the bridge was completed, and the land that they were on is now occupied by Luna Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lunaparksydney.com/about|title=About Luna Park - Amusement Park in Sydney {{!}} Luna Park Sydney|website=www.lunaparksydney.com|access-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216215808/http://www.lunaparksydney.com/about|archive-date=16 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Several more were injured from unsafe working practices undertaken whilst heating and inserting its rivets, and the deafness experienced by many of the workers in later years was blamed on the project.

Interviews were conducted between 1982-1989 with a variety of tradesmen who worked on the building of the bridge.

===Opening===
The bridge was formally opened on Saturday, 19 March 1932.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan|title=Events That Shaped Australia|pages=140â€“142|publisher=New Holland|year=2006|isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref> Among those who attended and gave speeches were the [[Governor of New South Wales]], Sir [[Philip Game]], and the Minister for Public Works, [[Lawrence Ennis]]. The [[Premier of New South Wales]], [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], was to open the bridge by cutting a ribbon at its southern end.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

[[File:De Groot cutting the ribbon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Francis de Groot]] declares the bridge open]]
However, just as Lang was about to cut the ribbon, a man in military uniform rode up on a horse, slashing the ribbon with his sword and opening the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the name of the people of New South Wales before the official ceremony began. He was promptly arrested.<ref name=natgeo>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/on-this-day-in-history-opening-of-the-sydney-harbour-bridge.htm|title=On this day in history: Sydney Harbour Bridge opens|work=[[Australian Geographic]]|access-date=17 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706101439/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/on-this-day-in-history-opening-of-the-sydney-harbour-bridge.htm|archive-date=6 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The ribbon was hurriedly retied and Lang performed the official opening ceremony and Game thereafter inaugurated the name of the bridge as 'Sydney Harbour Bridge' and the associated roadway as the 'Bradfield Highway'. After they did so, there was a [[21-gun salute]] and an [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[flypast]]. The intruder was identified as [[Francis de Groot]]. He was convicted of offensive behaviour and fined Â£5 after a psychiatric test proved he was sane, but this verdict was reversed on appeal. De Groot then successfully sued the Commissioner of Police for wrongful arrest and was awarded an undisclosed out of court settlement. De Groot was a member of a right-wing paramilitary group called the [[New Guard]], opposed to Lang's leftist policies and resentful of the fact that a member of the Royal Family had not been asked to open the bridge.<ref name=natgeo/> De Groot was not a member of the regular army but his uniform allowed him to blend in with the real cavalry. This incident was one of several involving Lang and the New Guard during that year.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

A similar ribbon-cutting ceremony on the bridge's northern side by North Sydney's mayor, Alderman Primrose, was carried out without incident. It was later discovered that Primrose was also a New Guard member but his role in and knowledge of the de Groot incident, if any, are unclear.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The pair of golden scissors used in the ribbon cutting ceremonies on both sides of the bridge was also used to cut the ribbon at the dedication of the [[Bayonne Bridge]], which had opened between [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and [[New York City]] the year before.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two States Open Bayonne Bridge, Forming Fifth Link|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/11/15/archives/two-states-open-bay-onne-bridge-forming-fifth-link-new-york-and-new.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 November 1931|page=1|access-date=30 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723064620/https://www.nytimes.com/1931/11/15/archives/two-states-open-bay-onne-bridge-forming-fifth-link-new-york-and-new.html|archive-date=23 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hails Bridge at Sydney|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/03/18/archives/hails-bridge-at-sydney-port-authority-sends-greetings-on-completion.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 March 1932|page=43|access-date=30 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723064703/https://www.nytimes.com/1932/03/18/archives/hails-bridge-at-sydney-port-authority-sends-greetings-on-completion.html|archive-date=23 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Despite the bridge opening in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], opening celebrations were organised by the Citizens of Sydney Organising Committee, an influential body of prominent men and politicians that formed in 1931 under the chairmanship of the [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|lord mayor]] to oversee the festivities. The celebrations included an array of decorated [[Float (parade)|floats]], a procession of passenger ships sailing below the bridge, and a [[Venetian Carnival]].<ref>{{cite book | author= New South Wales Government Printing Office | year= 1932 | title= Photographs of Opening of Sydney Harbour Bridge [picture] | publisher= Government Printing Office, Sydney | url= https://primo-slnsw.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ADLIB110345241&context=L&vid=SLNSW&search_scope=EEA&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US | access-date= 15 January 2017 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180102035252/https://primo-slnsw.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=ADLIB110345241&context=L&vid=SLNSW&search_scope=EEA&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US | archive-date= 2 January 2018 | url-status= live | df= dmy-all }}</ref> A message from a primary school in [[Tottenham, New South Wales|Tottenham]], {{Convert|515|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in rural New South Wales, arrived at the bridge on the day and was presented at the opening ceremony.

From left: walkway, eight traffic lanes (the two leftmost once carried the [[Trams in Sydney|Sydney trams]]), two railway tracks, and cycleway. The gantries with lights controlling traffic tidal flow are clearly visible, while the tollbooths can be seen near the bases of the high-rise buildings]]
From the Sydney CBD side, motor vehicle access to the bridge is normally via Grosvenor Street, Clarence Street, Kent Street, the [[Cahill Expressway]], or the Western Distributor. Drivers on the northern side will find themselves on the [[Warringah Freeway]], though it is easy to turn off the freeway to drive westwards into [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] or eastwards to Neutral Bay and beyond upon arrival on the northern side.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

The bridge originally only had four wider traffic lanes occupying the central space which now has six, as photos taken soon after the opening clearly show. In 1958 tram services across the bridge were withdrawn and the tracks replaced by two extra road lanes; these lanes are now the leftmost southbound lanes on the bridge and are still clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes. Lanes 7 and 8 now connect the bridge to the elevated Cahill Expressway that carries traffic to the Eastern Distributor.

In 1988, work began to build a tunnel to complement the bridge. It was determined that the bridge could no longer support the increased traffic flow of the 1980s. The [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]] was completed in August 1992 and carries only motor vehicles.

The Bradfield Highway is designated as a [[Stock route|Travelling Stock Route]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org.au/articles/nsw-drovers-rally-to-save-historic-travelling|publisher=The Wilderness Society|title=NSW drovers rally to save historic travelling stock routes|access-date=5 July 2009|date=27 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222021821/http://www.wilderness.org.au/campaigns/wildcountry/nsw-drovers-rally-to-save-historic-travelling|archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> which means that it is permissible to herd livestock across the bridge, but only between midnight and dawn, and after giving notice of intention to do so. In practice, owing to the high-density urban nature of modern Sydney, and the relocation of abattoirs and markets, this has not taken place for approximately half a century.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Tidal flow===
The bridge is equipped for [[Reversible lane|tidal flow operation]], permitting the direction of traffic flow on the bridge to be altered to better suit the morning and evening rush hours' traffic patterns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/managingtraffic/tmc_network.html |title=Managing the network < Managing NSW traffic < Using roads < Roads and Maritime Services |publisher=Rms.nsw.gov.au |date=6 September 2013 |access-date=9 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610211513/http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/managingtraffic/tmc_network.html |archive-date=10 June 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The bridge has eight lanes in total, numbered one to eight from west to east. Lanes three, four and five are reversible. One and two always flow north. Six, seven, and eight always flow south. The default is four each way. For the morning rush hour, the lane changes on the bridge also require changes to the [[Warringah Freeway]], with its inner western reversible carriageway directing traffic to the bridge lane numbers three and four southbound.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

The bridge has a series of overhead gantries which indicate the direction of flow for each traffic lane. A green arrow pointing down to a traffic lane means the lane is open. A flashing red "X" indicates the lane is closing, but is not yet in use for traffic travelling in the other direction. A static red "X" means the lane is in use for oncoming traffic. This arrangement was introduced in the 1990s, replacing a slow operation where lane markers were manually moved to mark the centre median.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

It is possible to see odd arrangements of flow during night periods when maintenance occurs, which may involve completely closing some lanes. Normally this is done between midnight and dawn, because of the enormous traffic demands placed on the bridge outside these hours.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

When the Sydney Harbour Tunnel opened in August 1992, Lane 7 became a [[bus lane]].<ref>Harbour Bridge Public Transport Lane ''[[Fleetline (periodical)|Fleetline]]'' issue 198 January 1992 page 13</ref><ref>Opening of Sydney Harbour Tunnel & Gore Hill Freeway ''[[Australian Bus Panorama]]'' issue 8/3 October 1992 page 38</ref>

===Tolls===
[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge toll gates, 1933.jpg|thumb|Northbound view of toll gates, 1933]]
The vehicular traffic lanes on the bridge are operated as a [[toll road]]. As of October 2019, there is a variable tolling system for all vehicles headed into the CBD (southbound). The toll paid is dependent on the time of day in which the vehicle passes through the toll plaza. The toll varies from a minimum value of $2.50 to a maximum value of $4.<ref>[https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/sydney-motorways/documents/sydney-motorways-toll-charges.pdf Sydney Motorway Toll Charges ] Transport for NSW 1 October 2019</ref>  There is no toll for northbound traffic (though taxis travelling north may charge passengers the toll in anticipation of the toll the taxi must pay on the return journey). In 2017, the Bradfield Highway northern toll plaza infrastructure was removed and replaced with new overhead gantries to service all southbound traffic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/northern-toll-plaza/index.html|title=Northern toll plaza precinct upgrade|last=NSW|first=Roads and Maritime Services|work=Roads and Maritime Services|access-date=2018-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925104407/https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/northern-toll-plaza/index.html|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> And following on from this upgrade, in 2018 all southern toll plaza infrastructure was also removed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/southern-toll-plaza/index.html|title=Southern toll plaza precinct upgrade|last=NSW|first=Roads and Maritime Services|work=Roads and Maritime Services|access-date=2018-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925141949/https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/southern-toll-plaza/index.html|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Only the Cahill Expressway toll plaza infrastructure remains.
The toll was originally placed on travel across the bridge, in both directions, to recoup the cost of its construction. This was paid off in 1988, but the toll has been kept (indeed increased) to recoup the costs of the [[Sydney Harbour Tunnel]].<ref>At Last! Sydney Harbour Bridge Paid For ''[[Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|Daily Telegraph]]'' 25 July 1988 page 1</ref><ref>[https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/dont-we-own-the-bridge-yet/news-story/470a79a8df85451a62546f1ee5a43a1f?sv=9d46fd6e74ef2ce70a1cf9189001bdf4 Don't we own the Bridge yet?] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 15 June 2009</ref>

After the decision to build the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was made in the early 1980s, the toll was increased (from 20 cents to $1, then to $1.50, and finally to $2 by the time the tunnel opened) to pay for its construction. The tunnel also had an initial toll of $2 southbound. After the increase to $1, the concrete barrier on the bridge separating the Bradfield Highway from the Cahill Expressway was increased in height, because of the large numbers of drivers crossing it illegally from lane 6 to 7, to avoid the toll. The toll for all southbound vehicles was increased to $3 in March 2004.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Originally it cost a car or motorcycle six pence to cross, a horse and rider being three pence. Use of the bridge by bicycle riders (provided that they use the cycleway) and by pedestrians is free. Later governments capped the fee for motorcycles at one-quarter of the passenger-vehicle cost, but now it is again the same as the cost for a passenger vehicle, although quarterly flat-fee passes are available which are much cheaper for frequent users.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Motorcyclists|url = https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|website = myrta.com|access-date = 12 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150614025012/https://www.myrta.com/wps/portal/extvp/myrta/etoll/motorcyclists/!ut/p/b1/dcrdEkJAGIDha-kK9ls_LYdGFIuIbwcnxmjGSPkpKl19uoDO3nfmITnJVCYz0DWVkZTkXfls6nJq-q68_j7fFnCwQoESo0ehATgnxeWyRNeSSbYC9hcYlCQkBaWIL9DPXDc-4BQ-N9vhYTsUd9gnIPPF1GZMUucev8ZYRDQOcFqqwsUEe-4PIUeYG9SmpX273tnzuN8FUOlU2JFlhMOYUtyQW76vv8TAB_4!/|archive-date = 14 June 2015|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Originally there were six toll booths at the southern end of the bridge, these were replaced by 16 booths in 1950.<ref>Sydney Harbour Bridge ''[[Truck & Bus Transportation]]'' March 1950 page 9</ref> The toll was charged in both directions until 4 July 1970 when changed to only be applied to southbound traffic.<ref>Reaching the North ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 200 June 1982 page 23</ref>

In July 2008 a new electronic tolling system called [[e-TAG]] was introduced. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel was converted to this new tolling system while the Sydney Harbour Bridge itself had several cash lanes. The electronic system as of 12 January 2009 has now replaced all booths with E-tag lanes.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/motorwaysandtolling/200807shb_lanechanges.html?hhid=shbcashless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217110129/http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/motorwaysandtolling/200807shb_lanechanges.html?hhid=shbcashless|date=17 February 2009}}</ref> In January 2017 work commenced to remove the southern toll booths.<ref>[http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/southern-toll-plaza.html Southern toll plaza precinct upgrade] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106010821/http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-inner/sydney-harbour-bridge/tolling-projects/southern-toll-plaza.html |date=6 January 2017 }} Roads & Maritime Services</ref> In August 2020, the remaining toll booths at Milsons Point were removed.<ref>[https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/sydney-harbour-bridge-toll-booths-to-be-removed Sydney Harbour Bridge toll booths to be removed] Transport for NSW 15 June 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/projects/sydney-harbour-bridge/northern-toll-plaza.html Northern toll plaza precinct upgrade] Roads & Maritime Services</ref>

===Pedestrians===
[[File:Sydney Harbour Bridge cyclist.jpg|thumb|A cyclist using the cycleway. Side [[welded wire mesh fence|fence]]s were added to prevent people from committing [[suicide]] by jumping from the bridge.]]
The pedestrian-only footway is located on the east side of the bridge. Access from the northern side involves climbing an easily spotted flight of stairs, located on the east side of the bridge at Broughton St, [[Kirribilli, New South Wales|Kirribilli]]. Pedestrian access on the southern side is more complicated, but signposts in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]] area now direct pedestrians to the long and sheltered flight of stairs that leads to the bridge's southern end. These stairs are located near Gloucester Street and Cumberland Street.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

The bridge can also be approached from the south by accessing Cahill Walk, which runs along the [[Cahill Expressway]]. Pedestrians can access this walkway from the east end of Circular Quay by a flight of stairs or a lift. Alternatively it can be accessed from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sydneycoastwalks.com.au/sydney-harbour-bridge-walk/|title= Sydney Harbour Bridge Walk|access-date= 1 April 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190401054637/https://www.sydneycoastwalks.com.au/sydney-harbour-bridge-walk/|archive-date= 1 April 2019|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>

===Cyclists===
{{main|Sydney Harbour Bridge cycleway}}
The bike-only [[cycleway]] is located on the western side of the bridge. Access from the northern side involves carrying or pushing a bicycle up a staircase, consisting of 55 steps, located on the western side of the bridge at Burton St, Milsons Point. A wide smooth concrete strip in the centre of the stairs permits cycles to be wheeled up and down from the bridge deck whilst the rider is dismounted. A campaign to eliminate the steps on this popular cycling route to the CBD has been running since at least 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyharbourlink.com/page/about |title=HarbourLink |publisher=Sydneyharbourlink.com |access-date=9 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126184320/http://www.sydneyharbourlink.com/page/about |archive-date=26 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/www/html/5539-harbourlink-project.asp HarbourLink â€“ North Sydney Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022020136/http://www.northsydney.nsw.gov.au/www/html/5539-harbourlink-project.asp |date=22 October 2012 }}</ref> On 7 December 2016 the [[Minister for Transport (New South Wales)#Minister for Roads|NSW Roads Minister]] [[Duncan Gay]] confirmed that the northern stairway would be replaced with a {{AUD}}20 million ramp alleviating the needs for cyclists to dismount.

===Rail===
The bridge lies between [[Milsons Point railway station|Milsons Point]] and [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]] railway stations, located on the north and south shores respectively, with two tracks running along the western side of the bridge. These tracks are part of the [[North Shore railway line]].

In 1958, tram services across the bridge were withdrawn and the tracks they had used were removed and replaced by two extra road lanes; these lanes are now the leftmost southbound lanes on the bridge and are still clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes. The original ramp that took the trams into their terminus at the underground [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] is still visible at the southern end of the main walkway under lanes 7 and 8, although around 1964, the former tram tunnels and station were converted for use as a carpark for the Menzies Hotel and as public parking. One of the tunnels was converted for use as a storage facility after reportedly being used by the NSW police as a pistol firing range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/news/wynyard-stations-secret-old-stairs-revealed-after-more-than-50-years/|title=Hidden stairs revealed at Wynyard Station after more than 50 years|date=21 March 2016|website=Commercial Property & Real Estate News|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405001944/https://www.commercialrealestate.com.au/news/wynyard-stations-secret-old-stairs-revealed-after-more-than-50-years/|archive-date=5 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Maintenance===
The Sydney Harbour Bridge requires constant inspections and other maintenance work to keep it safe for the public, and to protect from [[corrosion]]. Among the trades employed on the bridge are [[House painter and decorator|painter]]s, [[ironworker]]s, [[boilermaker]]s, [[machinist|fitter]]s, [[electrician]]s, [[plasterer]]s, [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, and [[Rigger (industry)|riggers]].<ref name=repaint-rta />

The most noticeable maintenance work on the bridge involves painting. The steelwork of the bridge that needs to be painted is a combined {{convert|485000|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, the equivalent of sixty football fields. Each coat on the bridge requires some {{convert|30000|L|impgal|abbr=on}} of paint.<ref name=repaint-rta /> A special fast-drying paint is used, so that any paint drops have dried before reaching the vehicles or bridge surface.<ref name=tia-shb /> One notable identity from previous bridge-painting crews is Australian comedian and actor [[Paul Hogan]], who worked as a bridge rigger
 before rising to media fame in the 1970s.<ref name="culture.gov" />

In 2003 the Roads & Traffic Authority began completely repainting the southern approach spans of the bridge. This involved removing the old [[Lead paint|lead-based paint]], and repainting the {{convert|90000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} of steel below the deck. Workers operated from self-contained platforms below the deck, with each platform having an air extraction system to [[Air filter|filter]] [[airborne particles]]. An [[abrasive blasting]] was used, with the lead waste collected and safely removed from the site for disposal.<ref name=repaint-rta />

Between December 2006 and March 2010 the bridge was subject to works designed to ensure its longevity. The work included some strengthening.<ref name=shb-upgrade>{{cite web|url=http://www.freyssinet.com.au/images/job-sheets/Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge%20Upgrade.pdf|access-date=16 September 2014|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge Upgrade|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904021220/http://www.freyssinet.com.au/images/job-sheets/Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge%20Upgrade.pdf|archive-date=4 September 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Since 2013, two grit-blasting robots specially developed with the [[University of Technology, Sydney]] have been employed to help with the paint stripping operation on the bridge.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wendy Frew |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/spick-and-span-20130717-2q1av.html |title=Spick and span |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> The robots, nicknamed Rosie and Sandy,<ref>{{cite web |last=Bryant |first=Chris |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d398f90-ec8e-11e3-8963-00144feabdc0.html#slide0 |title=Dawn of a robot revolution as army of machines escape the factory |work=Financial Times |date=5 June 2014 |access-date=9 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608215640/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d398f90-ec8e-11e3-8963-00144feabdc0.html#slide0 |archive-date=8 June 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> are intended to reduce workers' potential exposure to dangerous lead paint and [[asbestos]] and the blasting equipment which has enough force to cut through clothes and skin.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23352958 |title=Grit-blasting robots clean Sydney Harbour Bridge |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=18 July 2013 |access-date=9 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106185621/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23352958 |archive-date=6 January 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===South-east pylon===
Even during its construction, the bridge was such a prominent feature of Sydney that it would attract tourist interest. One of the ongoing [[Tourism in Sydney|tourist attractions]] of the bridge has been the south-east pylon, which is accessed via the [[#Pedestrians|pedestrian walkway]] across the bridge, and then a climb to the top of the pylon of about 200 steps.<ref name=shb-info />

Not long after the bridge's opening, commencing in 1934, Archer Whitford first converted this pylon into a tourist destination.<ref name="pl-ph34">{{cite web|title=Southeast Pylon History: 1934|url=http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/history_frs.htm|work=Pylon Lookout: Sydney Harbour Bridge|access-date=18 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218075104/http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/history_frs.htm|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He installed a number of attractions, including a cafÃ©, a [[camera obscura]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] museum, a "Mother's Nook" where visitors could write letters, and a "pashometer". The main attraction was the [[Observation deck|viewing platform]], where "charming attendants" assisted visitors to use the [[telescopes]] available,<ref name="pl-ph34" /> and a copper [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] (still present) over the granite [[guard rail]]s identified the suburbs and landmarks of Sydney at the time.<ref name="pl-gvf">{{cite web|title=Glass View Finder|url=http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/exhibition_frs.htm|work=Pylon Lookout: Sydney Harbour Bridge|access-date=18 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218074429/http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/exhibition_frs.htm|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 saw tourist activities on the bridge cease, as the military took over the four pylons and modified them to include [[parapet]]s and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]].<ref name="pl-ph39">{{cite web|title=Southeast Pylon History: 1939 â€“ 1945|url=http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/history_frs.htm|work=Pylon Lookout: Sydney Harbour Bridge|access-date=18 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218075104/http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/history_frs.htm|archive-date=18 February 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1948, Yvonne Rentoul opened the "All Australian Exhibition" in the pylon.

===BridgeClimb===
In the 1950s and 1960s, there were occasional newspaper reports of climbers who had made illegal arch traversals of the bridge by night. In 1973 [[Philippe Petit]] walked across a wire between the two pylons at the southern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Since 1998, [[BridgeClimb Sydney|BridgeClimb]]<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeclimb.com/|title=BridgeClimb|publisher=BridgeClimb|access-date=23 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227085143/http://www.bridgeclimb.com/|archive-date=27 December 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> has made it possible for tourists to legally climb the southern half of the bridge. Tours run throughout the day, from dawn to night, and are only cancelled for electrical storms or high wind.<ref name=checklist>{{cite web|title=BridgeClimb - Pre-Climb Checklist|url=http://www.bridgeclimb.com/things-you-need-to-know-to-climb/|website=BridgeClimb Sydney|access-date=20 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119193627/http://www.bridgeclimb.com/things-you-need-to-know-to-climb/|archive-date=19 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Groups of climbers are provided with protective clothing appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions, and are given an orientation briefing before climbing. During the climb, attendees are secured to the bridge by a wire lifeline. Each climb begins on the eastern side of the bridge and ascends to the top. At the summit, the group crosses to the western side of the arch for the descent. Each climb takes three-and-a-half-hours, including the preparations.<ref name=checklist/>

In December 2006, BridgeClimb<ref name="autogenerated1" /> launched an alternative to climbing the upper arches of the bridge. The Discovery Climb allows climbers to ascend the lower chord of the bridge and view its internal structure. From the apex of the lower chord, climbers ascend a staircase to a platform at the summit.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Celebrations==
Since the opening, the bridge has been the focal point of much tourism and national pride.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|access-date=2019-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325011549/http://www.environment.gov.au/|archive-date=25 March 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===50th Anniversary celebrations (1982)===
In 1982, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the bridge was celebrated. For the first time since its opening in 1932, the bridge was closed to most vehicles with the exception of vintage vehicles, and pedestrians were allowed full access for the day.<ref name=pl-bh /> The celebrations were attended by Edward Judge, who represented Dorman Long.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Sydney Harbour Bridge|url=http://bestbridge.net/Australia_en/sydney-harbour-bridge.phtml|website=bestbridge.net|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118035720/http://bestbridge.net/Australia_en/sydney-harbour-bridge.phtml|archive-date=18 November 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Bicentennial Australia Day celebrations (1988)===
Australia's bicentennial celebrations on 26 January 1988 attracted large crowds in the bridge's vicinity as merrymakers flocked to the foreshores to view the events on the harbour. The highlight was the biggest parade of sail ever held in Sydney, square-riggers from all over the world, surrounded by hundreds of smaller craft of every description, passing majestically under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The day's festivities culminated in a fireworks display in which the bridge was the focal point of the finale, with fireworks streaming from the arch and roadway. This was to become the pattern for later firework displays.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Sydney New Year's Eve (1993â€“present)===
{{Main|Sydney New Year's Eve}}
The Harbour Bridge has been an integral part of the Sydney New Year's Eve celebrations, generally being used in spectacular ways during the [[fireworks]] displays at 21:00 and midnight. In recent times, the bridge has included a ropelight display on a framework in the centre of the eastern arch, which is used to complement the fireworks. The scaffolding and framework were clearly visible for some weeks before the event, revealing the outline of the design.

During the [[millennium]] celebrations in 2000, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was lit up with the word "[[Eternity (graffito)|Eternity]]", as a tribute to the legacy of [[Arthur Stace]] a Sydney artist who for many years inscribed that word on pavements in chalk in beautiful copperplate writing despite the fact that he was illiterate.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

The effects have been as follows:{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Walk for Reconciliation (2000)===
In May 2000, the bridge was closed to vehicular access for a day to allow a special reconciliation marchâ€”the "Walk for Reconciliation"â€”to take place. This was part of a response to an Aboriginal [[Stolen Generations]] inquiry, which found widespread suffering had taken place amongst [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] children forcibly placed into the care of white parents in a little-publicised state government scheme. Between 200,000 and 300,000 people were estimated to have walked the bridge in a symbolic gesture of crossing a divide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/marching-for-a-fresh-beginning-20100527-whuu.html|title=Marching for a fresh beginning|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 May 2010|access-date=23 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016035508/http://www.smh.com.au/national/marching-for-a-fresh-beginning-20100527-whuu.html|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Sydney 2000 Olympics===
During the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympics]] in September and October 2000, the bridge was adorned with the Olympic Rings. It was included in the Olympic torch's route to the Olympic stadium. The men's and women's Olympic [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] events likewise included the bridge as part of their route to the Olympic stadium. A fireworks display at the end of the closing ceremony ended at the bridge. The east-facing side of the bridge has been used several times since as a framework from which to hang static [[fireworks]], especially during the elaborate New Year's Eve displays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-city/sydney-harbour/new-years-eve-fireworks|title=Sydney Harbour - New Year's Eve Fireworks|website=sydney.com|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919085823/http://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-city/sydney-harbour/new-years-eve-fireworks|archive-date=19 September 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:SHB75.jpg|thumb|upright|Walkers with LED caps on the bridge's 75th Anniversary]]
[[File:Shb75thhats.jpg|thumb|right|The commemorative hats given to walkers]]
In 2007, the 75th anniversary of its opening was commemorated with an exhibition at the [[Museum of Sydney]], called "Bridging Sydney".<ref>[http://www.hht.net.au/bridgingsydney] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050000/http://www.hht.net.au/bridgingsydney|date=27 September 2007}}</ref> An initiative of the [[Historic Houses Trust, New South Wales|Historic Houses Trust]], the exhibition featured dramatic photographs and paintings with rare and previously unseen alternative bridge and tunnel proposals, plans and sketches.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bridging Sydney |url=https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/exhibitions/bridging-sydney |website=Sydney Living Museums |accessdate=18 March 2020  |date=17 January 2014}}</ref>

On 18 March 2007, the 75th anniversary of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was celebrated. The occasion was marked with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the [[Governor of New South Wales|governor]], [[Marie Bashir]] and the premier of New South Wales, [[Morris Iemma]]. The bridge was subsequently open to the public to walk southward from [[Milsons Point, New South Wales|Milsons Point]] or [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]]. Several major roads, mainly in the CBD, were closed for the day. An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] [[smoking ceremony]] was held at 19:00.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ma.as/375296|title=Cap marking 75th anniversary of Sydney Harbour Bridge|author=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences|publisher=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Australia|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pictures.reuters.com/archive/AUSTRALIA-BRIDGE--GM1DUVNVPKAA.html|title=REUTERS|date=18 March 2007|agency=Reuters|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref>

Approximately 250,000 people (50,000 more than were registered) took part in the event. Bright yellow souvenir caps were distributed to walkers. A series of speakers placed at intervals along the bridge formed a [[sound installation]]. Each group of speakers broadcast sound and music from a particular era (e.g. [[King Edward VIII]]'s abdication speech; [[Gough Whitlam]]'s speech at [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975]]), the overall effect being that the soundscape would "flow" through history as walkers proceeded along the bridge. A light-show began after sunset and continued late into the night, the bridge being bathed in constantly changing, multi-coloured lighting, designed to highlight structural features of the bridge. In the evening the bright yellow caps were replaced by orange caps with a small, bright [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] attached. The bridge was closed to walkers at about 20:30.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

== Heritage listing ==
At the time of construction and until recently, the bridge was the longest single span steel arch bridge in the world. The bridge, its pylons and its approaches are all important elements in townscape of areas both near and distant from it.

The bridge has been an important factor in the pattern of growth of metropolitan Sydney, particularly in residential development in post World War II years. In the 1960s and 1970s the Central Business District had extended to the northern side of the bridge at North Sydney which has been due in part to the easy access provided by the bridge and also to the increasing traffic problems associated with the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-781-781-2>Walker and Kerr, 1974.</ref><ref name=nswshr-781/>
