[[File:Ecozone Afrotropic.svg|300px|thumb|The Afrotropical realm, marked in blue]]

The '''Afrotropical realm''' is one of Earth's eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It includes [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], the majority of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], the island of [[Madagascar]], southern [[Iran]] and extreme southwestern [[Pakistan]], and the islands of the western [[Indian Ocean]]. It was formerly known as the '''Ethiopian Zone''' or '''Ethiopian Region'''.

==Major ecological regions==
Most of the Afrotropic, with the exception of Africa's southern tip, has a [[tropics|tropical]] climate. A broad belt of deserts, including the [[Atlantic coastal desert|Atlantic]] and [[Sahara]] deserts of northern Africa and the [[Arabian Desert]] of the Arabian Peninsula, separate the Afrotropic from the [[Palearctic realm]], which includes northern Africa and temperate [[Eurasia]].

===Sahel and Sudan===
South of the Sahara, two belts of [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical grassland and savanna]] run east and west across the continent, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Immediately south of the Sahara lies the [[Sahel]] belt, a transitional zone of semi-arid short grassland and [[acacia]] savanna. Rainfall increases further south in the [[Sudanian Savanna]], also known simply as the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]], a belt of taller grasslands and savannas. The Sudanian Savanna is home to two great [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands]], the [[Sudd]] wetland in [[South Sudan]], and the [[Niger Inland Delta]] in [[Mali]]. The [[forest-savanna mosaic]] is a transitional zone between the grasslands and the belt of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]] near the equator.

===Southern Arabian woodlands===
South Arabia, which includes Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwestern Saudi Arabia, has few permanent forests. Some of the notable are [[Jabal Bura']], Jabal [[Raymah]], and [[Jabal Badaj]] in the Yemeni highland escarpment, and the seasonal forests in eastern Yemen and the [[Dhofar]] region of Oman. Other woodlands scatter the land and are very small and are predominantly [[juniper]] or [[acacia]] forests.

===Forest zone===
{{Main|Guineo-Congolian region}}

The [[forest zone]], a belt of lowland [[tropical moist broadleaf forests]], runs across most of equatorial Africa's [[intertropical convergence zone]]. The [[Upper Guinean forests]] of West Africa extend along the coast from [[Guinea]] to [[Togo]]. The [[Dahomey Gap]], a zone of forest-savanna mosaic that reaches to the coast, separates the Upper Guinean forests from the [[Lower Guinean forests]], which extend along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] from eastern [[Benin]] through [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]] to the western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The largest tropical forest zone in Africa is the [[Congolian forests]] of the [[Congo Basin]] in Central Africa. 

A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast, from southern [[Somalia]] to [[South Africa]].

===East African grasslands and savannas===
* ''Acacia''-''Commiphora'' grasslands
* [[Serengeti]]

===Eastern Africa's highlands===
[[Afromontane]] region, from the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] to the [[Drakensberg Mountains]] of South Africa, including the [[East African Rift]]. Distinctive flora, including ''[[Podocarpus]]'' and ''[[Afrocarpus]]'', as well as giant ''[[Lobelia]]s'' and ''[[Dendrosenecio|Senecio]]s''.
* [[Ethiopian Highlands]]
* [[Albertine rift montane forests]]
* [[East African montane forests]] and [[Eastern Arc forests]]

===Zambezian region===
{{Main|Zambezian region}}

The [[Zambezian region]] includes woodlands, savannas, grasslands, and thickets. Characteristic plant communities include [[Miombo woodlands]], drier [[mopane]] and ''[[Baikiaea]]'' woodlands, and higher-elevation [[Bushveld]]. It extends from east to west in a broad belt across the continent, south of the rainforests of the [[Guineo-Congolian region]], and north of the deserts of southeastern Africa, the [[Highveld]] grasslands of South Africa, and the subtropical [[Maputaland coastal forest mosaic|Maputaland forests]] on the southeast.<ref>Linder, H.

===Deserts of southern Africa===

* [[Namib Desert]]
* [[Kalahari Desert]]
* [[Karoo]]
* [[Tankwa Karoo]]
* [[Richtersveld]]

===Cape floristic region===
The [[Cape floristic region]], at Africa's southern tip, is a [[Mediterranean climate]] region that is home to a significant number of endemic taxa, as well as to plant families like the [[protea]]s (''Proteaceae'') that are also found in the [[Australasian realm]].

===Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands===
{{Main|Ecoregions of Madagascar}}

[[Madagascar]] and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub-region of the realm, with numerous [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[taxon|taxa]] like the [[lemur]]s. Madagascar and the [[Granitic Seychelles]] are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], and broke away from Africa millions of years ago. Other Indian Ocean islands, like the [[Comoros]] and [[Mascarene Islands]], are volcanic islands that formed more recently. Madagascar contains a variety of plant habitats, from rainforests to mountains and deserts, as its [[biodiversity]] and ratio of endemism is extremely high.

==Endemic plants and animals==
===Plants===
The Afrotropical realm is home to a number of endemic plant families. [[Ecoregions of Madagascar|Madagascar and the Indian Ocean Islands]] are home to ten endemic families of flowering plants; eight are endemic to Madagascar ([[Asteropeiaceae]], [[Didymelaceae]], [[Didiereaceae]], [[Kaliphoraceae]], [[Melanophyllaceae]], [[Physenaceae]], [[Sarcolaenaceae]], and [[Sphaerosepalaceae]]), one to [[Seychelles]] ([[Mesdusagynaceae]]) and one to the [[Mascarene Islands]] ([[Psiloxylaceae]]). Twelve plant families are endemic or nearly endemic to South Africa (including [[Curtisiaceae]], [[Heteropyxidaceae]], [[Penaeaceae]], [[Psiloxylaceae]] and [[Rhynchocalycaceae]]) of which five are endemic to the [[Cape floristic region|Cape floristic province]] (including [[Grubbiaceae]]). Other endemic Afrotropic families include [[Barbeyaceae]], [[Montiniaceae]], [[Myrothamnaceae]] and [[Oliniaceae]].

===Animals===
{{Main|Fauna of Africa}}

The East African Great Lakes ([[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Malawi]], and [[Tanganyika]]) are the center of biodiversity of many freshwater fishes, especially [[cichlid]]s (they harbor more than two-thirds of the estimated 2,000 species in the family).<ref>I.P.Farias et al., Total Evidence: Molecules, Morphology, and the Phylogenetics of Cichlid Fishes, Journal of Experimental Zoology (Mol Dev Evol) 288:76–92 (2000)</ref> The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa, but harbours 322 of West African's fish species, with 247 restricted to this area and 129 restricted even
to smaller ranges. The central rivers fauna comprises 194 fish species, with 119 endemics and only 33 restricted to small areas.<ref>T.Moritz and K. E. Linsenmair, West African fish diversity – distribution patterns and possible conclusions for conservation strategies (in African Biodiversity: Molecules, Organisms, Ecosystems, Springer, 2001)</ref>

The Afrotropic has various endemic [[bird]] families, including [[ostrich]]es (Struthionidae), [[sunbird]]s, the [[secretary bird]] (Sagittariidae), [[guineafowl]] (Numididae), and [[mousebird]]s (Coliidae). Also, several families of [[passerines]] are limited to the Afrotropics; These include [[rock-jumper]]s (Chaetopidae) and [[rockfowl]] (Picathartidae).

Africa has three endemic orders of mammals, the [[Tubulidentata]] ([[aardvark]]s), [[Afrosoricida]] ([[tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s), and [[Macroscelidea]] ([[elephant shrew]]s). The [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|East-African plains]] are well known for their diversity of large mammals.

Four species of great apes ([[Hominidae]]) are endemic to Africa: both species of [[gorilla]] (western gorilla, ''Gorilla gorilla'', and eastern gorilla, ''Gorilla beringei'') and both species of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] ([[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', and [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus''). [[Human]]s and their ancestors originated in Africa.
