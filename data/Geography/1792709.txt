'''Abu Zayd Ahmed ibn Sahl Balkhi''' ({{lang-fa|ابو زید احمد بن سهل بلخی}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]] [[polymath]]: a [[Islamic geography|geographer]], [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]], [[Islamic medicine|physician]], [[Islamic psychological thought|psychologist]] and [[Islamic science|scientist]]. Born in 850 CE in Shamistiyan, in the province of [[Balkh]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (in modern-day [[Afghanistan]]), he was a disciple of [[al-Kindi]]. He was also the founder the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].<ref name = E61-3/>

==Works==
Of the many books ascribed to him in the ''al-Fihrist'' by [[Ibn al-Nadim]], one can note ''the excellency of mathematics''; ''on certitude in astrology''. His ''Figures of the Climates'' (''Suwar al-aqalim'') consisted chiefly of geographical maps. He also wrote the medical and psychological work, ''Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus'' (''Sustenance for Body and Soul'').

A modern scholar describes the bulk of his works as "more than sixty books and manuscripts, meticulously researching disciplines as varied in scope as geography, medicine, theology, politics, philosophy, poetry, literature, Arabic grammar, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, biography, ethics, sociology as well as others."<ref>Malik Badri, ''Abu Zayd al-Balkhi’s Sustenance of the Soul: The Cognitive Behavior Therapy of a Ninth Century Physician'', International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) (2013), p. 1</ref>

==''Figures of the Regions''==
His ''Figures of the Regions'' (''Suwar al-aqalim'') consisted chiefly of [[Islamic geography|geographical]] maps. It led to him founding the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]]. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the [[Muslim world]], with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.<ref name = E61-3>E.

==''Sustenance for Body and Soul''==

===Mental health and mental illness===
In [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic psychology]], the concepts of [[mental health]] and "mental hygiene" were introduced by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who often related it to [[spirit]]ual health. In his ''Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus'' (''Sustenance for Body and Soul''), he was the first to successfully discuss diseases related to both the body and the soul. He used the term ''al-Tibb al-Ruhani'' to describe spiritual and psychological health, and the term ''Tibb al-Qalb'' to describe mental medicine. He criticized many medical doctors in his time for placing too much emphasis on physical [[illness]]es and neglecting the psychological or [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]] of patients, and argued that "since man’s construction
is from both his soul and his body, therefore, human existence cannot be healthy without the ''ishtibak'' [interweaving or entangling] of soul and body." He further argued that "if the body gets sick, the
''nafs'' [psyche] loses much of its [[cognitive]] and comprehensive ability and fails to enjoy the desirous aspects of life" and that "if the ''nafs'' gets sick, the body may also find no joy in life and may eventually
develop a physical illness." Al-Balkhi traced back his ideas on mental health to verses of the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]]s attributed to [[Muhammad]], such as:<ref name=Talib>Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), "Mental health in Islamic medical tradition", ''The International Medical Journal'' '''4''' (2), p. 76&ndash;79.</ref>

===Cognitive and medical psychology and cognitive therapy===
Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was the first to differentiate between [[neurosis]] and [[psychosis]], and the first to classify neurotic disorders and pioneer [[cognitive therapy]] in order to treat each of these classified disorders. He classified neurosis into four [[emotion]]al disorders: [[fear]] and [[anxiety]], [[anger]] and [[aggression]], [[sadness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. He further classified three types of depression: [[Depression (mood)|normal depression]] or [[sadness]] (''huzn''), [[Endogeny|endogenous]] depression originating from within the body, and reactive [[clinical depression]] originating from outside the body. He also wrote that a healthy individual should always keep healthy [[thoughts]] and feelings in his mind in the case of unexpected emotional outbursts in the same way [[drug]]s and [[First Aid]] medicine are kept nearby for unexpected physical [[Emergency|emergencies]]. He stated that a balance between the [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]] is required for good health and that an imbalance between the two can cause sickness. Al-Balkhi also introduced the concept of [[reciprocal inhibition]] (''al-ilaj bi al-did''), which was re-introduced over a thousand years later by [[Joseph Wolpe]] in 1969.<ref name=Amber>Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357&ndash;377 [362]</ref>

===Psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine===
The Muslim physician Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was a pioneer of psychotherapy, [[psychophysiology]] and [[psychosomatic medicine]]. He recognized that the [[Human body|body]] and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] can be healthy or sick, or "balanced or imbalanced", and that mental illness can have both [[psychological]] and/or [[physiological]] causes. He wrote that imbalance of the body can result in [[fever]], [[headache]]s and other physical illnesses, while imbalance of the soul can result in [[anger]], [[anxiety]], [[sadness]] and other mental symptoms. He recognized two types of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]: one caused by known reasons such as [[Grief|loss]] or [[failure]], which can be treated psychologically through both external methods (such as persuasive talking, preaching and advising) and internal methods (such as the "development of inner thoughts and cognitions which help the person get rid of his depressive condition"); and the other caused by unknown reasons such as a "sudden affliction of sorrow and distress, which persists all the time, preventing the afflicted person from any physical activity or from showing any happiness or enjoying any of the pleasures" which may be caused by physiological reasons (such as impurity of the blood) and can be treated through physical medicine.<ref name=Talib/> He also wrote comparisons between [[physical disorder]]s with [[mental disorder]]s, and showed how psychosomatic disorders can be caused by certain interactions between them.<ref name=Amber/>
