An '''anatopism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνά}}, "against," and {{lang|grc|τόπος}}, "place") is something that is out of its proper place.

The [[concept]] of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of [[anachronism]], perhaps because much that is anatopic is also anachronistic.  Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopic is necessarily also anachronistic. 

The online ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' gives a [[synonym]] for "anatopism":  ''anachorism'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{transl|el|ana-}} + {{transl|el|khōros}}, "place"):  "a geographical misplacement; something located in an incongruent position".<ref>https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/anachorism).</ref>

==Examples==
[[Catherine Hardwicke]]'s 2006 film ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' shows a field of [[maize]] in a [[Nazareth]] farming scene.  Maize is native to [[Mesoamerica]], not to the [[Middle East]], and in [[pre-Columbian]] times was grown only in the [[Americas]].  The use of maize in this film is an anatopism as well as an anachronism.

The same anatopism appears in the first part ("The Warrior Pharaohs") of a three-part 2002 [[PBS]] documentary series on "Egypt's Golden Empire" depicting the history of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]:  ears of [[maize]] corn are shown in a scene recreating the [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)|battle and siege of Megiddo]] in the 15th century BCE.

[[Ridley Scott]]'s 2000 film, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', set in 180 CE, features Roman soldiers riding horses using [[saddle]]s with [[stirrup]]s.  While the Romans had had saddles since about 100 BCE, and stirrups had existed in the world since about 700 BCE, stirrups did not appear in Europe until about the 6th or 7th century CE, making them both anatopic and anachronistic.

The opening scene of [[Disney]]'s 1994 film, ''[[The Lion King]]'', features a variety of African animals venturing to Pride Rock.  However, the [[ants]] that appear in the scene hold leaves in their mandibles, behavior that only [[leaf cutter ants]] in [[Latin America]] exhibit. 

[[John Ford]]'s much-lauded 1939 film [[Stagecoach (1939 film)|''Stagecoach'']] was filmed in [[Monument Valley]] on the [[Arizona]]-[[Utah]] border, but textually set in southern Arizona and southern [[New Mexico]]. The vegetation and topography of Monument Valley and the lower-altitude deserts are vastly different, rendering the film's actual location notably anatopic. 

The [[Poland|Polish]] writer [[Bolesław Prus]], for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', set in the [[ancient Egypt]] of 1087–1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like [[gunpowder]].<ref>[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', pp. 579-81.</ref>  This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in [[China]] or in [[Arab world|Arabia]].  Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a [[telescope]],<ref>[[Bolesław Prus]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', p. 391.</ref> that may also be an [[anachronism]].
