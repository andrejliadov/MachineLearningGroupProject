The '''five themes of geography''' is an educational tool for teaching [[geography]]. Adopted in 1984{{cn|date=November 2020}} by the [[Association of American Geographers]], those five themes were published in the NCGE/AAG publication ''Guidelines for Geographic Education, Elementary, and Secondary Schools''. Most American geography and [[social studies]] [[classroom]]s have adopted the five themes in teaching practices.<ref name="LessonPlanet">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lessonplanet.com/article/elementary-math/geography-lesson-plans-using-google-earth |title=Geography Lesson Plans Using Google Earth |first=Karen |last=Ganzel |accessdate=April 28, 2010 |publisher=Lesson Planet}}</ref>

== Themes ==

The five-theme organizational approach was superseded by the Geography for Life standards published by the National Geographic Society United States Of America, a set of eighteen standards promulgated in 1984. However, the five themes continue to be used as an educational approach in many educational outlets.<ref name="LessonPlanet"/>

===Location=== 
Every point on Earth has a location. Location can be described in two different ways:
* ''Absolute location'', a location as described by its latitude and longitude on the [[Earth]]. For example, the coordinates of [[Albany, New York]] are 42.6525° N, 73.7572° W.
* ''Relative location'', a location as described by where it is compared to something else. For example, [[Albany, New York]] is roughly 140 miles north of New York City.

===Place===
A place is an area that is defined by everything in it. All places have features that give them personality and distinguish them from other places.

* Toponym: a place name, especially one derived from a topographical feature.
* Site: an area of ground on which a town, building, or monument is constructed.
* Situation: the location and surroundings of a place.
* Population: the number of people that live in the area.

=== Human-environment interaction ===
{{see|human-environment interaction}}
This theme describes how people interact with the environment, and how the environment responds, with three key concepts:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/TeacherEd/FacultyStaff/betts/Handouts/PDFs/Five%20Themes%20of%20Geography.pdf | title=The Five Themes of Geography | accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>

*Dependency: Humans depend on the environment.
*[[Adaptation]]: Humans adapt to the environment.
*Modification: Humans modify the environment.

=== Movement ===
Movement is the [[travel]] of [[people]], [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]]s, and [[idea]]s from one location to another, or political events. Examples of movement include the [[United States]]' [[westward expansion]], the [[Information Revolution]], and [[immigration]]. New devices such as the [[airplane]] and the [[Internet]] allow physical and ideological goods to be transferred long distances in short time intervals. A person's travel from place to place, and the actions they perform there are also considered movement.

=== Region ===
Regions are areas with distinctive characteristics: human characteristics, such as demographics or politics, and physical characteristics, such as climate and vegetation. For example, the US is a political region because it shares one governmental system.
