The '''polar regions''', also called the '''frigid [[geographical zone|zones]]''', of [[Earth]] are the [[region]]s of the planet that surround its [[geographical pole]]s (the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s), lying within the [[polar circle]]s. These '''high latitudes''' are dominated by floating [[Arctic ice pack|sea ice]] covering much of the [[Arctic ocean]] in the north, and by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] on the continent of [[Antarctica]] in the South.

==Definitions==
The [[Arctic]] has various definitions, including the region north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (currently Epoch 2010 at 66°33'44" N), or the region north of [[60th parallel north|60° north]] latitude, or the region from the North Pole south to the [[Tree line|timberline]]. The [[Antarctic]] is usually defined as south of [[60th parallel south|60° south]] latitude, or the continent of Antarctica. The 1959 [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] uses the former definition.

The two polar regions are distinguished from the other two climatic and biomatic belts of Earth, a [[tropics]] belt near the equator, and two [[middle latitudes|middle latitude]] regions located between the tropics and ''polar regions''.

==Climate==
{{main|Polar climate}}
Polar regions receive less intense [[solar radiation]] than the other parts of Earth because the sun's energy arrives at an oblique angle, spreading over a larger area, and also travels a longer distance through the Earth's atmosphere in which it may be absorbed, scattered or reflected, which is the same thing that causes winters to be colder than the rest of the year in temperate areas.
 
The [[axial tilt]] of the Earth has a major [[Effect of sun angle on climate|effect on climate]] of the polar regions. However, since the polar regions are the farthest from the [[equator]], they receive the weakest solar radiation and are therefore generally frigid year round due to the earth's axial tilt of 23.5° not being enough to create a high maximum midday [[Position of the Sun|declination]] to sufficiently strengthen the sun's rays even in summer, except for relatively brief periods in peripheral areas near the polar circles. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects a large part of what weak sunlight the Polar regions receive, contributing to the cold. Polar regions are characterized by extremely cold temperatures, heavy [[glaciation]] wherever there is sufficient [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to form permanent ice, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with [[midnight sun|twenty-four hours of daylight]] in summer, and [[polar night|complete darkness]] at [[winter|mid-winter]].

==Circumpolar Arctic region==

{{see also|North Pole}}
There are many settlements in Earth's north polar region. Countries with claims to Arctic regions are: the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]] ([[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]]), [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]]. Arctic circumpolar populations often share more in common with each other than with other populations within their national boundaries. As such, the northern polar region is diverse in human settlements and cultures.

==Antarctica and the Southern sea==

The southern polar region has no permanent human habitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27910375|title=Why do so many nations want a piece of Antarctica?|publisher=BBC|language=English|author=Matthew Teller|date=20 June 2014|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> [[McMurdo Station]] is the largest research station in [[Antarctica]], run by the [[United States]]. Other notable stations include [[Palmer Station]] and [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (United States), [[Esperanza Base]] and [[Marambio Base]] ([[Argentina]]), [[Scott Base]] ([[New Zealand]]), and [[Vostok Station]] (Russia).

While there are no indigenous human cultures, there is a complex ecosystem, especially along Antarctica's [[coast]]al zones.  Coastal [[upwelling]] provides abundant nutrients which feeds [[krill]], a type of marine [[crustacea]], which in turn feeds a complex of living creatures from penguins to blue whales.
