== Synopsis ==
Canadian mapmakers 400 years ago relied on hand-drawn maps derived from personal accounts by explorers, fur traders and settlers. These maps were limited to coastlines and partial interior views. Explorers like [[Samuel de Champlain]], [[Jacques Cartier]] and [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] made their own maps. Later explorers and prospectors were often the first to go into uncharted regions, and their information on the land was invaluable in drawing up the maps of the time.

In 1959, the new ''All Canadian Atlas'' is a product of the joint efforts of geologists, meteorologists, prospectors, agronomists, draughtspersons, naturalists and especially, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. Aerial photography was essential in mapping the vast north of Canada. In 1948, [[413 Transport and Rescue Squadron|No. 413 RCAF Squadron/No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron]] flying specially converted [[Avro Lancaster|Avro Lancaster 10P]] aircraft undertook the task of mapping Canada's Arctic. Three large islands were discovered and one island near [[Baffin Island]] was named "Air Force" in their honour.

With all the accumulated data from photographs, the mapmakers of the ''All Canadian Atlas'' consulted with interested parties from government, industry and [[academia]] to ensure that all relevant information is included. Each of the 500 maps contains a wealth of information, depicting Canada in a hundred different ways from political boundaries, settlement, urban development, habitats, mineral and agricultural areas, temperatures and climates, transportation and industry to provide an accurate portrait of Canada in the late 1950s.
