'''Abruzzi e Molise''' (known as ''Abruzzi'' when part of the [[Kingdom of Two Sicilies]]) was formerly one of the [[regions of Italy]] encompassing a total of {{convert|16600|km2|abbr=on}} and including [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]] and Circondario di Cittaducale (presently a part of Lazio).

== History ==
From the time of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], this region was considered a single entity with the regional capital at [[L'Aquila]]. At this time, the region was further divided into four provinces: Abruzzo Ultra I, Abruzzo Ultra II, Abruzzo Citra, and Molise.

In 1852, the [[Papal States]] annexed [[Ancarano]], then further changes occurred during the formation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â€“1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] including the annexation of [[Venafro]] and adjustments of the border with [[Campania]].

In 1927 an additional adjustment was made when the [[Cittaducale]] was assigned to [[Rieti]].

== Transformation into separate regions ==
In 1963, the [[province of Campobasso]] was split from the region to form [[Molise]], with the remaining four provinces, [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]], [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Pescara|Pescara]] and [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], comprising the present day [[Abruzzo]].
