'''Population density''' (in [[agriculture]]: [[Stock (disambiguation)|standing stock]] or [[plant density]]) is a measurement of [[population]] per unit area, or exceptionally unit volume; it is a quantity of type [[number density]]. It is frequently applied to [[living organisms]], most of the time to [[human]]s. It is a key geographical term.<ref name=about>Matt Rosenberg [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm Population Density]. Geography.about.com. March 2, 2011. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.</ref> In simple terms, population density refers to the number of people living in an area per square kilometre.

== Biological population densities ==
Population density  is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.<ref name=about/>

Low densities may cause an [[extinction vortex]] and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the [[Allee effect]] after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes of reduced fertility in low population densities are:<ref>[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size Minimum viable population size]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006221151/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size |date=October 6, 2012 }} Eoearth.org (March 6, 2010).

===Human densities===
{{main|List of countries and territories by population density}}
Population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometre or square mile, and which may include or exclude for example areas of water or glaciers. Commonly this may be calculated for a [[county]], [[list of cities by population density|city]], [[country]], another [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or the [[Earth|entire world]].

The [[world's population]] is around 7,500,000,000<ref>[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. & World Population Clocks]. Census.gov. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.</ref> and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (197,000,000 sq. mi.).<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World]. CIA World Handbook</ref> Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km<sup>2</sup> (38 per sq. mi.). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km<sup>2</sup> (129 per sq. mi.). This includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km<sup>2</sup> (over 142 per sq. mi.).<ref name=about/> However, over half{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, additional criteria are needed to make simple population density values useful.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-state]]s, [[microstate]]s and urban [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].<ref name=unpop>{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | access-date= March 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km<sup>2</sup></ref> In fact, 95% of the world's population is concentrated on just 10% of the world's land.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Urbanization: 95% Of The World's Population Lives On 10% Of The Land|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081217192745.htm|access-date=2020-09-01|website=ScienceDaily|language=en}}</ref> These territories have a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].

Deserts have very limited potential for growing crops as there is not enough rain to support them. Thus their population density is generally low. However some cities in the Middle East, such as [[Dubai]], have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Desert regions : population, migration, and environment |last=Portnov |first=B. A. |last2=Hare |first2=A. Paul |date=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540657800|oclc=41320143}}</ref>

Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources.<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/issue/198/human-population Human Population]. Global Issues. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.</ref> Very densely populated cities are mostly in Asia (particularly [[Southeast Asia]]); Africa's [[Lagos]], [[Kinshasa]] and [[Cairo]]; South America's [[Bogotá]], [[Lima]] and [[São Paulo]]; and [[Mexico City]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] also fall into this category.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html The largest cities in the world by land area, population and density] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516053854/http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html |date=May 16, 2015 }}. Citymayors.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.</ref>

City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of "urban area" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the centre only than when suburban settlements and intervening rural areas are included, as in the [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]] (the latter sometimes including neighboring cities).

In comparison, based on a world population of 7 billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up almost 1 m<sup>2</sup> (10 sq. ft) per person (cf. [[Jacobs Method]]), would occupy a space a little larger than [[Delaware]]'s land area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Other methods of measurement ===

Although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.
* '''Arithmetic density''': The total number of people / area of land
* '''[[Physiological density]]''': The total population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Agricultural density''': The total ''rural'' population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Residential density''': The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
* '''[[Urban density]]''': The number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
* '''Ecological optimum''': The density of population that can be supported by the natural resources
