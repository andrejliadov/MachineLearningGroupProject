[[File:Beating the Bounds Oriel Oxford.jpg|thumb|Beating the bounds of the parish of the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in Oxford.]]'''Beating the bounds''' or '''perambulating the bounds'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Episode 44: Perambulating the Bounds |url=http://www.hubhistory.com/episodes/episode-44-perambulating-bounds/ |website=Hub History |accessdate=20 May 2020}}</ref> is an ancient custom still observed in parts of [[England]], [[Wales]], and the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]].  These ceremonial events occur on what are sometimes called '''Gangdays;''' the custom of going a-ganging was kept before the [[Norman Conquest]].<ref>[[George C. Homans]], ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991:368.</ref>  During the event, a group of prominent citizens from the community, which can be an [[Parish (Church of England)|English church parish]], [[New England town]], or other civil division, will walk the geographic boundaries of their locality for the purpose of maintaining the memory of the precise location of these boundaries.  While modern surveying techniques have rendered these ceremonial walks largely irrelevant, the practice often remains as an important local civic ceremony and in some cases remains a legal requirement for civic leaders.

[[File:Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane - geograph.org.uk - 440810.jpg|thumb|Beating the Bounds in Mill Lane, Cambridge. The clergy and people of [[Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge|Little St Mary's Church]] annually walk round the boundaries of the parish, singing hymns and psalms and praying for blessings on the residents and their activities.]]
In former times when [[map]]s were rare,<ref>The Ordnance Survey of the entire UK only began in the early 19th century and it was many years before the survey was complete.</ref> it was usual to make a formal perambulation of the parish boundaries on [[Feast of the Ascension|Ascension Day]] or during [[Rogation days|Rogation week]].<ref name=EB1911/> Knowledge of the limits of each parish needed to be handed down so that such matters as liability to contribute to the repair of the church or the right to be buried within the churchyard were not disputed. The relevant jurisdiction was that of the [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical courts]].<ref>Tate, W. E.(1946) ''The Parish Chest''. Cambridge: Univ. Press; pp. 73-74</ref> The [[priest]] of the parish with the [[churchwarden]]s and the parochial officials headed a crowd of boys who beat the parish [[boundary marker]]s with green boughs, usually birch or willow, Sometimes the boys were whipped or violently bumped on the boundary stones to make them remember. The object of taking boys along is supposed to ensure that witnesses to the boundaries should survive as long as possible.<ref name=EB1911/> Priests would pray for its protection in the forthcoming year, and often Psalms 103 and 104 were recited, and the priest would say such sentences as "Cursed is he who transgresseth the bounds or doles of his neighbour".<ref name="Tate 1946">Tate (1946)</ref> Hymns would be sung, indeed a number of hymns are titled for their role, and many places in the English countryside bear names such as [[Gospel Oak]] testifying to their role in the beating of the bounds.

The ceremony had an important practical purpose. Checking the boundaries was a way of preventing encroachment by neighbours; sometimes boundary markers would be moved or lines obscured, and a folk memory of the true extent of the parish was necessary to maintain integrity of borders by embedding knowledge in oral traditions. For a village man dwelling in champion country{{Clarify|date=April 2016}}, under the traditional [[Open-field system|open field system]], George Homans remarks, "the bounds of his village were the most important bounds he knew."<ref>Homans 1991:368.</ref> Village and parish were coterminous. The modern system of [[metes and bounds]] operates fundamentally similarly, giving a prose definition of a property as if walking about it.

At [[Manchester (ancient parish)|Manchester]] in 1597, [[John Dee]] recorded in his diary that he with the curate, the clerk and "diverse of the town of diverse ages" perambulated the bounds of the parish taking six days in all.<ref>Frangopulo, N. J. (1962) ''Rich Inheritance''. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 129-30</ref> At [[Turnworth]] in Dorset the parish register records the perambulation for 1747 thus:<ref name="Tate 1946" />{{quote|1747. On Ascension Day after morning prayer at Turnworth Church, was made a public Perambulation of the bounds of the parish of Turnworth by me Richd. Cobbe, Vicar, Wm. Northover, Churchwarden, Henry Sillers and Richard Mullen, Overseers and others with 4 boys; beginning at the Church Hatch and cutting a great T on the most principal parts of the bounds. Whipping the boys by way of remembrance, and stopping their cry with some half-pence; we returned to church again, which Perambulation and Processioning had not been made for five years last past.}}

In a few cases such as the Corporation of the City of Portsmouth the bounds were on the shoreline, and the route was followed by boat rather than on foot.<ref name=gates66>{{cite book |title=The Portsmouth that has Passed: With a Glimpse of Gosport |last=Gates |first=William G |editor1-first=Nigel |editor1-last=Peak  |year=1987 |publisher=Milestone Publications |isbn=1-85265-111-3 |page=66}}</ref>

==Origins==
In England, the custom dates from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] times, as it is mentioned in laws of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Æthelstan]]. It is thought that it may have been derived from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[Terminalia]]'', a festival celebrated on February 22 in honour of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god of [[landmark]]s, to whom cakes and wine were offered while sports and dancing took place at the boundaries.<ref name=EB1911/> Similar practices, of [[pagan]] origin, were brought by the [[Norsemen]].<ref name="Cholesbury">[http://www.cholesbury.com/beatbounds.htm ''Beating the Cholesbury Bounds'']. Retrieved August 3, 2007.</ref>

In England, a [[parish ale]], a feast, was held after the perambulation, which assured its popularity. In [[Henry VIII]]'s reign the occasion had become an excuse for so much revelry that it attracted the condemnation of a preacher who declared, "These solemne and accustomable processions and supplications be nowe growen into a right foule and detestable abuse."<ref name=EB1911/>

Beating the bounds had a religious aspect which is reflected in the rogation, where the accompanying clergy beseech (Latin ''rogare'') the divine [[blessing]] upon the parish lands for the ensuing harvest. This feature originated in the 5th century, when [[Mamertus]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienne|Archbishop of Vienne]], instituted special prayers, fasting and [[Procession|processions]] on these days. This clerical side of the parish bounds-beating was one of the religious functions prohibited by the Royal Injunctions of [[Elizabeth I]] in 1559; but it was then ordered that the perambulation should continue to be performed as a quasi-secular function, so that evidence of the boundaries of parishes, etc., might be preserved.<ref>Gibson, ''Codex juris Ecclesiastici Anglicani'' (1761) pp. 213-214</ref>

[[Bequest]]s were sometimes made in connection with bounds-beating. For example, at [[Leighton Buzzard]] on Rogation Monday, in accordance with the will of Edward Wilkes, a [[London]] merchant who died in 1646, the [[trustee]]s of his [[almshouse]]s accompanied the boys. The will was read and beer and plum rolls distributed. A remarkable feature of the bequest was that while the will is read one of the boys has to [[headstand|stand on his head]].<ref name=EB1911/>

Although modern surveying techniques make the ceremony obsolete, at least for its secular purpose, many English parishes carry out a regular beating of the bounds, as a way of strengthening the community and giving it a sense of place.<ref>[http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html A Sense of Place - Common Ground website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415134830/http://www.england-in-particular.info/parishmaps/m-boundary.html |date=2008-04-15 }}. Retrieved 06 04 2008.</ref> In 1865–66 [[William Robert Hicks]] was mayor of [[Bodmin]] in Cornwall, when he revived the custom of beating the bounds of the town. This still takes place more or less every five years and concludes with a game of [[Cornish hurling]]. Hurling survives as a traditional part of beating the bounds at Bodmin, commencing at the close of the 'Beat'. The game is organised by the [[Rotary club]] of Bodmin and was last played in 2015.<ref name="bodmin">{{cite web|title=Bodmin Beating the Bounds & Hurling|url=http://calendarcustoms.com/articles/bodmin-beating-the-bounds-hurling/|publisher=Calendar Customs|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> The game is started by the mayor of Bodmin by throwing a silver ball into a body of water known as the "Salting Pool". There are no teams and the hurl follows a set route. The aim is to carry the ball from the "Salting Pool" via the old [[A30 road|A30]], along Callywith Road, then through Castle Street, Church Square and Honey Street to finish at the Turret Clock in Fore Street. The participant carrying the ball when it reaches the turret clock will receive a £10 reward from the mayor.<ref>[http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&ClubID=1019 2010 Bodmin Hurl Rules] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005032340/http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/page.asp?PgID=134388&ClubID=1019 |date=2011-10-05 }}, ''Rotary Club of Bodmin'', 02/04/2010.</ref><ref name="bodmin" />

In Brightlingsea, Essex, the beating of the bounds is performed in tandem with the "blessing and reclaiming of the waters"; a church service is held at the town's harbour and then the church and civic dignitaries travel the coastal bounds in a sailing vessel where a 'din' is sounded with bells, whistles, shouts and other noise.

==== State boundaries====

The laws of [[Vermont]] and New Hampshire require the attorneys general of those states to meet once every seven years to perambulate the boundary between the two states. They do not walk {{convert|275|mi}} along the [[Connecticut River]], but they meet at the boundary and formally reaffirm their mutual understanding of the precise location of the boundary. The location had been disputed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Vermont v. New Hampshire]]'', decided in 1933.<ref>[http://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/01/015/00611 Vermont Statutes, Title 1: Chapter 15: New Hampshire–Vermont Boundary]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Attorneys General Delaney and Sorrell Will Meet on the Norwich/Hanover Bridge on May 14th for the Eleventh Perambulation of the NH/VT Boundary|url=https://www.doj.nh.gov/media-center/press-releases/2012/20120510-perambulation-boundary.htm|publisher=New Hampshire Department of Justice, Office of the Attorney General|date=May 10, 2012|access-date=November 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040451/https://www.doj.nh.gov/media-center/press-releases/2012/20120510-perambulation-boundary.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2017|url-status = dead}}</ref>
