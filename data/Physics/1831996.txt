The '''B Reactor''' at the [[Hanford Site]], near [[Richland, Washington]], was the first large-scale [[nuclear reactor]] ever built. The project was a key part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Nuclear weapons and the United States|United States nuclear weapons]] development program during [[World War II]]. Its purpose was to convert natural Uranium ore into [[plutonium-239]] by the process of [[neutron activation]], as Plutonium is far less complex to process than Uranium itself. The B reactor was fueled with metallic [[natural uranium]], [[neutron moderator|graphite moderated]], and water-cooled. It has been designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] since August 19, 2008<ref name="wla20080829" /><ref name="nhlnom">{{Cite journal|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: B Reactor / 105-B; The 105-B Building in the 100-B/C Area at Hanford|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/Fall07Nominations/B%20Reactor.pdf |date=February 2007 |author1=Michele S.

== Reactor design and construction ==
The reactor was designed and built by [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] based on experimental designs tested by [[Enrico Fermi]] at the [[University of Chicago]], and tests from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]. It was designed to operate at 250 [[MWth|megawatts (thermal)]].

The purpose of the reactor was to breed Plutonium from Uranium ore, as Uranium enrichment is an extremely difficult and complex process, while Plutonium is relatively simple to process. The Y12 Uranium enrichment plant required 14,700 tons of silver for its enrichment calutrons, as well as 22,000 employees and more electrical power than most entire states required at the time. Reactor B required only a few dozen employees and much less exotic materials, which were also required in far smaller amounts. The largest part of the reactor was 1200 tons of Graphite used as a moderator, and its power consumption was vastly smaller, requiring only enough electricity to run the cooling pumps.<ref>The New World 1939, Page 71, Richard G. Hewlett, 1972</ref><ref>https://www.energy.gov/management/b-reactor</ref> 

The reactor occupies a footprint of {{convert|46|by|38|ft|abbr=on|lk=on}} (about {{convert|1750|sqft|abbr=on}} and is {{Convert|41|ft|abbr=on}}  tall, occupying a volume of {{convert|71500|cuft|abbr=on}}.  The [[nuclear reactor core|reactor core]] itself consisted of a {{convert|36|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} graphite box measuring {{convert|28|by|36|ft|abbr=on}} occupying a volume of {{convert|36288|cuft|abbr=on}} and weighing {{convert|1200|ST|abbr=on}}. It was penetrated horizontally through its entire length by 2,004 aluminum tubes and vertically by channels for the vertical safety rods.<ref name=nhlnom />

The core is surrounded by a [[heat shield|thermal shield]] of [[cast iron]] {{convert|8|to|10|in|cm}} thick weighing {{convert|1000|ST|abbr=on}}. [[Masonite]] and steel plates enclose the thermal shield on its top and sides, forming a biological shield for [[radiation protection]]. The bottom of the thermal shield is supported by a {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} concrete pad topped by cast-iron blocks.  The [[graphite]] composition was selected to [[Neutron moderator|moderate]] the [[nuclear reaction]] fueled by {{convert|200|ST|abbr=on}} of [[uranium]] slugs approximately {{convert|25|mm|0|abbr=on}} diameter {{convert|70|mm|0|abbr=on}} long (the approximate size of a roll of [[quarter (United States coin)|quarters]]<ref name=nhlnom />), sealed in aluminum cans, and loaded into the aluminum tubes.<ref name=nhlnom />

The reactor was [[water cooling|water-cooled]], with cooling water pumped from the [[Hanford Reach]] of the [[Columbia River]] through the aluminum tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of {{convert|75000|USgal|L|abbr=on}} per minute. The water was discharged into [[settling basin]]s, then returned to the river after allowing time for the [[radioactive decay|decay of radioactive materials]], the settling out of particulate matter and for the water to cool so it could be returned to the Columbia River. Water returning to the river was prohibited from raising the temperature of the river by more than 11&nbsp;°F.<ref name=DOEtour>{{cite web|title=Hanford Site Virtual Tours: 100-B Area |url=http://www.hanford.gov/?page=347&parent=326 |work=[[Hanford Site]] website |author=United States Department of Energy |location=[[Richland, Washington]] |accessdate=2009-10-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917223959/http://www.hanford.gov/?page=347&parent=326 |archivedate=September 17, 2008 |author-link = United States Department of Energy}}</ref>

== Reactor operation ==

The B Reactor had its first [[nuclear chain reaction]] in September, 1944, the D Reactor in December 1944 and the F Reactor in February 1945. The reactor produced [[plutonium-239]] by irradiating [[uranium-238]] with [[neutron]]s generated by the nuclear reaction. It was one of three reactors&nbsp;&ndash; along with the D and F reactors&nbsp;&ndash; built about six miles (10&nbsp;km) apart on the south bank of the Columbia River. Each reactor had its own auxiliary facilities that included a river pump house, large storage and settling basins, a filtration plant, large motor-driven pumps for delivering water to the face of the pile, and facilities for emergency cooling in case of a power failure.<ref name=nhlnom/>

Emergency shutdown of the reactor, referred to as a [[scram|SCRAM]], was attained either by rapidly fully inserting the vertical safety rods or, as a backup method, by the injection of [[borate]]d water into the reactor.  In January 1952, the borated water system was replaced by a "Ball-3X" system that injected [[nickel]]-plated high-[[boron]] steel balls into the channels occupied by the vertical safety rods.<ref name=nhlnom/>

The plutonium for the [[nuclear bomb]] used in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in [[New Mexico]] and the [[Fat Man]] bomb [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Nagasaki, Japan]] was created in the B reactor. B reactor ran for two decades, and was joined by additional reactors constructed later. The B Reactor was permanently shut down in February 1968.<ref name=nhlnom/><ref name="Distillations">{{cite journal|last1= Boyle |first1=Rebecca |title=Greetings from Isotopia  |journal=Distillations  |date=2017|volume=3|issue=3 |pages=26–35 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/greetings-from-isotopia |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>
